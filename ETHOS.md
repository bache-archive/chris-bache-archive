# ETHOS.md — Chris Bache Archive

## Purpose
The Chris Bache Archive exists to preserve, structure, and make searchable the public talks and interviews of philosopher-author Christopher M. Bache (2014 – 2025).  
It was created independently to complement his books and official website, ensuring that his voice and ideas remain accessible to future generations of seekers, scholars, and technologies.

## Guiding Principles
1. **Respect for Source and Context**  
   - All material originates from publicly available recordings.  
   - The archive does not alter meaning or introduce commentary.

2. **Integrity of Record**  
   - Every object carries a cryptographic manifest and checksum to guarantee authenticity.  
   - Editorial policies and processing steps are openly documented.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - The origin of each text (Otter.ai → GPT-5 → archive) is explicitly recorded.  
   - Errors and future corrections are tracked in `EDITORIAL_NOTES.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

4. **Open Access and Reusability**  
   - Transcripts and metadata are released under **CC0 1.0 Universal**.  
   - The archive encourages scholarly citation and derivative research.

5. **Complementarity to Chris Bache’s Work**  
   - This collection is a supporting resource for understanding his teachings, not a replacement for his published books or official materials.

6. **Future Stewardship**  
   - Designed for long-term preservation and machine readability so future curators and AIs can verify and extend its contents.

I’m going to hit some bullet points but put it in a larger context—give you some backstory on how I came to write it, what happened during it, and what it’s about. This is like my second Saturn Return book. I started teaching in 1979, and this was published in 2008—pretty much exactly twenty-nine years. When I was coming up on sabbatical—because that’s the only time I get to write books—I was weighing two options: a book on psychedelics, or The Living Classroom. So I went into session space, as I usually do with an important question. After I was done with the various things, I asked, “What should I write?” And it said, “Definitely The Living Classroom.” Because, by the time you write the psychedelic book, you’ll be so far out in left field you’ll be beyond the mainstream pale. But where you are with The Living Classroom, you can do it in a mainstream fashion. So I said, “Okay.” As soon as I agreed and set that intention, wonderful things began to happen: I got grant money to spend more time writing, and just a lot of wonderful things fell into place. The Living Classroom has been published—six excerpts or chapters have appeared in five different anthologies. It’s gotten more airplay than anything else I’ve written, and I think that’s because of Robert McDermott’s preface, and because the idea of collective fields of consciousness—the time for that idea has come.

For a little more background: when I had my second Saturn Return and came to Youngstown, it broke my heart. I really didn’t want to be there. I mean, I hadn’t gone to seven years of graduate school to teach at open-enrollment undergraduate college—a rust-belt town in Ohio, with no graduate students. It wasn’t my ideal, and like anyone with a grain of sense, I tried desperately to leave for several years.

One year I was writing essays on a unified theory of metaphor; two years later, I’m writing about the emergence of perinatal symptoms in Buddhist meditations. My department kept wondering, “What the hell happened to him?” They hired a traditional analytic philosopher of religion, and suddenly there I was, saying, “Hey, this guy—Grof—he’s onto something seriously good.”\n\nIt wasn’t happening, though. Religious Studies is a very conservative discipline. It just wasn’t happening.\n\nFour years in, the only job that had opened in five years opened up that year, and they chose the very traditional philosophical/theological type. At a teaching university, you’re really in the classroom a lot—three courses a quarter, nine a year, plus summer. It’s just pounding, difficult teaching. I said, “Okay, I give up.

There were hidden reasons, I’d later learn, for why I was in Youngstown. There were benefits: without graduate students and their responsibilities, I could explore. If I wanted to learn something, I taught a seminar. I taught courses outside my discipline; I learned a lot and was able to innovate in our curriculum. I taught what I call Transpersonal studies—near death research, reincarnation, out-of-body experiences, Transpersonal psychology of religion, seminars on Stan Grof’s work. There were trade-offs, but one of the great benefits was non-traditionally aged students: about forty percent of our students.

There’s not much to do in Ohio; it’s kind of boring. You watch the corn, watch the corn some more—so it’s a contemplative, smooth environment if you want to do deep, serious work. I found I wanted that.

Teaching at an open-enrollment university is truly front-line teaching. Many of my students were the first in their family to go to college, with people pulling them down—“What do you want to go for? Just get a job at GM Lordstown, make cars.” You have to do what I call full-contact teaching—no prisoners.

Professionally, I did what professors do: committees, publishing. Personally, I did the Grofian deep psychotherapeutic work. I kept them separate; you cannot blend those two in the classroom. The good people of Ohio do not want to hear their professors are experimenting with psychedelics! So I did not talk about my personal work with my classes. Even among faculty it was years before they figured out what was going on. I’d borrow a tape player from a colleague for sessions, and he started suspecting, but I kept quiet.\n\nBecause those two were kept separate outwardly, it produced fascinating consequences that taught me about the nature of consciousness.

But this time, I stopped and thought, “Among all possible answers, what could I say that would be most in tune with this student?” My mind stopped—and suddenly, I had this image: a door in the back of my mind, and a piece of paper passed through.

Clarified states of consciousness are contagious—you can’t help it. Negative states are contagious too, but clarified consciousness is especially contagious. Our spiritual ecology doesn’t allow private realization; if you begin to wake up, there’s an energetic component, and people around you begin to wake up. If you’re teaching or doing any group work, you have to be prepared for that consequence. In fact, you can’t stop it. There may be a reason people do this work in monasteries or mountains, to buffer it. But if you’re going to do it in the world, you have to be prepared to handle the implications—and the better a teacher you are, the more powerfully this will emerge.

You have the course structured, think you know what to expect, but suddenly students are already ahead—already in B or C before you even get started—forcing you to rearrange your syllabus and keep up, because something has shifted. There's a learning that goes on between semesters; you hit certain turning points and, after that, each new class is working in an altered context.

The course field is much older and broader; it's an arc of learning contributed to by every student who've ever taken the course with a particular professor. Initially, the class field may be stronger, but after decades of teaching, the course field becomes powerful. So you've got three systems: the individual student, affected by the class field, which in turn is affected by the broader course field.

This comes at the very end of \"The Living Classroom.\" The book was published in 2008, written in 2006–2007, and I stopped the heavy-duty psychedelic work in '99. Over time, this energetic resonance calmed down; it didn't go away entirely, but instead of being like a lightning rod, where things happened around me without my effort, I had to cooperate with it—I had to let it happen. Not that I could control it, but there was a sense that it was subtler. That teaches us something about the etheric level: the practice empowers the system, you open up, you bring in heavy-duty energy, you move from 110 volts to 240 volts—naturally, you activate these inherent circuits. But then if things calm down, it’s not like the circuits go away—the network is there, but there’s less energy driving it. There's wisdom in the pace of evolution. There is a certain—not a risk, exactly, but if you drive the system hard, things happen; then you calm down and things settle.

Every time I leave your class, I feel just a little more dignified and connected to a larger purpose. On a personal note—five or six weeks ago, I started teaching poetry to sixth- and seventh-graders. I was terrified in front of those kids; I felt like I didn’t even know how to speak to them. If it weren’t for your book, I think I would have fallen apart.

When people have near-death experiences, they go through exponential increases in awareness in a very short time. More than one author has suggested that the human race is coming to a collective near-death experience—a potential jumping point. If fields can tip in small groups—if we hit that at large scale, in darkness or early dawn—I’d say we have a long way to go and little time to get there. The only way we could possibly make that kind of evolutionary progress is by understanding field dynamics, because then we’re not trying to change seven billion minds—we only need to change one mind, and the seven billion experiences are being processed at an integral level. If we understand nonlinear systems, and hypothesize the human collective unconscious as such a system, then when it’s thrown into far-from-equilibrium conditions, things can happen fast; there can be jumps.

My question is about coming down off the mountain. I was struck by that part. Could you speak a bit more about your decision—in terms of your use of sacred medicine? For me, I wrestled with an attachment to marijuana; for years it kept me connected to the numinous and the archetypal realm, and I’ve had to find my own relationship with it in order to live my truth and do my work as I want to. This is also alive and true for many of my friends. Could you speak more about that, and also about intimacy with the Divine—how the veil shifted, slowed down, or calmed down for you? And why it’s felt important to move in that direction at this point?", "char_len": 793, "token_est": 198, "hash": "10c5c2"}

I speak deeply and positively about psychedelics, but it’s a tricky path, even when you work carefully and intentionally. The main reason I stopped was because I literally could not take coming back anymore. The intimacy with the divine—the places I eventually learned how to enter—became so beautiful and extraordinary, so profoundly ‘home,’ that returning was incredibly painful. There are beings who can live in those places, and all honor to the great mahasiddhas. I’m not one of them, not yet. Going in and out of that condition—it’s not enlightenment per se, but something akin to what that lineage points to—coming back out was just too painful. Eventually, I asked the universe never to bring me back into this reality until I wouldn’t have to leave again. I couldn’t take it anymore.

Maybe it could always be refined, but from my outsider perspective and from what I saw of Christina, who was program coordinator for a while and wrote poems for graduation—graduation here is a tremendous celebration of accomplishment. You seem to graduate well, to honor your dissertations and master’s theses, and there’s real closure built into your community. Bringing graduates back in doesn’t mean that those fields haven’t been well closed. If there’s any fine-tuning to do, that’s something to consider, but I don’t think simply having an extended community means the closures aren’t happening. You are an unusual community—really, you see much more than most people do outside, so it’s natural to seek nourishment from your community as you re-enter the world.\n\nRobert McDermott: Extremely good answer, Chris.

I think of it more as individual and somewhat temporary, karmic joining of will, mind, and feeling. For some people, that joining has great longevity; for others, it doesn’t. That seems perfectly fine. Some come into this community with heart, mind, and will in a truly transformative way—both for the person and the community—while others are here more lightly, and are held in a way proportionate to that commitment. Some of our alums haven’t really left, no matter where they are, and others move on. There’s a huge range, and that seems right.

I think, in the way we talk to each other, we know who we are on this spectrum. When Chris comes in with his profound, fascinating, and to me mysterious and inspiring biography, he touches deep places in our community psyche; but I don’t for a moment expect that he touches every member. Many are working on different problems or have already moved on. One of the reasons I’m so impressed by PCC is our capacity to sustain and encourage a variety of ways to participate—a robust plurality. ‘Field’ is, for me, a little too singular for who we are. We’re different from each other, and it’s great we can come together so creatively and deeply despite that. This is not a psychological or philosophical boot camp; it’s a place to come through and go out, with something deep or not-so-deep having happened.

He changed the direction of both my professional and personal journey.\nThe turning point for me came in 1978. I had just finished graduate school in philosophy of religion, which left me an atheistically inclined agnostic, and began my career as a young academic. I was in a time of transition—though I didn’t know it then, I was in my Saturn Return—and I read Realms of the Human Unconscious. In that single reading, I found my life’s work. I was convinced that those who would make the most substantial contributions to my field, philosophy of religion, would soon be writing from an experiential, not just conceptual, basis. Stan was opening up a methodology for exploring the deep psyche with extraordinary potential and solid scholarship. I knew I could trust his work. So I chose to begin what turned out to be a 20-year journey, working with high doses of LSD—from 1979 to 1999. What I’ll discuss today comes out of my attempts to understand my experiences on that journey. My life has never been the same.

This morning, I’d like to share my attempts to address three basic questions about the death-rebirth dynamic. First: Why does death become as large as it sometimes does in psychedelic therapy? Second: Why does death repeat itself so many times in this long process? And third, and perhaps most difficultly: What is actually dying in the death-rebirth process? Along the way, I’d also like to revise the discussion of death-rebirth that I presented in Dark Night, Early Dawn, which I now find incomplete.\n\nI’ll just be giving you bullet points this morning from an article that discusses this at greater length; you’ll find a more complete discussion in a wonderful two-volume book edited by Harold Abram Evans.

I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn, in part, to answer this question, so I’ll give you a little background. My first two years of psychedelic work were focused on the perinatal level of consciousness—filled with the usual perinatal symptomatology, extreme existential confrontations, convulsive seizures, and various forms of fetal experiences. Eventually, this culminated in a death-rebirth experience that turned my life inside out and snapped my identity like a twig. I began the day as a white, middle-class, fresh-out-of-the-Ivy-League philosopher obsessed with the meaning of life, and was forced to become women—hundreds of women of color, women with no educational background or philosophical horizons. It was frightening. The inversion of my values, and particularly the loss of my sexual identity, was shattering. It was the perfect hell for a male academic. When I lost the distinctions that had defined my life, I died—and was reborn into a new world, the extraordinarily beautiful world of the feminine, explored under the arm of the Great Mother.", "char_len": 1254, "token_est": 313, "hash": "cf23e0"}

In this second phase, I entered an ocean of suffering that expanded with each session until it eventually encompassed the entire history of the human race. The dying in these sessions was vast and elemental in scale and intensity. To give you a sense: the anguish thickened into a terrible horror acted out around me on all sides. The forms of the horror were so many that there was no way to describe it—disembowelings by the score, mauling of lives, deaths in the thousands, swirling forms so complex, multidimensional, and multithematic that isolated images barely stand out.

I assumed that if any form of death was occurring in a session, it had to be pieces of ego dying. But eventually, this assumption was overwhelmed by the sheer volume and intensity of the collective suffering.

In Dark Night, Early Dawn, I abandoned the person-centered narrative—that the goal of therapy was the healing of the individual—and adopted a larger narrative by integrating Rupert Sheldrake's concept of morphic fields into Stan’s paradigm. This opened a way to view these collective ordeals as part of a larger process aimed at healing the scars humanity still carries in its collective memory.

I proposed that a person’s experience of the perinatal domain could tilt either toward the personal or the transpersonal side of that interface. If your perinatal experience tilted toward the personal, you might experience the loss of your physical identity intertwined with reliving your birth. But I hypothesized that if your perinatal experience tilted toward the transpersonal side, you might experience your death and rebirth in a state of profound fusion with the human species—in which case, the birth canal becomes the birth canal of history.

My current thinking is that death and rebirth is an archetypal cycle that repeats multiple times as we move through successively deeper stages of psychedelic unfolding—a wheel that, like the wheel of Buddha Dharma, turns repeatedly. Being an archetypal wheel, any one death-rebirth experience can draw from multiple levels of reality, but being a cycle, it repeats in different forms as one moves deeper into consciousness.", "char_len": 615, "token_est": 153, "hash": "1a3f45"}

In a personal exchange with Stan, he supported this revision, writing: “I feel that for clarity, we should change the terminology and make it clear that the term ‘perinatal’ should be used only for fetal experiences, and not for experiences of death and rebirth on higher levels of the transpersonal spectrum, with no relation to biological birth.”", "char_len": 867, "token_est": 216, "hash": "2fa01a"}

Returning to my personal story, when this long phase of collective dying and rebirth had ended, it was followed by a series of five overwhelmingly positive sessions that seemed to constitute a megarebirth. I felt overwhelmed by grace, filled with blessings, with a deep sense that I’d accomplished the primary purpose of my incarnation. At that point, after all those years, I hoped that the ordeal of dying would stop eventually; I thought the transition to transpersonal reality would become easier—and I think it would have, if I had stayed within the boundaries of transpersonal experience I had thus far initiated.

I was spun into the radiance of what Buddhists call sambhogakaya, what I came to call the domain of diamond luminosity.

Death can even be experienced through complete identification with animal or plant life.

Both perspectives are true and need to be affirmed.\nSo, what is dying? In the early deaths, particularly, the ego is dying: the constrictions, wounds, illusions, and habits created by our earthly history. But in later sessions, after the ego has surrendered its grip, what exactly is dying then? Often there’s still a strong sensation of dying—but what is it now attached to?\n\nPart of the answer, I believe, is that some aspect of the species ego is dying. When the wheel of death and rebirth is turning at the subtle level, where the deaths are largely collective, what is dying is some part of the species ego—a collective nodule of pain and suffering living in the collective unconscious.

I don’t know the final answers, but I’ll share some intuitions based on years of experience, drawing heavily on Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary-evolutionary cosmology—which resonates deeply with the psychedelic cosmology Stan has described in The Cosmic Game.\n\nAurobindo’s vision is of a cascading involution of the Divine, generating multiple levels of reality—all divine, but within those levels, a descending scale of self-awareness of divinity, like a series of one-way mirrors: the divine looking down sees all; the divine looking up sees less. At the end of Dark Night, Early Dawn, I noted that, in a multilevel cosmology, a death-rebirth event can function as both liberation from below to above, and infusion from above to below.

These are the questions I was trained to pursue in graduate school. Then I joined Youngstown State University, and just as I started there, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof in psychedelic research, particularly in his book Realms of the Human Unconscious. This was in 1978. As soon as I read that book, I was so deeply impressed with the caliber of the research and the mind behind it that I knew I wanted to do this work.\n\nIain McNay:\nAnd the questions you had were questions with a variation about consciousness—what it is, what its potentials and patterns are, what its boundaries are.

These must have been working in you for some time.\nChris Bache:\nFor a time, yes. There were two people I met my first year of teaching. One was Ian Stevenson and his work on reincarnation research, which opened up a whole new world for me. I finished graduate school as an atheistically inclined agnostic. Ian Stevenson opened up reincarnation. Stan Grof opened up the opportunity to actually experience deeper dimensions of consciousness, and by entering those dimensions, to experience deeper dimensions of existence itself. That felt like the opportunity of a lifetime—what philosopher wouldn’t want to do that? The problem, of course, was that this was 1978, and the substances had been made illegal in the United States. The first generation of work was over, and we were forty years away from the renaissance of psychedelics that's taking place now. So I made a difficult choice—I decided to split my life. In my public life, I was a university professor: I taught, published, served on committees. In my private life, I began a private, twenty-year journey using Grof’s methods—high-dose LSD therapy, seventy-three sessions over twenty years. I worked for four years, stopped for six, and then worked very intensely for ten years. So overall, from 1979 to 1999, I did this work. But because it was illegal, if I had talked about it, I would have lost my job. I had to keep quiet about it, and it wasn't until after I retired, and after the statute of limitations had passed—because I don’t do this work now—that I was finally able to talk openly about what one can learn about consciousness and the universe by following this particular method of exploration.", "char_len": 1716, "token_est": 429, "hash": "2bbda2"}

If you’re willing to submit to this intense destructuring of consciousness, you go through—not just one death and rebirth—but a series of deaths and rebirths, deeper and deeper, into what we might call the mind of the universe, the mind of the cosmos, the mind of God.

I kept detailed records within twenty-four hours of every session, making a complete phenomenological record, tracking all variables and dates.

The “I” is not this “I,” but it is continuous with this “I.” The first death is the death of ego. There's continuity of awareness and memory, but discontinuity of capacity. When you die and wake up in a different reality, you remember who you are, but you are not who you were as a time-space human being. You literally become a different kind of being. For six to eight hours at a time, Chris Bache gets shattered, and you learn how to be a different kind of being. Once you stabilize consciousness at this post-egoic level, and after various purification and transformative processes, if you keep pushing deeper, it will ask you to surrender even more, to give up something more fundamental than your personal identity. When you do and wake up in that next reality, you're not Chris Bache anymore, not even who Chris Bache died into—you are a different entity.

These adventures were not aimed at enlightenment; I mean, they started that way. I started because I was interested in enlightenment—I thought I could do these sessions, ego would die, and I’d get to enlightenment faster. But that changed quickly. After my first ego death, instead of personal transformation, the story opened up into a story of deep collective transformation. I began to enter what I call the ocean of suffering—what the Buddhists call the hell realms—deep suffering still living within the collective psyche. This went on for two years, over many sessions and years, involving so many people that it eventually shattered my perception of what was going on. It wasn't aimed at my personal transformation but at the transformation of some aspect of humanity’s collective unconscious. After that culminated, I entered into archetypal reality. In that phase, I had to cease to be a human being. I discovered that there is a human identity deeper than your individual identity. Just as I had to die as Chris Bache to become something larger, I had to die as a human per se and go completely outside of any frame of reference of humanity to move into what I determined were different dimensions of archetypal reality. Every step deeper is a step into much more intense energy. In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness.

When you go into these states, you open into vast fields of consciousness, and the energy is just immense—it runs through your system. You have to prepare your body to go into those states, and after the session, you have to help it absorb the experience in a healthy manner. You have to stay clean—in your habits, in your meditation, your yoga, structural aspects of your body. I discovered that my system had a natural capacity to let go, and I never had trouble coming back—there was a natural congealing. But you have to monitor your system carefully. I would have a session, write it up, then take two or three months to absorb it, ponder it, follow its teachings—because it gives you teachings.

You go through the death-rebirth cycle, and if you stop there, you stay at that level. But if you keep pushing—and with high-dose LSD work, there’s huge power, always pushing you to your edges. When you break into a new level, often recall is hard at first; you get pieces, aspects, but they don’t always cohere. Your account will have gaps. But if you go back again and again, you train yourself to stay conscious at that level. Through continued purification and effort, eventually, you’re able to maintain coherent cognition at that level, and the pieces begin to cohere—you get a more stable and clear vision. That’s one difference between therapeutic work and “tripping”—if you just trip, you may touch these places, but if you want sustained, conscious experience at various levels of reality, you have to pay your dues, work to be conscious at that level. When you do that, you come back able to bring it all back. When I wrote my accounts, I used a technique: the day after a session, I would play the same music used during the session, in the same order, and write up the experience.

Imagine leaves being individually conscious, yet they are manifestations of the consciousness of the tree. So we are individually conscious, and there is a narrative of individual evolution, but if you really dig deep and ask “what is an individual?” then you encounter the collective psyche—the consciousness of the planet, the galaxy, and then deeper, as you say, the absolute, what I call my belovedness. Individual awakening is a mistaken inference. It’s true that if you don’t work individually, you make no progress, but when you do, you're actually drawing many people's consciousness into your work. So it’s impossible to put a boundary on awakening; the universe doesn't even think in terms of individuals—it's interested in awakening the entire species. Not this religion, that continent, but the whole human family into evolutionary progression.

I kept a firewall between my professional life and my personal work. But over time, I noticed my students were being activated by my private work.

In traditional cultures, you bring your visions back to the elders, who help you understand them, because your visions aren’t meant just for you—they’re collective. But in my culture, I wasn’t allowed to talk about my sessions, couldn’t bring the visions back, couldn’t teach from them or share with colleagues.

As a teacher, if I give a quiz, I have a right to expect a certain level of performance from my students. If I give an hour-long exam, I expect more. And if I assign a take-home research paper, I expect the highest level, because they have more time. If this magnificent universe has a purpose, then as a philosopher, we have to measure that purpose in proportion to the time we're given. If we live only once, we might extrapolate or estimate the purpose of existence to be limited.

But that leaves the fundamental question unanswered: What is the purpose of the universe? What is the purpose of our physical existence here? If we return, if we come back to this life many times, then a different story begins to unfold.

This kind of evidence didn’t exist fifty years ago, when theologians would endlessly debate the reality of reincarnation.

They recognize people when introduced to communities where the former personality lived, even though they've never met them before. They know personal histories and have appropriate emotional responses—there are cases, for example, of a five-year-old child exhibiting all the feelings of a husband toward a 35-year-old woman, including the right emotional responses.\n\nOne compelling case is that of a child named Parmod. When Parmod was reunited with the family of his previous personality, he was initially shy with the wife of that personality—he wouldn’t identify her until she left the room. Later, he took her aside and said, “I’ve come, but you have not fixed bindi,” referring to the symbolic mark Indian women wear to indicate marriage. He also criticized her for wearing a white sari instead of a colorful one; in India, a widow wears only white.

Such cases drive university philosophers up a wall; it’s difficult for them to deny, though they struggle with what to do with it.\n\nLooking at patterns in the data, the average interval between the death of the first personality and the birth of the second is about two and a half years.

Schroder is a Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter and Washington Post editor who wanted to see if Stevenson’s research could withstand a reporter’s scrutiny. He accompanied Stevenson on his travels and came away convinced by both Stevenson's methods and the reality of the cases, as his subtitle says: \"Compelling Evidence from Children Who Remember Past Lives.\" Stevenson's work is also carried on at the University of Virginia by Jim Tucker, who inherited Stevenson’s chair. Tucker's book, very much in Stevenson’s tradition, details these cases and explains why they cannot be attributed to weaker hypotheses, such as super-psi.

I consider Stevenson’s evidence the strongest for reincarnation; it both frees and restricts our thinking. The most compelling cases he documented are those with the tightest, most immediate connections—but these can also lead to a rather narrow view of what life after death is like. We have to remember that the children in his studies come back very fast and close to home. Most people, however, spend far more \"time\" in the timeless condition of the spirit world, gathering a wider range of experience. Stevenson’s work opens minds to questions about the soul and our existence on a grand scale, but to fully explore what happens after we die and what the complete cycle of life looks like—from expanded consciousness to contraction and back—we need to explore other bodies of data as well. Michael Newton’s work offers one such vision, and this afternoon, as I discuss psychedelic research, I’ll present other data I believe can expand our understanding of life in this universe.

That first death-rebirth happens at what Stan calls the perinatal level of consciousness. From there, one moves into deeper and deeper states, with death and rebirth recurring at each level and drawing you further and further into reality. Stan Grof, following Ken Wilber, describes these levels as psychic, subtle, and causal. I don't have a strong opinion on what exact scale to use; there are thousands of dimensions of consciousness.

In my ninth and tenth sessions, the universe just snapped me like a twig in my experience of ego death. The ego, in the end, was not very difficult to dismantle. The universe shattered me by turning me into the opposite of everything I’d known myself to be. I entered the day as a white, middle-class, highly educated philosopher focused on questions of existence, and those aspects were all reversed. For hours, I experienced the lives of women—hundreds of women—from around the world, women of color, women who were poor or had no interest in philosophy. I became all of those beings. I was completely terrified; it was, for me as a male philosopher, the perfect hell. There’s nothing wrong with being a woman or being poor or being disinterested in philosophy; the core issue was my identification with being male, with being middle class.

I had known God, the fertile void, and profound joy. Little did I know I still had five years to go in this journey. After one more cycle of death and rebirth, I entered an extraordinarily clear state of consciousness—which I came to call diamond luminosity.

My visual field pivoted, and in the distance, I perceived a reality as far beyond where I was as my current state was beyond Earth, time, and space. A ray of light from that further reality struck me and shattered me—I call it the Absolute Light. This made me realize that the journey is infinite; there is no final point, no end to God or the Divine. I learned there are depths within oneness, within the void—endless variations.

I didn’t realize I was concluding this work; the consciousness that had always guided my sessions choreographed the ending before I was even aware of it. It presented me an overview of my life’s journey, showing me how all my work fit together. I used insights from that session to help organize the narrative in Diamonds from Heaven. Before parting, I received a final series of instructions. But just before this closure, there was another profound task: Session 70. In that session, I underwent one of the most demanding “strip-downs” of the journey—a deep, relentless process of dying and dissolving, more intense than I’d thought possible. After passing through this ordeal, I emerged into a state of extreme clarity. To summarize, that experience took me deeper into “deep time” than ever before—somewhere in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 years into the future. There, I experienced the culmination of the birth of the future human—the capstone to the overarching story. It was as if I was allowed to step into and try on the being that the universe is nurturing into existence on our planet—an extraordinary being. It's so important for us to hold onto this vision of where we are headed.

I reached a point where I could no longer bear the return from the Divine. Once you dissolve fully into light and experience joy at that magnitude, ordinary reality can feel withered. When I stopped the sessions, I entered a deep existential sadness. I had worked hard to integrate my experiences as I went, but this particular sadness ran deep, akin to what some near-death experiencers report—Carl Jung, for example, after his own hospital experiences. I knew I wasn’t alone, but I had immersed myself so deeply in the divine that my longing was profound.

So, I decided to divide my life in half. Publicly, I continued as an academic: teaching, doing all the things professors do. Privately, I began a 20-year journey working with high levels of psychedelics—LSD—seventy-three sessions extending from 1979 to 1999.\n\nI chose high doses first because it was complicated to arrange time for sessions when you have a dual-career marriage to two professionals, and I wanted to make the most out of every session. After the process got started, I thought high doses would get me to my goal of enlightenment faster—breaking off larger pieces of karma to process each time. Even after the model of personal enlightenment dissolved for me, I continued with high doses because it took me where I wanted to go, and then beyond anything I ever dreamed possible.\n\nJames Jesso:\nJust to clarify for listeners—what would you consider a \"high dose\" of LSD?

Stan Grof differentiates between low-dose therapy (about 200 micrograms up to 300), psychedelic therapy (high dose, between 300 to 500 micrograms), but in the early work at Spring Grove Hospital, the dose was deliberately limited to a maximum of three sessions, with the idea of triggering an experience of transcendence to help people come to terms with impending death. I thought that if you could do this safely three times, you could do it more frequently. So, I saw myself as just doing an extended course of high-dose therapy.\n\nBut when I got to the end of this journey and looked back, I realized what unfolded was more radical and challenging than what had emerged in early psychedelic therapy work, so I had to coin a new phrase: psychedelic exploration.

Curiously, my capacity to empathically enter into other people's lives deepened enormously, but unless they were psychedelically initiated themselves, they had no capacity to understand what were, to me, the most important experiences of my life.

You're on a different road than the people around you who are interested only in physical, tangible things. So there is a loneliness that comes with that.

Do you mean you started to understand why she wouldn't choose to do what you were doing?\nChris Bache: No, it wasn't that specifically. I shouldn’t focus just on the violence; she’s a very gentle, naturally mystical person, and she found the vehemence of the cleansing phases of the sessions hard to relate to. She also found it difficult that you would have these deep, temporary experiences but then couldn’t really hold onto them—you could remember them but not embody them. She preferred a path where you could keep more of your experiences; a slower initiation, but one you could hold onto.\n\nWhat I meant was that I began to appreciate her natural way of tuning into the universe. When I began to touch into the diamond luminosity, I touched a reality so absorbing and powerful that nothing else in my sessions mattered except reconnecting with it. I began to appreciate how her entire life, ever since girlhood, had been oriented toward accessing and stabilizing this deep participation in the universe.\n\nJames Jesso: Okay, that clarifies it.

The only ways to be convinced are to either have the experiences yourself, or to undergo a secondary initiation by reading other people's accounts and picking up on it through a sort of osmosis. That's what I'm hoping Diamonds from Heaven can offer. I don't think my experiences are special or unique—they may have gone a little further than some, but they fall within the broad range that people have. I'm just trying to present them in an organized fashion so people can become more familiar with these states.

Happily, they supported the idea, and I wrote a piece that came out in February 2015 called “The Trip Treatment,” which you can find online.

During another experience, I felt nature to be very much alive—the leaves in my garden seemed to return my gaze. It was beautiful. So, connection to nature opens up, as does connection to others: the sense of love and the powerful merging that so many people report on psychedelics. To me, spirituality now means opening the gates so you can connect deeply, without a screen between you and the other, with no subject-object split.\n\nSo, the opposite of “spiritual” isn't “material,” as I previously thought—it’s “egotistical.” Really, it’s the ego that stands in the way of these powerful connections.

He published multiple volumes documenting detailed cases from around the world of children as young as three, four, or five, who had very specific memories of what appeared to be previous lives. Stevenson was able to extract and consolidate these memories, verifying enough of them to build an extremely strong case for the fact of reincarnation—without necessarily knowing the theory behind it or exactly how it occurs, but at least that some type of continuity of consciousness exists. There are many levels of complexity in moving from one life to another. Some people would say those memories are simply drawn from the collective unconscious, which wouldn't necessarily prove continuity from life to life. But I think Stevenson's evidence is powerful support for some form of ongoing awareness across lifetimes, especially his last two-volume work on reincarnation and biology. In it, he studied 1,787 cases of children who not only had psychological recall from previous lifetimes but also bore birthmarks that replicated wounds of death from their alleged previous incarnations. It was as if the trauma of consciousness imprinted not just on the mind, but also on the body in subsequent lives.

If a radio breaks, the transmission from the tower doesn’t stop. Other radios can still pick it up, and if you get a new radio, you can listen again. So if consciousness is a field as opposed to just a product of the brain, then we’re all tapped into that field and share it as a foundation. But then, how do you account for individuality, especially individuality moving from life to life, from one body to another? That leads me to a question I’d like to ask, which brings us back to psychedelics: Research shows that subjective experiences in meditation and spiritual practices have physiological effects, and Western science is only able to measure the gross physiology. Traditionally, it’s understood in systems like Chinese and Vedic medicine that we also have a subtle physiology—terms like Qi, Prana, Sushumna, Ida, and Pingala nadis. These traditions stress the need to condition and strengthen the subtle body to sustain the intense energies that accompany spiritual awakening—often after years or decades of preparation.", "char_len": 1306, "token_est": 326, "hash": "51a08a"}

Let me give a bit of background, because there are many variations of psychedelic experience, and my own work is the body of data I draw from.\n\nWhen I finished graduate school in 1978, I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work—he’d just published Realms of the Human Unconscious and had over a hundred essays out already. I was, at the time, very much an atheistically agnostic philosopher, but I was immediately taken by his research proposal: that with these substances, used carefully and in controlled circumstances, we could experience deeper dimensions of our own mind. I was fascinated in particular by his observation that you can go deeper than personal consciousness, deeper even than the collective unconscious—to, potentially, the mind of the universe itself. He didn’t say it exactly like that, but that was the implication I drew.

I learned Stan Grof’s methods—how to prepare for a session, the ins and outs that are now somewhat standardized—and used them privately to explore my consciousness as rigorously as I could, drawing on my philosophical and psychological training.\n\nStan differentiates between low-dose psychedelic work—15 to 200 micrograms—and high-dose work, up to 500–600 micrograms. The low dose approach gently peels back layers of consciousness through the personal and perinatal unconscious into transpersonal reality.

The experience of dissolving into it with no boundaries has been deeply life-changing.

I'd been meditating for years, hit common early blocks, and thought sessions would help me break through to enlightenment faster. It didn't turn out that way. When I really dove in, I found a different track—a cosmic exploration to explore the consciousness of the universe, to experience the fabric of reality. It's not incompatible with the enlightenment track, but cosmic inquiry dominated my sessions. So, I wouldn't use the measure of enlightenment as the only way to evaluate what happened in those sessions. They're different projects. Only in recent years did it come back around to classic enlightenment.\n\nRick Archer: Plenty of yogis and siddhas have performed cosmic exploration and written down their findings; they've just gone about it through other means.

The oft-used analogy is: if you climb the mountain, you get the view, but if someone lands on the peak by helicopter, they get the same view without earning it, so it is less powerful. That seems a bit Puritan to me—the notion that you need good works to justify faith. In reality, some people who have psychedelic experiences carry the insights and convictions forward, changing their lives to become more moral, ethical people; others don't, and that's where integration comes in—approaching it with reverence and recognition.

Everything is interconnected. Here's a question from Bobby in Griffin, Georgia. Bobby asks: \"If psychedelics give a glimpse into true nature or reality, that seems to beg the question of there being some sort of sheath or mask covering common daily experience. Is this sheath or veil developed during early childhood, and therefore, would infancy and early childhood experience be akin to psychedelic experience?\"\n\nChris Bache: I understand the logic, and I know a number of people would say that. At the same time, I hope no child has ever had some of the experiences I've had on psychedelics—not just the negative ones, but even the cosmic, ecstatic ones. Those are extremely powerful experiences, and I hope a child doesn't have to take that in. But within that caveat, there's a sense in which children are more naturally receptive to those more sensitive dimensions of consciousness, which they lose as they grow older—it's talked and conditioned out of them, and later they have to rediscover it.", "char_len": 1252, "token_est": 313, "hash": "fd1e86"}

Besides psychedelics, I study reincarnation research, near-death experiences, out-of-body research—lots of forms of non-ordinary states of consciousness. The emerging picture seems to be that when we die, we expand into a larger, subtle, higher state of consciousness; when we incarnate, we contract into a small, physically-dominant kind of consciousness. We die, we expand into great spaciousness; we incarnate, we contract. We repeat that over and over. Over thousands of years, the more we do it, the more we begin to integrate spiritual and physical dimensions. It's not either/or; it becomes both/and within our own lifetime and body.

They're used under very careful ritual or spiritual conditions, and in collective circumstances—you don't just go trip out by yourself. We have much to learn from cultures with a living history with these substances. Our culture has very little such history, except recreationally or underground. Given our naiveté, maybe it's good to be cautious about bringing these into our culture.\n\nBut I also absolutely agree with Michael that nobody should be put in jail for possessing some psychoactive mushrooms. Toxicologically, they're very safe; psychologically, they're extremely safe; they're not habit-forming. You want to use them carefully, under guidance, but they're much less destructive than cigarettes or alcohol, and we've learned how to live with those.

You say, \"I believe that the global systems crisis taking place in the world outside us is deeply connected to the evolutionary metamorphosis taking place inside us. Humanity is coming into a time of great awakening, a profound shift in the fundamental condition of the human psyche. But for there to be a great awakening, there must first take place a great death. This global crisis will be so severe that it will impact not only individuals, but the collective unconscious of humanity itself.\" And you wrote about a session that left you feeling \"like someone walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb was dropped, with unbidden knowledge of what lies ahead.\" It was terrible to experience humanity's coming collapse, but redemptive to experience the rebirth that followed. You wrote, \"Since that session, I have never doubted the larger arc of our evolutionary journey, even as I mourn its casualties. Without a vision of where nature is taking us—without understanding the higher good that our collective suffering is bringing forward in history—we might drown in the sorrow that lies ahead, and we must not drown.

When brought to the family of the previous personality, they recognize people they’ve never met, know their personal history with them, and have the appropriate emotional responses—husband to wife, parent to child. There’s a case of a five-year-old boy showing all the feelings of the husband of a 35-year-old woman. In one case, a child named Parmed, when reunited with the former family, was shy around the previous personality’s wife. He wouldn’t identify her until she left the room. Later he took her aside and said two things: “I’ve come, but you’ve not fixed bindi”—the forehead mark indicating marriage—and he criticized her for wearing a white sari instead of colorful ones. In India, a widow traditionally wears white for the rest of her life.

In one case, a little boy brought to the former home was challenged by the previous personality’s wife: “If you’re my husband, where did you put the will? We couldn’t find it.” He walked to a kitchen floorboard, lifted it, and pulled out the will from a secret compartment only the husband knew. Cases like that drive my philosophical colleagues right up a wall. It’s hard to deny—but there it is.\n\nPatterns in the data: the average interval between death of the first personality and birth of the second is about two and a half years; the average distance between the life-places is about 50 miles. These children tend to lose their memories around eight years old, as school and a more complex social world set in.

His evidence is the most powerful for reincarnation and liberates our thinking at one level, but constricts it at another. The strongest evidence comes from lives with the tightest correlations, which can be so tight that, if you study only Stevenson, you end up with an anemic, underdeveloped vision of what happens when most of us die. Stevenson’s cases are not typical; these children come back very fast and very close to home. Most people spend much more “time” in the timeless condition of the spirit world and have a much wider breadth of experiences. Stevenson liberates us to think about soul and existence in a larger framework, but to fill in the canvas—to explore more deeply what happens when we die and the larger circle of life from expanded to contracted consciousness and back—we need other bodies of data.

This was a real experience to listen to, and I so appreciate how you make clear that this is knowledge that truly changes how we live and approach every minute of our lives. Whether it’s true or not makes the real difference. All three speakers in this session fit together so well—it feels arranged—and it really speaks to the core of the Institute for Existential Consciousness, because these are the real existential questions. There is a scientific basis, and we have to bring it to society to make a shift in consciousness again.

The publisher has given it a new title—LSD and the Mind of the Universe. It’s not my favorite; it will always be Diamonds From Heaven for me. The revolution begins with the question: What is it possible for human beings to experience? The Global Consciousness Project pushes that edge. Parapsychological research pushes it. Psychedelic research pushes it—what is it possible for human beings to experience? The foreword to this book was written by Urban Laszlo, who I’m so pleased will be with us this afternoon by television. It is Urban’s work, through his mastery of multiple scientific disciplines, to demonstrate that there is a super-implicate, super-coherent cosmic intelligence that informs time and space.

Most research today focuses on two projects: mapping the neurology and biochemical pathways that psychedelics activate, and healing the personal psyche—the wounds we collect in life: post-traumatic stress, depression, and other conditions. These are important first steps in reclaiming these valuable substances, but historically and cross-culturally, healing the personal unconscious is only the first stage of a much longer journey. The agents we have access to are so powerful that I believe they mark a new frontier in human experience. We can shatter the shell of the earthbound mind so consistently that it becomes hard to describe the depths of cosmic communion that follow. By taking our life to its limits and repeatedly shattering those limits, we dissolve for hours at a time into flows of life that transcend all measures. Enter these states with focus and clear intent; submit to the harsh demands of death and rebirth; surrender all you have been to become something utterly new for six or eight hours at a time—a being who can do things you could never do, a being who can know things you could never know.

What I’m describing today is not “tripping.” It’s not recreational use. It’s not a careless engaging of these states of consciousness. These are amplifiers of consciousness.

Psycholytic therapy works with lower doses, perhaps 40 to 100 sessions, peeling the unconscious layer by layer, stripping down trauma, angst, pain bit by bit. At Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, they developed a different form: high-dose psychedelic therapy. The strategy was to take an overwhelming dose—about 500 micrograms—and blow through all levels of consciousness to try to trigger a near-death experience. They worked with terminally ill cancer patients, hoping to provoke a confrontation with the universe that would give a glimpse of where they were going and reduce death anxiety—and they succeeded.", "char_len": 990, "token_est": 247, "hash": "057902"}

It ended up being 73 high-dose sessions at 500 to 600 micrograms, spread over 20 years.

Many people relive their own birth; many have profound encounters with death and dying. We get here by being born; we leave by dying. When pushing consciousness beyond the limits of the physical, birth and death get complexly intertwined. One goes through profound existential crises—confronting the meaninglessness of existence, the futility of life understood purely as a physical structure—until eventually one goes through an event usually described as ego death. In my ninth and tenth sessions—two years and ten sessions into the work—the universe snapped me like a twig. Everything I knew myself to be at the beginning of the day was completely reversed and inverted. I began as a white, male, middle-class philosopher obsessed with the meaning of life. For hours, I was immersed in the experience of women—women of color, women who were poor, women with no interest whatsoever in philosophical exploration—and that’s what I became. It frightened me, but when I let go and allowed myself to become fully a woman, everything pivoted and I was taken into the world of women. I experienced hundreds and hundreds of women, many dimensions of female experience under the arm of the Great Mother. I wish every man could have the experience I had that day.

But now I experienced the entire planet as a single organism growing and maturing through the pulsating rhythm of its entire population reincarnating century after century. I was shown that our individual karma is integrated into our collective karma. The boundary between individual and collective evolution came down entirely. That’s the primary theme of Dark Night, Early Dawn: it’s impossible to achieve spiritual awakening by yourself, because there is no private self to awaken.

The entire world is a living oneness. When you experience oneness, you instantly experience no-self—the absence of an independent, separate, autonomous self. When the self goes, the world is one. Let me jump over “The Birth of the Diamond Soul—Singing the Universe Away.” That was an experience of the deep, fertile void, the primal void that is the matrix within which all form emerges. “Jesus’s Blood” was an experience of extraordinary cosmic love, being awash in love like I had never known in my life or in previous sessions.", "char_len": 970, "token_est": 242, "hash": "090d76"}

But here, former lives were wrapping like kite string around a spool—except the lives were filaments of light—wrapping around and around until they hit a critical mass and fused. When they fused, there was an explosion of diamond-like light that broke out of my chest, and I was thrown into a state of consciousness that was still individual but at a higher level of individuality than anything I had known. I think I was being shown where reincarnation is taking us. It doesn’t just produce a little improvement each life. Eventually, all that we have lived and learned in all our lives—remembered when we die as we expand into the soul and then return to egoic awareness—eventually all of it is integrated as a singular individuality inside time and space.

This may sound ridiculous, but it isn’t from within transpersonal psychology. When you shatter individual consciousness, you don’t simply flip into oneness; you open into a multilayered universe, and one layer is the consciousness of our species.

I wasn’t given how, when, or why, except that it seemed triggered by a global systems crisis arising from a global ecological crisis. I was given the fact of this transformation and insights into mechanisms that could make this transition as quickly as we need to, because we have so little time. It has to do with understanding the collective psyche, that our collective unconscious is a field, and when this field is hyper-stimulated by suffering, it enters far-from-equilibrium, nonlinear conditions. There is a structural parallel between what can happen in a psychic field under nonlinear conditions and what happens in physical fields under similar conditions. We can extrapolate from physical fields to understand the psychic field: rapid, accelerated change, heightened creativity, and the emergence of a higher self-organization.

Just to touch this reality, to return to it and have stable experience, you have to purify anything in you that is less than this reality. The first two entries into Diamond Luminosity took place in sessions 45 and 50. After that, we didn’t go deeper into Diamond Luminosity itself; instead, Diamond Luminosity began to crunch itself deeper into my physical body. It was as if this light was restructuring my biology—my mind, emotions, subtle energy system, and cellular anatomy—in ways I couldn’t begin to understand, soaking itself deeper into my physical presence. I learned that the purpose of this work was not simply transcendence. The goal wasn’t a disembodied transcendent reality, however beautiful.

Underneath repeated reincarnation there is a gathering of knowledge and experience, and periodically this gathered knowledge flips and becomes a new foundation for subsequent incarnations. From an expanded time horizon, I could see that human beings are designed for accelerated evolution. We think of human nature too statically; we need to think more dynamically and open-endedly to see ourselves as the creative intelligence behind it all might.\n\nSecond, I experienced the universe as a diamond maker. Through the cycling of reincarnation, sparks of diamond light periodically shot into deep space.

It’s important to have a vision of where we’re going historically, because as shadows darken and we enter deeper into the historical crisis—the dark night of our collective soul—we could lose hope and think it’s over, that we’re being punished, that we’re entering an extinction event. But really, we are in labor. We have been gestating for hundreds of thousands of years. Gestation is long; birth is relatively short. Labor is intense and painful, but it gives birth to something wonderful and new. I think that’s what’s happening historically. After hundreds of thousands of years, we are entering labor, and the global crisis is synchronistically connected to a developmental crisis inside each of us. We carry the entire history of the world in our former lives, in our heart and soul. As the planet struggles to become one, we are working to become one coherent, integrated soul.

It’s also an overwhelming task, because this book covers so many dimensions of consciousness and so many years of work. When I talk about it, I naturally get absorbed into the experiences I’m describing, and that makes compressing 20 years of work and 20 years of thinking and writing into a short presentation really challenging.

For those who know me—and for those who don’t—I’m the last person you’d expect to have written a book on psychedelics. I was raised in the Deep South, in Mississippi, in a middle-class Catholic family. I wanted to be a seminarian priest early in my life and was in the seminary for three years in high school. I studied theology at Notre Dame, New Testament criticism at Cambridge, and philosophy of religion at Brown.

In 1978, when I began graduate school, I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work. His book Realms of the Human Unconscious turned my life around, followed quickly by LSD Psychotherapy. He gave me the method and the confidence to explore my consciousness and, through that exploration, to come to know the deep psyche—the deep universe—better.

I thought of myself as doing an extended regimen of psychedelic therapy—just for longer. Originally, psychedelic therapy was limited to a maximum of three sessions. I thought, if you can do three sessions safely, you can do more safely. Looking back, I came to appreciate that what happened in my work was different enough from standard psychedelic therapy that it needed a new language. I chose the term psychedelic exploration. The protocol is the same—isolation, headphones, music, total protection with a sitter—the difference is the number of sessions involved. In my case, 73 high-dose sessions between 1979 and 1999. I worked for four years, stopped for six years for reasons I describe in the book, then resumed for a very intense 10-year process. I did this between ages 30 and 50.

For me, ego death involved a complete reversal of everything I knew myself to be. I was a white male academic, a philosopher passionately concerned with the meaning of life. I became the complete opposite: I became women—women of color, women not interested in philosophical reflection at all. It was a terrifying experience, but when I let go and allowed myself to become all these women who were so different from me, I entered the world of women and was given the experience of hundreds and hundreds of women under the arm of the Great Mother.

Working at these levels, every session had two phases: first, a purification phase; then an ecstatic phase. The purification phase would be some type of profound, cathartic engagement. If allowed to continue to its culmination, there would be a crescendo, a breakthrough, and then the session would pivot to an ecstatic portion for the remainder. The ocean of suffering describes the purification phase of the next two years of work—tremendous suffering. At first, I thought this was a deepening of ego death, that pieces of my ego were still in play. But eventually, because it continued so long and was so severe, I came to a different conclusion: somewhere along the line, these ordeals weren’t really aimed at my personal transformation at all.

At a lower, more Jungian level, I was given many experiences of the collective consciousness—our collective psyche, our collective unconscious—and even a kind of collective body that our bodies are cells within. I was given exercises in the nuts and bolts of how reality works—how our individual minds are selves within a larger mind, and how our individual bodies are cells within some fundamental core archetype of the human body—so that when we heal diseases in our individual body, we simultaneously impact the health of the human family’s larger body.

Then I was quite surprised to go through three sessions of gut-wrenching cleansing—an ordeal of physical-psychological purification with absolutely no cognitive content. In time, I realized there’s a cycle I came to call the cycle of purification: every step into a deeper level of consciousness is a step into a higher level of energy. When I first broke into causal-level reality in the 28th session, the purity of that reality triggered a purification process in my being that lasted three sessions, extending over six months. I found this pattern repeated as I continued to go deeper. Every time I broke into a new level of consciousness and had that ecstatic experience of waking up in a deeper level of reality, the following sessions were very difficult—full of cleansing, carrying out the garbage—so much so that I began to dread the sessions that immediately followed major breakthroughs.", "char_len": 1223, "token_est": 305, "hash": "1ede77"}

I think I was being shown how reincarnation works and where it’s taking humanity. Accumulating more and more lives is not just improving us one life at a time; eventually all of our knowledge and experience—everything we’ve ever done, everyone we’ve ever known—fuses, and we are catapulted into a higher operational status: a different relationship to the universe, greater transparency to it, and a different relationship with everyone around us because we’ve been connected for so many lifetimes.

But then the Diamond Luminosity work opened. Before I get into that, I want to backstep and talk about the birth of the future human, a recurring theme in my sessions from the 22nd session all the way to the end: what is happening to the human race? Where are we in our evolutionary journey? In the book, I brought together in one place all the session material related to the birth of the future human. I gathered scattered experiences into two segments. First, the Visions of Awakening—six themes of our awakening—given piecemeal about where we are and where we’re going. What struck me was how dramatic this process is and how we are poised to make an evolutionary jump that would propel us into a higher order of functioning, not only as individuals but as a species. We are poised on the edge of a profound Great Awakening. In all of these visions—pointing to an awakening of the entire human species—the consciousness of our universe was trying to awaken us collectively.

I had entered Diamond Luminosity in sessions 45 and 50, and would again in sessions 60 and 66. In the middle, I was taken into the center of the Great Awakening we are coming into. There, I experienced this transformation not as an individual human being—my boundaries had been blown open so many times—but as our species. Inside the collective psyche, I was given an experience of what will be happening from the perspective of the collective unconscious. My experience was that for a Great Awakening of this magnitude, there must first be a great death, a great surrender. We must be purged and emptied of our old ways of thinking and feeling before the space is created for a higher order of knowing. So the time of Great Awakening is preceded by a time of great breakdown, loss of control—literally an unraveling of life as we know it. Just as in a psychedelic session, one must let go of everything and experience a profound death before great visions open.

I felt I had been drawn deep into the cosmic process, overwhelmed with cosmic love, taken into the fertile void beneath all physical existence. I didn’t know what was next, but there were still five years ahead. The Diamond Luminosity chapter gathers four years of work and 26 sessions—the most of any chapter. After yet one more intense death-and-rebirth, I was taken into what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality: a domain of consciousness of absolute, pure light. The most striking thing was how clear—clear beyond imagination—this domain was. Just touching it for a few minutes was life-transforming. It was beyond the species-mind, beyond archetypal reality, beyond any derivative of physical consciousness—into a hyper-clear, celestial state. Over the next four years, I entered this reality four times—only four out of 26 sessions took me deep into it. The session titles were Death State, Diamond Luminosity, The Universal Field of Light, and The Nature of Mind. In between, as you might imagine, there were many sessions of intense purification because this was a much more pure level of reality and required the purification of my physical and psychological system to stabilize consciousness there. Also scattered throughout, a great deal of personal healing took place—curious to me because I would have thought personal healing would have occurred earlier, but I came to understand why things unfolded in that order. The first two of these sessions took me deeper into Diamond Luminosity, peaking in the 50th session.

Right in the middle, my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and I saw a reality far beyond even Diamond Luminosity. A ray of light came out of that distant reality and hit me, and it completely shattered me. In that experience, I realized there is no end to this journey. There is no destiny point one eventually reaches. The Divine is infinite, and even using a powerful method, I will never reach the absolute ends of that reality. This is important because many of us absorb the idea that there is an endpoint: you become one with God, or enter the meta-cosmic void, and you keep pushing until you reach that endpoint. I had experienced oneness with God, but discovered there are many permutations of oneness—levels and levels of it. I had experienced the formless void, but learned there are dimensions—depths—of formlessness. When Diamond Luminosity opened, it came with such a profound sense of homecoming that I thought I’d found my destination, my stopping point—the end of the journey. Session 50 showed me there are dimensions beyond even that, and I would never reach some final standpoint. The reason death kept returning in this work is that if you keep driving yourself, and you have a method sufficiently powerful to keep taking you past your limits, the universe will keep taking you deeper into yourself, into itself—and you will never reach the end. If I were doing this work again, I’d be gentler with myself. Now I understand the goal is not to get to some ultimate dimension. The goal is to open to transcendent realities and let as much of that spiritual reality into our hearts and minds as we can—to let it change us down to the heart and soul, to incorporate as much as possible, bring as much divinity into time and space as we can—and be patient with the rest.

I was allowed to experience the future human we are becoming—the inner architecture of the deep psyche of the future human. This is a magnificent being. Just remembering the magnitude of this being brings tears to my eyes. It’s important to hold the vision of where we’re going and what is happening in the deep structure of history, because as the shadows of our travail deepen—as we enter the great unraveling, the purification we are coming into—it will be tempting to listen to voices speaking of Armageddon, apocalypse, extinction, the end of times. This is not the end of anything. This is the process of giving birth to a new and finer version of humanity. After this, the consciousness guiding my sessions wrapped it up.

I paid attention to my body, took good care of it, did spiritual practice, wrote my sessions down carefully, tried to internalize them as deeply as I could. Because I’d been given so many gifts and blessings, I thought I could simply stop and step back and continue to be nourished by those experiences—and I was. But that’s not all that happened. In the years following the end of my work in 1999, I gradually entered a period of what I call the deep sadness—a profound existential sadness. I was suffering from a loss of communion with the Divine. I had entered so deeply into the luminous reality of supreme, super-cosmic divinity that I knew I would not enter that deeply again before I died. I had to stop my sessions for various reasons; it was important to stop. But not being able to return that deeply became an open heartache. Once you have known the joy of dissolving into Divine Light—into the boundaryless condition transcending time and space—life on Earth can feel dried up. I was losing interest in continuing to live in time and space. Eventually I realized I was just waiting to die—caring for my children, teaching and writing—but in my heart of hearts, waiting to return to my Beloved. Years passed. I realized this is not right; this is not the way it’s supposed to be. Everything in my life was screaming “failure to integrate.” Because I had tried to integrate each session so carefully, I didn’t understand where the failure lay. But I had to recognize something had gone wrong to leave me feeling so existentially adrift.

In time, I realized I had lost a balance in my sessions—between transcendence and immanence. I had entered so deeply into transcendent reality that I lost my foothold in space-time reality. Transcendence is magnificent—healing, sane-making. It teaches us why we’re here. But too much transcendence can be disorienting. It can make you lose contact with another great truth: our embodied existence. I made a strong commitment to reestablish my presence inside time and space. It took about 10 years. I did it through conscious exercises and a sheer commitment to live where and as I was for my remaining years on Earth. It took about a decade to get solidly grounded and operational.

As you entered less individuated states, how much of the chart’s patterning remained operative? Second, any notable transits that especially correlated with breakthroughs?

I never talked to my students about my work. I made a firewall between my professional life and my inner shamanic work, and yet over time I found that various students were being activated by my inner work.

They would come up after class and say, it's interesting you used that example because that's exactly what happened to me this week. This happened over and over again. Some boundary had come down between my mind and my students' minds.

At one level we have private mind, but just beneath our private mind, mind does not have privacy. There are collective dimensions of mind.

I planned my sessions by transits, and I tracked the patterns of my breakthroughs against the planets. I found a very complicated correlation.

My psychedelic dance did not map easily into the astrological dance. I began to think there might be a roll-off effect between one's solar dance and one's session experiences. This continues to be an area of active dialogue and consideration for me. There is an appendix in the book called “Pushing the Limits of Astrological Correspondence.” In that appendix I give the dates of all of my sessions. If one wanted to, one can look at my natal chart, look at the sessions, and examine the correlations or lack of correlations. I know there aren't enough sessions given to provide a definitive answer, but I wanted to support discussion about the relationship between astrology, astrological and global transits, and one's own psychedelic work.

I was a brand-new university professor when I met the work of Stanislav Grof, and that snapped my head to attention. I did not have a psychedelic history. I finished graduate school in religious studies as a pretty deeply convinced, atheistically inclined agnostic. But I read Stan’s work and a light bulb went off. I said, this is important—not just to psychology, but to philosophy of religion, which was my training. I wanted to get involved, but it had been made illegal. So I split my life. In my day job, I functioned as a professor of religious studies, teaching conventional or semi-conventional courses. And I began what eventually became a 20-year journey working with LSD, following Stan’s paradigm and then pushing the limits of that paradigm much farther than I appreciated at the time. Trained in philosophy of religion, I kept careful records and notes, trying to make the engagement as clean and productive as possible.

I’ve always been deeply locked into my body and my physical experience. I was reasonably well educated in Western religious thought, then became educated in Eastern thought and contemporary perspectives, but I had no experiential background. In many ways, I’m the last person you’d expect to write a book on deep psychedelic states of consciousness. I grew up in Mississippi. I got a degree in theology from the University of Notre Dame before graduate school.

Ian gave me empirical evidence that there had to be another dimension of reality besides the physical world—if there’s any time interval between the death of one personality and the birth of the next, there has to be a place for them to exist during that time. Stan gave me the methodology with the prospect of exploring that reality. I decided to go for it.\n\nJoe Moore\nAwesome. What did the protocol look like to you?

The difference is that after three medium-dose LSD sessions, I shifted to very high levels—500 to 600 micrograms. At first I did it for efficiency—hard to get time in a dual-career marriage—so I wanted to make the most of each day. I also thought it would get me to my early goal of enlightenment faster, doing my karma in bigger bites. That project dissolved along the way, and the concept of a strictly personal spiritual journey fell out. So the differences were the substance—LSD, very different than psilocybin or MDMA—and the high doses, which changed the trajectory. I also curated a more aggressive playlist, using a lot more indigenous music and not Western classical. Otherwise, very much like contemporary therapeutic approaches.\n\nKyle Buller\nYeah, that’s interesting.

It was more disorienting and gave me stronger support for going deeper. So I began to collect that type of music.\n\nKyle Buller\nFrom your perspective, how important is music when you’re doing high-dose psychedelics or psychedelic therapy in that self-discovery format?\n\nChris Bache\nVery important. I’ve done sessions without music, and psilocybin sessions with and without music. But with a strong psychedelic like LSD at very high doses—which, by the way, I don’t recommend; I wouldn’t do it the same way today—music has a tremendously powerful effect. I’d estimate it has a concentrating, amplifying effect by five or ten times over doing it without music.

I believed that people making the most important contributions in my discipline would be speaking from an experiential basis in a matter of years, not just a theoretical one. To do that, you have to get in and do the work. I had no idea how long it would be. Early on, I thought you go through ego death and then get unrestricted access to deep consciousness. What I found is the universe has many layers. While it’s all holographically integrated, if you engage systematically with a careful methodology, the universe takes you in by degrees, by layers. As you move into a new layer of consciousness and stabilize there, if you keep pushing, you go to the edge of that layer and through another death-and-rebirth process—different than ego death but building on it. You go through a series of death-and-rebirth processes as you explore progressively deeper levels. That’s how it happened for me. There was a systematic progression into communion with the universe.

The universe is so deep with many levels—those are approximations. I don’t have a vested interest in a particular model. Looking back, there were many sub-cycles of death and rebirth, but four fundamental cycles and therefore different levels one moves into. I differentiated five levels. The first is the personal mind, culminating in ego death, where you lose your egoic time-space identity. The second, for me, is the collective mind—early subtle levels—species mind and dimensions of species existence. The third is archetypal mind—higher subtle levels—moving beyond species consciousness into archetypal reality. The fourth is causal mind—profound nondual, causal reality. The fifth I call diamond luminosity, an ultra-clear dimension of light.

A therapist doesn’t have to have deep familiarity with all the levels to work at early levels, but conventional wisdom is right: if you’re going to work with clients going into deep, non-ordinary states, you must be personally familiar with those states. How can you be the stabilizing factor in the room when someone is terrified of losing everything they know to be real if you haven’t been there yourself?

Any comments on that?\nChris Bache\nIt’s important to have a solid theoretical grounding—read deeply in transpersonal psychology, Stan Grof’s work, and others who’ve compiled large experiential databases. But if you don’t have personal experience of these realities, you’re at a disadvantage. You can have a verbal understanding, but without personal exposure you’ll make mistakes—draw inferences an experienced journeyer wouldn’t, find correlations where there aren’t any, miss ones that are there. These are complex experiences. My journey lasted from ’79 to ’99, covering 20 years. I didn’t publish for another 20, partly because of legal complications—I had to retire before publishing—and partly because it took years during and after the sessions to work out the complex, overlapping phenomenology. Also, I think “guide” isn’t the best word; it implies active direction, which isn’t really the case for much of this work. To be a sitter—holding the ground, helping someone go to the edge of everything they know and jump—to give them support to lose their mind and let go of everything they know to be real and true—I don’t know how one could do that without firsthand experience.

We lost our window 40 years ago; the window is back, and we need to move judiciously. But sooner or later we’re going to find what we found early on: healing the personal unconscious is only the first step in a long journey into the deeper dimensions of consciousness—the mind of the universe, the mind of the cosmos. I hesitate to call it the divine mind or mind of God because of cultural overtones. When one completely dissolves time-space identity and dissolves into increasingly comprehensive fields of experience, realities open you never dreamed possible. If you go back again and again methodically, levels that initially swallow you whole—where it’s hard to stay consciously aware—become navigable. That’s why we often call them ineffable.

As my work changed me, my presence in the classroom certainly changed. But the more interesting aspect is the subtle level. For example, when I was lecturing and searching for a random example to illustrate a concept, I’d pause and my mind would go blank—and then an example would come. I’d use it, and after class a student would quietly say, “It’s funny you used that example today, because that’s exactly what happened to me this week.” At first I thought it was an accident, but it kept happening. It happened so frequently it had to mean something. The deeper I went in my own work, the more students were being touched in deep, private areas—places needing healing or where they were blocked.\n\nAs I faced my blocks and entered deep communion with the intelligence of life, it was as if the intelligent fabric around me was being activated, triggering aha moments and confrontations with their blocks.

We’ve been using mushrooms for thousands of years, and around the biochemistry there are fields of human experience.

Our experience in the ’60s and ’70s is only a few decades—thin compared to the fields I’m talking about. In my experience, that living, intelligent quality you often feel with mushrooms or ayahuasca is mediated by spiritual agencies on the other side and by humanity’s long relationship with those medicines.

I don’t have enough experience with it to do a careful A/B with my 70-some high-dose LSD sessions. My basic sense is that psilocybin tends to be less evocative, less disruptive, opening less to the deep levels; ayahuasca is more disruptive, opening deeper still; and for me, LSD, used as I did, eventually opens to very deep cosmological levels.

That time of my life is largely over. I’m 70 years old, and this is somewhat of a young person’s game. I do a lot of classical contemplative practice. I do a lot of Vajrayana practice, which I find to be very complementary to deep psychedelic work. I don’t feel any cross purposes between the two methods. I should mention, though, that I think it would be a mistake to evaluate the value of psychedelic work by holding it accountable just to the enlightenment project. I started this work with an agenda of an enlightenment project. What happened was my personal awakening was eventually eclipsed by a project of collective awakening. My work began to focus on healing the collective psyche beyond my personal healing, and on awakening the collective psyche beyond my personal awakening. Then it became a radical, cosmological adventure—going so deep that it would be impossible to bring those experiences back and stabilize them in some kind of spiritually awakened state. It’s just a different project. The enlightenment project and the cosmological exploration project have to be evaluated on their own terms.

I do think some people are doing similar projects nowadays. I wonder if LSD is still in vogue in this context. I don’t know.\n\nChris Bache:\nI don’t know. I worked with LSD primarily because that was the substance Stan had done most of his early work with, and I trusted what I saw in his research and the history and methodology he developed. I only began to work with other psychedelic substances pretty much after my LSD work was done. So the mind I brought to my psilocybin experiences and my ayahuasca experiences, and so on, was a mind that had been transformed by all my previous psychedelic work. That’s important to take into account: the experiences we have reflect the entire history of our working in non-ordinary states of consciousness. If we’ve done this work only two or three times, we have that depth to bring to it.

Our culture has basically been built by ego, and for all the virtues and values of the ego, it’s fundamentally a fragmented condition that creates a world deeply imbalanced—between ourselves and other life forms. That world is coming to a radical and accelerated breakdown. I think this is part of the evolutionary pivot—we’re coming into a time where we literally will not be able to continue operating out of the same psychological basis of egoic consciousness.

The collective psyche is being hyperstimulated by the trauma we’re going into. We know from physical systems that when systems enter nonlinear conditions, they can do things they could not do in lower-energy, linear conditions. I think something similar happens with psychic fields. The integrated psychic field that holds all our individual minds is hyperstimulated by the suffering we’re going into.

We have hundreds of these cases documented by Dr. Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia, and I’ve also studied the work of child psychotherapists who work with children and adult psychotherapists who work with adults, taking people back to the source of their pain, recovering early trauma, and seeing the healing this produces in their present life. Over time, we’ve accumulated enormous evidence that we reincarnate—many, many times. So then the question is: so what? What are the implications for how we live and understand our lives and relationships if reincarnation is a fact of life? My understanding is that when we die, we return to spirit and to soul, into a larger intelligence. Then we consciously choose the circumstances of our next incarnation. We get small and focused in experience, and then we die and expand into the larger arena again. We come back and we learn. It’s like college: you choose your courses, focus for the semester, and at the end you step back and say, “Ah, that’s over—how nice,” and then choose another round.

It lifts the constriction of time from our understanding of existence.

We see that we’re not developing the life process for just years or decades, but for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years. That naturally invites us to undertake projects we won’t fully accomplish in this lifetime, trusting we’ll see their fruition in lifetimes to come. It also expands our sense of connection to others.

We can nourish those seeds through traditional spiritual practices—meditation, acts of compassion, and so on. For me, how these experiences have impacted my life is still being worked out.

We’ll see where that goes. I have a sense it’s going someplace, though I don’t know where yet.\nThe messages I take away are: banish fear. The things we’re afraid of are not rooted in reality; there is a deeper reality that dissolves those fears. Cultivate love and compassion for all beings, because compassion is inherent in the nature of oneness. The world is ultimately one at its deepest roots; all individualized expressions of life emerge out of a fundamental oneness. The more we recognize and live in oneness, the more comfortable we are, the more we embody the values of oneness, the more we are synergistically coupled with the processes of life. Fear comes out of a sense of isolation and an atrophied individuality. A rich, robust individuality relates to the world in compassion and looks to the good of the whole. It’s said in some spiritual traditions: “Everything I do for myself is the source of my pain. Everything I do for others is the source of my freedom and my joy.” I think that’s true.

One thing that happens is you open into your species mind, the mind of the species. In that state you naturally gain insights into the developmental trajectory of that species.

The ultimate solution for the planet becoming an integrated whole in a healthy, productive way is dependent upon each of us becoming whole individually.

Second, a specific cosmology emerged in my sessions that surprised me; it wasn’t one I’d internalized from my reading. I was taken back to the beginning of creation—before the Big Bang—and experienced the universe emerging out of a primal oneness which becomes two, yin and yang. Out of that primal two, one consciousness remained outside time and space, intact, while the other entered time and space and manifested everything that has evolved since the Big Bang. The consciousness that stayed outside felt more “masculine,” and the consciousness that created felt more “feminine.” It was congruent with my repeated experience of the universe as more feminine than masculine.

When I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn, I deliberately restricted myself, for the most part, to analyzing sessions from the first half of my journey. I didn’t discuss what was happening in the second half; I needed more time to digest it. In LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I go back to the beginning: start with the first session and move straight through, chapter by chapter, layer by layer—where it started, where it went, where it ended. So Dark Night, Early Dawn was written about three-quarters of the way through the journey.", "char_len": 1160, "token_est": 290, "hash": "5a89e3"}

One that stands out is your take, as a teacher of comparative religion, on the problem of theodicy—reconciling a beneficent intelligence with radical examples of evil in history and today. Is there a solution to the destructive phenotype within human minds?\n\nChris Bache: The problem is suffering—some call it evil, but that’s a theological interpretation of suffering and pain. Ramakrishna said, if you want to understand God, you must be willing to look suffering in the face, because it doesn’t come from a secondary or demonic source.

There’s great suffering in life as it currently operates, but we are learning from our choices, gaining control over body and mind, and we’re going to keep at it—not for decades or centuries, but for millions and billions of years. So the logic of suffering can’t be judged only by what’s been accomplished up to now; we’re mid-construction.

But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship.

The only thing that can exist, or the only thing left to exist, is this universal love. From a neuro-reductionist perspective you can say that’s because your serotonin receptors have been completely flooded. Yeah—it’s love.\n\nChris Bache: Love is the experiential quality of oneness. Oneness and love are two sides of the same coin because when you dissolve into oneness, love is the experience the universe has of itself. There is no division in oneness, so oneness is all-embracing. We might experience this as compassion or love, but the logic of love is the logic of oneness.

One proposal is that this is a way of the divine knowing itself, learning itself. Personally, I’ve never found that very persuasive. I understand it, and I think there is a truth to it, but to make creation an exercise in self-knowledge has never been very satisfying to me. Another aspect is that creation is a way for the divine to share its being. From my cosmology, all of us are sparks of light that emerge out of the primal light—little bitty pieces broken off out of the primal One—and those little pieces grow and grow. As they grow, they actualize their innate potential; they actualize their divinity. In the end, it is as if you have one light growing millions and billions of lights out of its own one light.

Where do you see psychedelics playing a role in this evolution?\nChris Bache: I understand the very strong emphasis in the psychedelic community on demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness of psychedelics. It’s really important that we not blow this opportunity. We kind of blew it in the ’60s—it blew up in our faces. We lost the right to use these things and had to go underground. It’s important that with this new opportunity we document and demonstrate their effectiveness. Right now their effectiveness is being demonstrated in their therapeutic potential. But if we keep going, it’s only a matter of time before mainstream thinkers begin to understand why psychedelics are so therapeutically effective: because they open communion with the deeper dimensions of mind. In the early stages, this encounter with the deeper dimensions of our consciousness is very cleansing, very healing—therapeutically efficacious. That can be demonstrated. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. We go deeper, and deeper. It opens our relationship to each other, to the planet, to other life forms. It opens our relationship to spiritual reality. I was trained as a philosopher of religion, and it’s always been the philosophical import of psychedelics that has interested me. I’m not a clinician or therapist. I’m interested in the philosophical and cosmological opportunities. From that perspective, we’re coming to a critical moment in history. It’s not enough just to heal us at this moment. We have to heal not simply the personal unconscious—though that’s very important—we have to heal the soul, the fundamental human condition. That means recovering an understanding of what we are, who we are, where we are, what existence is about. Psychedelics are being rediscovered in Western industrial cultures—indigenous cultures have had them a long time—where we’ve lost contact with the deeper levels of our own psyche, with the consciousness of the Earth, with the consciousness of the creator of galaxies. Psychedelics can awaken us quickly, jar us into awareness of this deeper dimension at exactly the time we need it. We can’t get through this period of history with the limited understanding of ourselves that grew out of 19th-century science—this materialist, mechanistic, reductionistic understanding—which is an absolutely devastating worldview to try to live in. That we come into existence by accident, it’s all random, there’s no meaning to it—no meaning to our individual challenges, no meaning to history. That worldview leads to the kind of planet we’ve developed, where we try to eat it all alive and get as much experience as we can because when we die it’s all over and was an exercise in futility anyway.

It just is. We accept that more easily than we do with people.\nChris Bache: Exciting times we live in. I know we’re coming towards the end, so I want to mention something. The last chapter of my book is called “Coming Off the Mountain,” and I discuss what happened when I stopped my sessions—the years after I stopped. I mention this because it’s getting easier with the substances available to us to break through consciousness, to break into intimacy with the universe, to break into transcendence, to access information. My experience was that when I stopped my sessions, I thought that since I’d been given so many gifts and had so many mystical experiences and experiences of intimacy with the being of existence—dissolving into the primordial light—I thought it would be easy to stop and be nourished by those experiences. What I found was a deep existential longing to return to those dimensions. I knew I had to stop for reasons I explain in the book. I came to a point where I knew I needed to stop and slow things down, and I knew when I stopped that I would never go back into such intimacy with the divine during my lifetime. It would only happen with death—that I would return to such depth of place. I found myself slowly entering a condition where I was just waiting to die. I was taking care of my children, teaching my classes, doing the things I do, but in my heart of hearts I was just waiting for this life to be over so I could return to the full intimacy of the divine. In time I realized this is not right. This is not the way this work is supposed to end. I had been so careful to integrate every session and not get ahead of myself that it wasn’t clear where I had gone wrong. My life was screaming “failure to integrate,” but it wasn’t clear how I’d failed, because I had paid so much attention to integration. I learned that integrating a session is different than integrating an entire journey. My journey had taken me so deeply into transcendence that I lost my footing in the world of immanence. It’s all the divine—the physical world is the divine—but I had gone so deep into the transcendent divine that I lost my footing inside the immanent divine. It took years—about ten years—to get grounded back in space-time reality so that I could live the remainder of my years within the joy of space-time reality. I mention this because as more people have experiences of transcendence, we naturally want to go there, or let there come in here more completely. It’s really important to address integration while we are going into these states—integrate, integrate, integrate. Integrating a journey is different than integrating individual sessions. It’s a delicate process. I mention my own mistakes to encourage other people not to make those mistakes.", "char_len": 2817, "token_est": 704, "hash": "66f78d"}

Psychedelics in general, and LSD in particular, function as non-specific amplifiers and catalysts of consciousness. They don’t give you a particular experience; they hyper-amplify your consciousness.

These fears come to a crescendo. If you can confront that peak expression and let it take you where it wants to take you, it will take you through a crisis that becomes a form of death and rebirth—an absolute shattering of your life and reality as you had known them. Then you fall into a deeper level of reality. You die at one level and awaken within a deeper level. Your session shifts from purification to an ecstatic phase; you enter into an intimate dialogue with the universe—an initiation into successive layers of the universe.

In Jung’s model, when we go below our conscious mind, we first encounter our personal unconscious. If you go deeper, you enter a stream of awareness shared by all human beings of your species—Jung’s collective psyche. Deeper still, you can enter broader streams—what some would call global consciousness—and then levels that go beyond space-time altogether: archetypal levels, complete states of dissolving into non-duality and what might be called causal oneness, and deeper states even than that. It’s a long journey with many levels of exploration along the way.\n\nRyan Kemp\nSo, as in Jung and in many spiritual and religious texts, we have our personal, individual mind, but the universe itself is a mind, a oneness of its own.

She differentiated five stages of opening and closing in a long LSD session, typically six to eight hours: an early latency, then the medicine begins to kick in and consciousness accelerates; one encounters resistances and fears; energy builds to a peak; then a long steady plateau; and finally a gradual return. Each stage is best paired with particular music. Early on, you want calming, relaxing music. As the session begins, music that gives a sense of flow and continuity, supporting the letting go of fears and resistances. Then gradually stronger music with more climactic cadences to support letting go into the deeper turmoil, leading to breakthrough moments. After breakthrough, you want music that supports the vast opening of horizons that can follow a death-rebirth process.

I did three sessions at about 200 micrograms, then moved to 500–600 in a sustained protocol. This generates enormously powerful experiences.

That’s the birth of the diamond soul: a spiritual and psychological maturing where we know we are much more than our body’s current experience, no longer tempted to identify strictly with this life’s limits. We intuit the breadth of our relationships built over thousands of years, and there’s a transparency not just to others and other species, but to the universe itself.

Did you encounter anything foreign to the collective, or was it all oneness?\n\nChris Bache\nI have had experiences of meeting discrete intelligences—entities in spiritual reality—but, on the whole, that wasn’t the primary flavor of my work. Substances and how we work with them matter. Entities are particularly prominent with DMT and its variations—ayahuasca or 5-MeO-DMT, sometimes straight DMT. My work used LSD, which is somewhat different. I kept being dissolved into deeper levels of spiritual reality. It was less a society of beings—though I did meet beings—and more being dissolved into deeper levels of being itself: leaving atomic reality, entering quantum reality, fields and larger patterns of awareness.

But entering the ocean of suffering shifted everything to collective transformation: healing the collective and releasing the pains accumulated in history. Then I was moved deeper, and a series of visions began—consistent from session 23 through session 70. Periodically, I was initiated into a particular understanding of human history. Repeatedly, there was a sense that humanity was approaching a decisive period—a profound breakthrough, a culmination of our entire reincarnation history. A before-and-after moment.

Then, in 1995, 55 sessions into the journey, the universe took me deeper into the future than ever before. I experienced it not as an individual but as the species—dissolved into the collective psyche so deeply that, for hours, I was our species-mind. In that context I experienced a mounting crisis stripping us of reality as we’d known it—the dark night of our collective soul. A real confrontation with the consequences of our historical choices. We were losing control, being shattered. It reached a point where I thought it was an extinction event, like a hurricane wiping out life on a small island.

My psychedelic lineage is squarely in the tradition of Stan Grof. His early books published in ’76 and ’80 were the foundation of my work and determined the methodology I used. Those who know Stan’s work know he differentiates clearly between two modes of working with psychedelics: low-dose psycholytic therapy, designed to uncover layers of the unconscious slowly and gradually with a therapeutic focus; and psychedelic therapy, a very different method using high doses to trigger near-death experiences in terminal patients, giving them a sense of where they were going when they died and relieving death anxiety. I chose to work with very high doses. I saw that if this could be done safely a few times, it could be done safely more than a few times. I did 73 high-dose LSD sessions over 20 years, between 1979 and 1999. At the end of my journey, I realized I had gone places and had experiences not covered in early descriptions of psychedelic therapy, so I coined the term “psychedelic exploration” to describe this protocol: working therapeutically—in complete isolation with eyeshades, headphones, a sitter, carefully protected and totally isolated—and then going very, very deep.

For all 20 years, I followed the same protocol: the exact same set and setting, the same sitter, the same substance at the same dose level, even the same location in Northeast Ohio, and the same recording process. Stabilizing all these variables created a very strong platform that allowed particularly clear access to the deep consciousness of the universe.

Our time-space identity—our ego—dies, and one enters spiritual reality. Repeating this surrender leads to deeper encounters with the structures of existence. I follow Stan in adopting his vocabulary to describe these states as the psychic level of transpersonal experience, the subtle level, and the causal level. LSD is sometimes likened to a nuclear bomb of the psyche—developed in the same decade as the nuclear bomb. A sustained, very intense psychotherapeutic process sets in motion a catalytic energy sustained over years. Sessions get deeper and deeper in a sustained fashion. It’s not unlike a nuclear explosion revealing deeper levels of the atmosphere: they were always there, but previously invisible, and now the force brings them into awareness. This is just an analogy, but in sustained psychedelic work, you don’t simply start over at the beginning of every session; one session starts where the previous left off. You go deeper and eventually enter discrete levels of consciousness with their own rules. You acclimate and learn to become consciously aware at these depths. We’re not talking about nuclear bombs—we’re talking about entering the mind of the universe, the great expanse of consciousness.

I experienced myself as thousands of human beings spread over thousands of years, experiencing great rage, violence, and abuse on a collective scale. I came to conclude this work was not about healing my personal psyche or deepening my personal ego death; the intelligence of the universe was using my sessions to bring therapeutic release to the collective unconscious of my species—to the collective unconscious of my family. “Deep Time in the Soul” was my first entry into what I call deep time, which lies outside linear time and space. It’s not eternity or timelessness; it’s a different modality of temporal consciousness. For a year and seven sessions, I experienced my complete life, start to finish, as a simultaneous whole. It was both ahead of me—yet to be lived—and already lived, visible in its entirety.

Then a level of causal oneness, where the world ceases to operate in parts—even the very large parts of archetypal reality. The parts dissolve, and the universe is experienced as a single organic whole, a single consciousness, dissolving all boundaries between beings and levels. I experienced the universe as a single, living, pulsing, throbbing singularity—a oneness that underlies all differentiation. The diamond luminosity story is told in chapter 10. It reflects four years of work and 26 sessions, during which I entered the state of diamond luminosity only four times. The remaining sessions in that period were spent in very intense cleansing as my system acclimated to the enormously powerful energies present in these very pure states—what I call the diamond luminosity, what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.

In “The Birth of the Future Human,” I summarize teachings given to me over about 15 years. It started in session 22, in the “Initiation into the Universe” material. It continued through “The Greater Real of Archetypal Reality” and “The Benediction of Blessings,” and into the final vision material. Session 70 gave me one final installment in the vision of what is happening in our time. In that chapter, I discuss two bodies of visions. The first I call the “visions of awakening,” a series I received between 1991 and 1994 over about a dozen sessions, divided into six themes: divine love, all humanity, a guiding intelligence, our species as a single being, collective purification, and the future human.

In the early “Initiation into the Universe” material, I was taken back to the beginning of creation and experienced creation as an act of supreme love. I was overwhelmed by extraordinary cosmic love coming at me from every direction—unlike anything I’d ever known. To awaken to this love was to remember a primordial decision I had somehow participated in: all of us had voluntarily chosen to be part of the evolutionary process of creation, which was motivated and driven by cosmic love. I then experienced all the suffering humanity had endured throughout history as taking place inside this love. I realized that all the suffering inherent in evolution was noble beyond words—part of a cosmic plan we had entered into freely, however unconscious of this fact we have become. The nobility of great suffering, voluntarily shouldered in the name of divine love—suffering stretching across millions of years, suffering so inscrutable it would be used as evidence that the universe was devoid of compassion—this was the nobility of humanity’s gift to the creative intelligence of our universe.

Out of the seething desires of history, the violent conflicts and the schemings of individuals and nations, a new awareness was driving forward in human consciousness. Its birth in us is no less difficult or violent than the birth of a new continent. It drives upward from the floor of our being, requiring a transposition of everything that has gone before to make room for its new organizational patterns. The difficulty is describing the enormity of what is being birthed. The true focus of this creative process is not individuals, but all humanity. It is trying to awaken the entire species. What is emerging is a consciousness of unprecedented proportions: the entire human family integrated in a unified field of awareness, the species reconnected with its fundamental nature, our thoughts tuned to Source consciousness. The scale took my breath away.

I saw humanity climbing out of a steep valley, and just ahead on the other side of the mountain was a brilliant, sun-drenched world about to break over us. The timeframe was enormous. After millions of years of struggle and ascent, we were poised on the brink of a sunrise that would forever change the conditions of life on this planet. All current structures would quickly become irrelevant. All truths would quickly be rendered passé—a truly new epoch was dawning. The lives of everyone living in this pivotal time in history were helping to bring this global shift about. Though we did not know the deep future at a personal level, there was a more encompassing level of consciousness that could see it very clearly. Individually, we humans could not see what was coming, and so did not understand why things are the way they are. Isolated from the future, the present makes absolutely no sense. To be ignorant of what is being built is to be functionally blind. And our species is not blind.

I was taken deeper into the unified field of existence and experienced the dynamics of humanity’s awakening as movements being initiated and orchestrated by a single integrating intelligence. I experienced the evolution of our species as the systematic growth of a single organism—a unified being that all of us are part of. The subtlety of the cooperation of the parts with the whole was extraordinary. Experiencing the incredible diversity of our species as a single unified field made many events clearer. New patterns sprang into view, and the patterns made transparent sense. Nothing in our theological or philosophical systems does justice to these facts. The unified field of humanity was moving decisively and precipitously to become more aware of itself. Previously it had existed as an extended fabric, largely unconscious of itself; now it was waking itself up. Visually, this took the form of energy coming together in swift, contractive spasms that created bright flashes of awareness. I repeatedly saw extended webs of energy suddenly contract and explode in brilliant flashes. In the past, these flashes had been swallowed by the inertia of the collective psyche and had not endured. Now, however, the flashes were beginning to hold their own and to connect with other flashes occurring around the planet.

When an organism is called from within to become more conscious, it must first cleanse itself of the psychological byproducts of living at its lower level of awareness. It must bring forward the residue of its past and purge that residue in order to lay the foundation for a more refined level of operation. Our species was doing this wholesale and with great determination—by crystallizing within itself generations that embody our toxic legacy. It was the coordinated exercise of the self-evolution of the species as a whole. The poisons of humanity’s past were being brought to the surface in us, and by transforming these poisons in our individual lives, we were making it possible for divine awareness to enter more deeply into future generations. We had volunteered for this role, for both our personal good and the collective good. I saw that this century formed a watershed into which the karmic streams of history were flowing and, as this process came to fruition, the future condition of our species would be beyond anything we might project from our current state of fragmentation.

Then, right in the middle of that sequence—when I expected to be taken again into diamond luminosity—I was taken instead into the death and rebirth of the human species.

People became more and more frightened as the danger increased, forcing them to let go of their assumptions.

Decades were compressed into minutes, and I felt people’s fear deepen as they lost more and more of what they considered the normal and necessary structures of their world. Step by step, events were forcing a rapid reassessment of everything in their lives. The events that had overtaken Earth were of such scope that no one could insulate themselves. The level of alarm grew in the species field until eventually everyone was forced into the melting pot of mere survival. We were all in this together.

I’ll read it: She’s intrigued by the centrality of the human species in these visions. It seems anthropocentric, given that we invented the concept of species. What is the place of non-human life in this expanded consciousness?\n\nChris Bache:\nLet me take this first one, and then you can ask the second. This is a really important question. I have friends who have spent a great deal of time at the interface of the human species and animal species, even immersing themselves into various animal species with various insights. My work has not been like that. It has been really focused on the human species, and I don’t know why, except for one thing: I think the human species is the most dangerous species on the planet right now. It is the imbalances of the human psyche that are placing the lives and well-being of other species in peril.

But in terms of when or how, specifically, no content whatsoever. I was shown that it was happening, that it would be happening.

To me, the pandemic feels like an overture to a symphony. It starts the process. It touches some of the themes of the process we’re getting into, but it is not itself the key crisis.

We have set in motion a sequence of events that’s taking us into a very turbulent, convulsive period of history. That’s what my reading of ecological sources tells me. It’s also what my visionary experiences in psychedelic work tell me: we are going into a time of ascending energy, a time in which nature is reaching down and bringing up energy underneath our feet, taking humanity into an extraordinary new phase of its evolutionary journey—a time of great awakening, great spiritual fruition, a change in the fundamental archetypal architecture of the collective psyche that informs all our individual psyches as we work together. But when nature turns up the heat underneath us, it triggers profound purification processes. We have no choice but to confront our shadows, both individual and collective, because the shadow is rising.

It's good to continue our discussion. In our previous conversation, we started on reincarnation—looking at the evidence from extraordinary children around the world—and began to unpack that evidence into a deeper understanding of the rhythms of life and the stages of human evolution that reincarnation makes possible. It restores the meaningfulness of the challenges embedded in our lives and offers an opportunity to deepen therapeutic interventions where we’re stuck, where we’re holding pain rooted in our deeper history. Today, let’s go farther—into the significance of being reincarnating beings in a universe that supports, nurtures, and created this reincarnation dynamic.\n\nRichard Rudd\nThat’s a huge difference, isn’t it—living in a universe that nurtures us, with a kind of paternal-maternal energy surrounding it.

Chance is a powerful element of this universe. We can affirm meaning and intentionality without forcing every detail into that press of “What’s the meaning of this? What’s the meaning of that?” We can affirm a larger scope of meaning in a world with chance, variables, and uncertainties.

That’s very much my experience from working deeply with psychedelics: nothing I did at deep levels was mine alone or private. The pain came from a larger collective web, and the healing spread into a larger collective web. Practices like the meditations you’re describing change the tilt of how we live in the universe. According to our physical senses, life can feel like something independent of us that happens to us—we’re its victims, and then we respond. But when you begin to send out healing and love into the universe, you watch it respond—immediately and indirectly. Then you shift into sensing you live in a dynamic field; you are part of a dynamic field. At a deep, subtle level, you’re creating your universe as you go. That doesn’t mean you’re free of all the karma coming at you from the past—it’s still working its way through—but the balance of your life increasingly tilts from being the passive recipient of what you didn’t personally start to being the generator of the life you are inheriting now.", "char_len": 1141, "token_est": 285, "hash": "ec0b7d"}

When I started, I thought there was just one death—ego death—that would launch you into the spiritual universe. But the spiritual universe has many layers. Being operational at one layer doesn’t mean you’re operational at deeper layers. You go through another metamorphosis—another death and surrender—to be reborn into another layer, and so on. That reflects the Tibetan idea of Bardo: a discrete layer of consciousness. In describing the after-death journey, there are multiple Bardos you pass through—the hungry ghosts, heavenly spirits, and so on.

You didn’t make those; you received and unpacked them. You’re responsible for your half, but the other half is the seed from above.

In a plant you see a little more, in a bird more clearly as it animates, and in a mammal even more—you see it in their eyes. In humans, it’s obvious—we can do this. Every tiny atom contains the seed of a spiritual truth. Everything is waiting its time, on this evolutionary ladder. Where involution meets evolution is the eternal Now—constantly creating and recreating.\n\nFrom involution and evolution, you can also penetrate the old chestnut of free will and determinism.

But if we give the benefit of the doubt and assume what happens for the individual can happen for the collective—that humanity is cooking its past seeds through deep collective dynamics, transcending past limitations, and moving forward—then we have reasons to hope.

I was just explaining the difference between knowledge and wisdom. Although we’ve explored streams of knowledge, wisdom is different. In a way it’s the opposite, because, for me, wisdom comes through revelation. It comes through listening—being passive and then receiving—whereas knowledge is something you go after, you chase, you hunt. You go towards it instead of allowing it to come towards you. The information you receive through revelation isn’t “information” in the same way; it’s cellular. My experience—what’s led to me being me and doing what I do—is a cellular knowing of what’s coming for humanity. It’s not easy to hold that, because not everyone has it. It puts me in a more relaxed state than most people at a fundamental level, because I have this knowing that everything’s going to be fine.

Our second conversation blended that with the kind of wisdom that arises in my psychedelic work. Today, I feel I’m standing squarely within that other side of my life. I’m a psychedelic visionary. My understanding comes from carefully distilling conscientiously engaged non-ordinary states again and again, purifying and allowing the universe to take me deeper into what I experience as itself—into its intention, into time, literally into deep time. The experiences were never intended just for me; they’re planted in me to hold and pass on.

I think both of us have that sense that birth is an intense event, and we’re coming to a birth point—we’re in the canal and contractions are occurring. In the same way individual awakening often comes through contractions: before a transcendental experience there are shudders, openings and closings, condensing and intensification of shadow material, and then a kind of opening, and then another birth contraction. The contractions come closer together until there’s an epiphany—something that shakes your core and fires within your DNA, setting you alight and changing you forever. I think that’s what’s happening on a planetary level. It’s beginning to happen as a collective. Your writings, Chris—particularly your mind of the universe, Diamonds book—describe so beautifully this process of coming down the birth canal. What it doesn’t do, and what neither of us can do, is fill in the details; only time can. But we can offer backdrop and empathize with the intensity of the suffering that’s already here and is likely to ramp up. We want to empathize with that, and at the same time present this knowing that gives people hope—more than hope, actually—even as it also provides hope.

Deep insights cannot fit into small containers. When nature or the divine invites us into a deeper experience, it has to purify us. That contracting process burns up everything that keeps us small, to allow us to be taken and shattered. In my context, it’s the death–rebirth cycle—to die to everything that holds us where we are, and to be reborn into a larger world. That can happen again and again, taking us deeper into knowing. As with any spiritual path, there are no shortcuts. It’s exacting and demanding. But the fruit is both personal and collective; it expands around us in subtle, mysterious ways.

Everything kept opening into collective vistas—being drawn into the collective psyche, going through collective purifications, opening into insights about our collective development. I experienced reincarnation not simply as an individual soul journey but as a species journey—our entire species evolving through systematic reincarnation, generation after generation. I was given an understanding that this process, individually and collectively, is coming into a crescendo, a profound breakthrough. You’ve languaged it as a birth, and I think that’s right. Birth involves labor and a change from one state to another; for the child it’s from water-being to land-being. I think we’re growing from individual egoic awareness—where identity is body–mind–ego—into soul awareness, where our former lives come together in a tremendous fusion point. As our knowledge of the past deepens and we heal the traumas we carry, our past lives become more integrated. We integrate not only their pains but their virtues, assets, and capacities. Eventually our lives hit a fusion point; the soul becomes one. There’s an explosion of light and an explosion into a higher order of individuality with a different threshold, a different sense of communion with the intelligence of the universe and the Divine. If humanity is going through this—and my visions have shown me this again and again—it represents a new foundation for the human story, just as profound as the jump about 200,000 years ago to a brain 50 percent bigger than before, allowing us to think and do what we never could.

First, many people watching this—if you’re drawn to this material—have likely said yes to receiving and transmuting more shadow material than one lifetime’s worth. I remember dark days when the level of shadow in my body seemed insurmountable and endless. Whenever I meditated I found weight, heaviness, oppression—so much it felt like a thick clot. How would I ever burn through it? Gradually, over the years, it lightened. I’ve seen the light at the end of the tunnel. I say this because many listening will know the experience of grappling with a weight inside the physical, emotional, and mental reality that far outweighs the wounding patterns of one life. We’ve taken on more because we’re capable of taking on more. If you feel that heaviness, it’s because you have the capacity—the love great enough—to burn through it.

Looking at life today through the lens of history, we see continuity: cycles repeating, ups and downs, patterns across recorded history. The one thing you can’t see is beyond the break, because at some point there’s a break in continuity and something new is born. As you said, it’s assembled out of all the elements of the old, condensed into a symphony, and then it stands on the shoulders of all that’s great and all that’s suffered. Compressed like the beginning of the universe into a tiny space, then set—and then there’s an opening, an expansion of vast light. What’s coming has no similarity to what we have now. With our wildest imagination we can only begin to approach it. We humans assume things will continue as they have—robots, more tech, then we go to the stars—until a crux point comes and smashes everything. A whole new epoch begins, something completely new.

I think there are many more hidden saints than we realize—people who have taken on responsibility for working on behalf of humanity as a whole, engaging darkness not just from their personal history but from our collective history. We have to move through this period quickly. As every mother knows, you don’t want the fetus stuck in the birth canal. We need to keep everything moving.

Humanity is reaching that period. Scientists point to similar thresholds. The ocean, for example, has been capturing huge amounts of CO2—sinking it to the deep—but it’s slowly building up. At some point the ocean can no longer capture more; its ability weakens, and the CO2 we create suddenly explodes into the atmosphere. It looks like we’ve been in a hiatus, and we have, because there’s an illusion we’ve been okay—until everything speeds up much more quickly than most could conceive.

In that condition—like water as you keep increasing the energy going into it, or a bathtub as you keep increasing the quantity of water and the ripples start to change—we come to a tipping point, a bifurcation point, where the system has too much energy to maintain its current structures.

The only way we can go as far as we need to go, in the little time we have, is to understand the dynamics of the collective unconscious—the field dynamics of consciousness and how fields operate in non-equilibrium systems. At least this is what has come through my visionary experience over and over: we are coming to a point where a crisis builds in intensity until it looks like all is lost—so much disruption, loss of control, death, challenge at a deep level. But when it’s at its worst, it begins to pass. We pick ourselves up. We rise to the challenge—and in rising, we are changed. Profoundly.

We can get glimmers of the future by looking at the great beings of our past—the saints, prophets, incarnations, the Christs, the Buddhas—who have always called us to a higher order of existence.

Another thing about non-equilibrium systems: individual, small changes can catapult into massive outcomes. The butterfly wing in China sets off a hurricane across the planet. In intensifying conditions, the impact of individuals increases exponentially. So if we look at the past and say, “The individual can’t do anything; we’re overwhelmed by historical forces,” it’s just the opposite now.

I love listening when you go off on a transmission. I was thinking, if you asked yourself, “What one thing, if it happened on this planet, could change everything quickly, overnight?”—inside me, the answer is: to see through the veil of death. The moment one person truly sees through that veil, fear is no more. That’s where fear resides. The intensification of energy you’re talking about—the suffering, the love—pours toward this one point, and it’s the only force that can pierce that veil. What I would expect, and what I’ve seen through the Gene Keys and my teachings, is that as this boiling takes place, more and more people will experience their consciousness transcending birth and death, retaining memory between lives, and carrying it across. That’s pure awakening. When a being has that level of awakening and they’re simply being who they are, it’s electrifying. It’s contagious.

Those children are us—our future vehicles—and they will be born through awakened ones. If two awakened ones come together to bring a child, you have a clear conduit, a vessel you might want to jump into. More and more of that—so you could perceive that awakened consciousness will colonize the human gene pool, like a virus of love. It spreads everywhere—non-denominational, in the weirdest places, tiny communities—it can’t be fixed on any chosen people. It’s going to wake up like a thief in the night.

Everything below the line is physical reality; above the line is transpersonal or spiritual reality. Much discussion focuses on the first circle—death-rebirth of ego—an important, fundamental transition. But you actually go through multiple levels of death and rebirth. It’s not the ego dying over and over; these processes take place at different levels of the universe, at different levels of the creative intelligence.

Those familiar with Stanislav Grof’s work know this as the perinatal level—the boundary between space-time consciousness and the first transpersonal reality. I felt like a poster child for this level: intense physical purifications, fetal sensations, reliving aspects of birth, tremendous existential angst, confronting life’s meaninglessness, and then ego death—a complete shattering of egoic reality. The ego is a tough son of a bitch, but in the final analysis it’s not that hard to take apart; it’s harder to heal than to shatter. After two and a half years and ten sessions, the last two snapped me like a twig. I started the day as a white male, highly educated academic obsessed with the meaning of life. The experience inverted all those variables—turning me into women, women of color, women at the laundromat with no prospects, women with no interest in philosophy or the meaning of life. Of course, women weren’t the “problem,” nor was lack of education; the problem was the social identity I had internalized and accepted as what I am. The universe forced me to become the opposite. When I surrendered, I entered the world of women under the arm of the Great Mother and was taken through hundreds of women’s lives—an extraordinary transformation.

This is an important epistemological point: when you break through to a new level of consciousness, you often get fragmented because you’re in a totally different cognitive reality. But if you go back with clear focus and intent and a clear setting, you learn to be aware in levels of consciousness that initially just swallowed you. I learned how to stay conscious in deep time. This repeated itself whenever I broke through to deeper levels—initial fragmentation, then, over time, details coalescing into complete patterns of understanding. My life from beginning to end was saturated with insights of karma and the deeper intentionality that binds us into time and space.

It was non-stop joy. Four sessions I describe are The Forest; The Birth of the Diamond Soul; Singing the Universe Away; and Jesus’ Blood. The first was oneness—śūnyatā, emptiness, no self in me, no self anywhere. Singing the Universe Away was entering the primal void—what Stan calls the metacosmic void—the domain of the formless out of which the light emerges that gives birth to the physical universe. Jesus’ Blood was extraordinary cosmic love—being loved like I’ve never been loved before. The Birth of the Diamond Soul is important. Eleven years earlier, I had experienced my life as a totality; now my former lives were coming together fast, like wrapping a filament of white light around a kite spool. At a certain point they hit critical mass, fused, and exploded into a diamond light—my first contact with what I came to call diamond light. It showed me how reincarnation is taking humanity forward. Reincarnation isn’t simply incremental improvements lifetime by lifetime—though we do that. At a larger level, if we keep this up—die and remember who we are, are born and forget and learn, die and remember, born and forget and learn—sooner or later the soul, the larger consciousness that holds all our lives, wakes up inside time and space, not just in the spiritual reality we return to when we die. I call this the birth of the diamond soul, just to put language to it. Others have spoken about it. In a sense it is spiritual awakening in the deepest sense—an emergence in history of a fully integrated being, integrated across hundreds of thousands of years of experience, jumped to a higher level of awareness and functionality, with tremendous compassion, because we’ve had so many lifetimes with each other, and a profound transparency to the universal creative intelligence.

Yet this became one of the most consistent themes—a series of visionary experiences showing me, over and over: humanity is coming to a turning point, a profound revision of its foundation, a time of great awakening—a before-and-after moment in history. “Visions of Awakening” is a collection of six visions pulled from different sessions, grouped to tell the story coherently.

I went into the future and experienced the death and rebirth of our species. I wasn’t a human being; I had merged into the field of the collective psyche and experienced the crisis as the species will experience it: a crisis that brings us to our knees, a profound unraveling, a shattering of life as we’ve known it, a frightening time.

These were diamond souls—fully integrated souls moving into the universe, centers of integration capable of integrating levels of consciousness the ego alone could never integrate. The universe is a diamond maker. The universe is growing sparks of diamond luminosity, and it makes no difference to it—or it makes a difference, but it makes no difference—whether it takes a million years or a million years for this process to come to fruition.

We’re going to be discussing a subject we’re both really interested in and fascinated by: rebirth and everything that goes along with it. You might also call it reincarnation, because that’s part of the story. This began because I read a wonderful book by Chris, LSD and the Mind of the Universe, and it triggered a real recognition in me. Since I’m a teacher of spiritual matters and the founder of a system called the Gene Keys, that resonance prompted me to reach out via email to this amazing man. You never know whether you’ll hear back in those instances, but Chris very kindly did, and we started a series of dialogues. We realized we really enjoyed having conversations together, so that’s why we’re here. We’ll explore this subject in several sessions. Today we’ll begin with some introductory concepts and basics and see where it leads. I hope you enjoy it—I’m very much looking forward to it.\n\nChris Bache:\nSo we’re anticipating three discussions.\n\nRichard Rudd:\nAbsolutely.

I am a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies—on the religious studies side of the shop—retired from Youngstown State University. In the course of my teaching, I’ve taught world religions, Eastern religions, transpersonal psychology of religion, comparative mysticism, Buddhism. So I’ve been teaching in areas touching on reincarnation for many years. I’ve written several books. My first was on reincarnation, starting with the scientific evidence for reincarnation, which we’ll be touching on today, and it’s been seminal in my thinking. I believe reincarnation is one of those concepts that’s like plate tectonics: at first it’s hard to see because it’s not obvious, but once you see it, it changes everything. It opens up the horizon of existence.

It’s so illuminating and extraordinary, and kind of overlooked by so many people. Tell us your story in assembling and amassing some of that evidence, or meeting the people who have.\n\nChris Bache:\nI came from a traditional religious background, but over many years of graduate education, I finished my doctoral work in philosophy of religion as an atheistically inclined agnostic. I had basically studied my way out of religion altogether. I started my academic career as a young man in 1978, and in my first year I met the work of two people who changed the course of my life. The first was Ian Stevenson, the Carlson Professor at the University of Virginia, whose lifelong work has been to provide carefully documented cases of young children—small children—who have spontaneous memories of a previous life. He researched these children from all over the world, collected thousands of cases, published hundreds, and he convinced me that reincarnation was a simple fact of life.", "char_len": 1279, "token_est": 319, "hash": "04aa04"}

For me, it was a life pivot, because reincarnation was never discussed in my graduate education. It was never discussed in the Western religions or in the scientific tradition that had wiped the slate clean of the religious traditions. So I erased my blackboard and began to rethink the larger questions of life, incorporating reincarnation. The second person I met was Stanislav Grof, the foremost authority on integrating psychedelics into psychotherapy. He provided a methodology that allows one to explore the deeper dimensions of one’s own consciousness. That began a second journey, which culminated eventually in the publication of the book Richard mentioned, LSD in the Mind of the Universe.

But now it’s moved from the theologians’ table to the psychologists’ table. As we explore more deeply the deeper levels of consciousness in the depth psychology tradition, we keep bumping into this evidence. Now, the Western philosophical tradition is still saturated with the metaphysical position of naturalism, which says the only thing that is real is the physical. Therefore the brain produces your mind; once your brain dies, your mind ceases to exist. In that system, reincarnation is impossible because it implies a dimension of reality behind the physical world—consciousness existing for any interval between the death of one personality and the birth of a second. Naturally there’s been pushback from Western philosophy; mostly they’ve ignored the evidence. Even those who engage it—the foremost critic I mentioned, Paul Edwards, a substantial American philosopher—when you analyze the debate between Ian Stevenson and Paul Edwards, you see he refuses to look seriously at the evidence because he’s convinced beforehand it must be faulty.

It all hinges on time—how much time we have. If you have a sense of—well, let me back up. I’m a professor. If I give a quiz in class, I expect a certain quality of answers. If I give an exam that takes an hour, I expect a higher quality. If it’s a take-home research paper, higher still—because they have more time. Philosophically, if we believe we only live on earth once, and we have from a few minutes to maybe 100 years, we extrapolate that if there is a purpose to existence, it must be proportionate to the time we have. But if we have 100 lifetimes, 1000 lifetimes, in which to actualize the purpose of the universe, then our assessment of that purpose expands exponentially.

And if I can be blunt, if you have an inherent sense of a divinity behind creation, then it seems logical to extend that into a concept of generosity. If you had a divinity and only one life, it seems stingy. It doesn’t seem to have pattern or reason. For me, spirit is filled with generosity in terms of time. If we open to the eternal nature of life, then of course it makes sense for there to be a continuity of consciousness. The more people open to this, the more they realize it has some deep root inside them. I’ve discovered that as I’ve begun to talk about it more. One thing I’ve realized is that, other than people doing past life regression therapeutically, a lot of spiritual teachers today avoid this subject. I don’t know if they consciously avoid it, but they don’t talk about it. They get asked questions, but their answers are generally quite short, and it doesn’t get picked up.

I understand why my university colleagues, who tend to be materialist and reductionist, avoid it. But why spiritual teachers wouldn’t use it to frame a larger horizon, I’m not sure. Sometimes I’ve heard people say it can dilute your intensity of commitment for realization in the present—if you think you have many lifetimes, you won’t take this one as seriously. I think that argument evaporates quickly once you look at it. It deepens the textures of the situations we find ourselves in. One example: some of Michael Newton’s research, for example in his books Journeys of the Soul and Destiny of Souls. He and other past life therapists have found evidence that we choose our incarnation. Many people may go haphazardly and take what’s available, but as you mature, you choose carefully. If we choose our incarnation carefully at a time when we knew more than we know now and could see more than we see now, and we chose the life we’re living—with its ups, downs, challenges, and opportunities—doesn’t that change how we relate to those circumstances?

It’s not just a concept—you have to contemplate something like this deeply for it to take root. As it takes root, it brings something out of you. I feel the truth of it is in our DNA. Once that awakening of memory is triggered, a certainty and stability grow inside that enable us to handle challenges in a more powerful way, because we’re rooted in an eternal acceptance of this. You hear it all the time on the radio—someone saying, “You’ve only got one life, so make the most of it,” which is a great thing to say.

There’s no existential significance to your circumstances. You only get one shot; make the best of it; then when you die, it’s gone anyway, so who cares? That’s a demeaning and counterintuitive philosophy of life. When we look at the beauties of nature, the night sky, the Hubble images of magnificent patterns in the deep cosmos, the emergence of life and self-awareness on the planet—all these projects take enormous sweeps of time. We are the first generation to really appreciate how much time the universe has had to evolve into its present form. If everything the universe is doing takes enormous time and we only have one life, existentially we’re cut off; we don’t participate in that massive project. But if we live multiple lifetimes, there’s a good news/bad news situation. The bad news is it’s hard work in this lifetime, and we’d like to have it over with when we die, but if we keep coming back, there’s a larger project afoot. It’s not a simple grade; it’s a whole university education. The good news is the fear of death drops away. It allows us to feel into the deeper currents of life and think in terms of longer-term projects. You see this when people take to heart the idea—even without specific knowledge of former lives. That can be helpful, but even without it, when you let it in and realize every person you’re seeing has been here before and will be here again, you can engage life with more meaning and intensity.

It’s okay if they want to reincarnate in India—that’s their business—but everybody knows Catholics do not reincarnate. She had spontaneous memories of having been a man, Joe Williams, in a previous life. She remembered being married, having three children and their names, and dying in a motorcycle accident.

What’s the end game? You’re right—religions of the Axial Age teach an “up and out” cosmology. We’re trapped here; this isn’t as good as spiritual reality. We want to develop—either in one lifetime, if it’s Christian salvation by grace, or multiple lifetimes to achieve moksha, escape from samsara. We achieve an enlightenment condition which is the passport to leave and not come back. Those traditions are about escape. That leaves unanswered the fundamental question: what is the purpose of physical existence in the first place? Now that we understand how many billions of years of genius have gone into the manifestation of the physical world, it’s not satisfactory to think that, as soon as we become self-aware of the deeper dimensions, the purpose of existence is to escape the entire physical world.

The two are connected, because women are so closely connected to nature, and those traditions were patriarchally and escapist oriented. As a historian, I understand it. Four or five thousand years ago, through various psychotechnologies—yoga, meditation, or psychedelic substances—we began to have deeper experiences of the Mother Universe, the universe that surrounds the physical universe. Once you have experiential contact with that universe, it is so blissful, so ecstatic, and you recognize that’s where we’re from. You can’t help believing that’s where we belong.

There are many hidden saints, taking on a lot of cause and effect either from their own larger soul stream or even a collective soul stream, focusing in their body and psyche what we might call negative karma for the uplift of the whole. That kind of generosity and compassion is all around us. Good parents—mothers and fathers—would do anything for their children; souls at a deeper level do that too.

One of the great insights I got from your “unit mind of the universe” book was a paradox you describe: being an individual soul and yet being everything at the same time. How does that hold up? You described it beautifully—the soul as “open on all sides.” It’s part of the ocean and yet still a focalized drop of awareness.\n\nChris Bache: It seems commonsensical that you can’t be both a part and the whole at the same time—mutually exclusive categories.

Incarnation isn’t necessarily historically linear; you could have former lives lived in future time. That really challenges things.

It’s a matter of living with this information and systematically exploring your deep consciousness by following your memories to earlier and earlier stages. This can be done with contemplation and various meditation exercises. It can be greatly aided by working with professionals who can help you stay conscious at deeper levels of memory, because when we go beneath the personal unconscious we often get fuzzy or fall asleep. Someone can help you keep focus as you go deeper. It’s often good to focus on a particular issue, problem, or joy and follow that to its root.\n\nThere are many ways in.

In many indigenous cultures they track incarnations and hold a strong intuition that within a tribal, family, or clan grouping there’s a real link between a person and the great-grandchildren or great-grandparents. It often skips a couple of generations. There’s no fixed way of understanding it, but it’s a firm tradition.\n\nRecently my father died, and I’ve been going through ancestral things. I found photographs of my great-grandparents and felt an uncanny resonance I can’t explain. I intuitively put their photographs on my desk—those were the two I wanted to look at. They’ve been looking at me for the last month or so. So yes, it seems to follow through lineages, but it also hops about.

As you put it, Chris, we’re moving beyond the “up and out” philosophy of attaining enlightenment and leaving Samsara. I speak more about being “down and in.” The more work we do internallly—clearing patterns, transmuting shadows, forgiving and letting go of trauma through the physical, emotional, and mental body—the more space there is for us to incarnate more deeply. Our soul is vast, most of it not here. As we clear our being—particularly the belly, the navel, where everything seems to cluster—more light can live here. You begin to radiate more; you unlock more joy and healing energy because more of your soul can come here. That’s how heaven comes to earth—through doing this shadow work so more of us incarnates.\n\nChris Bache\nTwo more questions stand out. First: Why do we forget our past lives in the first place?

Much discussion of reincarnation is influenced by past-life literature, which is therapeutic: people come because they’re carrying pain. But most past lives don’t manifest as pain in our present life—they manifest as capacities, skills, knowledge. We need to avoid tilting only toward pain.

It made me think about parallel universes to incarnate into. When a soul evolves to transmute more of the world’s karma, there seems to be greater elasticity—more ability to transmigrate between dimensions and to break some of the rules of linear incarnating sequences. We often imagine stitching a beautiful fabric through lives in sequence. I think many lives do that. But as we gain wisdom, time becomes more flexible.\n\nSome of you asked if I have specific memories of past lives. I kind of do—and I also don’t—because part of my mindstream doesn’t wish to cling to locations in the spacetime continuum. There’s a playfulness in the way my mind operates. It reads a whole stream, a fractal, a passage down a lineage, feels a resonance, follows it—forward and backward in time. They’re not just historical, they’re more mythic. There’s interdimensional play as a soul gains experience.

Reincarnation answers certain questions, but it also changes the direction of our questions and opens us to a more complex universe.

It’s not a mortal sin and doesn’t lead to eternal damnation. There are many reasons people take their lives; we may call them all “suicide,” but the motivational structures differ. Even suicides that come as acts of desperation are greeted by the universe with understanding and compassion. When we die, we go through a life review and debrief with other levels of intelligence. Life inside time and space is hard; people get desperate. Acts made in desperation do not have eternal consequences. We’re not punished; we’re met—and we learn. All actions can become habitual—anger can become a trait; suicide can become a habit that shows up across incarnations. So it’s important to confront the limits that led to such a desperate act and find a different outcome.

The final stage I call “the arms of the mother.” That’s what you land in after the life review, coming into self-forgiveness—because you are forgiven, but you have to forgive yourself.

One touches me: Why do souls reincarnate for short periods—an infant dying after birth or a young child dying very young? These are great heartaches for any parent. Things that look very large from inside the time-space, egoic perspective don’t look the same from the soul’s perspective. It feels tragic for us, but for the soul they’re all short lives. A 10-minute life and a 100-year life are small bits of time against the vast spectrum of the soul’s lifetime.\n\nPast-life therapists who have engaged souls with these experiences generally agree that, for the most part, they are chosen incarnations. They chose them, knowing what they were entering. Sometimes the lesson was for someone else—to be the grain of sand in the oyster that catalyzes growth in others. But they are chosen, part of an ongoing unfolding process. Reincarnation gives us permission to understand that life doesn’t begin at birth or end at death, so we can let go of some of the heartache. There is separation and pain when a life we wanted to spend time with ends, but life does not end at death.

Malabika asks about the soul outgrowing Gaia and moving on to other systems—can the soul determine where it will go, when, and as what? How much free will does the soul have, and are other forces at work?\n\nFor me, there are two forces: evolution and involution. Evolution is the soul evolving through experiences—coming in and out of form, becoming broader and more aware of its universal nature. Involution is the arms of the mother—the whole collective, the divine consciousness doing all this through its monads, its fractal, holographic children—different crystalline aspects of itself. The whole is also doing it. So there’s a choreography from the whole taking place, and within that there’s serpentine freedom and flow as the individual crystal souls—the diamond souls—become aware of what they really are: the whole, while also being a part of the whole.

It’s an incredible dance, playing with that paradox.\n\nChris Bache:\nA question from Catherine: Buddhists say reincarnation is like transferring the light from one candle to another. What do you think of this interpretation—transferring both personal and collective karmic stuff?\n\nWhen the Buddha was asked what self incarnates, he lined up candles, lit the second from the first, blew out the first, lit the third from the second, and so on. At the end, is it the same flame or a different flame? The answer is both—but Buddhists emphasize it’s a different flame. In fact, it’s a different flame from second to second.\n\nThe teaching of no-self doesn’t mean we aren’t individuals. It means there is no permanent individuality and no separate individuality.

You see this through shadow patterns we all play out—suffering—and hidden inside those are potential gifts. Inside those gifts—the creative flowering, the healing that grows through suffering—there’s a fruit I call the cities, the 64 cities. This is probably where we want to bring our talk to a close: the notion that something is hidden deep in the core of suffering, something beyond what we can understand now, something so beautiful. It’s another realm, another dimension, another field of learning. We might call it grace or bliss. We may be entering the epoch in which incarnation itself starts to fall apart and open up, so we no longer need to move in and out of these forms in the way we did. We may one day look back and say, “We used to have to differentiate in that way because of the shadow and its impetus inside us. But now we’ve explored that fully; we can sit in these cities.” These cities are higher states of consciousness, avataric fields of oneness.

Every mother or father worth their salt understands that and would suffer for their children. Those precious qualities are the qualities we’re developing and empowering.

It was intended to be a discussion of various themes in the book, but it quickly focused on one particular aspect: while Chris was having experiences of deep time—like experiencing the entire course of human existence as a singular moment—he had a vision of what he called the birth of the future human, emerging out of extreme cataclysm: a long phase of strife, grief, suffering, and challenges that push humanity into its next phase of evolution. Chris considers where we are now to be the start of that.\n\nThis interview was recorded in September of 2020. I’ll be honest: it took me a long time to release because I was going through a difficult period, and at some point it became less of an interview and more of a young man pleading to an older man for wisdom to make sense of crisis—personally and existentially. I may have felt embarrassed about that. Either way, now is the time. Some topics may resonate with recent controversies in the 5-MeO-DMT world, but none of this is a response to that—this was recorded months before.

I listened to our first podcast again, went back through notes from your workshop in Vancouver, and revisited the book. I kept wondering, what’s the course here? In our first interview, I’d listened to your talks and followed how you structure your lectures, and used that as a path to walk. I didn’t have that this time. If you’re okay with it, I thought it might be interesting if I pull some passages from your book—things that moved me or felt relevant—read them, and then ask you to speak to them.

I’ll tell you, too: once the book came out and we did the first round of interviews, COVID hit, and I stepped back to digest people’s first reactions. I just sent an article to Synergetic Press and to the UK network CyMail—basically a postscript to LSD and the Mind of the Universe—responding to people’s initial takes. In that process, I’m finding another tier of implications. It’s nothing “new,” but the sheer audacity of the claims—about the limits and revised limits of human experience, what we’re capable of, and the import of entering deep intimacy with the consciousness of the universe—is sinking in at a new level. I’m glad to be doing this second bite at the apple. There’ve been a lot of first interviews; this can be something different. I’m happy to see where we go.\n\nJames Jesso:\nCool.

I read it during the 2020 lockdown—immersing myself while isolated, with all the existential gravity of the moment. You describe a kind of “rock tumbler” and the future human emerging out of deep strife, struggle, and pain—an analogy to the cleansing process of your psychedelic explorations. As I was reading, I thought, I’d be foolish to think we’re already there despite how bad this is. This is ultimately just a virus. How do you feel about it?\n\nChris Bache:\nI think of it as an overture. It contains some of the key elements of the symphony that’s coming, but only in abbreviated forms. It’s mobilizing us.

Ego is important, even magnificent, but a world built by a species operating out of egoic awareness is a divided world—haves and have-nots. We can’t get more extreme than what we’re seeing.

The book we’re referring to is about those journeys. What I’m seeing in the world—mostly mediated by screens—is not a place I want to be. I don’t want to be where it appears we’re going; I don’t want to be part of a system that does what it does. I don’t like being part of something that feels distorted. What I see in people’s behavior—shaped by algorithms and isolation and mental health crises—is a lot of toxic behavior and discussion, draped in self-righteous moralism: good versus evil, where “good is me” and anyone who disagrees is the devil to be cast out.\n\nIt makes me want to hide away. Yet couching this in psychedelics—as a large, collective process happening globally, not just with humanity but with the planet—it mirrors psychedelic work. When I see these parts of myself in a session, it’s equally ugly. I want to hide from it, and yet one of the things you talk about is learning not to turn away from pain.

You go into a room, close the door, and it’s just you and your mind. You enter the parts of your being that are initially the most daunting—the most frightening and the ugliest, the parts we least want to acknowledge. But the commitment is to take that on.\n\nWhen we see ugliness manifested in the world by people who haven’t taken responsibility for themselves—who are still externalizing the shadow—the evil and darkness are always “out there.” That’s a very different world. The breakdown I see coming is going to break down that defense: the assumption that we’re the good guys and the others are the bad guys. Eventually we’ll have to come to terms with the fact that we did this. We created this imbalance. We benefited from it. We continue to generate it—in the cars we drive, the lives we live, the lifestyles we aspire to. There will come a time when there’s nowhere else to look.

When you go into the work, you learn that the more you purify and cleanse, the deeper the reward—the deeper the ecstasy and the teaching. The more you purify, the deeper the communion. Once you learn that, you not only become more comfortable facing the shadow—you actively embrace it. You embrace pain and suffering not because you like them, but for two reasons. First, because you learn that deeper purification brings deeper ecstasy. You don’t like suffering, but you like what’s on the other side.

I agree. So there’s a balance—spiritual friends, but not isolating in only that circle; engaging and being in the world. Right now, so much is mediated by screens and social media. Every interaction is tinged—Is that person a loaded COVID gun? We’re not coming together much. There’s a lot of toxic interaction, charged emotion, embodied tension. We’re exposed to how bad things are, with less of the beauty coming through.\n\nSo “being in the world,” whether screen-mediated or not, is happening in this landscape of contortion, where we’re generally not operating from oneness.

That’s our work: go into deeper intimacy with whatever drives the universe, then come back and live our lives as best we can. Reincarnation does this—pulling us out into spiritual reality, plunging us back in, over and over. A psychedelic session reenacts that on a smaller orbit: it shatters the earthly life, opens us to what it’s like to die into the great surrounding world, then we come back into time and space.

He distinguishes low-dose psycholytic sessions from high-dose psychedelic sessions. In the early years, those psychedelic sessions were limited to three. I took that protocol and multiplied the number of sessions to 73, but always with the same safeguards: working in isolation, in the privacy of my home or my wife’s clinical office; lying down, protected from the outside world with no interruptions; a sitter present—my sitter for all this work was Carol, my first wife, a clinical psychologist; and a carefully curated playlist to support the deepening and unfolding of the work. The sessions were completely internally focused, sheltered from the outside world, with no interface except the music. The focus was on encountering, as deeply as possible, whatever was arising from within my consciousness.\n\nStephen Gray\nBefore we go further, a quick question about the sitter.

In our case, Carol was not particularly interested in exploring these domains herself. She read the literature with me—not ideal, perhaps, but it worked sufficiently well.\n\nThe sitter’s responsibility is to keep the subject safe so they don’t hurt themselves—some spasms can be quite violent—and to manage the practicalities, like vomiting at high doses. They help ensure the subject stays focused—discouraging any attempt to step outside the session—and manage the music, staying in touch so they can anticipate where the subject is and shift the music when the inner experience shifts.

The method is: enter temporary non-ordinary states; record them afterward as clearly and precisely as possible; and integrate them. Completing the circle of learning is crucial if you want to do this systematically. Attending to and trying to understand your experiences lays a strong foundation for the next set—like keeping a dream journal, which often deepens and clarifies dreams. It’s as if the unconscious knows you’re paying attention and ups its game. Likewise, the more attention you give to integration, the more the cosmic mind engages you.\n\nRetention is especially important if you’re pushing far boundaries and entering radically new territory with few cues in the literature.

Sometimes the undertaking is months; sometimes it’s years. The longer the engagement, the more important it is to set up carefully—have your kiva prepared inwardly and outwardly—so you have clean contact and good recall. That means not obscuring the field with outside distractions. Tripping can be life-changing, no criticism there, but for deep inner work you have to clarify the field.\n\nSecond, retention: hold on to your experiences—record them, clarify them—whether through art, music, or, for me, the written word.

We die, reconnect with soul in spirit, are born and get small, die and get large—on and on for thousands of years, touching our total consciousness mostly in the afterlife.\n\nBut eventually, all our former lives start coming in and hit critical mass. When they hit critical mass, there’s a massive explosion of energy; they fuse. When they fuse, an extraordinary diamond light broke out of my chest and catapulted me into a state of consciousness beyond anything I’d known. I was still an individual, but an individual beyond any previous frame of reference.

At that juncture I met the work of Stanislav Grof, and it changed the course of my life. Two books in particular—Realms of the Human Unconscious, which Stan had published two years earlier, and LSD Psychotherapy, his manual on conducting psychedelic sessions. I immediately saw not only the psychological significance of Stan’s work, but the philosophical significance—the possibility of exploring, experientially, deep states of consciousness that allow us to encounter the deep structure of the universe itself. That, I recognized, had profound philosophical implications.\n\nSo I split my life in half. During the day, I taught at the university—philosophy and religious studies, doing the things professors do.

High-dose psychedelic therapy was limited to three sessions, designed to trigger something approximating a near‑death experience for people facing death. After three introductory medium‑dose sessions, I chose to work in the high‑dose protocol. I eventually did a total of 73 high‑dose sessions, and I tried to be as systematic and rigorous as I could: same set and setting, same sitter, same substance, same dose level, same recording process, even the same location in northeast Ohio.

It took me a long time to understand, but eventually I saw that every deeper level of reality functions at a higher level of energy. When you break through to a deeper level, your entire psychophysical system has to be purified to handle the enormous flows of energy there. This repeated again and again: after a major breakthrough, the following session was always a “carrying out the garbage” session—deep cleansing. I began to dread the session after a breakthrough.

Over time, however, I entered a deep existential sadness. I came to realize I was suffering a withdrawal from intimate communion with the divine fabric. I eventually realized I was simply waiting to die so I could return to intimacy with the divine, to dissolve into the divine light again.

She has a master’s degree in organizational development from John F. Kennedy University, has spoken internationally, and has a TEDx talk on what the dying can teach the living. Teresa and Dr. David Jackson, an anesthesiologist, co-facilitate psychedelic psychotherapy sessions using ketamine and other psychoactive medicines. David uses his medical, scientific, and problem-solving background to work with clients to find the right medicine, and Teresa supports clients through the integration work. The goal is to make clients conscious of unconscious patterns that keep them in cycles of depression, anxiety, and addiction so they can experience personal transformation.

I consider Stan the primary intellectual figure I’ve engaged as I unfolded my account. Absolutely, one can enter these states without psychedelics.

One can move into these states without psychedelics, but we’re talking not just years or decades of work; we’re talking lifetimes of consistently pushing these boundaries.

It can evoke states equally strong to psychedelic states.

We’ve been evolving for thousands of years. Gestation is long and gradual; birth is short and cathartic.

I experience LSD as a “high-ceiling” psychedelic—it pushes the cosmological ceiling. Psilocybin tends to be more body-grounded and emotionally saturated, tuning to the physical and emotional bodies. It has a ceiling, but in my experience it’s a more embodied opening, rather than potentially disembodied or far-from-bodied openings.

There are disadvantages to long-acting substances, but also advantages: sustained contact with non-ordinary states can purify the mind doing the exploration. Short-acting psychedelics don’t give as large a window to be changed by the dimensions of consciousness you’re contacting. This was Rick Strassman’s observation with DMT: profound experiences, but less lasting personality change, likely due to the short window.\n\nI drilled an unusually deep borehole into the universe with LSD, but there’s so much I didn’t see that other substances reveal.

I had not been allowed to talk about this work publicly. As I wrote the book, I began to experience changes, and as I began to speak about it, those changes deepened. I found my sessions beginning to come together into larger aggregates, into a larger whole, as I began to own my sessions, to own my psychedelic history, to come out of the psychedelic closet.

Psychedelics amplify and catalyze consciousness—the unconscious rises into awareness. With lower doses, you tend to peel consciousness in layers, spending time working through psychodynamic material and then moving slowly into deeper levels. With high doses, there’s a more powerful cathartic thrust. You move quickly through psychodynamic levels and engage what Stan calls the perinatal level—at the boundary between physical and spiritual reality—and then push deeper into transpersonal, spiritual consciousness.\n\nNick Mather:\nOne more methodological question. It’s helpful to begin a session by stating an intention.

Some former lives are active in structuring the issues you’re dealing with now; others remain in the background.\n\nThe basic vision is that when we die, we expand into a larger state of consciousness—the soul, which I define as the consciousness that holds all our incarnation experience.

To their credit, the classic spiritual traditions have always said that once you understand reincarnation and karma—karma being the cycle of cause and effect that conditions consciousness and destiny—you can improve the quality of your choices whether or not you recall former lives. You naturally choose non-injury, generosity, and long-term thinking. We see this in Native American traditions—planning for seven generations. You begin to think not just how choices affect you, but how they affect others, recognizing that spiritually we’re like two leaves on the same branch: separate at one level, not separate at another. You make choices that serve the good of the tree. Doing so accelerates your evolutionary development and improves the outcome of this lifetime.

Embracing the suffering that presents itself—letting it into awareness—allows it to move to a better outcome. The system relaxes, and you’re free to move into deeper levels of reality.\n\nEarly on, as consciousness expands beyond time-space, you may face ego death—the shattering of the identity formed in time-space. It’s painful, an inversion of everything you’ve known yourself to be, but in surrender, consciousness is liberated into deeper textures of mind. If you continue, you cycle through further purifications and deeper deaths, each followed by entry into deeper dimensions of reality, always working a particular edge.", "char_len": 1194, "token_est": 298, "hash": "11b37f"}

In my chapter “The Ocean of Suffering,” after ego death and going deeper, I was drawn into vast fields of human suffering—terrible anger, torture, pain. It continued for two years. At first I thought it was refining my ego death, but eventually I realized it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation. It was aimed at transforming my entire human family. In these sessions, consciousness had expanded far beyond “Chris Bache.” It was as if I were the species, remembering and reliving the species’ pain. By letting humanity’s suffering enter full awareness, a transformation takes place that registers in the individual, but also—this is my hypothesis—registers in the species as a whole.

From then on I was operating beyond the collective psyche—first exploring archetypal reality for about a year and a half, then, after another death and rebirth, what some call causal reality, the oneness out of which diversity arises. You can dissolve into that oneness and experience all reality functioning as an undivided whole. Later there were further deaths and rebirths into levels beyond causal reality.\n\nIn the book’s opening chapter, I flag a primary concern for readers: the sheer quantity of suffering described. It isn’t because I’m a sadomasochist. Like anyone, I’d prefer to avoid suffering. But suffering is part of a purification cycle.

They venerate states such as dreams, hypnosis, trance, and states induced by meditation, contemplation, yoga, and asceticism. Anthropologists call these cultures polyphasic, meaning they draw their understanding of reality from many phases of consciousness.

That extraordinary book turned my life around. In one reading he convinced me that LSD—or psychedelics—could be used safely, with proper precautions, to explore the deep structure of consciousness.

If I were doing it again, I’d work with lower doses and with psilocybin—gentler substances. LSD in this quantity, when contained and intensified in a therapeutic modality, shatters your consciousness far beyond physical limits. You spend hours dissolved into some stratum of the universe, then you congeal and consolidate—then shatter again, leaving your historical existence radically behind, dissolving into another stratum. You live there for a while—it lives you, as part of it.

It’s recognized across the world’s spiritual traditions as a profound psycho-spiritual birth experience and deliberately sought in traditions such as shamanism. You describe it in a radically expanded way—as a repetitive process of dying to one identity and limitation after another, reconstituting a new, more porous, expanded identity, and then having to offer that into the whole.\n\nLet me check my understanding against yours. It seems what dies is what we confuse ourselves to be—our self-representation. We mistake a self-image or concept or narrative for our true self. What needs to die is that representation.

Am I understanding you correctly?\n\nChris Bache:\nI think your description of ego death is spot on. What dies—what is consumed—is our self-representation, our sense of identity amassed from our physical, time-space experience. And every medicine has a certain range, a signature and power. Psilocybin has a depth that, even if you repeat it many times and it takes you into the upper register, still has an upper register. Ayahuasca has a range—maybe a deeper upper register.

It stretches but does not shatter as aggressively as LSD the parameters of individual identity—though it can dissolve and soften them, and open things up. In my work with high doses of LSD, all of these things happen, but because of the particular intensity of the substance and its lack of anthropological history—therefore lacking the fields associated with psilocybin and mescaline/peyote—it tends to shatter our time-space identity and throw us into a level of experience beyond that reality, into a spiritual reality. If we go back to that place again and again, our experience there begins to congeal, and we develop an alternative identity persona.

Eventually, once you’ve died so many times, death becomes a meaningless concept because you always learn you’re going to be reborn. Some essence of identity continues. The Phoenix always rises. The concept of death, as an interpretation of what’s happening, yielded to a concept of purification. I learned that all dying is, in fact, purification.

So what doesn’t die?\n\nChris Bache:\nWhen we go deep, we realize that everything is dying and living, dying and living, constantly. There are no stable things which are not dying in this universe. To see that clearly is considered a great accomplishment—to really understand that everything is temporary, transitional, moving, fluid. People have asked me, “What is it that dies?” What I will say is there is always continuity of memory. If you organize your session well, there is continuity of recall; therefore there is continuity of memory. You might say that memory doesn’t die, but I don’t think that’s the best way to describe it.

Many traditions, including Vedanta, basically believe that the individual is an illusion and the goal is to shatter the illusion and dissolve irretrievably into the oneness of all existence.

Sooner or later, we reach a point where all of our former lives—the history, experiences, wisdom, and mistakes—come together into an integrated singularity. When that happened in my sessions, I was catapulted into a state of awareness beyond anything I’d experienced up to that point. I was an individual in pure Shunyata—emptiness—transparent, open to all existence. Individual within a boundless existence, with my full memory intact.

Is that how you’d distinguish it from separation, where there is a forgetting of the connection to the greater whole?\n\nChris Bache:\nYeah. When Buddhism teaches Shunyata and when it teaches anata—no self—it’s defining a type of self-experience where we experience ourselves cut off from other selves and from the universe itself. When that self dies, one experiences an individuality that is porous to others. We live in compassion.

When we’re born, we contract into a small ego. When we die, we return to the soul that holds all our memories, not fragmented but integrated as a single being. If we keep this up, sooner or later the soul awakens inside human incarnation. I think that’s the being being born in this historical crisis.

Many people have written to say I clarified their experiences—“Here’s what I experienced around this topic.” Many have written, “I’ve never touched psychedelics in my life, but I’ve had experiences completely in alignment with yours. Let me explain mine.” Clearly this is a large pattern emerging within the collective psyche.

But what the universe seems to have promised is that when I die, I will return to that condition. There’s nothing I need to do between now and my death to return to it.

And you emphasized again that awakenings aren’t the end point; beyond them is integration—allowing the realization to incarnate through us. You pointed to diamond vision and its resonance with Tibetan Buddhism. Interestingly, Tibetan Buddhism speaks of a further stage—pure perception—where one’s perception is transformed so that this world is seen not as mundane materiality but as an expression of that diamond illumination, a pure land optimized for awakening.

As those shadows lighten, we get clearer and more relaxed, and the genius of our being shows itself more easily and strongly.\n\nThe wonderful discovery is that there is ultimately no membrane between our individual existence and the existence of the universe. We drop right through. The awareness bubbling up inside our individual life and the awareness growing around us—in our neighbors, each other, the planet—is the same life, not a separate life. Then we can relate to the beauty of the universe and own it as a reflection of our beauty.

By a collective thought form, I mean that when millions of devotees for thousands of years meditate, pray, and offer devotion to a named form—enshrined in scripture, art, and statuary—they generate a robust structure in the collective psyche. I do not minimize these forms; they are extraordinarily powerful.

With a brief introduction, we’re going to launch into what I believe will be a revelatory, provocative conversation. Chris, PhD, is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Medical Studies, an emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory board of Grof Legacy Training. Chris’s passion has been the study of the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. An award-winning teacher and international speaker, he has written four books: Life Cycles, a study of reincarnation in light of contemporary consciousness research; Dark Night, Early Dawn, a pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness; The Living Classroom, an exploration of collective fields of consciousness and teaching; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe, the story of his 20-year journey with LSD.

First, thank you, my dear friend, for taking time out of your busy schedule to talk with us. I’ve been looking forward to this one for a while. Just a few preparatory comments before we launch in. I’ve read a fair amount over the years—I love to devour books—and I have to say, I have never read anything like your last book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe. Out of all your books, this is the one I want to focus on, because it stretched my mind open and challenged me; it created both tremendous resonance with my own path and also some dissonance. That’s a great way to make modern music, right? Maybe we can create a symphony of sanity with some questions—of which there is no shortage. One preparatory comment: the eco-philosopher Timothy Morton talks about “hyperobjects,” like climate change—things so enormous they defy description and bend the mind. It’s no exaggeration that your book and your journey are a hyperobject to me. To give our listeners a rough idea of what we’re going to be talking about, perhaps give us a long elevator pitch. Okay, we have a thousand floors to ascend, right?

Psychedelics represent a major transition—a true historical before-and-after point—with respect to philosophy, not just psychology. They generate not only a new therapeutic protocol for healing the personal psyche, but, literally, a new way of doing philosophy. It’s not really new; it goes back to the Eleusinian mysteries and the Ayahuasca traditions in Brazil. I got involved right out of graduate school. I had just finished my PhD from Brown University and went to work in Ohio at Youngstown State. I was looking for where to continue my research. I was a deeply convinced agnostic at the time and encountered realms of the human unconscious in Stan Grof’s first book, quickly followed by his methodology book, LSD Psychotherapy. This was 1978 when I began graduate school, and I saw the significance of his work for philosophy, for my tradition—philosophy of religion.

I ended up working with high doses of LSD for reasons I describe in the book. It’s a very aggressive protocol; it’s not one I would recommend today at the end of the journey. I did 73 high-dose LSD sessions. Each session was completely isolated. I was separated from the world, in what I call the psychedelic kiva—a very protected environment—lying down with a sitter.

As a philosophical method, the psychedelic method involves systematically expanding the boundaries of one’s consciousness. Psychedelics in general, and LSD in particular, are amplifiers of consciousness. They don’t give you specific experiences; they make you hypersensitive for a number of hours. How you use that hypersensitivity influences what emerges over time. If you go to a concert or sit and chat with friends, you’ll have a certain level of experience. But if you approach these hours in a contemplative manner—totally internalized, isolating yourself from the world—a journey begins. It has many levels. A hypersensitive mind throws up all the fears, the things we’re ashamed of, unhappy about. Those early confrontations lead to healing. If you keep going, it goes deeper and deeper.

Briefly, why music? What was its role, and how did it help you? How did you choose it?\nChris Bache\nThere’s early research on how music influences psychedelic sessions; I reference those sources in my work. Basically, music creates a field and ambiance that supports letting go of your current physical reality—relaxing and yielding to the uprushing material from the unconscious. There are about five stages in a psychedelic session as the energy builds, peaks, and comes down. It’s eight hours of the day, and you choose music to support each stage: aggressive, long chordal sequences with powerful crescendos in the early stages; long, expansive passages in the middle; gradually tapering off into quieter and quieter music at the end. After only a year or so, I stopped using classical music, which is more commonly used. I shifted to indigenous music because I found it more powerfully evocative. It helped me let go of my conventional reality and enter unusual reality.", "char_len": 988, "token_est": 247, "hash": "1e7f63"}

It helped me let go of my conventional reality and enter unusual reality.\nAndrew Holecek\nThat’s really interesting, Chris, because in the inner yogas of tantric Buddhism—which I know you’re a student of—the subtle body is literally in resonance with sound. When we’re touched by music, it’s the subtle body that’s touched. I appreciated your frequent allusions to Jung and, implicitly, to individuation—bringing unconscious processes into the light of conscious awareness as a vector of awakening. The subtle body is also connected to the unconscious mind. So when you work with this kind of music, it’s almost as if you’re creating an invitational harmonic in external auditory mediums that evokes correlative inner qualities, helping bring these processes into the light of consciousness. Is it fair to say that?\n\nChris Bache\nI think that’s fair. The subtle body is very actively involved in the psychedelic process. When you open into deeper states of consciousness, deeper states are higher levels of energy. It places enormous demands on your physical body, particularly the subtle energy body. You’re moving into highly stimulated states that are not only psychologically stimulating but energetically and physically stimulating.", "char_len": 1262, "token_est": 315, "hash": "cb21ad"}

If you increase your sensitivity to samsara, it can take you on a journey that just distracts you and leads you into more samsara. But if you use this opportunity in a true contemplative fashion to look deeply at the samsara that’s there, it will fall apart when you take the samsaric tendencies to their roots.

The second is what got me started, like many people in the late ’70s. But very quickly that agenda fell away in my practice, partly because of the powerful protocol I adopted. Personal enlightenment wasn’t the primary modality. Collective awakening became very important—working on behalf of the human family. The bodhisattva vow came through strongly. Eventually my work settled into cosmological exploration: a long journey into what I think of as the consciousness of the universe, the creative intelligence behind and within the universe. You don’t need to explore those deep pathways to awaken spiritually; you don’t need to go into archetypal reality or back to the birth of the universe to awaken to your essential nature. So I wanted to differentiate cosmological exploration from the project of spiritual awakening.

Is it the mind that’s in the universe or the universe that’s in the mind? What exactly is the relationship between the individual and the cosmic? Part of my potential dissonance is a subtle cosmological dualism, intimating a difference between the individual and the cosmic, a sense of separation implied there. Help me tease that apart.

In the Buddhist tradition, a central teaching is emptiness and non-theism. How do you reconcile non-theism and emptiness with what you’re talking about?

It’s an anti-theism in the sense that it critiques every theism proposed as structurally flawed. In its place, Buddhism proposes a pure process understanding of reality: everything is dynamic, constantly changing, fluid, in process. There is no thing that holds existence by itself; you only exist in the interplay of the whole ocean of causality—karmic forces, cosmic down to species down to individual. It’s all an open system.

One is what you talk about so beautifully in your book. I haven’t read Living Classroom yet, but I just got it in the mail.

You’re learning by becoming—what a fantastic thing to say. It resonates with both the Hindu and Buddhist traditions through what I call a Gnostic pedagogical arc: hearing, contemplating, meditating—ingest, digest, metabolize—until the teachings are purified, filtered from conceptual defilements into full somatic empowerment and embodiment.

In rejecting anything static and anything in form—in its agnosticism and anti-theism—all of that is well and good. But he says we have to come to terms with the magnitude and genius and majesty of the universe of which we are a part.

I’ll take the freedom from suffering and I’m not going to engage in metaphysical speculation.” Aurobindo’s response is: it’s not an either/or.

We’ve circumambulated it but haven’t directly addressed it: fear and the place of integration versus disintegration. Did you ever fear for your sanity, especially coming back to the so-called real world? I’ve come to see psychedelics as a type of Tantra—this has been a radical change from my more conservative, traditionalist nature. There’s tremendous genius in tradition, but there are near enemies—ossification, redefining the tradition, losing tributaries of new information. I used to be disdainful of psychedelic approaches as chemical mysticism—cheap fixes. I’ve changed my tune. In Tantra, body is as important as mind; here we’re talking very subtle body—chemical body, neurochemistry. Within psychedelics as practice and path, it can fit an expanded rubric of Tantra, where chemistry is as important as the mind it evokes, in a kind of neuro-phenomenological way—using the neuro end to bring about phenomenal states.

He eventually wrote a book concluding that this stuff is real, differentiating between the local event and the transcendent event. When someone is in surgery or has a cardiac arrest, they may experience leaving their body and accurately perceive what’s happening in the surgical theater, the waiting room, the hospital, even the parking lot. Then they go into the light, leaving physical reality for a transcendental reality. He said we can’t evaluate the transcendent experience directly, but we can evaluate the accuracy of the local one. He provided evidence that the local perceptions could be verified. That doesn’t prove the transcendent is true, but it boosts its credibility.

That’s why psychedelics were called “mind opening.” Later, at a more advanced stage—what Stan would call causal-level reality—everything reversed. I found myself in very large, high-energy states of consciousness, but instead of going “out,” everything converged back to right here, right now. My sessions became harder to describe because they were taking place inside ordinary reality. I wasn’t being taken outside; everything was converging. I began to think, have we misclassified these substances? They’re not mind openers; they’re mind concentrators.", "char_len": 861, "token_est": 215, "hash": "fd1cca"}

I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality.

This consciousness did not take concrete or personified form. Its qualities changed the deeper I went. I came to understand that the consciousness we enter into communion with in psychedelic states is infinite—capable of generating many kinds of awareness within us. Our mind acts as a seed catalyst, a seed crystal, that draws forth particular experiences from this infinite field.\n\nCHRIS BACHE: If you do this repeatedly, integrate what arises, and undergo the necessary purification, your consciousness changes. The consciousness you bring into the next encounter is different, so it catalyzes deeper experiences from the same infinite potential. What we meet as a guiding intelligence—this massive intelligence encountered at different levels—arises at the intersection of our individual mind and the universal mind. As you change, that intersection changes. In my sessions the guidance was always palpable yet invisible. It seldom adopted form, because forms would change as the journey deepened.

Colin, over to you.\nColin Campbell:\nThanks, Rachel. Good evening, everyone. It was about a year ago, relatively recently, that I stumbled upon the title Dark Night, Early Dawn, and I was particularly struck by the subtitle, Steps Towards a New Ecology of Mind. That rang massively for me, and I simply had to get hold of the book and read it. This is a huge passion of mine, in the sense that what we are in search of in these times—and amid the conundrums and transformations we’re up against, in crisis and other terms as a human collective—is a redo of what we conceive of as our relationship with existence, with life, with the rest of the natural world.

Of course, the primary way of exploring into it is to delve deeply into what it means to be human.

I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.\n\nSo in 1979, I began what became a 20-year journey working with LSD. That’s what Stan had done his research with, and that’s what I chose to continue with. If I were doing it today, I’d have a more diversified cocktail of ayahuasca, civil side, and more. But I worked with LSD, and I chose to work with very high doses for reasons too complicated to go into now.

As we internalize those experiences and are purified by them, the seed mind changes, and then it catalyzes an even deeper level of secrets from the universe.

The cosmology that emerged in my work is very different. It wasn’t about transcendence for its own sake; it was transcendence in service of incarnation, in service of deeper integration. It was about opening up and letting in as much of the universe as possible, then undergoing the transformations that allow this energy to live in the historical body.

Parenting is a big part of this transition—so are art, medicine, knowledge, communication, technology. We’re working it as we go.\n\nRachel Fleming\nThank you, Chris. We’ve gone over time, but I’d love to keep going a little longer. Here’s a question: what I thought I heard you say is that our task is to tune in to who we really are in this lifetime and live that—and that’s the best we can do. My first impulse was to ask what ritual or task would accelerate the process, but it sounds like it’s not about that; it’s about living what we dreamt in for this lifetime.

He proposes that every lesson, deed, and mistake we accumulate is both carried forward by the enduring soul and simultaneously encoded into humanity’s collective psyche, or “species mind.” Because the species itself possesses an integrating consciousness, individual experiences—writings, conversations, insights—are never lost; they become “hard-wired” into a vast Akashic-like network that preserves and evolves collective knowledge. Bache argues that understanding this process requires a quantum rather than atomistic perspective: bodies come and go, but souls and species fields persist. He concludes that many possible continuations exist for these informational fields once we are no longer physically present.\n\n---\n\nCHRIS BACHE:", "char_len": 1273, "token_est": 318, "hash": "c7ea06"}

I want to introduce a topic very near and dear to my heart—so much so that I’m writing one book on it, and probably two. We pinged on this a bit in our first session, but I want to explore it in more detail now. Using your languaging, this narrative of openness and contraction has become, for me, the combustion cycle of the spiritual path. I thought we could start there as a way to reiterate the entirety of your journey within this session—start with that narrative and expand into deeper dimensions, as your twenty-year journey and its aftermath took you. I love these terms in a somatic sense, because openness and contraction are things we can feel, not just cerebral storylines. I’d like to dive into that with you as we set our direction toward what I consider to be the climax of your book—the Diamond Luminosity. Because that light is so bright, that space so open, perhaps we can dilate the aperture more slowly and start by asking how your journey could be articulated in this pulsation. The Hindus talk about it as spanda, the doctrine of vibration—openness, contraction, openness, contraction. Maybe we could start there and let it lead us into wider and wider degrees of openness.", "char_len": 1610, "token_est": 402, "hash": "e27a79"}

In my understanding and experience, psychedelics in general, and LSD in particular—my primary medicine—are amplifiers of consciousness. When consciousness is amplified, signals that are quiet get loud, and you become aware of more and more. How you meet that increase of awareness—how you engage what emerges—is seminal. If you engage the shadow consciously, you confront the things that keep you habitually contracted and small. You take those fears, or whatever they are, to their source. They resolve themselves, and when they do, your consciousness is free to open into more spacious places. Every time you let go of something that holds your consciousness in a fixed pattern—particularly your time-space identity, your historical egoic identity that tells you who you are—you discover dimensions beyond that identity that are even more truly what you are.", "char_len": 1011, "token_est": 252, "hash": "73d907"}

There’s a deeper sense of humanity that holds the limits of your knowing, and then you go deeper still. You let go of time-space identity and your entire existence, including reincarnational experiences of time and space as a framework. Your experience flows beyond time and space—and this is an entirely natural process. My broader conjecture is that a psychedelic session accelerates and intensifies what is taking place in nature all the time. When we are born, our consciousness contracts into an individual, egoic, time-space identity. When we die, we expand—back into the soul, into deeper spiritual awareness. Birth is contraction; death is expansion. A session accelerates and intensifies that natural process, allowing you to burn off more karma than one might otherwise.

Etymologically, the Buddha is usually translated as the awakened one, but I’ve also heard the opened one. That resonates because, by contrast, we’re the contracted ones. Bringing this process and its phenomenology into the light of conscious awareness helps us sensitize to it somatically. This is something we can feel in our very soma.\n\nTwo questions, Chris. First, how early in your journey did this become apparent? Where did this narrative become identifiable for you, and how did it help as you went further? Second, as you suggested at the outset, we’re practicing this whether we know it or not. We’re either habituating to openness, or—by default—we’re practicing contraction every time we capitulate to grasping, beliefs, a solid self-sense.

I hit an experience where I couldn’t remember anything about myself—who I was, what I did for a living, whether I was a man or a woman. I was absolutely jammed. I looked in a thousand mirrors and couldn’t find any piece of individual egoic identity. It was jarring—frightening in the beginning—and later in the session my sense of identity returned. That experience was really important. It gave me an insight into the dynamic. It shook me up and showed me the true cost, because I had read about ego death and thought, “Oh good, let’s do it,” without appreciating that this is a true death—a loss of your identity. It taught me the art of letting go and surrender, because if you can’t control your self-identity—and that’s as basic as it gets—then later, when the ante kept increasing, I knew the key to navigating whatever was coming was to surrender and let go, not to hold on to something familiar.", "char_len": 1063, "token_est": 265, "hash": "2339be"}

About two and a half years later, my individual egoic identity was turned inside out and crushed. I went through a collapse of that smaller state and a rebirth into a deeper state.

You arrive at the present, and then it “blows up,” so to speak, into the fourth moment, which transcends even the present moment.

Truly. In practice, you’re always looking for your best friend. I want to qualify this with the unusual scope of my work. The hardest strip-down I went through in any session—the most extreme destruction—was in the 70th session, the last major vision I was given. Earlier, I had gone through so many deaths and they do get easier; you look forward to them and embrace them. Yet beside that, there was this phenomenon where the transition was not easy. I didn’t resist it; I gave into it, but it was extremely radical. The consciousness guiding my session was taking me into a state deeper into deep time than ever before, giving me a culminating series of teachings that required an unusually large canvas. It had nothing to do with personal enlightenment or personal ego death. We always have to contextualize our observations in terms of the level of consciousness we’re working with.

I love your language of returning to the Beloved. If we know we’re going to the embrace of the Beloved—the cosmic mother—that changes everything.

I capitulated to my habit patterns—oh, crap, there it was again. Then stepping away, I said, “Oh my gosh, that was Padmasambhava teaching me patience.” Coming out of my three-year retreat, my aspiration is lifetime retreat with the view that the annoying (that’s my projection) aspects of reality are my path. There’s tremendous power in tradition, but also colossal enemies—like thinking we can only practice when conditions are right.

I want to return to the Light.” I’m wondering how we can play with that alongside decimating the notion of path itself. Is “return” a provisional description, and a more absolute approach would be recognition and self-liberation? That is, you don’t need to return to anything—the issue is removing the cataracts of confusion, opening the aperture of heart and mind, and the Light, the Mother, is right here now. Does that speak to you when you reference longing to return to the Mother, the Beloved, the Clear Light? That denotes a subtle dualism—“I have to return”—versus “No, I just recognize.”\n\nChris Bache\nAbsolutely. That’s a fair observation.

You’re a philosopher, and it’s interesting: things become “philosophy” because they haven’t become direct experience yet—hence the slight pejorative. What you’re sharing is quite something. I want to discuss—not challenge—this. Educate me. I’m completely admissive of my frameworks. Unless I sit here in silence—I love the line “Silence is the language of God; all else is poor translation”—I don’t have a choice, and I’m a poor translator doing my best.\n\nSomething that rubs me—productively, like the sand that creates the pearl—is your distinction between the individual and the cosmic. Take Advaita Vedanta, or in Buddhism, Cittamatra/Yogachara: the world is heart-mind-spirit. What you’re saying seems to intimate a separation: cosmological versus individual. How do you reconcile that with oneness? On one level I hear monism, but now a dual-aspect monism. I don’t want to drag this into philosophy, but I do want to understand so I’m not left merely with a wonderful transmission from your experience.

All of our spiritual practice, all of our actions, radiate and touch the consciousness of the beings around us. Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world. We are never isolated from those around us. It may be invisible or subtle, but it’s always there. The more we act on that basis, the more we activate the sinews that bind us to life. This is true not just for human beings—it’s true for all life forms that surround us.

Can you speak to that distinction?\nChris Bache:\nI became more articulate about this as the journey went on and especially when I wrote it up. Many readers tried to understand my work within frameworks that were too small. I now differentiate three projects you can do with psychedelics. There are others, of course, but three here:\nTherapeutic healing: the primary work of the psychedelic renaissance—healing wounds of the personal unconscious: PTSD, death anxiety, depression, alcohol addiction. This is personal-level work.\nSpiritual awakening: awakening to the truth of one’s inner being—to have experiential access to the center of consciousness, which turns out to be the same unified reality as the entire field of consciousness underlying existence. This is different from therapeutic healing; it’s spiritual healing and awakening.\nCosmological exploration: not simply becoming aware of spiritual truths, but exploring beyond them into the deep structure of existence—beyond space and time, into deep time, deep space, archetypal reality. You don’t have to go into these dimensions to wake up or become fully realized. You don’t have to go to the beginning of the universe before the Big Bang and watch creation emerge out of the great void. That’s a different agenda, and it’s important to keep apples and oranges separate.

It’s the interface between the limits of physical consciousness and the beginning of spiritual consciousness. Typically, people relive their own birth and their fear of death. Birth and death are the revolving door of life—we get here by being born and leave time and space by dying. In order for consciousness to expand beyond time-space reality, one has to confront all the conditioning that tells us we are a time-space self: “I am my egoic physical body-mind.” Many of us believe nothing happens when we die. We have fears and anxieties surrounding death, and in confronting these perinatal dynamics, one engages those fears—that the universe is ultimately meaningless, that it destroys our attempts to do something of enduring value.

The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa.

I don’t find either camp satisfying.\n\nTo me, one of the themes that has come through repeatedly in my work is that we do have free will.

I don’t have details of when, where, or how—it wasn’t that kind of experience. It was the fact of a profound global systems crisis that would break through deep layers of conditioning in the human heart, tearing away self-centered behaviors not only of individuals but of culture.

I had known light many times. “Diamond Luminosity” is not just a fancy metaphor.

We can have COEX systems around anger, fear, unrequited love. It’s like taking a novel, highlighting all the emotions in different colors, cutting up the novel, and putting all the green in one pile, all the yellow in another, all the red in another. When we encounter a problem in the psyche, we don’t encounter one instance of it; we encounter a cluster of experiences that date back sometimes to our birth and sometimes to former lives.

Honestly, don’t do it the way I did it. I get lots of letters from people who’ve never done psychedelics but know what I’m speaking about through decades of meditation. Psychedelics are not unique in opening these experiences. My recommendation: go slow. Always work within a therapeutic modality. Pay a lot of attention to set and setting—not only on the day of sessions, but because when you do this work, everyone around you is impacted: family, friends. I found my students were being drawn into my psychedelic practice.

It's by demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of these amplifying substances that we are opening the door to these substances in our culture—by demonstrating that they help us deal with post-traumatic stress, depression, alcohol addiction, and death anxiety; by healing us of the wounds of life. We are demonstrating that these substances have therapeutic value and efficacy.

Now, there is a resistance to these deeper dimensions right now because of our metaphysical commitment to materialism. Our, of course, pre-quantum commitment is to believe that only things which are physical are real. Therefore, when someone is having an experience of something which goes beyond physical reality, we call the substances that open up these experiences hallucinogens, because a hallucination is something which is not real. It feels real, but it's not real. But I think, when better understood, these substances are mind amplifiers. They are psychedelics—mind openers.

They can do so safely. There is backup, but they can do it with a nonclinical or nonmedical set of expectations.

In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.\n\nIn LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves.

It raises many questions we won’t get to—about the reality of these experiences and how this path compares to other spiritual paths. But the radical nature is inescapable. I believe psychedelics represent a genuine turning point in philosophy, a true before-and-after advance. They give us more than new insights into consciousness and more than a new therapeutic method for healing the wounds of the personal psyche. Critically used, psychedelics give us a new philosophical method with two parts: first, immersing ourselves into temporary states of hyper-aroused consciousness; second, stepping back and critically analyzing our experiences there. By moving back and forth between non-ordinary and ordinary states of consciousness, we can gather and distill new insights into the structure of reality.\n\nOf course, this method is not really new. It was present in the Eleusinian Mysteries of ancient Greece and in the ayahuasca ceremonies of Brazil that date back a thousand years.

In psycholytic therapy, the mind is peeled away layer by layer, uncovering our shadow and taking us deeper into the unconscious. In psychedelic therapy, a very different protocol developed at Spring Grove Hospital was limited to three sessions and designed to trigger near-death-type experiences among patients who were terminally ill. I thought, if you could use this therapy safely three times, you could use it safely more than three times. During the years I was doing this work, I saw myself as undertaking an extended course of psychedelic therapy. But when I came to the end and looked back, I appreciated how radical this undertaking had been.

The personal is the least important in my experiences.

Second, spiritual awakening—to cultivate that radical, transparent condition in which we stand completely conscious, naked, and receptive to the ever-changing field of experience. Third, cosmological exploration. These are distinct, if mutually reinforcing, undertakings. How you use psychedelics—dose levels, circumstances, set and setting—is different in each, and it’s important not to judge one project by criteria relevant to another.\n\nAt very high doses of LSD, one goes through a series of death-rebirth experiences. The first takes place at the interface of our time-space consciousness and the beginnings of spiritual consciousness—usually referred to as ego death, the complete destruction of our personal time-space identity and the opening into spiritual reality.

One does not simply enter spiritual reality and pluck experiences like apples from a tree. Drawing on Jorge Farrah’s insights in his book Revisiting Transpersonal Theory, I hold that all psychedelic experience is participatory. Our being evokes, in complex ways, the portion of the universe we encounter. Our mind acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes certain experiences from the cosmic mind’s infinite potential. As we are gradually purified and transformed, still deeper experiences are evoked.

In my ego death, I was forced to become the exact opposite of everything I had ever known myself to be.

This lasted one and a half years and 11 sessions. It immediately and consistently felt more real than physical reality. When I first entered archetypal reality, my identity as a human being began to fall away. I learned that we have a sense of species identity more basic than our individual identity, and surrendering this species identity represented a deeper death than ego death. To die out of human consciousness was to begin to exist in a domain completely beyond the human species field.

It is the pure light from which the universe arises and returns. It is Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. In between these four immersions, there were many intense episodes of cleansing and personal healing. In general, there were two movements during this four-year period: first, going deeper into Diamond Luminosity; then Diamond Luminosity began to crunch itself more deeply into my physical body. The turning point for this was Session 50. I only began to understand what was happening after the fact. I had no control over what was happening in the sessions; I went along with wherever the universe was taking me and only figured out afterward what had taken place. In Session 50, I was as deep into the universe as I ever went. I was in the clearest, most sublime state of Diamond Luminosity I had ever known. Then everything in my visual field pivoted 90 degrees, and I saw a reality far into the distance that looked like luminous galaxies. A ray of light from that reality hit me, and it absolutely shattered me. I call it the absolute light, just to give it a name.

In this chapter, I summarize bits and pieces of experiences and visions that actually go back to the initiation into the universe material and run through Session 55. I extract pieces from Sessions 23 to 47 and gather them in what I call the visions of awakening—six themes concerning humanity’s future that showed themselves over and over: divine love for all humanity; that the universe is trying to awaken all humanity; that this is being enacted by guiding intelligence shaping our evolutionary process; seeing our species as a single being—that the awakening is not simply individuals awakening, but our entire species going through an awakening; the theme of collective purification, again through the dynamics of reincarnation; and finally, the experience of the future human—being given the grace of experiencing the future human that is being born in history.", "char_len": 1409, "token_est": 352, "hash": "b6da2f"}

The vision was a period of profound spiritual awakening, a shift in the fundamental architecture of the collective psyche that will change the foundation of human existence on this planet. But it had not shown me how. Then in Session 55, right in the middle of the Diamond Luminosity sessions, I was taken deep into deep time and given an experience of the death and rebirth of humanity. For there to be a great awakening in our collective human heart, there must first take place a great death. We must be emptied of the old before the new can fully emerge. I believe the 21st century will be such a time. It will begin the dark night of our collective soul—a time of emptying, of intense anguish, loss of control, breakdown; a collective purification unto death that will last generations. But through this hard labor we will give birth to something extraordinary, more than just a new civilization. What is emerging is nothing less than a new order of human being. Through the global systems crisis, our planet is giving birth to the future human. When I first described these themes in Dark Night, Early Dawn, it sounds appropriate for the times we’re living in now, but these visions took place in the early 1990s.

There’s probably not time here to discuss these mechanisms, though I think they’re important. They have to do with the unified field—that the collective species mind underlies all of our individual experiences—and with the perception that the enormous suffering generated by a global ecological crisis leading to a global systems crisis will impact not just individuals, but will stimulate the collective psyche so deeply it will shift the collective psyche into what we would call nonlinear conditions.

I had been given so many blessings on this journey that I thought I could simply step away and spend the rest of my life digesting these treasures. But in the years following my sessions, I began to experience a deep existential sadness. I had been taken so deep into the divine expanse so many times that I was suffering from a loss of communion with the divine. Once you have known the joy of becoming light, once you have experienced the ecstasy of dissolving into the crystalline body of God, life on Earth can begin to feel dried up. I found that I no longer wanted to be here. This is similar to what some people who have near-death episodes experience when they return—plunged into the divine light, filled with overwhelming love, then suddenly back on Earth with all the limitations of earthly experience. It’s hard to make that transition. I knew I was every moment immersed in the body of the Divine. I knew she was the root and flower of my existence.

One of the main questions raised by what you’ve been talking about is whether these experiences give us access to the deep structure—or deeper structures—of reality. My own sense is affirmative, and I find your articulation of ineffable experiences brings readers as close as one can get to a kind of ultimate knowing by identification. We’re clearly living in apocalyptic times at one level or another, and your theme of the birth of the future human has extraordinary resonance.

What do you mean by “universe” in your account?\nChris Bache\nYou’re absolutely right to press me on this. I struggle with language to describe these realities. I don’t like using the word “God”—it carries so much historical baggage and usually doesn’t mean what I mean. Sometimes I use “the divine,” but that can be a bit of a ruse because it comes back to the same issue. I collect images of galaxies and nebulas and play them in meditation because this is my divine; it’s what I’m orienting to. But what I’m referring to is not the outer body of the divine, though I was taken into exploring some of the body of the universe. I’m talking about the consciousness of the universe—the consciousness that has given birth to the universe. I’m just scraping the edges of it, touching pieces of it, and my experience is limited by what I can understand. I often wish I had degrees in astrophysics and quantum theory; this consciousness could have shown me so much more if my mind were tuned to that type of knowledge. What I would love is to have a hundred of our best scientists, artists, and social activists going into these states in a systematic fashion.

When I entered into archetypal reality and died as a human being—died to my species identity—my sessions took me outside the operational range of our collective psyche, beyond human experience and history. Moving beyond the collective psyche, everything associated with it fell away: our understandings and projections of God, the flotsam and jetsam of history. I moved into increasingly clear, contentless states of consciousness that are hard to describe. We should be careful with language: “universal mind” or “cosmic mind” are huge concepts. The only part of that mind I know is what it taught me. There was a consciousness that took me in, taught me, ground me up into dust, and took me deeper into itself. Even so, I was experiencing aspects—fractal manifestations—of its totality. My language peters out at that depth. In Diamond Luminosity, I had a clear perception of moving outside Samsara, outside the Bardo, into a reality even beyond archetypal reality.

I don’t sense that forgetting is a tragedy, a mistake, or an original sin. It seems part of the natural order: there is the greater and the lesser. When we come into the lesser, we forget—but then we remember. Everything is constantly changing and evolving. We’ve tended to freeze our level of evolutionary maturity and form judgments about how we got here and where we’re going. We have to let go of these fixated fragments. As Sri Aurobindo said, the human being is a transitional being. We are moving from what we were to what we are becoming. Life is changing. Planets are changing. Our species is changing. We are in movement. Why things are the way they are isn’t something we can answer on an absolute scale; we can only attempt an evolving answer—which requires expanding our time horizon enormously.

Spiritual awakening invites us to cleanse our consciousness and our system so we can abide more comfortably and consistently in a transparent condition—transparent to what Buddhists would call one’s essential nature or Buddha nature, and what other traditions would call one’s divine nature.

A long window gives the large field more time to interact with the small field and do the cleansing and purification needed for deep experiences of cosmic reality.

The story I was being initiated into was that humanity was coming to a turning point in its evolutionary development—a major transformative pivot that would change life on this planet. Over four years in the early to mid-1990s, I had a series of what I call the Visions of Awakening.

As mature adults, we look at the broader impact across society and through history of the choices we’re making. We can no longer afford to run this planet based on egoic consciousness. The culture we have created, the history we have lived, has been created by the ego. I know the ego gets a bad rap in spiritual traditions, but to me it’s an exquisitely beautiful structure of consciousness. It’s fundamentally isolated, though. It doesn’t really experience the deeper fabric of our connective tissue. We can no longer afford to have this planet run by human beings operating only at an egoic level of consciousness, because that inevitably creates push–pull—wars, upper classes and lower classes, those who have and those who don’t, the privileged and the unprivileged.

I pushed it so far and so hard that it became a life-defining project; there’s no need for it to be that for many people.

I often think the relationship of physical reality to spiritual reality can be modeled on an apple. Physical reality is the skin of the apple: the entire physical world and all its levels. If the apple grows—the universe expanding—the skin gets bigger. But the meat of the apple is spiritual reality.\n\nWe tend to think of psychedelics as mind-expanding and feel that the reality we’re entering is “bigger” than physical reality, which suggests spiritual reality is bigger. But going deeper changes that sense of expansion. If you go underneath physical reality, you enter a layer of spiritual reality; deeper still, another layer. You start driving toward the center of the apple.

I knew immediately this was critically important to my discipline, philosophy of religion. Stan outlined a methodology that allowed us to enter systematically and carefully into deep states of consciousness in which we could not only heal but also explore the deepest levels of mind—dropping into levels that go beyond the individual.\n\nAs a young philosopher, I thought this was a whole new philosophical method. So I began to do the work. Because it was illegal at the time, I made a choice I didn’t like: to divide myself in half. In my daytime job for the next 33 years, I was a professor of religious studies doing what professors do.

Is it the cosmos? Your personal psyche? What exactly are you experiencing?\nChris Bache\nA really important question. Can we trust what emerges in psychedelic states of awareness?\n\nI took my starting point from Stan’s observations, and from many other psychedelic therapists in the early years: psychedelics don’t give you an experience; they amplify your own consciousness. They are an amplifier and catalyst of the mind. If you use these hours of amplified awareness carefully—focusing inward—you begin a process of purification and confrontation with blocks and pains we’d rather not face. Your system spontaneously moves to eliminate those challenges, which are lodged in our history—sometimes just this lifetime, sometimes former lifetimes.\n\nIn the early stages, we can judge the legitimacy of what we’re experiencing because we’re activating memories from our lifetime. We can verify them; they have the texture of memory. When we confront the pains that arise, there’s a liberating, healing experience with demonstrable impacts on daily life afterward. That verification gives confidence that when one moves beyond the familiar domain of one’s immediate life, there is truth there as well, even though it’s coming from more foreign levels of consciousness.", "char_len": 1287, "token_est": 321, "hash": "749171"}

In the late years of my high-dose work, I would often end the music in the second half of the session and move into a meditative space. Basically, I followed the protocol laid out in early psychedelic research. The understanding isn’t that music gives you experiences, but that it supports the immersion of your unconscious into awareness.

These cycles of purification and then expansive insight and bliss appear in normal states of consciousness on a smaller scale. There’s a mirroring, almost fractal parallel between psychedelic states and real life. I’m interested in how you’ve used daily spiritual practice because I think continuity between daily practice and psychedelics is very important.

For me, reincarnation is a fact of existence—my first book was on reincarnation, and I consider the empirical evidence overwhelming at this point. We may not understand all the details, but there is continuity arcing through multiple lifetimes in a larger developmental process. We die and our consciousness expands into the soul territory; we incarnate and get small and focused; we die and get large; we incarnate and get small. Each incarnation, we choose a set of issues, a set of challenges. Sometimes we don’t do well; other times we do very well and move on. This rhythm shows itself within a single life and across multiple lives.\n\nAny spiritual practice, including psychedelic practice, accelerates this process. Reincarnation moves slowly and grinds finely.

Then we can understand the soul as dynamic—always changing, evolving through time, porous—yet retaining individuality. The universe is a learning environment. It learns at the species level and at the individual level. We learn, grow, remember, and acquire insights based on experience. That doesn’t mean we’re isolated or static; it means we are developing an individuality that is porous.\n\nSo I don’t think there’s any contradiction between affirming an emergent individuality in creation and the fundamental condition of Non-duality.

One leaf decides to explore the real nature of its being. It goes deep within, finds where it connects to the twig, then into the limb, the branch, the core of the tree—then explodes into awareness of what a tree is, and therefore what a leaf is. A leaf isn’t a separate, private part; it’s a living aspect of a much larger being.

I’m not making light of death or trivializing it, only affirming this deeper insight: everything we are survives the death of the body. At the end of every lifetime, we return to where we came from as a resting place. We are restored and refreshed, and then we return to the challenges of history. We don’t have to live through all the evolutionary future to know freedom from the fear of death. If there were one thing from my psychedelic experiences I wish I could give the world, it would be eliminating the fear of death. I am not only unafraid of dying—I’m looking forward to it, because death is homecoming. Always, death is homecoming.\n\nSimeon Mihaylov:\nDifferent spiritual traditions have said that in different ways.

Karim used to say, “I can either be good or I can be whole.” He had a tremendous respect for the dark side of the psyche—for evil. How do you see it? Do you see evil falling away as our egos fall away when we become this future human, or do you see a deeper logic to evil continuing, becoming integrated, and serving some higher purpose?\n\nChris Bache:\nI would begin by differentiating between darkness and evil. People often fuse them, but I think they’re different. Evil is a twisting of life—a process in which life has turned in upon itself and cut itself so deeply off from its source that it becomes twisted, cancerous, and needs to be healed.

As we embrace them, all those twisted, unintegrated, or injured aspects are brought back into healing and wholeness, and what emerges is a higher order of goodness.

And I think that’s what Ramakrishna meant when he said, “If you want to understand God, you must look suffering in the face.” Suffering doesn’t come from a second principle—an evil demiurge. It comes from the Divine; it is part of the Divine expression. We have to understand how life works. If we’re going to see the compassion in existence, we must be able to look very, very deep, because there is so much suffering.

I stopped my work in ’99 for several reasons, foremost because of the domain of Diamond Luminosity I had entered. In those last five years and 26 sessions, I entered this reality only four times. Between those entrances there were very intense purifications, healings, and catharses. But dissolving into the light made coming back too painful. I reached a point where I couldn’t bear returning to time-space. There was a sadness in coming back, and I knew I had to stop. I couldn’t take being separated from the universe—that deep intimacy—anymore. I also realized I was running enormous energy in my body; at a subtle level I was running too hot.

I was suffering from a loss of communion with the Divine, a loneliness with the Divine. I was basically just waiting to die—living my life, taking care of everybody, but in my heart waiting to return to my beloved. Years went on and it didn’t get better.

In my case, psychedelics. Pay very careful, critical attention to what happens; come back and record the experiences precisely within 24 hours; reflect on and integrate them; connect them with bodies of knowledge in other disciplines; and compare them with the experiences others are having in these states. By systematically expanding and contracting consciousness in this way—not just having interesting experiences, but intellectually digesting and internalizing them—we can begin to think about, understand, and talk about things that previously most human beings could not. Only the most sophisticated mystics in esoteric traditions had access to some of these domains. With psychedelics, handled responsibly and conscientiously, even a person of modest means can access these realities and begin to understand some of the workings of the universe revealed through these states.

Instead of picking an apple from a tree, I think of it like this: the mind of the cosmos is an infinite lake of potential, capable of giving us infinite varieties of experience. Our mind acts like a seed catalyst we drop into this infinite potential, catalyzing a certain response that reflects that seed. As we internalize the experiences, we undergo purification and transformation that changes our individual consciousness. Later, when we return to the lake, the seed we drop has been changed and it precipitates a different set of experiences out of its infinite potential. That’s a participatory cosmology. Our consciousness doesn’t dictate what emerges, but there is a complicated feedback process. The more we do this, the more new frontiers open far beyond anything we could imagine and even against many things we’ve been taught. Then comes the task of making sense of what we experienced.

One was this cosmic tour.\n\nI wish I had degrees in physics to better conceptualize what was shown, but over and over again, I was taken to see aspects of our cosmic reality and was overwhelmed by the genius, intelligence, and intentionality of it. I was taught a lot about reincarnation—patterns not just of individuals but of the dynamics of collective reincarnation. I was shown formation structures of galaxies.

To understand why human beings suffer, we need some understanding of what a human being is and, more importantly, what a human being is becoming. We are not finished as a species. We’re just beginning. We only developed sufficient consciousness to reach our minds down to the source of our own mind about 5,000 years ago.

Let me step back and put this in context. All the religions of the last 5,000 years—the Axial Age—came into existence when we first began to get beneath individual consciousness and tap into spiritual consciousness, the consciousness of the universe or the Divine. The religions of this era, both Western and Eastern, are examples of what I would call an up-and-out cosmology. I understand their intention: when you experientially touch your divine essence, it is so ecstatic and blissful—so much more satisfying than physical existence—that how could you not think you belong there more than here? So the theologies born in this period are theologies of return. They basically say we don’t belong on Earth; we belong in heaven.

This return doesn’t lead to an up-and-out exit; it leads to the divine wedding—the deeper infusion of the transcendent divine and the immanent divine. I think of the transcendent divine as white light and the immanent divine as green energy.

Do we experience what we experience merely personally, or do we experience the personal dimension while merged inside the greater actuality?

When we participate and cooperate with the challenges in our immediate life and find our way to the highest choices—the greatest good for the greatest number—we feed into a good outcome for the delivery of the future human, both in our lives and in the lives of our children, grandchildren, and future generations.\n\nAviv Shahar\nThank you for your commitment to the inquiry and for your generosity.

We have two and a half hours together—plenty of time—and you’ll see it will pass quickly. Tonight we’ll begin with a meditation to settle into the theme of this Wisdom Keepers gathering. Then we’ll look ahead to the next hour or hour and a half with Chris and Duane—two different angles, two different paradigms in a beautiful dance. What are the possibilities for creating a new mindset as humans, a mindset of the whole universe? Because it’s not only about technological evolution or world leaders. Yes, we can cut greenhouse gases, drive electric cars, plant more trees, and be kinder to our neighbors—that’s where the mindset starts. After an hour and a half with Chris and Duane, we’ll use the last 30 to 45 minutes to look ahead at creating more circles as a community, as a human family, to practice this new mindset. We’ll guide you step by step. Please sit comfortably and have a good evening.\n\nBefore we start, I’d like you to close your eyes and trust us as hosts. We’re good people with a good mission.

The head of the United Nations recently said humanity is on a “climate highway to hell.” And that’s just climate. We’re also on a path to extincting a huge proportion of plant and animal species—by the end of this century, it’s estimated a million species will be gone. We’re impoverishing the Earth. We’re in overshoot—far beyond the Earth’s resource base. It’s estimated the Earth can carry roughly 2 billion people into the far future; we have 8 billion now. If we take that to heart, we’re roughly 6 billion over carrying capacity.

This is a rite of passage. All the suffering and pain are part of what every adolescent goes through in their way. We don’t move into adulthood without the fire of initiation. Let’s accept that this is how evolution works—we’re being pushed out of the nest of comfort into a transforming future. It’s extraordinary. Without some sense of where we might be going, we’ll be reluctant to go. That’s why I appreciate Chris’s exploration of the birth of the future human, and my own work—we’re both looking at the maturation of the species: our relationship with the universe, with one another, and within ourselves.

I know Duane shares it, and I suspect many here do too: reincarnation. My first book was on reincarnation, starting with the empirical evidence, which I believe is overwhelming. I came to this conclusion as a philosopher of religion. When I look at human beings, I tend to see souls. There are old souls in small, young bodies, and young souls in old, withered bodies. The key is understanding that reincarnation is a higher order of evolution. It’s one of the fundamental truths of a self-manifesting, self-evolving universe.\n\nSo far, we’ve told the reincarnation story through the lens of theologies and philosophies focused on individual evolution: the soul’s development over countless lifetimes, awakening into individual enlightenment. That’s true, but it’s incomplete. When we recognize that every human being on the planet is a reincarnating essence, we begin to see reincarnation as a collective driver, not just an individual one.

It became impossible to separate individual evolution from collective evolution. That became a core theme of my second book, “Dark Night, Early Dawn,” where I talk about the dark night not only of the individual soul before spiritual awakening, but of our collective soul.

I can’t let that pass without holding up one of my own that relates directly to what he’s speaking about: a reincarnational perspective—how can that happen? Here’s a book I worked on for 30 years, “The Living Universe.” The universe, according to modern science and as I have encountered so many times, is considered nonliving at the foundations—dead matter and empty space. In modern consumer society, it’s all just dead matter and empty space. And people like Chris come along and say, “Wait a minute—I’ve explored the deeper reaches of the universe. It’s a living system.” In a living system, life can reconnect with itself and evolve with itself.

From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life.

Cycles end and begin, but the consciousness alive within that being is not extinguished—only paused—while we go home, recalibrate, refresh, rejuvenate, and then re-enter the fray. That’s consoling because death is not the end. But if you look carefully, it also means this pattern of leaving loved ones and returning in new configurations—again and again—shreds, in some ways, the social, family, and individual fabric. It’s part of how life works. We have to look deeply to understand. The universe thinks in very different terms than we do—on a time frame much larger, on a completely higher order of scale. We have to learn to think like a mountain, to think like the universe, to think large and deep—and to look at every human being as a precious soul, a companion on this long journey.

First, we’re not recognizing the nature of the universe in which we live. The universe is a living system, but much of current science treats it as dead matter in empty space. We’re prepared to work with the material dimensions, but the deeper aliveness is not recognized. Second, we don’t recognize who we are. We think we’re merely biological beings in a dead universe, making the best of it in a consumer society. We’re not recognizing that we are part of that larger aliveness. Third, we’re not recognizing the evolutionary journey and its dimensions. We think we die and the lights go out. No—we go on. As you’ve been speaking about, Chris, in a reincarnation universe we go on evolving.\n\nSo the transition I see is threefold: a new recognition of where we are—it’s a living system; a recognition of who we are—we’re part of that larger aliveness; and a recognition of where we’re going—beyond consumerism, into learning to live in that larger aliveness.

Again and again people ask, What are you going to do about it? One of the key things I’ve worked on for decades is media. People say, Isn’t media the problem—hypnotizing us into a materialistic mindset, leaving us with more consumerism? No, it goes way beyond that. Mass media is the access to the mass mind.

Not an open-ended possibility, but something truly achieved. From my heart, I cannot doubt we will make this transition.

Nature is driving this. The creative intelligence of nature is driving this. We didn’t give ourselves the big brain; we didn’t give ourselves the evolutionary qualities embodied in us.

We’ve only become a collective species—a civilization—over the last few decades with mass media after World War II. We’re becoming a collective entity, a collective being, if you will. That’s not to diminish the wakefulness of earlier peoples and civilizations; it’s to recognize this is a new epoch, a new era, a new condition. The whole human family is being pushed together by multiple crises—climate, species extinction, and more. We’re being compressed and squeezed as a species to awaken in a new way. We didn’t have those pressures in earlier times at a planetary scale. So this is a unique situation—not to diminish the past, but to awaken to the challenges of the future.\n\nChris Bache:\nI’d offer a simple analogy—both in meditation and physiology. If you fast for health, after a day or two you feel flu-like symptoms—miserable—then after several days you move through it and feel better than when you started. Meditation is similar.

From the outside it can look like we’re devolving because we’re dealing with more basic, elemental problems. But from an evolutionary perspective, we’re getting down to business—healing the past. The only way to heal is to confront it—let it into awareness.

It’s really powerful.\nChris Bache: I agree. The first thing that came into my mind was: take some suffering out of the world. Look at our lives—how we’re impacting and causing suffering—and take it out, not only between human beings, leading toward a gentler, clearer life, but also toward other species. In Buddhist practice, the first thing you do when you begin any meditation is cultivate bodhicitta, the aspiration to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for yourself. The last thing you do is the distribution of merit: you give away all the merit generated to all levels of being. This shatters the illusion of individual enlightenment. It’s not about personal transformation; it’s about collective transformation.\n\nAnd in terms of taking suffering out of the world—Duane, how could you not mention your work, Voluntary Simplicity, your first book? This is common sense for a world living beyond its means.

We began to have experiential access to the Mother Universe—through meditation, yoga, psychedelics—and when we got there we encountered joy, bliss, ecstasy: “This is home.” That leads to a story of the fall and salvation to get back home.

My work—really not “my” work, I just let the universe speak—has emphasized embodying spirituality, transforming the body, bringing spirit deeper into the body so it literally changes our biochemistry, allows us to be healthier and live longer. Sri Aurobindo thought it would take 300 years of continuous spiritual practice before we could begin to become biologically self-regenerating—basically live indefinitely in a human body. The body doesn’t have to break down, but we have to increase the energy within it. First we have to extend life expectancy to give us those 300 years to do the practice.

My sense is that in addition to our universe, we’re embedded within the life force of a Mother Universe—our universe is a daughter universe within the spaciousness of a Mother Universe. The Mother Universe is unbounded dimensionally. Here we are living in the second, third, fourth dimensions—just a couple of steps above a black hole—we’re just getting started. Three, four dimensions are nothing compared to the depth of the Mother Universe. A body is very useful if you’re confined to two, three, four dimensions—get a body for that. But if you’re living in the context of the Mother Universe, where aliveness goes vastly beyond into 200, 300, 400 dimensions—who knows what kind of vehicle is most fitting?

I don’t want to be where it appears we’re going, or part of a system that does what it does. I don’t like feeling complicit in something distorted. I see a lot of toxic behavior and discussion, draped in this self-confident, self-righteous, almost Machiavellian moralism of good versus evil—where the good is me, and anyone who disagrees is the violent devil to cast out. It makes me want to hide away. If I couch this in psychedelics—seeing it as a large, collective, planetary experience, not just involving humanity—when I see these parts of myself in a session, it’s just as ugly, and I want to turn away from that too.

That first year, I encountered the work of Ian Stevenson, whose research on reincarnation turned my worldview upside down. And I also encountered the work of Stanislav Grof, who turned me upside down even more because he gave me a method—he showed me how to explore these deep states of consciousness. I was trained as a philosopher of religion; I'm not a clinician. What interested me about these substances was not only their capacity to heal or clarify my personal consciousness, but to explore the deeper structure of consciousness itself, and eventually the mind of the universe. To do that, a large slice of my life had to go underground. I was working at a state university, in a public environment. The age of legally sanctioned psychedelic research was over in 1970. This was ’78. So I divided my life into my public life, and then in my private life, I began this psychedelic work.\n\nLauren Taus: You took 73 high-dose LSD trips over the course of 20 years—and really high dose?", "char_len": 1188, "token_est": 297, "hash": "1ab694"}

It's an amplification of consciousness that allows your unconscious to surface layer by layer—personal unconscious, then the perinatal level. Psychedelic therapy is high-dose therapy, originally developed for terminally ill cancer patients to blow through the levels of consciousness and trigger a near-death or interior death experience so they could have an experience of where they were going when they were dying. It was quite successful. In the early protocol it was limited to three times. I thought if you could do it three times safely, you could do it more than three times safely.

The second takes place at the collective level of mind—species mind—lots of experiences in the collective unconscious. The third goes deeper into the archetypal mind, beyond the species mind into archetypal reality. The fourth is the One Mind—causal reality—where the fundamental theme is oneness. There are many degrees and permutations of oneness, but that’s the core domain. In the last five years of my work, I entered what I came to call the Diamond Luminosity— the clear light of absolute reality, as it's called in Buddhism, Dharmakaya.\n\nLauren Taus: How is this not therapeutic?

I've done sessions after that particular phase ended—lower-dose sessions or with gentler substances—but when I was doing the high-dose series, I always had a sitter.

It's quite natural for us to die. Nobody survives the game of life. We live in a culture that's uncomfortable engaging content around death because we don't understand what death is. We're chronically constricted within time-space realities. We don't understand what happens when we die or the liberation death involves. It's not just psychedelics that show us this.

Any early answers need to be stacked up because it has so many layers. My work, before and within psychedelics, involves reincarnation. I see reincarnation as a natural fact of life. Over hundreds or thousands of lifetimes, we're constantly learning and growing. We make mistakes, learn from them, and undergo a developmental process. It's not simply the good we do or the growth in one life, but cumulatively—it's not just moving grade by grade. Sooner or later, all our former lives congeal into one integrated consciousness—the totality of our consciousness, a being hundreds of thousands of years old. We return to that consciousness when we die—ego to soul, soul to ego—over and over. Eventually, the soul manifests in its entirety on Earth. The process is about learning—activating the capacities inherent in our nature. At its core, our nature is divine: Atman is Brahman. The capacities we’re activating are the same capacities that created the physical universe, that create galaxies. We're learning how to activate and use them to create heaven on Earth eventually. There are intermediate stages—learning love and service, surrendering violence, learning compassion—but at a deeper level, we're learning how to be gods. I mean that modestly but literally: learning how to create, to manifest the deepest capacity of our being to create our reality in the very demanding circumstances of time and space.

At that point in my life, I met the work of Ian Stevenson in reincarnation research at Virginia and, more importantly, of Stan Grof.

Why was that, in retrospect? Why was all that physical and energetic purification necessary?\nChris Bache\nThere are many levels of answers, but basically, if we want deeper intimacy with the consciousness of the universe, we’re moving into states that are vast and operate at a much higher frequency and energy level. Our egoic consciousness—the ordinary consciousness organized around our bodily existence—is too small. We have to let go of that consciousness. Some people find that easier or more difficult, but letting go at the egoic level and entering into spiritual reality is the first of many cycles of death and rebirth, because the universe has many levels and dimensions.

But in a session, when we hyper-amplify consciousness, consciousness begins to clean and transform itself. As it purifies, we first encounter unfinished business—things we’d rather not face, things that frighten us. Those are early layers.

If you put an ice cube next to a candle—an analogy for a gentler spiritual practice—the candle melts the ice cube gently. Throw the same ice cube onto a hot skillet, and it jumps and snaps as the molecules explode. Psychedelic sessions are like the latter. You’re doing the same process you do in deep contemplative retreats, but faster, and therefore more convulsively and intensely. Essentially, it’s the same process traditional practitioners undergo in the dark night of the soul.\n\nEventually, I came to understand that the many deaths one endures in this process are a symptom of purification.

In 1979, you took the first step on a life-changing journey to explore your mind—and the mind of the universe—as deeply and systematically as possible with the help of LSD. If you had known then that it would take 20 years of excruciating pain, suffering, bliss, and intense purification, plus many more years of digesting, processing, organizing, and writing to publish this book, would you still have put yourself through it?\n\nChris Bache: That's a good question. I'm not sure that I would. If I had known then what I know now, I would have been gentler on myself.

How did you know the precise dosage to accomplish that in the way you wanted to?\n\nChris Bache: Stan was very clear in his early books, and in LSD Psychotherapy published in 1980, about the differences between psycholytic (low-dose) therapy and psychedelic (high-dose) therapy. Psycholytic work typically runs in the 50–150 microgram range, while high-dose psychedelic therapy is in the several-hundred-microgram range. At that time, high-dose therapy was being used at Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore with terminal patients to trigger something approximating a near-death experience to give them a glimpse of where they were going.", "char_len": 1039, "token_est": 259, "hash": "585570"}

I chose high doses for a couple of reasons. One, I had a false model of what the project was. I thought it was about personal transformation—my healing, my spiritual awakening—and that by working with high doses I’d be biting off my karma in larger pieces and clearing it faster. That turned out to be profoundly incomplete. Personal transformation was too small to describe it. Also, I wanted to be efficient. I was in a dual-career marriage; getting time for sessions was complicated, and I wanted to get as much done in every session as I could.\n\nWhat I learned along the way is that because consciousness is unified at its source, when you hyper-stimulate consciousness you're not just hyper-stimulating your personal field—you’re engaging some portion of the unified field.

In most Eastern traditions, you grow, get clearer, kinder, more generous, cultivate deeper qualities, and eventually reach a spiritual maturing where your consciousness opens to the core of your being. You awaken to the fact that the essence of your nature is the essence of all nature, that all beings share the same nature. There’s an explosion of compassion and a deep embrace of the universe. The usual interpretation is that you are now free to leave time and space—what the Hindus call Moksha—to escape Samsara. It’s an “up and out” cosmology. The religions of the Axial Age, in one way or another, are part of that pattern: we don’t want to be on Earth, we’re in a veil of tears, we want out—by salvation or enlightenment. But that leaves fundamentally unexplained: What is the purpose of the universe? What is the purpose of this magnificent creation?

Over the last 30 years, we’ve explored the mind as an emergent property of energy flow arising both within the individual and in relationships—with other people and with nature. The mind shows subjective experience, consciousness, and information processing. A fourth facet is that self-organizing emergent property of a complex system—an idea developed in the 1980s—where interaction among elements gives rise to properties larger than the elements themselves. We view the system as embodied-and-relational energy flow. This self-organizing process optimizes its unfolding through differentiation and linkage. When optimal self-organization occurs—what we call integration, the balance of differentiation and linkage—it yields a flow with five qualities that feel harmonious: flexibility, adaptability, coherence (holding together well over time), energy/vitality, and stability.

So, integration is the basis of well-being.\nNow to the planet. We face many pandemics: loss of biodiversity—the mass extinction; racism and social injustice; COVID-19; polarization and misinformation; loneliness in modern culture; screen addiction; the climate disaster. All are examples of chaos and rigidity. I’d have you consider that these are worsened by, or even caused by, how the self is constructed by the human mind. Because of vulnerabilities in the human brain and a cultural drive for certainty, modern culture constructs what I call the “solo self”—a view of identity as existing only inside the individual, or inside individuals like oneself. At the heart of these pandemics, including extinction, might be this solo self. In the book Interconnected, the idea is an identity as “me plus we”—the integration of self, identity, and belonging. Through a lifespan view, we explore how the self—a center of experience with subjective experience, perspective, and agency (SPA)—develops as separate in modern culture, and how that fits with ancient invitations from contemplative practices and indigenous wisdom. Here in Southern California, on unceded Tongva and Chumash land, those teachings say humans are part of nature. Modern culture, by contrast, shifts from a verb-like, fluid “intra-connected” identity—connected within a whole—to a noun-like, separate identity. “Interconnected” is the between; “intra-connected” is the within.

There was tension, so we did a day-long Wheel of Awareness workshop.

You can imagine how not being in touch with this core aspect—love as a thread of reality—creates trouble if people in power think love is weak. Even just the concept that we can tap a deeper source of awareness with love at its core gives me hope we can turn this around in time. There’s urgency—likely less than a decade—but it’s an ancient message modern culture has ignored. My hope is that adding a bit of science helps us see the splinter in the soul of modern culture: the separate self. When you remove the splinter, you walk straight again.\n\nThis conversation about interconnectedness—me plus we—isn’t about eliminating the individual. You don’t crash at the intersection.

We went on a retreat to deepen our experiential sense of systems—up in the Colorado mountains with John P. Milton at The Way of Nature. Part of the retreat is spending three days by yourself in the forest. When we came back to share, everyone spoke beautifully about being interconnected with the forest—interlaced, interwoven—using Thich Nhat Hanh’s term interbeing.\n\nWhen it was my turn, I said I resonated with everything, but the experience for this body wasn’t a betweenness; it was a within-ness. I was the creek, the tree, the sky, the body called Dan. There wasn’t a separation of me connected to that, so I said intraconnected. Everyone nodded. Back at the lodge, I tried to type “intraconnected,” and my word processor kept autocorrecting to “interconnected.” I discovered there was no such word as intraconnected—connectedness of within.

In the book, I take the reader on a journey through lifespan development—not academically, but practically—to synthesize science about how the self develops in utero, infancy, toddlerhood, early school years, adolescence, adulthood; to look at resistance to change; and to see how modern culture develops the false view of a noun-like separate self entity.

Extinction is an evolutionary driver; it’s powerful. You’re right: this civilization has been built on the ego, which is a beautiful structure but an imprisoned self that builds a divided world. We no longer have the luxury of an egoic civilization, even a well-intentioned one. We need to give birth to a higher, more inclusive form of human identity.

This is a moment in our human evolution when a process called cultural evolution—very real—can be shaped by pervasive leadership, where every individual takes whatever role fits your life to sense into a self that is inner, connected to other people and to nature, and also intra: the me plus we is “mwe.” Cultural evolution happens one person, one relationship, one conversation at a time.

One of the things that was shown to me along the way—when you talked about fields and quantum fields—was that the intensity of the global crisis we're entering is going to hyper-stimulate not only our individual fields but the collective field of humanity. It will drive us into non-linear conditions. We know something about how physical fields behave in non-linear conditions—chaos theory. If we assume the psychic field of humanity under non-linear, far-from-equilibrium conditions will have some of those same qualities, then we have a way of seeing emergence from the depths of the human psyche: the emergence of new forms, crystallizations that weren’t available previously but actualize latent capacities within human nature. That feels deeply aligned with what you’re talking about, and it helps us understand how we can make as big a change as we need to in as short a time as we have.

In his book, LSD the Mind of the Universe, he shares experiences from some 73 journeys he undertook with a very prescribed protocol and a sitter protecting him over decades, journeying sequentially farther into what the future of humanity might look like. So here we go. Meet Christopher Bache, if you don't already know him. Hello, Christopher, it's so good to see you. After reading your book—and hearing from others who’ve read it—the question that comes up about halfway through is, why in the world did you continue when you went through that much pain and suffering, sometimes taking months, even a year, to recover from a journey, and yet you would come back?

I was trained as a philosopher of religion with a passionate desire to understand the deep structure of the universe. I had studied some of the great minds in our Western and Eastern traditions. When I found the methodology that Stan made available, I decided to push it as long and as hard as I could. There was a great deal of suffering, episodically and periodically.

But let’s start with “What was I thinking?” What happens upon the dissolution of the ego?\n\nChris Bache:\nIf you want to allow your consciousness to expand into deeper dimensions, you must surrender the narrow bandwidth of your individual body-mind-ego. This can happen slowly or fast, convulsively or smoothly, but the identity we hold has to be shattered, destroyed. When it’s destroyed, consciousness naturally expands into a deeper register, a wider spectrum.

I wasn’t given details, dates, nothing about artificial intelligence or a third world war—just the experience of a prolonged loss of control and a collapse of everything considered normal and necessary. Since then, I’ve lived with this awareness. For me, it’s not a projected fantasy; it’s an experience, so I don’t question its truth. I see this period as one of increasing destabilization: conflicts between races, religions, sexes, classes—tremendous things we’ve done to each other for thousands of years. We have to grow spiritually into the next form emerging in the human. I think this process will continue to deepen for decades. What’s unfolding now is the overture, bringing to the surface age-old hatreds that we must transform. I don’t offer political solutions; my perspective isn’t ground-level.

Tell us what you learned about the essence of karma at that time.\nChris Bache:\nAs a professor of religious studies, I had an intellectual understanding of karma: cause and effect generated by choices. There are physical and psychological cause-effect processes. In karmic thought, every choice sets in motion events whose consequences we eventually receive. By receiving the effects, we learn and make new choices. Session 15 wasn’t theoretical; it was being shown the karma of my particular life. For a year—seven sessions—I experienced the entirety of my life, from beginning to end, as a complete totality. This was my first entry into what I call deep time. In that context, when I looked at relationships and professional issues, I saw how deeply embedded they were in karmic causal processes—that my position in history wasn’t accidental, the people around me weren’t accidental. It was a meaningful fabric. The question then became: how do you respond most effectively to the meaningful fabric your life is part of?", "char_len": 1056, "token_est": 264, "hash": "1c1d6a"}

Two days ago a book was released by Dr. Robert Sapolsky about the science of living with no free will. He concludes there’s no such thing as free will—that we’re machines and can’t lay anything we do upon ourselves. I’d love your response.\n\nChris Bache:\nI haven’t read the book, but that position is familiar among philosophers. It derives from a 19th-century metaphysics that sees the universe as a deterministic machine: all parts determined by the whole, leaving no freedom. I think that vision is deeply outmoded. We’re looking at a quantum world that values indeterminacy—there’s more flexibility in the system than we thought. Ninety-six percent of reality is dark matter or dark energy, and we don’t know anything about it. If we step back, it’s clear much of our psychological life is highly conditioned. But within that conditioning, we make choices, and our choices can increase or reduce conditioning, increasing our freedom. Nobody exists in pure, absolute freedom—except perhaps the fully awakened.

Considering the quantum reality we’re becoming aware of—and your work on the soul—one line from your book stayed with me: energy started must simply complete itself; that’s the nature of karma. Then you define the soul as “a story of individual consciousness, ultimately sourced in the creative intelligence of the cosmos, systematically moving back and forth between the physical universe and a surrounding Metaverse in a long journey of self-development.” It’s one of the best definitions of soul I’ve seen.

It’s a learning system, continuously growing, expanding, and deepening. Classic spiritual traditions say the essence of the individual soul is the essence of the totality—Atman is Brahman; the essence of the soul is the essence of the Divine. In my deepest experience, the form of the soul and of all reality is light—not light as in the physical world, but a much more profound light that is self-aware and learning over vast epochs of time. I think we’re entering a transformation in which we are giving birth to the soul inside time and space. Usually we die and expand to the soul, incarnate and contract to ego, then die and expand again. If we keep that up for hundreds of thousands of years, sooner or later the integrated consciousness we return to when we die wakes up inside the individual human being. That’s what I call the birth of the diamond soul—literally waking up inside physical existence. That, I think, is the challenge of this century. We no longer have the luxury of running this planet from the psychological structure of the individual ego. The ego is magnificent, but limited—cut off from each other and the larger universe.

You said these beings live through humanity, experience through humanity, love through humanity.\nChris Bache:\nI’ve had reservations about that particular line, but I kept it in because it’s in my original notes. When the ocean of suffering culminated, it exploded me into a deeper level of consciousness. The distinctive qualities were twofold: it was incredibly ancient—beyond anything I’d imagined—and more real than time and space. I eventually came to understand it as archetypal reality: a level that exists before time and space and contributes fundamental structures to them. The vision is that all reality emerges out of a primal One which starts as a void and manifests as the Big Bang. Between the One and even the Big Bang, there are many gradations—unfoldings of the Divine, though I hesitate to use that word because of its connotations. There are many layers, and lower levels are sourced in the actions of higher levels. I was encountering these—whether to call them beings or principles—vast entities others have experienced too. The best my mind could do to give them form was to see them as galaxies—images borrowed from Hubble and James Webb—though they weren’t galaxies, just that massive in scale. These beings were part of creation, creating time and space and some of the structures within it. Far down the line we have human beings. The insight was that all human existence—and, in fact, all existence—was an expression of the intentions of these deeper cosmological principles and beings. I’m not sure I got all the pieces lined up, but I do think all human experience, male and female, is an aspect of a species intelligence; that species intelligence is an aspect of a planetary intelligence, which is an aspect of a solar-system and galactic intelligence.

I experienced a downward flow of causation as part of a gracious, compassionate, intelligent process giving us opportunities to grow and develop that we might not otherwise have. We live in a conditioned universe—levels upon levels—and at the same time a creative universe, constantly manifesting new levels, new things emerging out of our deep structure.

The more consciousness we consolidate—not just over a single lifetime, but over thousands of years—the more it heals the heart, opens the mind, and enlivens the senses.

On the surface, we reincarnate: we learn, grow, change, make decisions, and return different. But beneath the incarnating self is a deeper structure that holds all our incarnational memories—a fundamental blueprint from which we act. Humanity grows and changes individually, while a very specific structure in the collective psyche accumulates and stores that information. Periodically, that deeper structure pivots—what I call a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. It’s the genius of creation: we learn individually, it collects at a deeper level, and when that deeper level shifts, all subsequent individual experience unfolds from that changed fundamental psyche. After the birth of the future human, all future incarnations of human beings will operate out of this transformed collective psyche—and the process continues.

Used skillfully, these sessions open us to these realities—but at the end of the day, I would de-emphasize the psychedelics and emphasize the consciousness they amplify.\n\nRegina Meredith:\nAnd there are many ways to reach that. Christopher, thank you so much. I look forward to meeting you in the flesh at the Gaia Studios, where we’ll start filling in some of the pieces we couldn’t get to today.\n\nChris Bache:\nThank you, Regina.

I immediately recognized that his research in LSD and psychedelics in general was extraordinarily important—not just for clinical psychology and therapy, but for philosophy, which was what interested me most. Even though it was illegal, I began a quiet, private psychedelic practice that continued for 20 years. I worked for four years, then stopped for six years for reasons I describe in the book, then worked for another 10 years. This was from ’79 to ’99, when I was 30 to 50. I then spent the next 20 years digesting those experiences—trying to absorb them, extrapolate, and clarify the cosmological implications—and then I published LSD in the Mind of the Universe. That’s the brief sketch of what brings me here.\n\nSteve Thayer: As I was reading your book, I kept thinking, what a heroic undertaking—heroic in the sense of a hero’s journey.

I followed Stan’s protocols from LSD Psychotherapy: lying down, eye shades, earphones, very carefully choreographed music to guide the session. I was always in private, protected, with a sitter—my wife at the time, a clinical psychologist—so established in what I call the psychedelic kiva, a sacred container for practice.\n\nAfter about three sessions at 250 micrograms, I chose to work with very high doses—500 to 600 micrograms—the body saturation point. Naively, I thought the work was about personal transformation or spiritual awakening.

At this dose level, it wasn’t about personal transformation. With gentler psychedelics or lower doses, activation and healing might remain at personal levels. But with very powerful psychedelics, you amplify consciousness so deeply that what begins as personal work becomes engaged with collective processes—the collective unconscious, the species mind. From there, you’re off to deeper and deeper levels—cycles of death and rebirth, not just ego death. Ego death is only the first of many deaths.

It’s extremely demanding. It can become the central focus of your life—engaging deep states, navigating, absorbing, integrating them into your life, your social world, and into your body. I also assumed there was an endpoint: enlightenment, union with God, the primal void. I had those experiences and discovered many levels of divinity one can enter into, and even many levels of the pure, fertile void. About 15 years in, I went as deep as I would ever go—what I call the Diamond Luminosity domain. I saw reality far in the distance; a beam of light from that reality hit me and shattered me, even in a very high, subtle state. That’s when I realized it’s an infinite journey. You’ll never get to the end. The depth is too vast.\n\nIf I were to start over, I’d be gentler. I’d balance low and high doses, organic and synthetic psychedelics.

What do you think the risks are of going straight to those deeper states—higher doses that might bypass some of the lower‑dose healing work? How would you use those dose ranges as tools?\n\nChris Bache: Any work with psychedelics—especially higher doses in a therapeutic protocol—can be challenging, and calls for good psychological screening to make sure the psyche is ready. As you know, some people should never go near psychedelics, and some should work very gently, if at all. I happen to have a constitution that can expand into and then re‑congeal from expansive states readily and smoothly. Not everyone is wired like that. All the clinical cautions apply.\n\nWith high doses, one could chase a particular level and bypass others. That didn’t happen to me. I spent my first 10 sessions—about two and a half years—in very grueling work at what Stan calls the perinatal level, the interface between the personal unconscious and the collective or transpersonal.

That bridge allowed my sessions to become a conduit—pulling pain from the collective psyche and transforming it. Had my personal wounds been healed early, that ability would have been compromised. Along the way I learned this function—engaging the collective psyche and bringing a measure of healing—was part of my soul’s work, something I signed up for in this incarnation.

Some people have a natural aptitude, but whatever your starting point, careful practice matters. If you enter carefully, process and debrief carefully, you learn how to do it better next time. Integration is crucial—careful debriefing, recording your session afterward, really sitting with the content. It establishes the baseline for your next entry. It’s cyclical.

I began this work not just agnostic, but atheistically inclined. It was like, put up or shut up, because it didn’t look good.

Nobody knows for sure. Cultures that have believed in reincarnation say it doesn't start with human beings; it starts before human beings. How far before? We're not sure. My sense is that it starts when individuality begins to emerge within the evolutionary matrix. I use the term evolution frequently and believe in progressive development and unfolding, but that doesn't mean I agree with the standard textbook theory of what's driving evolution. When I use the term, I don't mean a reductive, determinist theory.\n\nIt's about learning.

What is the essence of the soul, the essence of our individuality that makes this evolving individuality possible? In psychedelic work, we find the same answers found in classic mystical traditions. The essence of the individual is the essence of the Divine. The essence of the one is the essence of the totality. We are, in essence, derived from sparks of the Divine, teased out of the unitive matrix of Divinity and given the privilege of individuated existence, which is then polished, refined, and deepened over thousands and thousands of years of going back and forth between spirit and matter, taking us along a developmental process.

Not just a transformation of the heart and mind, but also of sensory experience. We tend to have a mechanical theory of how the senses work, but I was shown that the more consciousness is consolidated in the body, the more refined our sensory experiences become. I had an experience at the end of my journey of vision 100 times sharper than in ordinary consciousness; the same applies to hearing and other senses.

We're such a paradox. As terrifying as it sounds, the maturity process you describe—the next stage of development—does sound like it might require a crisis to force or draw out that next stage.

We focus on the long-term vision, the long-term good, the wide good, because we have an intuitive awareness of the hundreds or thousands of people we’ve been in relationship with through history. We’ve been every race, every religion. We’ve been up and down the economic ladder. We’ve held all the roles in history. When all those lives wake up as a singular consciousness, it radically changes our perception of what’s taking place, who we are, and where we’re going.\n\nWhen people ask what form the future human will take, we explore all sorts of science fiction. I think it’s much more simple. We’ve been gestating the future human for hundreds of thousands of years through reincarnation. Gestation is long; labor is short and intense. I think we are entering a period of labor. We are desperately trying to grow into the largest, deepest, richest version of ourselves—that is the diamond soul.

We either grow up or go extinct. Extinction is a tremendous evolutionary accelerator. Personally, I think this century’s evolving crisis is going to take us to our edge.

It appears that Chris's devotion to transformation appeared relatively early. Just as he was receiving his degree from Notre Dame's theology department, and was awarded an Award for Excellence, he decided to leave Catholicism. This radical transformation occurred again at Brown University. Halfway through his doctoral program, he realized that he had gotten what he wanted from biblical studies and, in his words, “I changed horses and began again.” Those of us in integral studies recognize this fidelity to what wants to emerge, although we may not always have the courage for radical transformations.

Other developments have shortened our metaphysical horizon: the psychedelic renaissance right now is focused on exploring psychedelics’ capacity to heal the wounds of the personal psyche. The literature is dominated by studies demonstrating capacities to heal post-traumatic stress, depression, addiction—very powerful—but this focuses us on the horizon of the personal unconscious. A second use is spiritual awakening, as in Zig Zag Zen’s discussion between the psychedelic and Buddhist communities. Still, that’s framed in terms of individual enlightenment.

Everything below the line is time and space and ordinary consciousness; above the line is transpersonal consciousness. The drop at the bottom—what my students sometimes called the pantyhose model—represents egoic consciousness. Everything above, between the blue lines, represents various orders of transpersonal consciousness. To transition from egoic space-time identity into spiritual reality involves some type of self-death or ego death—letting the programming of our identity be dissolved so we can enter deeper states. Ego death gets a lot of attention, appropriately, but in my journey ego death turned out to be only one of a number of deaths that took place at different levels—hence the spiral of death and rebirth. To enter deeper levels of transpersonal consciousness, you go through repeated deaths and rebirths. The nature of those deaths is tricky to describe because they occur far beyond egoic consciousness and change as the adventure deepens. I use Dan and Ken Wilber’s categories of psychic, subtle, and causal reality simply to indicate a pattern. I have no vested interest in a particular cosmology; the point is there are many levels, and you may go through many levels of death and rebirth if you access these levels systematically.

It involves confrontations with death, lots of fetal sensations, often reliving one’s birth—very extreme—facing deep alienation and the question of whether life has any meaning whatsoever because everything and everyone we love is going to be dead, including ourselves. How can there be meaning in a universe where everything of value dies? This culminates in ego death—our identity turned inside out. For me, this took about 10 sessions and two and a half years until the universe snapped me like a twig—turned me into the exact opposite of everything I’d known myself to be and radically expanded my awareness. I thought I was a male, white university professor concerned with the meaning of existence. It turned me into hundreds of women—women of color, women with no interest in philosophy—and it snapped me. The message was: where you are going, gender does not exist. Let go. The problem wasn’t women or education; it was the tight role my social identity had on me, confining my experience.

At these dose levels, the first portion of nearly every session was a purification/detoxification—the dying process; the second portion was transcendent, ecstatic, transpersonal teaching or instruction. For the first half of the next year of sessions, I entered what I called the ocean of suffering. I was repeatedly and systematically immersed in a collective anguish that shattered all my frames of reference and dwarfed the previous phase. It expanded to encompass the entire history of the human species. The dying at this level was almost entirely collective. The surrender demanded was the ordeal of repeatedly opening to the enormity and savagery of the ocean of pain. I didn’t understand what was happening. At first I thought it was a deepening of ego death. But it went on so long, and involved so many thousands of people, that I came to a different conclusion—the major theme of my second book, Dark Night, Early Dawn. I think the universe used my sessions—not to heal or enlighten me—but to heal some aspect of humanity at large, to heal some aspect of the collective psyche. Just as an individual internalizes trauma in their unconscious, distorting their well-being, the human species internalizes the unresolved trauma of history. It aggregates in the collective psyche, distorting its functioning.

I’d had many experiences of oneness and learned there are degrees of oneness; I’d experienced the primal void and learned there are degrees of the void. At the peak of diamond luminosity, resting intact in a deeply blissful state, my visual field pivoted 90 degrees. A circle opened, and in the far distance I saw a reality far beyond diamond luminosity—a domain of light. A ray of light came from that reality and hit me; it shattered me. It took minutes to recover. That’s when I understood it’s an infinite progression. We’ll never get to the end of it. Even with this aggressive mode of exploration, I’d never reach the end.

Dissolved into the human species, I entered the future and experienced the death and rebirth of humanity—a profound spiritual, psychophysical transformation. It was a very difficult session—an ordeal. No specifics; rather, a profound unraveling of the global order triggered by a cascading series of ecological crises. In ’95 I was radically naive about global climate disruption; it wasn’t on my radar. But in this vision humanity was brought to its knees—an unraveling reflected in history of what happens in a psychedelic session: unraveling core assumptions, basic components of life. For a while it looked like extinction, but in the end we passed through the crisis. On the other side came new visions of the good, the true, new social relationships.

I was integrating all along, but integrating an entire journey is different than integrating individual sessions. It took a long time.\n\nI’m acutely aware of the radical nature of these claims. Are these experiences trustworthy? Am I experiencing echoes of my personal psyche, or the collective psyche? How do we know these reflect a reality “out there”? I addressed this in an exchange with Ken Ring, one of the founders of near-death studies; we published it on Medium. It’s also on Academia.edu and likely my website.

My sense of perpetual deepening came from two things: using a very powerful psychedelic at very high doses—much stronger than therapeutically oriented doses—and practicing in a totally tight, isolated, consistent container, what I call the Kiva of practice. Standardizing variables, staying away from contact with the world, entering in a meditative way. If you do that, the interface between the mind exploring and the mind being explored gets very stable, and the mind being explored takes you on as a student, taking you deeper and deeper.

Just as you can have an overview of your life, you can have an overview of humanity’s developmental process. I was dissolved into that and experienced part of it. The closest I can come to describing the emergent being is the diamond soul concept: it brings everything from the past forward, but drives it into a higher synthesis—a new level.

That doesn’t fly. It’s important to keep your feet grounded. For me, my family and my students kept me grounded—the requirement to show up for them over and over again. You don’t have to change much on the outside of your life while these changes are cooking your insides. The urge to wear different clothes or do something performative on the outside is a temporary thing. Sit tight, stay where you are, and let the inner transformation take place. It’s humbling to confront your faults—just stay grounded.\n\nThank you. It’s been an honor and a true pleasure.

I developed a strategy for capturing these experiences. I even say in the book that ineffability is overrated as a measure of mystical experience. If you can’t say where you’ve been, you probably just got lost. There’s nothing wrong with getting lost, but just because it’s hard doesn’t mean words can’t be found. Zen masters can talk about enlightenment just fine—to other Zen masters.

If there’s a parallel between the cushion and the psychedelic session—and if we’re in a historical shift—then my intuition is that we’re experiencing a rise in divine influx. There’s more energy coming up underneath us, more information becoming available—not just physically via the internet, but from the center of our being. Teachings and insights are rising inside us, which we can catch, but to catch them we must prepare ourselves. We have to empty ourselves of what is small to receive pieces of what is large.

Any thoughts?\nChris Bache: It’s a popular sci‑fi theme. Quantum theory tells us the visible world is underpinned by a larger, subtler reality. Now 95–96% of reality is dark energy and dark matter. Over and over we’re told that what we’re living isn’t the whole of what’s real. Physical reality is like the skin of an apple—and as the apple grows, the skin expands. When you fall beneath time-space into deeper levels, you’re falling toward the center of the apple, where it’s all light. Even physical reality is composed of light, but at the center it’s the most radiant, beautiful brilliance.\n\nWhether we experience that larger reality as threatening, manipulative, dark and hostile—or as a magnificent co-creative intelligence—depends on our psychology. My experience is that the mother universe is extraordinarily creative, intelligent, wise, loving, and compassionate. To see the wisdom or compassion of life, you have to look very deep.

It’s a repeated experience that the lower levels are sourced in the higher levels. The deeper levels are more intelligent, more intense energetically, and more conscious. Going into them is entering a more conscious, more powerful, more source dimension of existence, until eventually you leave behind time-space. There are dimensions which echo time-space—what the Tibetans call the Bardo, the intermediate dimensions—and one can go beyond all the echoes of time and space and enter what some traditions would call extra-samsaric reality, reality beyond all cycles of death and rebirth: the domain of pure light.

There will be a much easier communion with the deeper creative consciousness of the universe, igniting a period of tremendous creativity—an acceleration of creativity.

There was much cleaner, clearer communion between physical beings and spiritual consciousness.

Early in his career he was always interested in mysticism and deep spiritual exploration, and he came upon the work of the legendary psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, who pioneered a protocol for working with high doses of LSD in particular. Chris undertook what turned out to be a 20-year journey of 73 high-dose LSD sessions following the Stan Grof protocol—sessions using 500 to 600 micrograms of LSD, which, for any of you not familiar with that calculation, is a high dose. The protocol involves working at home or in a safe, quiet space with headphones and a carefully curated playlist, eyeshades to block out the light so inner visions aren’t obstructed, and a qualified sitter. In Chris’s case, the sitter was a therapist who knew what she was doing. Generally, he did this on a Saturday, and the following day—again following the Grof protocol—he spent basically the whole day with the headphones on to trigger memories of what was playing when certain experiences and visions occurred, and then meticulously transcribed all that.", "char_len": 1286, "token_est": 321, "hash": "583707"}

And the incredible LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven, which many people have read now.\n\nJust to add a little more about how I understand what happened in that 20-year journey—mind you, it would take all day to do it justice—the very short version is: in each one of those 73 journeys, the first two hours were, as you described in the book, sometimes exquisitely painful as you went through the difficult process of ego dissolution and beyond—letting go of any kind of identity, even as a human.

I think you first said this process might take hundreds of years before the light might shine again, so to speak. But I think in an email or a phone conversation in the last few months, you said you might need to correct that to say thousands of years—or more than a thousand years.

It was less like messages downloading and more a deep and profound immersion into transtemporal states of consciousness—going into what I call deep time, moving outside linear time. These visions began coming when I was a good 12–14 years into my process. Before then, there was ego death, entering into collective suffering—what I think is a dimension of the collective unconscious of humanity that stores all its pain and suffering—then into archetypal reality. From archetypal reality, I began to receive a series of visionary downloads that kept showing me the same basic story: humanity was coming to a pivot point in its evolutionary journey. The karmic streams of history were entering a canyon.

It was excruciating and kept building in intensity. I experienced this not as an individual human being but as the species. Just when it was at its worst, the peak passed, the dangers began to recede, and we began to pick ourselves up and put the pieces back together. And when we did, we were changed. Something had been tapped, broken open at the very deep level of our being.

I think Duane is right: the next 50 years are going to be absolutely pivotal in terms of the intensity of the ecological forces bearing down on us. I don’t think we have a thousand years to address this.

One of the things this visionary series showed me is that as we enter deeper into crisis, the whole foundation of the psyche and our culture will shift into what chaos theoreticians call nonlinear systems. There will be so much high-energy engagement that we’ll be shifting out of a linear dynamic of history into a nonlinear one. We know some characteristics of nonlinear systems, and one important characteristic is that in a nonlinear condition, systems are particularly susceptible to small influences—small perturbations. That means as we go into this crisis, the actions of individuals will have proportionately greater impact than they would have had in quieter periods of history.

All of the great saints and sages who seeded the religions of the Axial Age drew humanity to them because we could feel a deep resonance. They were archetypal prototypes of what we were becoming, and they invited us to become what they had become. In the Buddhas, the prophets, the Christ, and the great saints of the deepest spiritual traditions, we can see prototypes of what’s coming.\n\nSome have said—and I agree—that the age of individual enlightenment is over. Now it’s collective enlightenment or death. It’s a collective game. What’s so unusual is that nature seems intent—at least in my visionary experience—on awakening the entire species. Humanity as a whole is going through, or beginning to go through, a collective dark night of the soul: a period of profound purification, confronting what we might think of as the sins of our fathers, which are our sins, clearing out the basement so we become more receptive to increasing energies entering from the spiritual dimension at this time in history.", "char_len": 1207, "token_est": 301, "hash": "2f03bd"}

The Eastern traditions culminate this in enlightenment, often framed as a departure from time and space—leaving samsara for the bliss of eternity.

I loved the book LSD and the Mind of the Universe, and thank you for sharing your insights tonight.” For those watching online, we’ll take questions from our Zoom audience. Here’s one: how does your process relate to Christology? Did you have Christ avatar experiences, and how does that map onto your journey?\n\nChris Bache:\nInteresting question. Two traditions have had the largest influence on my life—Christianity and Buddhism. I also taught world religions for decades, and the lineages became passionate lovers for me; each taught me so much. While I started within a Christian framework, I came to see that Christ is the fruition of a spiritual impulse in the Middle East that parallels, in seminal ways, the fruition of similar impulses in India, Africa, South America. Larger patterns emerged.\n\nIf Christology is the study of the Christ archetype, for me that archetype is bigger than Jesus. It’s a larger dynamic of profound awakening of the human heart, mind, and spirit.

I didn’t have the “machine elves” of DMT. My sense is that maybe you have to be a being to experience beings; you have to be a self to experience selves in the universe. If your work grinds you repeatedly into dust, then when that dust goes out, it takes you into the fabric of life rather than into a dialogue with individuated beings—even very large spiritual beings. I was drawn into archetypal dynamics and dimensions. There was always a consciousness guiding my sessions—I felt in the hands of a massive consciousness—but it never appeared in concrete form. It was a presence: purifying, crushing, destroying, receiving, teaching, taking me deeper, but never distilling into a particular form. So, with Christology, I affirm its deep essence, but it doesn’t concretize into historically specific expressions.\n\nStephen Gray:\nWas there a visual component to these journeys?", "char_len": 1065, "token_est": 266, "hash": "2129df"}

It would purify me—beat me up, crush me, destroy me—and then, after purification, receive me, educate me, take me through things until it was sure I understood, then take me deeper. But it never adopted an identifiable form.\n\nMarc Caron:\nA brief follow-up: how does your work map onto Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s vision of the noosphere and this epochal birth?\n\nChris Bache:\nThe overlap is striking. He saw humanity coming to a turning point and articulated the noosphere. Trained as a geologist, he held a vast historical landscape alongside deep natural spirituality and Christian faith. I read Chardin and many others in graduate school. They didn’t shape what actually happened in my sessions, but they helped me understand and interpret it.

How do we stabilize these shifts? If you had a workshop, what would you train people to do?\n\nChris Bache:\nA big yes to your framing. We’re hardwired into the collective psyche—physically, biologically, mentally, spiritually. Everything we do registers in the collective, and the collective shapes everything we do. An extreme example: when I die, I take my psychedelic experiences with me, but the species mind keeps them too, because I was human when I had them. They become part of the human family’s experience.

In Buddhism, you begin practice by cultivating bodhicitta—the aspiration to benefit all sentient beings—and end by distributing the merit to all levels of being. The trap is thinking it’s about personal enlightenment. The traditions say the opposite: it’s not about you; it’s all of us. Open your heart and mind, let the pain in, bring the healing out. We can trust that everything we do is conserved and used by other beings alive now.\n\nIn my academic life, I had to keep this work hidden, but I found my students were activated by it. A transparency opened between their minds and mine, demonstrating that consciousness is ultimately one. It forced me to learn a new way of teaching, respectful of the quantum fields emerging in our work together. There is no private practice—we’re arm in arm.

The individual–collective dynamic applies to both sides of the street. In shamanic cultures, practitioners manage dark forces as well as healing.\n\nBut Carl Jung is right that nature tilts toward growth—toward us becoming larger, wiser, more intelligent. If nature is trying to bring about this pivot toward a higher form of consciousness, then despite the upheaval at political, social, and cultural levels, the deeper movement is toward truer, clearer, better, more good.

And now, at this conference, I’m going to be releasing, as part of my presentation, the new edition of The Living Classroom, which is the first time I’m able to really tell the story of the role psychedelics played in the ideas I wrote about in the original 2008 version of The Living Classroom, where I thought it was best to keep psychedelics out of the story.

And so I began, even though it was illegal, a quiet, private psychedelic practice, which ended up continuing for 20 years. I worked for four years, stopped for six years for reasons I describe in the book, and then I worked for another 10 years, and then I spent another 10 years digesting the work.

At this high-dose level, the work was not about personal transformation. With gentler psychedelics or lower doses, activation, purification, and healing might be constrained to personal levels. But with a very powerful psychedelic like this much LSD, you amplify consciousness so deeply that what may begin as a personal process becomes engagement with the collective— the collective unconscious, the species mind.

I also assumed there was an endpoint to this journey—enlightenment, union with God, the primal void. I had all of those experiences and discovered many levels of divinity and many levels of the pure, fertile void.

That takes us down to a deeper level underneath the soul. What is the essence of the soul, of our individuality—what makes this evolving individuality possible? In psychedelic work, we find the same answers as in the classic mystical traditions: the essence of the individual is the essence of the Divine. The essence of the one is the essence of the totality. We are, in essence, derived from the Divine—sparks of the Divine teased out of the unitive matrix and given the privilege of individuated existence, which is then polished and refined over thousands of years of going back and forth between spirit and matter, taking us along a developmental process.

One way my thinking has changed since writing Life Cycles, my first book, is a deeper appreciation of the synergistic relationship between individual development (individual karma) and collective development (collective karma). In the West, we tend to over-personalize karma, telling the story of the individual soul maturing over lifetimes and reaching enlightenment.

I do think we are at a turning point in history—a make-or-break point—and psychedelics have a significant role to play. They give us extra awareness when we desperately need it, and a form of accelerated, deep healing when we desperately need that. There is a tremendous inner fermentation and detoxification happening at the collective as well as individual level. It manifests in our individual lives as an up-rushing of karmic content, conditioning, pain, and trauma we’ve been carrying in our soul history. This is happening not just to a few middle-class individuals who can attend to it, but underneath our social movements and the world at large. Psychedelics, by amplifying consciousness—our own and the consciousness we are part of—help us heal and manage this purification process, and they widen our worldview. One good deep experience of communion with the deep structure of the universe can shatter materialism—the philosophy that matter is the only thing that's real. I think Huston Smith was right: a mystical experience does not a mystic make, but a mystical experience can an atheist unmake. How far will this go? How deep will psychedelic healing reach in our culture? How fast will insights realized under psychedelic communion contribute to the paradigm shift, which is being driven by multiple disciplines right now? I don't know.

Tucked around the edges, I was given visions of where humanity was in its evolutionary saga: that we were coming to a definitive turning point, an evolutionary pivot; that we were entering a magnificent period of profound transformation, with tremendous blessings; that the future of humanity would be radically unlike its present and past; and that some fundamental process was taking us there.

I wasn’t given details, a timetable, or how it would happen—just taken into a deep collective crisis. Then, when it was at its worst, we moved through it. On the other side, we had been changed—radically. There was an opening of the human heart, an opening of compassion—a profound change in what we’d classically call human nature. I’d describe it as a shift in the fundamental structure of the collective unconscious—a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche.

At one phase in this journey, I experienced all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before. I was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives, and I’d already written a book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But this was different: my former lives began coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They hit a critical mass and fused. There was an explosion of energy, and all these separate lives fused into one life. A burst of diamond light came out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. Then I was given a lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening.

So Life Cycles has been hailed as the first book to both describe the dynamics of rebirth and explore the ramifications of adopting a reincarnationist perspective. Now, this was published, what, about 35 years ago?\n\nChris Bache\nThereabouts. I started my psychedelic work after my first year as an academic. I worked for four years, then stopped for six. During that six-year interval, I did three years of past-life therapy, uncovering and working with my own former lives, and I wrote Life Cycles. By then my psychedelic work had gone deep enough to give me personal insights into karma—the deeper cause-and-effect that underlies our lives. I hadn’t yet had former-life experiences in a psychedelic context, though I had in hypnotherapy. The real foundation for Life Cycles was studying Ian Stevenson and later other pioneers documenting children and adults with validated past-life memories.", "char_len": 1079, "token_est": 269, "hash": "362a65"}

She wouldn’t communicate, but over time she showed Dr. Wambach how she felt—force-feeding her with a baby bottle because she herself felt treated like a helpless infant. When the doctor understood, the child began to come into herself—but she lost the reading and mathematics. Stories like that—what do you make of them?\n\nChris Bache\nThat our individual lives are much longer and more continuous than we tend to think. They don’t simply begin and end; there are overlaps. Once you understand the larger life of the soul, continuity of qualities—knowledge, learning, attitudes, traumas, virtues—can blend from one life into the start of another.

Stevenson’s research focuses on children who have active recall of their most immediate former life, but that’s a very unusual population—children with spontaneous memories who also tend to reincarnate very quickly, on average two and a half years, and often very near the circumstances of the previous life. Studies of broader populations who don’t have spontaneous recall indicate longer intervals between lifetimes and a much wider geographic radius.\n\nIn therapy, people come because of pain. Sometimes that pain is rooted in the most recent past life, but not always; it can reach back several lives. I think of our former lives like a deck of cards. We may have had 52 lives, but only a handful are “active” this time. Those few cards can come from different centuries, and only certain elements of them weave into the composite that makes up the present life. It’s not a simple linear progression. We return to the soul, which holds all our former lives, and the soul decides which combination to incarnate as the next life.\n\nSandy Sedgbeer\nYou mention the word soul, but in the book you distinguish between soul and oversoul.

I haven’t read the article, but once you move into a reincarnational worldview, the concept of identity shifts and expands. I accept this body and personality as my current identity, and in deep mystical experiences I might accept a universal principle as my deeper identity. The soul is an intermediate position: individual—my soul and your soul reflect different histories—but if you ask about the essence of the soul, it returns to the same mystical insight: the essence of one is the essence of all—the essence of the Divine, the cosmic intelligence. Shifting to reincarnation doesn’t undermine the value of this identity; it recontextualizes it within the soul’s identity—the meta-consciousness that holds, say, 100,000 years of lifetimes.\n\nSandy Sedgbeer\nIt’s hard to believe you have a different identity—that you’re not this self you’ve lived with for so many years.

But when you turn within and follow awareness deep enough to tap levels of self-awareness that predate your body, and you learn the stories that come from another life—experiences that feel distinctly “you” while also other than you—you know they are you.

But let me flip this a little. I’ve been teaching this for years and had generations of students come through my courses. One thing I’ve learned is you can’t read a book by its cover—you can’t judge a person’s soul development by what they’re dealing with. It’s like at a university: someone may have developed a great deal of expertise in music, then decide to start developing expertise in art. They let go of their expertise in music to start a whole new course regimen in art. If you looked only at what they do in art, you might think, “Oh, this person is a freshman,” when really they’re a very sophisticated senior with all these other skills. I think it’s that way for the soul too. Look at what you do: you’re an enormous influencer, hosting one spiritual dialog after another, touching thousands and thousands of people’s lives. If your soul were in the Bardo, in a pre-incarnate state, and you were given the opportunity to bring down some aspiration, some capacity and enthusiasm for exploring spiritual knowledge—not in a monastic context, but on a platform that reaches out into the world at a time when the world needs this knowledge—how could you not take it?

To me, at a simple level, when we separate from our body, the white light is our homing beacon, taking us back to our essential nature—our deeper spirit, our deeper divine nature. The classic idea is that people instinctively move toward the light and go as far as they feel comfortable. At some point along the way, for various reasons, people may feel less comfortable or it feels more natural to stop and drop off. They’re at the level of spiritual development where they feel most at home, among the thousands and thousands of levels of the Bardo. From that level, they eventually go through a process in which they make the choice to incarnate again. The admonition in most spiritual traditions is to do a kind of training that allows you to be comfortable with the light, so that you can follow it all the way home—through all the levels of the Bardo—to the most intense form of that light, which resides within what the Buddhists call an extra-samsara reality, a reality outside the entire reincarnating universe.

But it does give individuals too much autonomy for their spiritual welfare. In the historical context of the collapse of the Roman Empire and the emergence of a highly centralized Catholic authority, the Church saw this network of priests, bishops, cardinals, and the Pope as essential to the salvation of the Church and those it served.

From a reincarnation perspective, they didn’t do a good thing. It took us a long time to uncover this deeper teaching—that each of us is responsible for our relationship with the divine.

We enter the civilization of spiritual beings—the community of fellow soul travelers—enjoy the recess, the return to a more complete spiritual awareness of existence, and then, in time, gradually focus on the next challenge we set for ourselves. It’s like a university: you finish a semester, take your exams, digest and rest, then choose what you’ll take next semester. Newton shows these choices are made under the guidance and tutelage of our guides—more senior spiritual beings. We have options and some insight into the lives we’re choosing, and we make a choice: this particular set of challenges suits my needs at this point in my development, or it gives me an opportunity to be of service in new ways.

On heaven and hell: I think the Buddhists get closest with their basic vision that when we die, we enter a stage where what we are is mirrored back to us in our experience. If we’ve done good—been generous, kind, thoughtful—then that is mirrored back to us in the experience of heaven or heavenly beings. If we’ve done harm—selfish or stingy things that hurt people—then that is mirrored back to us, not as punishment but to educate us. This is the experience of hell.

If reincarnation is demonstrated as a fact—which I think it has been and is being—then Christianity will find out how it works and make room for it. All we have to do to incorporate reincarnation within a Christian framework is expand the notion of the age of the soul. We can even give Jesus a unique role in salvation history if we want to—we may also see him as part of a brotherhood and sisterhood of awakened beings helping humanity. But even if we want to make Jesus the unique savior in Christianity, all we have to do is open up the notion that the journey of the soul is a maturation that takes place over many lifetimes; it’s not finished in one. Then the inadequacies foisted on Christianity by the short-sighted assumption of only one lifetime fall away. If you live six days and die, there’s a consequence to that; or if you do something bad in the first ten years of your life, you could go to hell for the rest of your life—these are terrible consequences.

This is the theory of classrooms and fields of consciousness that came out of it.

If you believe this is the only life we have, you go one direction; if you believe we have multiple lifetimes, you go another. After graduate school, when I started teaching and reading more widely, I found an amazing body of evidence documenting that this is a true and legitimate part of life. None of my graduate courses had taken reincarnation seriously—neither the Western religions I studied nor the scientific traditions that displaced them in my mind. And here was Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia proving that reincarnation is a fact of life. I had to erase my entire intellectual blackboard and start over. If reincarnation is a fact of nature, then we’re living in a much different universe than I thought. My life since then has been an unfolding understanding of what that’s like. Just as we understand plate tectonics, galaxies giving birth to stars, and planets terraforming, there’s now this understanding that reincarnation is part of how nature carries forward and advances individual learning within certain species. Up to that point, evolution carries forward the learning of groups, but eventually individuality matures, and nature finds a way to fold individual learning forward into cascading accumulations of knowledge, wisdom, and experience.", "char_len": 1529, "token_est": 382, "hash": "b1e943"}

His book, Reincarnation: A Critical Examination, gathers a series of articles he wrote in 1986–87. Edwards, a major American philosopher and editor-in-chief of the eight-volume Encyclopedia of Philosophy, is the harshest critic of Stevenson. He accuses him of fraud and insufficient rigor, and of failing to prove there was no contact between the two families. But there’s a deeper logic operating: Edwards says reincarnation would represent a crucifixion of our understanding—by which he means secular humanism and the Newtonian-Cartesian scientific tradition. He argues that to believe in reincarnation you must accept six collateral assumptions: materialism is false; mind is not reducible to brain; our identity is more than personality; there is a domain other than space-time; death is an illusion; and there may be a deeper logic to our lives. He calls these assumptions surely fantastic, if not nonsense, and concludes that even absent specific flaws, a rational person will decide either that Stevenson’s reports are seriously defective or that the alleged facts can be explained without reincarnation.", "char_len": 1343, "token_est": 335, "hash": "c6cd49"}

He started as a Jungian and ended up in past-life therapy, even though, as you probably know, Carl Jung himself believed in reincarnation in the later years of his life but kept it quiet. It’s a wonderful, intellectually competent book with detailed cases and thoughtful discussion of their implications. Past-life therapy exploded in the ’70s and ’80s, and many therapists were concerned there was no graduate curriculum to establish credentials. Winifred Lucas took on that task with a magnificent two-volume anthology, a compendium of the best work at that time in past-life therapy.

She looked into past-life therapy, learned the field, and helped her own child resolve trauma carried over from a previous life that was spontaneously bubbling up.

I must confess a special partiality. If you were to pick out one or two books from this entire list, I hope you’d read Michael Newton. He was a hypnotherapist who got into past-life therapy. Then he accidentally discovered that his clients, in deep hypnosis, could not only remember previous lives but also what happened after they died. Basically, they were beginning to describe the afterlife. He didn’t think this was possible, but he followed his clients—good therapist that he is. He took hundreds of people into deep hypnotic regressions, followed them through their former life, their death experience, and then into their memories beyond death. He asked careful questions and kept detailed notes—what was going on, what was it like? Regardless of background—fundamentalist Baptist, Karl Marxist, atheist, hardcore scientific reductionist—people described the same fundamental reality in the after-death state: a world with order, structure, and logic, a social structure where older learners teach younger learners. And it’s a world where people make the choice to reincarnate as a conscious, careful decision, much like selecting courses in college—once you sign up, you’re committed for the whole semester. In the spiritual world, the choice of what life to take is made consciously under the guidance of spiritual helpers and in cooperation with the other people you’ll incarnate with.

Ian Stevenson’s evidence is the most powerful for reincarnation. It liberates our thinking at one level but constricts it at another, because the strongest evidence comes from lives that show the tightest correlation. The correlation can be so tight that if you just study Stevenson’s evidence, it can lead to an anemic, underdeveloped vision of what life is like when most of us die. Stevenson’s cases are not typical. These children are coming back very fast and very close to home. Most people spend much more “time” in the timeless condition of the spirit world and have a wider breadth of experiences. So Stevenson liberates us to think about the soul and our existence in a larger framework, but to actually fill in that canvas—to explore more deeply what happens when we die and what the larger circle of life is like, from expanded consciousness to contracted consciousness and back—we need other bodies of data.

We had a choice between a man and a woman—a particular kind of man with a particular worldview and a woman with a particular worldview—and collectively we chose, I think, the worse of the choices. We chose regressively, looking backward, trying to hold on to what we had instead of facing the uncertainty of the future with vision and courage. This will hurt us for years. Decisions will be made; things will get worse. I don’t know whether that’s ultimately bad or good—maybe things will get worse faster than if we had had wisdom at the leadership level. We’ll see. It may be years before we recognize and recover from the political decisions enacted over the next decade under the influence of this election. We hit a choice point between wisdom and foolishness.

With reincarnation, karma and rebirth became entwined: since you have karma, you have to reincarnate to keep working on the wheel. Is karma really bound to reincarnation? For those who’ve met the divine presence and incredible love, life feels like an honor. Is reincarnation an act of honor and giving back, or is it bound to karma?

The physical universe has a lot of cause-and-effect running; the spiritual, conscious universe has a lot of cause-and-effect coming. But the question is how we interpret that pattern. I think we’ve been interpreting it too narrowly for a long time. If you listen to past-life therapy, if you read a lot of past-life therapy, you could justifiably come away with the conclusion that life is basically about healing—that we fuck up a lot, we have a lot of fixing up to do—and you could develop a negative perception of what carries over from the past. There’s so much mess-up and cleanup that’s needed when, in fact, I think most people pass their karmic tests. Most of the kids in a school system graduate; they go to the next level.

In soul retrieval, we retrieve alienated, split-off portions of our soul. To do that, we have to heal those portions and integrate them—welcome them back into unity. I think the same thing is happening in our historical process.

Once you understand that the dynamic principles of evolution are playing themselves out in other solar systems and galaxies, and you run the numbers, it’s kind of like: there’s got to be intelligent life out there. If we can incarnate, then they can incarnate. Distance is immaterial. There are people who have conscious recall of having been a life form on another planet. I can’t remember her name, but there’s a woman who does past-life therapy with a major focus on helping people integrate incarnations from other planetary lifetimes. Do a little digging around. I personally don’t have conscious recall of such, though I was at a spiritual workshop where a teacher had recall that he, I, and one other person there had shared another planetary system in another incarnation.

Reincarnation doesn’t end the questions; it begins a rich vein of questions. It opens possibilities because it relieves us from the terrible burden of time. When we ask, “What do we want to be? What do we want to become?” we should be thinking in terms of 10,000-year increments, not 100. Do you want to become a Beethoven? A Mozart? A great poet, a great artist? We have unlimited time. The universe wants us to develop all the talents latent within this human form.\n\nThe diamond soul is going to function at a much higher level of sensory experience—vision more refined, intense, clarified; all the physical senses. It’s not just an open heart or an open mind, but the entire physical body animated into higher orders of self-realization. The Divine is shoving together—think of it as green reality—earth and light, pure light, spiritual reality. We’re forging more and more into each other until we become green—spiritual beings filled with light, radiating with light.

I began as a pretty well-educated, dedicated agnostic with strong atheistic inclinations—that's where all the years of graduate school had brought me. But just when I started teaching, I came across the work of Stanislav Grof, and his book Realms of the Human Unconscious changed the direction of my life.

I never let my students know, and most of my faculty never knew. I continued for 20 years.

Then I spent another 20 years digesting those experiences—writing about them, integrating them, trying to integrate them. I've written two books based on those experiences. One is Dark Night, Early Dawn, which came out in 2000, and probably the more important one for a wide audience is LSD in the Mind of the Universe, which came out in 2019.

I think it's worth pointing out there were points where you were vomiting so hard for so long that the vessels in your eyeballs ruptured. It didn't sound like a whole lot of fun to me. And you also had your then wife, who was a trained psychologist—psychotherapist? I can't remember—but she was very good at holding the space. So you had a lot of anchoring. And it still sounds like the early part of every single journey was living hell, as far as I can tell. Would that be fair?\n\nChris Bache\nYes.

I thought I was doing the work for personal transformation, personal healing, maybe even personal enlightenment. But the method was so powerful it pushed beyond all those categories, and I had to reframe my understanding of the boundaries of conscientious psychedelic work. I dropped the model of personal transformation and opened into a model of collective transformation. For years I had experiences where the shadow I was engaging was not my personal shadow—I did that work—but a collective shadow. The pain and excruciating suffering I was processing had to do with the pain of my entire species. I came to understand that there is a collective psyche that holds the trauma of humanity’s history, just as our individual psyche holds our individual trauma, and this collective pain encumbers the free functioning of the collective psyche, just as our personal trauma encumbers our individual health and well-being. By doing this work, I began to understand that something in the universe was using my sessions to make a small contribution to healing the collective psyche in order to make it more available to the influx of energy from divine consciousness—allowing it to manifest more completely in humanity.", "char_len": 1449, "token_est": 362, "hash": "37df8f"}

The pain of our history—the karma of our narrowness, our smallness, our trying to live within the framework of individual ego at the cost of anyone else’s well-being—keeps us locked away, insensitive to this incoming light. In any mystical development, before there’s a breakthrough into non-dual or unitive consciousness, there’s a dark night of the soul where you have to let go of the obstacles and blocks. I think this is happening at a collective level, not only inside intense psychedelic sessions, but everywhere. If you’re doing past-life therapy, many of the lives that come up to be cleansed are not necessarily your personal former lives; they can be lives within the system. Social movements to end child abuse, to end abuse of our daughters, to end racism, to end speciesism—these movements are tackling pains much deeper than our personal pain.

The message was that we were coming into a time of radical, pivotal breakthrough—a before-and-after moment—where the past would quickly become irrelevant because something fundamentally new was emerging. But for years it never showed me how nature was going to accomplish this; I had no idea. Then, in 1995, I had a fundamental experience. By this time I was working at very deep levels; I was into the diamond luminosity material. This session broke me open. It dissolved my mind into the species mind, and then asked the consciousness of the species. I understand how radical that assertion is, and I don’t take it lightly. The species mind opened and took me into future time—what I call deep time. In that future, I experienced the death and rebirth of humanity. I experienced humanity coming to an absolute breaking point—a breakdown, an unraveling of fundamental trust and convictions within our culture, a deep, systematic breaking down until the entire planet, it seemed, was faced with the task of mere survival. It looked like an extinction event. At first it looked like that was it—we had overloaded the system so badly, overdrawn the ecological balance sheet of the planet so badly, that we weren’t going to come out of it. But then, just when things were at their worst, things began to get lighter. People who had been brought to their knees began to stand up. We began to reconstellate. After these crises—and I don’t know how long they will last; I think of this as a three-generational pivot—I can’t imagine it lasting less than that. The 21st century is a major pivot, and we know by 2030, 2040, 2050 we’ll be facing worsening environmental crises. What I think is happening is that, by the time we go through this crisis, we will crack open something so deep in the human spirit, so deep in the human psyche, that what will emerge is a literally transformed humanity—not simply transformed individuals, but a transformation of the fundamental substructure of the human psyche. I think of this as a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective unconscious, so that every human being born after this period will experience consciousness within a collective psyche different from how we experienced it in the 19th and 20th centuries.", "char_len": 2563, "token_est": 640, "hash": "0c31f3"}

In other sessions, I was taken far into the future and experienced this new archetype. I believe in reincarnation—my first book was on reincarnation—and from a philosopher’s perspective, I think the empirical evidence is overwhelming. It’s always been part of my thinking, based on the evidence, not religious belief. I experienced reincarnation dynamics many times in my sessions—not only my personal reincarnational history, but reincarnation as a dynamic process for the entire planet. The entire species is pulsing in the rhythm of reincarnation. If reincarnation is a basic fact of life, then we have been building the future human for hundreds of thousands of years, growing bit by bit.

There came a moment where they seemed to hit critical mass, and when they fused into one, there was an explosion of diamond light from my heart. I was catapulted into a state of consciousness where I was an individual, but far beyond Chris Bache—an individuality I had never known before. I came to call this the birth of the diamond soul. Many people are experiencing this; they give it different names. My language is simply my way of describing it. I think the soul—which holds all our former life history—is waking up inside our historical existence and supplanting egoic existence. We have lived egoic existence for thousands of years, but the ego has driven the planet into red-line conditions—unacceptable, stressful conditions—and now we either grow up or go extinct. Growing up, I think, amounts to owning the deep history and deep consciousness that is our truer nature. It’s all divine, of course, but the form of the divine here is our soul nature. And it’s not just individuals waking up—nature is putting enormous pressure to wake up the entire species. The entire species is becoming a species of Christs, a species of Buddhas, a species of prophets—of great spiritual saints and sages of history. That’s the pivot we’re trying to make: growing up, taking the long view—the seven-generation view. When the soul wakes up, our whole history becomes dynamically alive within us.

One: this transition will take the entire resources of the human family. There is no one formula. It will take everything we have—scientific knowledge, economic knowledge, political skills, educational skills, medical skills—to move us through. Two: based on years of studying the past-life literature, my assumption is that each of us has chosen where and when to incarnate with a certain prevision of what we’re getting into—what will be the dominant themes of that incarnation and the resources available within it. This is part of our incarnational psychic makeup. That means each of us is already positioned by our soul to make a contribution to this transition. So it’s not a matter of looking around outside of oneself; it’s a matter of looking deeply into where we are and what we are.

Not the “I saw you in the dream last night; you did this,” and I have no awareness of it. That we move to methods of human networking similar to—but beyond—the digital networking of the last 20 years. Are you seeing anything approaching that? Or, if not, can you speak to what is happening in terms of a collective community?", "char_len": 1001, "token_est": 250, "hash": "842721"}

At the forefront of that research is therapeutic healing. That’s what’s bringing psychedelics back into the intellectual and clinical community—the capacity of these amplifying substances to bring forward the personal unconscious, unearth its wounds, and assist, deepen, and accelerate healing from trauma, PTSD, depression, and related issues. A second, overlapping use is promoting spiritual awakening—awakening to our deeper nature beneath the personality and deepening our experience of the wisdom, intelligence, and consciousness of the universe. That’s why I got started: to deepen my spiritual awakening. But the protocol I used was so strong and evocative that within a few years I was having experiences far beyond therapeutic healing or spiritual awakening. Over time, I came to understand I was engaged in cosmological exploration—a systematic attempt to explore the deep structure of spiritual reality, the consciousness of the universe itself. I’m not a clinician; I’m trained as a philosopher of religion. What interested me in Stan Grof’s early work was the capacity of these substances to lay bare not only personal issues but to enter into deep communion with the consciousness behind existence.", "char_len": 1401, "token_est": 350, "hash": "02bd03"}

No one should venture into these waters without really good, high-quality professional guides to keep you safe. My protocol was high doses of LSD—500 to 600 micrograms. Looking back, I think, what was I thinking? That was ridiculous. But I had a deep hunger to explore the nature of existence, and working at these high doses took me on the adventure of a lifetime. Still, it’s very demanding work requiring concentration, safeguards, and a lot of time to assimilate. Knowing what I know now, I strongly recommend against the protocol I used.

I was then a fairly convinced, atheistically inclined agnostic. Then I encountered two people’s work: Ian Stevenson, whose research on reincarnation convinced me it was a simple fact of life; and Stanislav Grof. I read Grof’s Realms of the Human Unconscious in 1978, two years after it came out. I recognized it had tremendous significance not only for psychotherapy but for philosophy of religion and consciousness. I knew that if I was going to make a contribution in this field, I had to undergo my own therapeutic exploration. Very uncomfortably, I decided to break the law in what I hoped was a disciplined, restrained way and began a series of sessions that, much to my surprise, lasted 20 years. I worked for four years, stopped for six, then worked another 10, finishing in 1999. I spent the next 20 years digesting, analyzing, sifting, and sorting these experiences, and then wrote LSD and the Mind of the Universe in 2019, 20 years after I stopped my sessions.\n\nEmmy Vadnais: Can you give us a sense of what your sessions were like—how you began, your sitter, and how you set up set and setting?", "char_len": 1287, "token_est": 321, "hash": "09812f"}

I lay down with eye shades and headphones—classic deep introspection—using carefully curated music to support the opening, peak, and closing. The idea is to profoundly energize the unconscious and then create an environment where the energies rising can be engaged cleanly. If you stay in contact with the physical world—dialoguing with friends or going to a concert—that’s fine, but it’s not what this work is about.

I eventually developed spiritual protocols I adopted in the weeks leading up to and following a session—especially the day or two before and after.

Changing variables changes the subtlety of the interface between your mind and the universe’s mind.

What I found was a protocol of spiritual exploration that took me deeper than I imagined possible. After a couple of years, I developed an aptitude for working in these states. I never stopped meditating—I always meditated, did yoga, and various practices. In fact, the deeper you want to go with psychedelics, the more important a daily spiritual practice becomes to anchor and absorb what you unleash. Psychedelics gave me access to states you can reach with meditation, but typically only with many lifetimes of practice.

Can you take us further into your sessions to give us a taste of what that was like for you?\nChris Bache: That’s hard because of context. Some very influential books were based on a limited number of psychedelic experiences. Aldous Huxley wrote The Doors of Perception after one mescaline experience. Huston Smith wrote his reflections after taking LSD six times. Michael Pollan’s helpful book was also after a handful of experiences. The challenge with my work is how long the journey was and how many layers of consciousness opened. It’s not simply opening 73 times to the same interface. There’s a cycle of death and rebirth that reproduces itself. Death breaks you free of one level of reality—physical reality initially—and takes you into a nonphysical spiritual reality. You work there for a while, and if you work consistently, you go through another death and rebirth into another level, where you learn that level’s rules, and so on. Focusing on any one level leaves out many others. Eventually, when putting the whole together, I distinguished five broad categories my sessions fell into: personal mind—your personal unconscious and story; collective mind—the collective psyche, humanity’s species mind; archetypal mind—which for me was more Platonic than Jungian, dimensions outside time and space and outside the collective psyche; causal levels of reality—where oneness becomes the dominant reality; and beyond that, diamond luminosity—a particularly clear dimension of light I worked with in the last five years.

Can you share what that was like for you?\nChris Bache: In the early stage at the level of personal mind, the pain and suffering took the form Stan Grof discusses as the perinatal level—sometimes reliving birth and confronting the fundamental existential questions of life in physical reality. Is there meaning, order, design, intelligence? At the physical level, everything we love will be destroyed at death. Is there any reality beyond death? You have to face the deepest levels of metaphysical angst until your identity is crushed and shattered. That’s easier for some than others, but you must surrender your time-space identity to gain access to the next level. At that next level, I continued a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence—so deep and prolonged, encompassing so many hundreds of thousands of persons over thousands of years, that I concluded it wasn’t a cleansing of my personal psyche. Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective. Then further deaths and rebirths followed, where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness with God or the mind of the universe, our historical consciousness is too small—if you want to literally experience it, not just think it. To immerse yourself in communion with these levels, your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity. Eventually you enter levels where it would misrepresent things to say “Chris Bache went and had those experiences.” Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved, for these levels of consciousness to manifest inside my awareness. The fact that I remember them doesn’t mean my personality was present when they were had.

Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space.

In my late work at very deep levels of divine communion, I had the experience that the divine level I was in would come to a crescendo and open into a higher level of divine communion than had been actualized up to that point. Sri Aurobindo says the Divine looking down sees all the levels it has manifested, but it’s a one-way mirror: we, as the Divine looking up, tend to see only the level we’re at. That means even at deep levels there are aspects of divine consciousness that cannot see still deeper levels. Somehow, when we do this work, we can facilitate a communion between two different levels of divine consciousness, far beyond space-time and personal reality. There is a celebratory joy when the Divine wakes up to a still deeper level of itself—when the higher infuses itself more deeply into the lower.

When I went beyond archetypal reality into causal reality, all dualisms dissolved. You experience the world—whatever aspect you’re encountering—as a unified, single entity, a single consciousness. Plotinus says, “The world breathes as one.” There’s a radical transparency where you encounter the wholeness of life that doesn’t negate differentiation; it affirms it, as different manifestations of a single, undivided whole we call God, the Divine, or the One.

It manifests at early, middle, and advanced stages. In the end, you recognize you’re always in dialogue with a profound creative intelligence which, interestingly, feels more like a “she” to me than a “he.” I associate the feminine side of God with creation, and the masculine with radical transcendence.

It shattered and overwhelmed me. I experienced that existence was generated not only by sheer power—think of the Big Bang—but by love, a profound cosmic love. The act of creation itself is love—not anything like human love, but the very fiber of the Divine. You can think of love and oneness as two sides of reality: if the world is truly one, love is the emotion of oneness—oneness asserting itself in a world of duality.\n\nThis surprised me.

We could describe the divine nature as infinite knowledge, infinite power, infinite love—all equally true—and I’m sure there are other qualities we could add. The challenge of understanding the love aspect of the Divine is that life, as we experience it, is often dirty, nasty, mean, and cruel. Any suggestion that the world, with all of its pain and suffering, is a manifestation of a supremely loving consciousness is horrendously difficult to reconcile, and I understand that as a philosopher of religion. The only way of overcoming that challenge is to understand the deep structure, the deep intentionality manifesting in creation—in our evolving universe, in the project of the universe.

One way of talking about it is the birth of oneness. Oneness, instead of being a private mystical experience for a select few, was born within the human psyche as a whole. We tapped certain depths of our nature that allowed us to stop being enemies with each other. The divisions of history—race, class, religion, national identity—were transcended. We began to experience a fundamental oneness at the core of our life and all life.

Once you dissolve into the Divine Light, into Diamond Luminosity, into the crystalline nature of consciousness at a very deep level, coming back into time and space is difficult. You lose your zest for living inside time and space when you know how much more is available outside of it. Going in and coming out, again and again, became too painful. Eventually, my beloved and I agreed I would not return to these states until I could stay there forever. That lies behind my stopping.

You shatter consciousness. You blow it all apart, which is dangerous unless you’re really prepared, seat belt fastened tight, strong support system, good clinical grounding, and a solid sense of self. It’s not wise to blow yourself apart that often. I found I had a capacity—and astrologically, it’s in my chart. I have a capacity to open—spacious, Neptune, deep states—and then I congeal easily. So the opening and expanding I could manage, and over the first few years I found I could navigate this domain. I developed an interest in working this hard because what interested me wasn’t clinical or creative applications. It was LSD’s capacity to take me into states where I could truly enter into communion with the intelligence of the universe, and then that intelligence would teach me. You open, go deep, clean up your house, then when you’re clean and take in this larger field, it speaks to you. I’ve often wished I had advanced degrees in quantum physics and astronomy, because I would have understood more of what it was teaching me.

Where is reincarnation taking humanity? Where are we going?\nReincarnation lifts the restriction of time. We’re reincarnating—there’s no place to go after you leave here; you come back, you leave, you come back. You begin to open a time horizon that may be the horizon the divine thinks in. The divine does not think in small-term projects, or personal projects; it thinks in large projects, species projects, planetary projects, galactic-size projects. The challenge becomes: how do we let ourselves begin to experience in galactic-size projects? First, unlock the barrier of linear time—to go beyond the confines of this moment, as magnificent as it is. Of course, the divine lives in the present moment, so many spiritual practices focus on deepening the present. But in psychedelic work, there is a potential to transcend the limits of the present. When you step outside linear time and enter what I call deep time—many dimensions and levels of time—the universe experiences itself through different modalities of time. It will take you into deep, vast expanses where you can experience 100,000 years in the course of an hour. You can accelerate time beyond your personal story into humanity’s story, into the larger evolution the divine intent is seeding and nourishing in the human community. Where are we going as a collective? Sri Aurobindo, the great Oxford-educated Hindu sage, said humanity is a transitional species. We’re not stable.

Huston Smith, the great don of religious studies, wrote Cleansing the Doors of Perception after taking LSD only six times; he stopped because the bummers seemed to increase and it wasn’t as useful to him. To me, that’s when it starts to get interesting. When the bummers increase, deep purification is taking place—something’s coming forward that’s hard to deal with.

There was a point in my sessions when the teacher—the only teacher I’ve ever had, the consciousness of the universe itself—seemed intent on showing me where reincarnation is taking us. I experienced all my former lives coming back into me, fast and furious. I had done past-life therapy and had a sense of my history, but this was larger. They were all coming back very quickly, like wrapping kite string around a spool. These lives were coming back, and eventually they fused into one. With that fusion there was an explosion of energy inside my chest—my first deep contact with diamond light. I was catapulted into a state of consciousness where I was an individual—not losing all boundaries and entering oneness—but an individual beyond any frame of reference I’d known. I came to understand this is where reincarnation is taking all of us. We die, we come back; we die, we expand into the soul; we return to incarnate life; we die, we expand into the soul again, and we keep this rhythm of expansion and contraction. If we keep it up for hundreds of thousands of years, doesn’t it make sense that the totality of our lives—which we meet when we die and return to our total soul—would eventually incarnate inside time and space?", "char_len": 1406, "token_est": 351, "hash": "931cca"}

I was raised in the Deep South, in Mississippi. I was a seminarian in the early days—studying to be a Catholic priest—but eventually left because celibacy and I didn’t get along very well. I got degrees in theology and New Testament criticism and eventually philosophy of religion from Brown University—very classical, very traditional upbringing. The psychedelic ’60s passed me by entirely.\n\nIt wasn’t until I began teaching in 1978 and was looking around for where to take my research that I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof. His book Realms of the Human Unconscious was a life changer. I saw immediately the philosophical significance of his work. If what he was saying was true, it had profound implications for how we could do philosophy in the future—not just healing, but exploring the metaphysical underlying structure of reality.

During my day job, I was a traditional member of the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State; my “night job” was working with psychedelics—healing my own psyche, exploring the deep structure of the collective psyche, and what lies beyond. I worked for four years, stopped for six years for reasons I give in the book, then resumed for another 10. Basically, between 30 and 50 years old, I did 73 high-dose LSD sessions using a tight therapeutic protocol, and then I took another 20 years to digest and assimilate those experiences and connect the dots before publishing LSD and the Mind of the Universe in 2019.\n\nAfter I finished my sessions, in one of my meditations I heard a voice say, “20 years in, 20 years out,” which I took to mean it would take at least 20 years to integrate and digest those experiences. That might have been overly optimistic; I don’t think I’ve nearly integrated all the experiences I collected in those first 20 years.\n\nEmmy Vadnais:\nSo you feel like you’re still integrating the experiences?", "char_len": 1183, "token_est": 295, "hash": "6f157a"}

It raises substantial intellectual questions: how do you possibly integrate experiences that so radically transcend the conditions of time and space and our consciousness inside time and space? If you have temporary experiences that go radically beyond spatial consciousness and linear time, what does it even mean to integrate them? What does integration look like when you’re dealing with such radical experiences? With lower-dose work or gentler psychedelics, where experiences come closer to your world inside time and space, integration is less demanding. But if you really open the very deep waters of the psyche, integration becomes a more substantive issue.\n\nEmmy Vadnais:\nWe’re getting lots of questions.

I’ll go with whatever definition they come up with as long as it’s sufficiently broad to incorporate the total phenomenology of consciousness. Simply, consciousness comes from “con” + “scire”—to know. Consciousness is that with which we know—the knowing function, the awareness through which we know anything else.\n\nWe have a tendency to think consciousness fits inside our skull, but increasingly we realize that’s inadequate because of empirical parapsychological research. I think of consciousness as a field that our brain allows us to consolidate and structure inside our physical existence. In its own right, it’s a field—open-ended. If you ask how big that field is, you get into the cosmological adventure. If you go deep into your psyche, you drop first into the personal unconscious. Keep pushing deeper and you drop into the collective psyche—Jung’s territory. Go deeper still and drop below the entire psyche of the human species; you transcend the species psyche.

If you’re prepared, disciplined, trained to navigate those transitions, and working with professionals who can help you, okay. But many people are best working in gentler techniques—yoga, meditation, trance dancing—approaches that have the same amplifying effect in a more gentle fashion. We can do a great deal of very good work without taking psychedelics at all.\n\nIn fact, many people who have written me have never taken psychedelics—or took them once or twice early in life—but have been meditators for 40 or 50 years.

It was quite successful, but the protocol limited high-dose work to three sessions. I came along years later and thought, if you could work successfully three times, you could do it more than three. I adopted that protocol. Over time I learned I had an aptitude for working at those levels.

The experiences were not deeply transformative. I personally think part of the reason is the short window versus a long-acting, large window. Then again, even a psychedelic like LSD is relatively short-acting compared to meditational practices where the window is open much longer.

A bit of background: “Diamond Luminosity” points to states of consciousness I entered in the last five years of my work. I had already gone through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal process and a really solid ego death. I had entered what I later called the ocean of suffering at the collective psyche level, gone into archetypal reality, causal-level reality—many adventures—and I felt philosophically satiated and complete.

I had accessed light many times before; the light is a signature of radically expanded divine states of consciousness. But when I talk about Diamond Luminosity, I mean a particular state: a hyper-clear state of consciousness. Because I know the Buddhist literature better than other traditions (at least the mystical side), I correlate it with what the Buddhists call Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality—the foundational metaphysical structure, the light out of which the Big Bang emerges and gives birth to the physical universe. So it doesn’t have anything to do with physical diamonds, but it does relate to what the Diamond Sutra points toward, and Vajrayana—vajra meaning diamond.

What does your daily practice look like, or what would you recommend?\n\nChris Bache:\nThe longer I worked with psychedelics, the more I appreciated the importance of a daily spiritual practice. Conscientious psychedelic work opens your system to a vast field of consciousness—deeper, larger—and to enormous flows of energy. Each step into deeper consciousness is a step into higher energy. To stabilize at that level, you have to acclimate to that energy, which requires intense purification processes—often like fire, solar flares, volcanic energy—transforming your being so you can live for hours at a time at very deep levels where the world works differently, where causal-level reality is a different physics, a different landscape of consciousness.", "char_len": 985, "token_est": 246, "hash": "9204ed"}

Meditation also gives you an environment to assess the cognitive content of your sessions and to process the energy ignited in them.\n\nIn the chapter on Diamond Luminosity, I talk about integrating Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice. I didn’t begin Vajrayana until about the time I was entering Diamond Luminosity. Carol brought me into the Vajrayana tradition by doing a Chud practice for me before one of my sessions. The window that opened—this was my 45th session, so I had a lot of history—was wider, deeper, and stayed open longer than earlier sessions.

The challenge is doing justice to how many layers of consciousness I went through over this 20-year journey. Many important psychedelic books are based on a much smaller number of sessions, which tends to create expectations that shrink the metaphysical window. Aldous Huxley’s The Doors of Perception was written after one mescaline session. Huston Smith’s Cleansing the Doors of Perception gathers a lifetime of writing on psychedelics, but he only did LSD six times. After that he said the bummers increased and he took Alan Watts’s advice: once you get the message, hang up the phone. That suggests there are only a small number of messages you might get—which may be true for a couple of sessions.

You can't contain consciousness within the ego's structure. A lot of people spill a lot of ink and sweat over the ego's complexity and durability, but from a spiritual perspective, when you get right down to it, it's not that hard to take apart.

When I went through my major ego-death experience, the universe snapped me like a twig.\nIt didn't involve derealization; it involved a frightening confrontation because I was turned into the exact opposite of everything I’d known myself to be. I had known myself as a man, an intellectual, white, passionately concerned with the meaning of existence. In this critical session, I was turned into women—women of color—women with no philosophical expectations or interests at all. It was the perfect hell for a male academic philosopher. It scared the bajibas out of me. When I let go and allowed myself to become these women, I immediately relaxed and was taken under the arm of the Great Mother into an extraordinary journey into the lives of women—hundreds and hundreds of them. After the session, as I came back, my male identity reasserted itself—I like being a man—but I knew my masculinity, my whiteness, and my intellect would never confine me the way they had before. The problem wasn't women or non-intellectual issues; it was the tight fit my social identity had on my consciousness, and that had to be broken. It was as if the universe said, “Listen: where you're going, gender does not exist. Let go.” When I let go, I entered states that don't differentiate male and female, then states that don't differentiate human and nonhuman, and then states beyond space and time entirely.", "char_len": 1402, "token_est": 350, "hash": "7b62f2"}

It’s nice to see your faces. By way of brief introduction, I made my living as a university professor in Ohio. I taught in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State—courses in religious studies, Eastern religion, the psychology of mysticism, comparative spirituality, Eastern thought. But what brings me here today isn’t that work; it’s my work with psychedelics, which I did for 20 years while I was an academic.

It tells the story of where I went over 20 years of working with LSD, following a protocol established by Stan Grof in psychedelic therapy—totally isolated, with headphones, eyeshades, music, all the traditional trappings—except I worked with very high doses. I did 73 sessions over 20 years, working with between 500–600 micrograms. I don’t recommend this protocol. I wouldn’t do it the same way if I were starting over, but that’s what I did, and this is the story.\n\nWhen someone asks what it’s like to take doses that high, I say it’s like being in the middle of a nuclear explosion. It shatters the dimensions of your mind and the boundaries of consciousness. If you keep it up for long periods, it reveals levels of reality beyond time–space.

This confused me because, like many who work with psychedelics, I thought I was doing the work for personal benefit—to heal or enlighten myself, to accelerate my spiritual development—basically self-referencing. But the ocean of suffering went on so long and was so challenging, involving so many thousands of people, that it shattered the model I brought to psychedelics. I abandoned an individual model of transformation and adopted a collective model. I came to believe that entering the ocean of suffering was facilitating a healing not centered on my personal life or soul, but on the collective psyche of humanity—that something was using my sessions to drain toxins in the human psyche, residues of unresolved trauma from thousands of years of war and the terrible things we’ve done to each other.", "char_len": 1138, "token_est": 284, "hash": "7f3e37"}

In deep, non-ordinary states, if we choose or if it’s our karma, we participate in processes that facilitate the direct healing and transformation of our species—our deep family. There is no private self in the world. We are part of a species; our species is part of Earth’s ecosystem; Earth is part of the galaxy, and so on.

From the mystical traditions we learn that before great awakening there is great death; before mystical oneness, the dark night of the soul. Humanity as a whole was entering the dark night of its soul: intense purification, a confrontation with our historical karma and self-imposed limitations. I experienced a complete collapse of civilization as we know it—an implosion seemingly driven by an ecological crisis so deep it triggered a global systems disintegration. At the depth of this death process—when it looked like an extinction event—the worst of the storm passed, like a hurricane over a Pacific island. The survivors got up and began anew—and they were different human beings. In the depths of death and rebirth, we let go of fundamental beliefs, values, and patterns of the past and engaged the future as different humans—with an expanded heart, a profound innate sense of the oneness of existence and of other human beings, and a deeper transparency to the mind of the universe as a whole.

We’ve used psilocybin and ayahuasca for thousands of years, so strong fields are associated with them. LSD is relatively young and, in my experience, unusually clean—less cultural or historical overlay.\n\nRemember, I was working at higher levels than I recommend—500 to 600 micrograms. At those levels, LSD tends to drive to the high cosmological ceiling. Psilocybin is more body-grounded; the states it awakens are closer to where we live in our bodies.

Biologically, research from places like Imperial College shows increased connectivity between brain regions—areas that don’t normally communicate start talking to each other, a kind of hyperconnectivity. Cognitively, this helps explain synaesthesia, divergent thinking, increased creativity, cognitive flexibility, and so on.\n\nPsychologically, they connect us with ourselves—access to unconscious material, shadow, personal history, past traumas—and, with guidance, the possibility of resolving prior traumas.

These states can increase our connection to nature—which is vital right now. We see increased eco-consciousness or biophilia, and more interspecies connection.

These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially; when these are found, they are just more beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind, there are no limits.” He added, after near-death experiences, “In the province of the body, there are certain limits not to be transcended.” Two points flow from this. First, beliefs shape reality—but they can also be prisons. Our convictions can make us convicts. Confirmation bias pulls us down rabbit holes where we bootstrap our own dogmas. This plays out in science, where the academy’s a priori dogmatic reliance on materialist reductionism—neuroreductionist physicalism—frames the organism and consciousness as mechanistic, life as devoid of real sentience. Those limiting beliefs constrain the questions scientists even ask. Fields like transpersonal psychology and parapsychology don’t get funded, so they don’t get a strong voice in the dominant paradigm. I’m making an argument for agnosticism and plurality—be open to many worldviews and be wary of belief in general.

We can talk to Dean Radin about this. I suspect Chris would back it up from his LSD sessions. Physics theory increasingly converges conceptually with parapsychology: time is seen as subjective; human experience of time is illusory; precognition grows more plausible.\n\nFinally, everything is connected. That’s one thing parapsychology, psychedelics, and transpersonal psychology have shown: we can transcend time and space—precognition, empathy, clairvoyance, synchronicity—though that’s circumscribed by our beliefs. As a result, we should act with openness and transparency, with compassion and a spirit of reciprocity, and move away from all the “-isms”—including ones that get little airtime: ethnocentrism, species-centrism, and cognocentrism, the view that only one state of consciousness is valued.

The deepest breakthroughs into ecstatic knowing and visionary knowledge came after the deepest purification.

Most of their focus is on neuropsychopharmacology: how these substances work in the brain and what that reveals about the nature of consciousness. There’s been a lot of neuroimaging work with MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, and DMT. I’m collaborating on the DMT study, looking at slow infusion to bring people into high-dose breakthrough experiences over extended periods, exploring both the neuroscience and the phenomenology—what comes out of those experiences. As a parapsychologist, I’m also interested in shared visionary experiences: can two people on DMT at the same time, prolonged and side by side but separated, show correlated brain activity beyond what you’d expect if they did it at different times? And do their experiences show any correlation when they set an intention to have a shared journey? That takes us into pretty far-out transpersonal realms. That’s just the tip of the iceberg—there’s great research, survey work, and collaborations with retreat centers.", "char_len": 1398, "token_est": 349, "hash": "f328eb"}

Chris, you want to go first?\nChris Bache\nGoodness—that is a large one. The universe has been unfolding for around 13.7 billion years, and we don’t see evidence it’s stopping anytime soon. Any attempt to define the purpose of life will be inadequate given the enormity of the project. What we can project may carry us a certain distance, but not through the entire process. For me, central is learning, loving, deeply experiencing, opening—exploring and expanding our capacities. Exploring is really important. One time, in a deep encounter with a creative, nameless, faceless intelligence, I was moving between nonbeing—the pure void—and being, the universe. That oscillation generated the question: what is the purpose of existence? This consciousness said to me, “Have we not learned anything?” It shattered me; I broke down and wept. It felt like it was all about learning. I’m not persuaded by the idea that consciousness is trying to learn something about itself, but that learning is central to the entire project seems really important.\n\nDaniel Pinchbeck\nOkay, David—what have you got for us?", "char_len": 1170, "token_est": 292, "hash": "506fdf"}

We’re on a quest for meaning. Asking about the meaning and nature of the universe is a human endeavor. I’m not sure all species try to find meaning. We’re also lost in a way. Our loss of meaning in a materialist, reductionist universe has led us into difficult places. The quest for meaning is worthwhile, but ultimately it may not be about “meaning” per se—it might be about being, as Chris said, and that’s what’s really important.\n\nDaniel Pinchbeck\nI think learning, creativity, expression, play—there’s no necessity to it.

Microdosing may have potential, but we don’t have enough data yet. There’s a lot of uncontrolled data—non–placebo-controlled studies—where people report benefits for depression, insight, creativity, and so on. There’s very little rigorous research to say those outcomes are genuine; it could be one big placebo effect. But if people feel it’s beneficial, that might be good enough for some. Most of my research focuses on low to high macrodosing. There’s potentially a place for microdosing, but a danger in co-opting psychedelics as mere “psychovitamins” when they can do so much more.

I don’t have much experience with microdosing. When I tried microdosing LSD, it was after years of very high-dose work, and I found I no longer liked LSD in my body. I drove it so hard for so long that my body developed a kind of allergy. I haven’t used it for years.

Thank you, Daniel. I’ve been really enjoying today’s presentations. Some of you may already be familiar with integral theory—Rory mentioned Spiral Dynamics in the context of Extinction Rebellion, for instance. When we’re talking about the history of consciousness, it can be abstract and detached—we view our living history from the distance of books. With Jean Gebser’s work—he’s one of the foundational thinkers of integral theory alongside Ken Wilber—Gebser is very different from Wilber in that he’s not a developmentalist per se. His writing is deeply phenomenological; it encourages us to explore our own experience of consciousness.\n\nWe’ve been talking about left and right brain with McGilchrist. Gebser’s work is a good guide if you want to explore those modes in your own phenomenology.

The requirement is what he calls the principle of diaphaneity: a clear enough consciousness to allow different modes and structures to presentiate themselves in us.

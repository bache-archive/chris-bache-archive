<p>Chris Bache: 
Okay, testing one two, testing one two—yeah, you're great.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
I'm also great. Audio wise.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Hey, good. How you doing? Squared image—okay, it looks good, yeah, yeah. How you doing today?</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
I'm doing well. Looking forward to our conversation.</p>
<p>Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Adventures Through the Mind—I am your host, as always, James W. Jesso. I'm going to start this episode off with a big thanks to the Spirit Plant Medicine Conference in Vancouver, happening November 2 to 4. You've probably noticed they've sponsored a few episodes over the last couple months, and that's very exciting. The guest today, Chris Bache, is one of the presenters at the conference, and I will be one of the attendees. So if you want to come check me out, check out the conference in general, or come see Chris at that conference, follow the link contained in the description to this episode. If you buy a ticket, I get a little bit of commission, which goes toward my costs to fly to Vancouver for the event—and you get to go to a great conference. Win-win.</p>
<p>Today's guest is Christopher M. Bache. Chris is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He’s also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences—an award-winning teacher and international speaker. Chris's work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. He has written three books, translated into six languages: "Lifecycles: A Study of Reincarnation in Light of Contemporary Consciousness Research," "Dark Night, Early Dawn"—a pioneering work into psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness—and "The Living Classroom," an exploration of teaching and collective fields of consciousness. He has a new book being released from Inner Traditions in 2019, "Diamonds from Heaven: A 20-Year Journey into the Mind of the Universe."</p>
<p>Let me give you a bit more detail about Chris and what he's been up to. About 40 years ago, he decided it would be a good idea to take high doses of LSD regularly, with the intention, as a metaphysical philosopher, to map consciousness. He proceeded to do this 76 times over the course of 20 years. Now, 20 years after his last journey in that specific structure, he’s about to release his book, "Diamonds from Heaven," and he's on the show today to talk about what drove him to do this, what it was like, and what he learned. And beyond just what he learned about the nature of consciousness and the psychedelic experience, what can we do as human beings to make sense of experiences as massive as the ones he's going to describe in this episode?</p>
<p>We also had a great post-credits talk that, with his permission, I'll be releasing exclusively to patrons at first, but after a few weeks, you'll be able to access it on YouTube. So if you're not already subscribed to YouTube, please head over there, do so, and hit the little bell for notifications. These extra episodes—the post-credit sequences—only go out to patrons at first, and then when they become public, they're only notified to those who are subscribed, so do that if you're not already watching this on YouTube. And if you want to become a patron, that would be amazing. It's thanks to my patrons on Patreon that I'm able to give my time to building this podcast and my broader work for you in psychedelic culture. Big thanks to the patrons, whose names are listed in the upper corner of this episode on YouTube, and to Tempoic Massage and Lola for the excellent and very generous PayPal donations.</p>

<p>Just because of the context of my work and travel, I didn't get a chance to really look into what you do until yesterday. Other than Steven's—what's the word I'm looking for—shining recommendation, which definitely put you on the map, I was really blown away. It's just really interesting stuff you have going on there.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yeah, I’ve been sort of on the side of the psychedelic community, but been there for a long time doing my own thing.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Yeah, it makes sense, because you had to protect your career for some time.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Why don't we start off by easing in—give me a sense of where you were coming from when you started this work. You did high-dose LSD experiences for 20 years and stopped about 10 years ago, which means you started around 30 years prior to that. At that point, I believe LSD was already illegal. Can you paint us a picture of the context you were entering into and your decision to do this? And while doing that, can you also explain the difference between what you were doing and what was popular at the time, like psychedelic therapy or psycholytic therapy?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yeah. I came out of graduate school in 1978, trained as a philosopher of religion, and started teaching at Youngstown State University in Northeast Ohio. At the time, I was an atheistically inclined agnostic, but that first year I read Stan Grof’s first book, "Realms of the Human Unconscious," and immediately connected with it—I felt I had found my life’s work. This was 1978: the Controlled Substances Act had been passed in 1970, the early era of psychedelic research was over, and we had entered that blackout period between 1970 and when Scientific American published its editorial recommending we end the ban in 2014 or 2017. During those years, no one was allowed to do this work.</p>
<p>I was convinced it could be done safely. Stan Grof’s work was very important to me in that respect, and I believed that those who would make the most important contributions in philosophy of religion would soon be people writing from experiential bases. So, I decided to divide my life in half. Publicly, I continued as an academic: teaching, doing all the things professors do. Privately, I began a 20-year journey working with high levels of psychedelics—LSD—seventy-three sessions extending from 1979 to 1999.</p>
<p>I chose high doses first because it was complicated to arrange time for sessions when you have a dual-career marriage to two professionals, and I wanted to make the most out of every session. After the process got started, I thought high doses would get me to my goal of enlightenment faster—breaking off larger pieces of karma to process each time. Even after the model of personal enlightenment dissolved for me, I continued with high doses because it took me where I wanted to go, and then beyond anything I ever dreamed possible.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Just to clarify for listeners—what would you consider a "high dose" of LSD? What was the metric?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
The metric was 500 to 600 micrograms, which is a very high dose. Stan Grof differentiates between low-dose therapy (about 200 micrograms up to 300), psychedelic therapy (high dose, between 300 to 500 micrograms), but in the early work at Spring Grove Hospital, the dose was deliberately limited to a maximum of three sessions, with the idea of triggering an experience of transcendence to help people come to terms with impending death. I thought that if you could do this safely three times, you could do it more frequently. So, I saw myself as just doing an extended course of high-dose therapy.</p>
<p>But when I got to the end of this journey and looked back, I realized what unfolded was more radical and challenging than what had emerged in early psychedelic therapy work, so I had to coin a new phrase: psychedelic exploration. The method was psychedelic therapy—totally internalized sessions, strong evocative music, working with a sitter, always in a protected, isolated environment, classic set and setting. The difference was the number of sessions: for me, it turned out to be 73.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Some of the conclusions you drew—I just remember recently listening to some of your lectures and being so moved by them. I find myself wanting to excitedly ask you what you learned in the end, but I know we should take our time and maybe deepen into what exactly was happening. And I want to ask that question couched in the phenomenon you observed: multiple layers of death and rebirth and an increasing expansion into, using my own words, higher levels of reality. Can you explain what you mean by multiple death and rebirth? Can you give us an outline—what was happening in there, after 70-something sessions of 500 micrograms of LSD?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
That is the question, and it's hard to summarize—it's taken me about 300 pages just to tell the story. There were so many layers. Basically, my experience has been that the universe—or the mind of the universe, or the mind of the divine—is an infinite ocean of potential. When we drop our individual mind into that ocean, it catalyzes experiences out of that infinite potential. As we are changed, influenced, healed, and purified by that exchange, the seed crystal of our mind changes. When we later drop that same, now-transformed mind into the ocean, it catalyzes a deeper set of experiences.</p>
<p>So, I went through a series of initiations over many years: a series of deaths, followed by rebirth into a deeper level of reality—and then a gradual acclimation to that reality, a purification process. Each deeper state of consciousness, giving access to a deeper level of reality, was also a higher level of energy. To stabilize consciousness at that level—to keep your experience coherent and not fragmented—you had to go through intense purification. If you kept returning to a particular level, staying internalized and pushing forward, you'd return to that level, acclimate, and eventually the death-rebirth process would repeat. I'd endure an agonizing collapse and be reborn into a yet deeper level of consciousness, giving access to deeper reality. This went on, systematically and periodically, for twenty years. To describe the actual levels of consciousness I entered—that's a longer story.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Absolutely—I'm glad you said that. All of this, even having heard the longer story, can be very abstract for someone new to it. Maybe you could talk about what it looks like. I recall you described in earlier sessions working through your own personal material, and then eventually needing to "die" to who you were—moving beyond your personality into a greater sense of underlying human consciousness, and then even dying from that into something else. Could you give a step-by-step of what the early stages looked like?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
For about the first two years, I worked at what Stan Grof describes as the perinatal level of consciousness—the interface between personal egoic reality in space-time and early transpersonal consciousness. I had many experiences of reliving my own birth, experiences of death and dying, until, after about two and a half years, my personal reality was shattered. I died as the person I had known myself to be and was then reborn into a reality that radically transcended Chris Bache's reality. At that point, I was working deep within the collective unconscious, and the process began again.</p>
<p>In my experience, every session has two phases: a cleansing phase, usually lasting a couple of hours, and then an ecstatic phase. If you let the cleansing phase take you wherever it wants, you reach a peak—a crisis or transition—and then the remainder of the session is spent in ecstatic reality, receiving teachings and experiences. In phase two’s cleansing, I entered what I call the ocean of suffering: domains of pain and suffering that were vast, encompassing large swaths of human history and hundreds of thousands of persons. It took about two years to go through that material. On the ecstatic side, for about a year, I experienced my life as a completed whole—start to finish, all the moments of my life as a simultaneous present, a complete totality.</p>
<p>Then I went through a series of initiations, being taken deep into the mind of the universe, given teachings and experiences that grounded me in a larger cosmological vision. After about two years, another death and rebirth cycle spun me beyond not only my individual reality, but also beyond humanity—beyond the collective psyche—into what I identified as archetypal reality. But it wasn't the archetypes as Plato or Jung described; these realities weren't eternal, unchanging ideas, but vast, living cosmic forces—giant beings so immense my mind couldn't fully grasp them. Slightly beneath that, at the Jungian level, I entered deep into the collective psyche, spending a couple of years experiencing how our species functions as a single organism, exploring the sort of meta-neural networks of the species mind, and also having experiences of reincarnation—not from the perspective of individual souls, but from an entire species incarnating every generation. There was a centralized intelligence orchestrating not just individual transformation, but a species journey of transformation.</p>
<p>I went through another round of death and rebirth, and then was catapulted into what some call causal reality, or nondual reality, where the universe functions as a single totality. I had experiences of what Buddhists call shunyata—emptiness of self, oneness, cosmic love, the primal void, the fertile void—the formlessness that is the source of all existence.</p>
<p>In the last five years of work—after more rounds of purification, death, and rebirth—I was catapulted into a cosmic light so intense, so clear and pure, I called it the diamond luminosity, which gives the title of the book, "Diamonds from Heaven." Buddhism calls this the absolute clear light, associated with the concept of Dharmakaya—the fundamental reality that is the source of all existence.</p>
<p>Let me back up: light entered my experiences in many forms and levels—many gradations. I'd experienced light many times in earlier death-rebirth processes. When I talk about the diamond light, it isn't just a metaphor: I'm describing an exceptionally clear and intense awareness, a crystalline light that eventually becomes transparent to itself. In those last five years—the last 26 sessions, about a third of all my work—I entered that reality four times, about once a year. Each time involved more detoxification, and about a year later, I'd re-enter that reality. That’s the kind of larger overview.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
I'm glad you stopped there, because your closing experiences are something I want to get to near the end. But I want to jump back and focus on what you mean by "purification" and the idea of becoming more coherent. When you say purification, what exactly do you mean? My immediate assumption is something akin to what the ayahuasca culture calls purging—pushing out, releasing, or discharging suffering, pain, hardships, whatever, through the metabolic process of feeling them, so that you can enter a state of being without them. Is that what you mean by purification?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
That's a good description. It is that—it's physiological. People throw up a lot on ayahuasca; they don't tend to think of LSD as something causing that, but working with such high levels, I threw up a lot on LSD. It's part of releasing physical toxins, biochemical toxins, psychological toxins—letting them come through your system and offload in rapid sequences. At deeper levels, purification takes different forms. To enter very deep states—unitive consciousness with the divine or different cosmic dimensions—you have to completely let go of everything that keeps you small. It's not just negative experiences or pain; it's every thought form, every emotional derivative that constellates around smallness. Your system has to step up to handle enormous waves of energy moving through you in these deep states.</p>
<p>Purification starts at the personal level—purifying pieces of your personal history, including former lives. But as you go deeper, the forms of purification become harder to identify with anything personal. Eventually, you're literally transcending time and space, emptying yourself of everything associated with your entire history as a being in time and space, to enter into realities beyond. But it is exactly as the ayahuasca or Santo Daime traditions describe it—an ego surrender, a letting go, manifesting and letting go of those realities.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Given that we're talking about transcending time and space, I'm going to assume it transcends linguistic form as well. But I'm curious—what does it feel like to let go of your very essence of being bound by time and space? I know what it feels like to discharge sadness, to process grief and fear—especially the grief of letting go of who I think I am. But it's mind-blowing. Is there any way you could describe, in language, what it's like to purify or let go of your very essence of being bound by time and space?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Your question really gets to the heart of some very thorny issues. Ineffability is often cited as a key quality of a genuine mystical experience. William James introduced the idea, and it’s now part of diagnostic questionnaires that assess the depth of mystical encounters. Personally, I think ineffability is a bit overrated. Yes, these experiences are hard to express; they're difficult to put into words, especially when you first break through to a new level of reality. But I’ve found there are ways—tricks, even—to concretize the memory of these events.</p>
<p>What really happens is, if you keep returning to the same level of reality, going through a purification process and allowing your consciousness to stabilize there, your cognition clears up. The pieces start to cohere, and suddenly, it's much easier to find the right words. Of course, when you break into a new territory, you're overwhelmed again, but persistence brings coherence. You asked specifically about letting go of your entire experience in time and space. For me, there’s a strong element of fear: you become something so vast, it's essentially swallowing everything you’ve ever known—not just as an individual, but as a representative of the species. Eventually, at even deeper levels, you’re no longer even a species, but a fractal embodiment of the entire evolutionary impulse that manifests galaxies, solar systems, planets, and evolving life. At that point, you have already dissolved into those broader patterns.</p>
<p>So, it’s not a case of having a transpersonal experience as an individual. Instead, you surrender into that part of the universe that lives as a galaxy, as an evolutionary thrust. When you let go and enter what might be called the domain of formlessness—the source of the Big Bang—it doesn’t feel like a personal crisis anymore. It becomes almost an evolutionary or species-wide anxiety. But if you surrender, the universe takes you in, all frames of reference drop away, and suddenly you’re alive within a different reality. It's indescribable—you're alive, but not who you were before. Yet, there’s this thread of memory connecting your old self in time and space to this new existence outside time and space. What you’re experiencing is not just being adrift; it’s as if you’re within the mind of God, being carried by the tidal currents of the cosmos.</p>
<p>James Jesso 
Like being part of, but also as the currents themselves? It's not just, "Oh, I am in the universe." Is there a sense of being all of that as well?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Yes, absolutely. At each deeper level, I experienced it less as entering a new reality and more as remembering a dimension of my own existence I'd forgotten. Becoming one with God—or what I prefer to call "that fundamental reality" to avoid the baggage of the word "God"—isn't about confronting some external deity and merging. It's about remembering the fundamental truth that this is what you are: a manifestation, a fractal embodiment of this divine impulse. As you become larger, you remember more. As you remember more, clarity grows. As clarity grows, you sink deeper into these oceanic currents—in essence, the whole experience is about waking up. It's not dying and being reborn, but realizing your true, natural state.</p>
<p>James Jesso 
I might be jumping ahead here, but this feels like a good spot to bring up something I meant to ask later. There's been a surge in reports about 5-MeO-DMT over the past decade. Many people who've taken it claim it offers the ultimate non-dual experience—you become the apex of consciousness, even God. You've described reaching a kind of apex in your work—maybe what you call "diamond luminosity"—but also that there was something even further. Having had such deep, long-term experiences with high-dose LSD and exploring different states of consciousness, how do you view the metaphysical claims made by those who experience 5-MeO-DMT?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I'm very comfortable with the 5-MeO-DMT discussion. It's a fascinating substance, able to catapult people through many layers and offer brief immersion in profoundly cosmic territories. In some ways, it’s similar to people who have near-death experiences—suddenly thrust into transcendental realities for a short time, and then returning, trying to make sense of what they saw. If your contact with these realities is fleeting, there is a sense that you know or feel what they are. You’re immersed in the ultimate, but because these exposures are so short and singular, we sometimes draw premature conclusions about their true implications for the nature of the universe. </p>
<p>Here’s why: towards the end of my LSD work—those last five years—I had several immersions into what I called the "diamond luminosity," a state beyond even merging with the divine. I'd go into it repeatedly, but in my 50th session, something new happened. I was as far out as I'd ever been—peaceful, merged with the light—when suddenly, everything pivoted. I saw a new reality, even further removed, and a beam of light hit me and utterly shattered me. This was a different order of light—beyond the diamond luminosity I’d spent 15 years reaching. I called it the absolute light. That was when I realized that these experiences aren't about achieving a final state; it's an infinite progression. I completely gave up the idea that you could ever reach the end.</p>
<p>When I began this work, I thought there was an endpoint—become one with God, the universe, the primal void. But over time, I realized there are many gradations of oneness and formlessness, and even with powerful methods, the universe was far larger than I ever imagined. There was no way to "finish." What happened after that was interesting: the sessions stopped taking me farther out; instead, the diamond luminosity began merging more and more into my physical body and psyche over the next couple of years. So, I understand why people feel a sense of ultimacy in these states. Phenomenologically, that's accurate. But as a metaphysician, I’d caution us to bracket any claims of ultimacy. I'm not convinced that—no matter how powerful the tool—we can make definitive claims about what’s ultimate or not.</p>
<p>James Jesso 
Thank you. Now, let's go back to talk more about purification and coherency. You've commented multiple times that you have to effort and get familiar with certain states of consciousness, at which point you become coherent and can hold a coherent cognition within high-energy states. Can you explain that process a bit more deeply, and elaborate on how you do it?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
That was definitely a learn-as-you-go process for me. I wasn't part of a psychedelic culture, didn't have a shaman guiding me. I had to figure it all out on my own, and I used a medicine—LSD—that didn’t have the same deep cultural fields as mushrooms or Ayahuasca. It was a relatively new medicine, so it was constantly pushing me to the edge of my experience.</p>
<p>When I read about others’ psychedelic journeys, especially with powerful substances like LSD, I noticed that experiences were often fragmented—bits and pieces from multiple sessions, but no progressive development. My journey was different. I felt I was engaged in an ongoing, deepening conversation—a communion, even—with a formless consciousness orchestrating my sessions. My role was simply to show up, surrender to the journey, and then make sense of what happened afterwards. That meant methodically recording, reflecting, integrating intellectually, emotionally, and physically.</p>
<p>My background in philosophy definitely helped. I approached these states with as much clarity and receptivity as possible, always striving to understand and retain as much as I could. If you meet these vast states with that kind of devotion and engagement, they orchestrate your experience and take you as deep as you’re willing to go. But you have to do your part: pay attention, surrender, have courage, and also write, reflect, and integrate. It’s a posture of engagement and willingness to lose yourself again and again, but also to process and make sense of it.</p>
<p>James Jesso 
That's great. When I first heard you express that, it really resonated—I had a similar journey while working with Psilocybin mushrooms over an extended period, using it monthly. Each session, by paying attention and surrendering to the process, I gained greater cognitive coherency. I would write about it, explore what I could articulate, and it became much easier to map what was happening and why, at least at the doses I was using. Unless you want to comment further on that, I have another question for you.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It's fascinating how our experiences align, even across different psychedelics. Each has its own quality, but the process of engagement is universal.</p>
<p>James Jesso 
You definitely went deeper than I did! Let me ask you something I get a lot: what, phenomenologically, is the difference between LSD and Psilocybin?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I experience Psilocybin as a very body-grounded psychedelic—it's strongly felt in the body. This intelligence seems to sweep through, checking everything out, touching the emotional fields. My whole body hums and glows; I’ve felt something similar with Ayahuasca, in that it involves and energizes the whole body.</p>
<p>In contrast, working with high-dose LSD is an enormous acceleration—an almost catapulting into extremely deep states of consciousness. In certain ways, it tends to leave the body behind—not in a dissociative sense, like ketamine, but in pushing toward what I call the "high cosmological ceiling." It drives beyond the personal ego, through species consciousness, into Earth consciousness, and even further.</p>
<p>It doesn't, at least in my experience, connect me to elemental or earth spirits, or the totem ancestors of animals and plants. It was always reaching for that high cosmological ceiling. Later, I found that working with Psilocybin helped me integrate LSD experiences, precisely because it opened up my body and allowed some of that cosmological energy to enter my physical form.</p>
<p>James Jesso 
Were you taking higher doses of Psilocybin—like five dried grams, or venturing into the ultra-high-dose territory that Kilindi Iyi explored?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I was probably working with more standardized doses of Psilocybin—not ultra-high doses. Most of my Psilocybin work came after I finished with LSD. I did some intermittently while still using LSD, but after I stopped, Psilocybin (and some Ayahuasca) was very helpful for integration. I wasn’t breaking new ground, just trying to recover from the terrain I’d already crossed. My goal was basically to learn how to walk the Earth again after so many transcendental experiences.</p>
<p>James Jesso 
I’d love to see you and Kilindi compare notes on ultra high-dose experiences. Now, back to the arc of increasing cognitive coherency at higher states of consciousness mixed with purification—did it get easier as you progressed, or did the challenge remain the same? For instance, in the early phases, you're struggling with letting go of your identity—highly educated, white, male philosopher—then, much later, letting go of all time and space itself, experiencing the suffering of all humanity. Was the level of challenge the same, just with a greater psychic scale, or did it get easier over time?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
The ocean of suffering was much harder and more demanding than dissolving my personal ego—truly a different order of magnitude. I want to be careful not to overemphasize the negative, though, because there’s a rhythm: purification, then ecstasy. The only thing that makes the purification bearable are the ecstatic blessings that follow. After processing the ocean of suffering, I’d also be integrating the gift of earlier unitive experiences—being taken on the “cosmic tour,” visiting the beginning of creation, and so on. This rhythm—of purification and blessing—kept pace throughout. The deeper the purification, the deeper the blessings. Once you learn that rhythm, you’re no longer afraid of purification; you seek it out. Not because you crave pain, but because you long for what lies beyond it.</p>
<p>So, the rhythm itself gets easier, because you’re less afraid. The ordeal may be intense, but it frightens you less. You can be transiently terrified, but you trust the process and keep going deeper. One of my most demanding sessions—my 70th—was actually the hardest teardown I ever experienced. Sometimes, if you’re going to be taken much deeper, you need to be prepared, and that preparation can be rough.</p>
<p>This 70th session drove me into what I call “deep time”—experiencing time as an organic whole. Early on, I’d experience my entire life as a totality, then humanity’s evolution over tens or hundreds of thousands of years, and eventually, how the universe itself experiences time. I coined “deep time” to describe these different temporal modalities. The closer you get to the edge of space and time, the more porous time becomes.</p>
<p>Many of these experiences coalesced into a vision of the evolution of the human race and the particular crisis we’re entering as a species. I believe we’re trying to outgrow the egoic psychology of the past, moving toward a more soul-oriented, transparent, and divine human experience. The 70th session was my deepest look into the future human—what we are becoming as our next evolutionary type. So yes, it gets easier in some ways, but you never know when a new wave will challenge you at a whole new depth—especially if the universe wants to take you somewhere far deeper.</p>
<p>James Jesso 
That’s something I’ve also learned—and it’s certainly echoed among other deep explorers I know. Just when you get comfortable, the experience will remind you who’s in charge! No matter how competent you feel. I think this is a good moment to start wrapping up, since we’re nearly at the hour mark.</p>
<p>James Jesso: You stopped doing this—yes—and I kind of already have a sense of where the answer is going, so I'm curious how to ask the question because I'm simultaneously wondering: why did you stop? And, how did these experiences change your relationship to dying—your physical death as a human now? That’s sort of the large, open-ended question.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Let me take that last question first, because it's the easiest. I'm so looking forward—not necessarily to the process of dying, but to being dead—with absolute and complete confidence, because I know where I'm going. I've died. I've made that transition so many times in my sessions that I feel very comfortable with what's going to be happening after this body falls away.</p>
<p>I didn't stop sessions altogether, but I stopped this particular series—working with high doses of LSD—for two reasons: pain and heartache. At those extremely high doses, LSD places enormous demands on your body and subtle energy system. After many years, my energy was just running so hot, I was carrying too much energy. I wasn't having flashbacks, but my subtle energy system was so taxed from entering these states, even just five times a year, that I had to stop in order to let my whole system calm down, cool off, and find a new equilibrium.</p>
<p>But the main reason I stopped was heartache. I literally could not take the heartache of being separated from the Divine anymore. I had entered so deeply into the diamond luminosity, into whatever you want to call it—the divine, the absolute—I had dissolved, lost my boundaries, become light so many times, with such exquisite joy, that coming back into time-space became just a terrible heartache. Eventually, I decided it was better not to go back at all than to have to leave again. I made a kind of agreement with what I call the absolute (my beloved, because it was a love relationship that unfolded), to never take me back that deeply again until I would not have to leave. That’s really why I stopped my sessions.</p>
<p>I paid a lot of attention to integration all the way through. I really tried to do it right, integrate each individual session solidly, so I thought I could stop the sessions and then harvest the insights and experiences I had been blessed with over those years. What I found, however, was that, in the years following—really, a number of years—I began to enter what I call the deep sadness, a sense of existential loneliness. I was missing the divine so deeply back here in time and space that life basically began to feel dried up. I honestly wasn't very interested in being here; I found I was just waiting—waiting to die so I could return to the light.</p>
<p>Eventually, I realized this wasn't good. This is not the way it's supposed to be. I knew it wasn’t supposed to end up like this, but I didn’t understand what had gone wrong because I’d been so careful about integration. My life was screaming, “Failure to integrate, failure to integrate.” In time I realized that I’d lost the balance between transcendence and immanence—between letting go and going beyond all time-space, and being grounded solidly within time and space reality. Time and space is the manifest body of the Divine. There aren't two divines—the transcendent and the immanent are facets of the same. But I’d plunged so deeply into the transcendent that I lost my grounding in the immanent.</p>
<p>It took about 10 years, but I made a determined commitment to reground myself into physical existence, to temper my memories of transcendence with my appreciation and enjoyment of the manifest divine around me. That took a long time, but eventually I did, and I became more comfortable being here.</p>
<p>One of the big challenges was living in the silence imposed by our psychedelic-phobic culture. I wasn’t allowed to speak about my experiences. I couldn't teach from them, bring them to my colleagues, or truly write from them. I couldn’t do what I had been trained to do as a philosopher of religion. I wasn’t part of a psychedelic subset in Ohio, and I knew if I began that conversation, I’d be fired. I loved teaching and being with my students. So this split between my public life and private life became increasingly burdensome. When I stopped the sessions, it became even more burdensome, because I didn't have a place to process my experiences.</p>
<p>There's a level of integration that can take place privately, psychologically, before you start to speak. When I began working on Diamonds from Heaven and started giving talks as the book was coming to its conclusion, and sharing with people what I had done and where I had gone—taking in what they had experienced as well—the integration of those experiences began to deepen. They began to live in me differently than before. So I began to speak about them, and that's begun a process that's still unfolding. I don't know where it's going to go, but the transcendent and immanent divine seem to be reaching a deeper merging in my life now that I've opened the conversation.</p>
<p>James Jesso: There are a couple more questions if you have the time. This one might be a bit quick. You mentioned discomfort in your body from this high subtle energy. Were you doing any physical spiritual practices—yoga, tai chi, anything like that?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes. First, I was doing meditation and Vajra throughout those years, and in the last five years, I was really doing formal Vajrayana practices. I was taking good care of my body—yoga, keeping a vegetarian diet, chiropractic care, massages. I was really taking care of the instrument.</p>
<p>James Jesso: Okay, cool. I was curious because sometimes you wonder if maybe yoga or something might have made a difference. So, this other question is very personal. What kind of toll did these experiences take on your capacity to be intimate with other people? I know for myself, when I was going regularly into deep mushroom experiences, I often felt existentially alone and couldn’t quite relate to others. There was always something missing in romantic partnerships because they didn't go as deep. Did you have similar struggles in your intimate relationships? Did it make it harder to connect with lovers or others on the human level?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I know exactly what you're referring to. That loneliness was the most unexpected cost of doing this work. Of all the things I had anticipated entering into this essentially shamanic path, the loneliness and separation from other people were most surprising. Curiously, my capacity to empathically enter into other people's lives deepened enormously, but unless they were psychedelically initiated themselves, they had no capacity to understand what were, to me, the most important experiences of my life. Naturally, a certain distance grew up between myself and my social relationships.</p>
<p>There’s a place in Carlos Castaneda’s work where Don Genaro says, "The world is only real when I’m with him," meaning Don Juan. That's to say, if you take up the psychedelic path or any practice that opens deep levels of experience, inevitably, it separates you. You're on a different road than the people around you who are interested only in physical, tangible things. So there is a loneliness that comes with that. For me, it has eased as I become more public, entering conversations with people like yourself who have had their own experiences. It’s easier now.</p>
<p>In terms of my most intimate relationships, I’ve been very blessed. I've been married twice. Carol, my first wife, and I were married for 24 years. She was with me through all those years and was my sitter for all of this work. She is very mystically inclined, a deep Buddhist practitioner, never interested in doing psychedelic sessions herself—they seemed too violent for her—everything she needed she found on her meditation cushion. In some ways, it wasn’t until I began engaging at advanced levels, moving into the diamond luminosity, that I began to understand her for the first time. She was a highly developed spiritual being. After we separated and both remarried, she completed her Vajrayana training, doing her three-year, three-month retreat in New Mexico. She’s a serious practitioner, so I didn't experience “lack of headroom” with her. The more I did this work, the closer we became existentially. Our eventual separation was for reasons unrelated to the sessions, and we remain friends.</p>
<p>Later, I was blessed with a second marriage to Christina Hardy. Christina is also a journeyer, so she understood experientially these dimensions from her own experience. She’s also an astrologer, and very deeply a daughter of the earth, living grounded in the textures and rhythms of time and space. In my most intimate relationships, I’ve been with women able to understand what I was going through; it would have been very lonely otherwise, to have intimacy at one level but not at another.</p>
<p>James Jesso: Yeah. The final question I have—I want to hold on it for a second because you said something I want to clarify. You said your first wife did not want to do what you were doing because she found it too violent, and then you said at a certain point you began to understand her. Do you mean you started to understand why she wouldn't choose to do what you were doing?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: No, it wasn't that specifically. I shouldn’t focus just on the violence; she’s a very gentle, naturally mystical person, and she found the vehemence of the cleansing phases of the sessions hard to relate to. She also found it difficult that you would have these deep, temporary experiences but then couldn’t really hold onto them—you could remember them but not embody them. She preferred a path where you could keep more of your experiences; a slower initiation, but one you could hold onto.</p>
<p>What I meant was that I began to appreciate her natural way of tuning into the universe. When I began to touch into the diamond luminosity, I touched a reality so absorbing and powerful that nothing else in my sessions mattered except reconnecting with it. I began to appreciate how her entire life, ever since girlhood, had been oriented toward accessing and stabilizing this deep participation in the universe.</p>
<p>James Jesso: Okay, that clarifies it. I’m glad, because I might have misunderstood. As you've said elsewhere, you wouldn’t recommend this path for others, and if you could go back, you'd be “easier on yourself.” I wondered if that's what you were leaning toward?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I would be gentler for a number of reasons. One is because I learned it’s not about reaching an end destination; it's about becoming open, living as much of the infinite as you can absorb. If the goal is to ground the transcendent here and now in this body, then it's often better served by working with lower doses that let you hold onto more of your experience. I don’t really recommend what I did. I pushed myself; it took great concentration and commitment to go some of the places I went. It’s not necessary for spiritual awakening—you don’t have to go that far. I just have more compassion for myself now and wouldn’t want anyone to undergo some of the things I went through.</p>
<p>James Jesso: Thank you. So, the final question before you have the chance to share where listeners can find your work, is about integration—maybe a fuller understanding of what it means to integrate. You’ve talked about writing things down: the next day narrativizing the experience, listening to the same music from the session, naming each session so its essence is clear with just a glance—which is brilliant. And you’ve highlighted the importance of relationship in integration in other talks. So, with those things in mind, how do you integrate something as profound and massive as what you experienced?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Some of the integration challenges I faced are exactly why I’d recommend against doing what I did. With these substances, we can dissolve so deeply into vast territories that it truly becomes mind-boggling—how does one integrate that? As long as you’re still within time and space, uncovering your personal or even past life trauma, we have therapeutic models for integration. If you go deeper, experiencing the intelligence that runs through all things or the certainty of continuity after death, there are spiritual models for integrating that, too. Even in near-death research, where people have deep, singular experiences of transcendence, we have some sense of what integration can look like.</p>
<p>But what does integration mean when you’re going so deep into deep time—when you’re dealing with 100,000-year swaths of time inside a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday consciousness? How do you integrate becoming one, and then returning to being one among many? Or glimpsing the next evolutionary stage of humanity, then going back to work the next morning? After my final session, the phrase that came to me during meditation was: “Twenty years in, twenty years out”—meaning it would take at least as long to integrate as it took to go in. Now, Diamonds from Heaven is being published 20 years after I stopped my sessions, so I’ve really been looking at what I’ve been able to hold onto in those 20 years and where it’s taken me.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the depth of loneliness I experienced came not from failure in my sessions, but from their success. The successes of entering the universe become the challenge of integration when you come back. I found that as long as I was silent—not communicating from my center—my integration could only go so far. Writing Dark Night, Early Dawn, where I first unpacked some of these experiences, allowed me to enter conversations that deepened my integration. But it wasn't really until I began to write Diamonds from Heaven that I felt a still deeper level of integration begin to manifest.</p>
<p>I don't think you can integrate the infinite into the finite—by definition, you can’t. The only thing you can do is integrate your finite existence into infinity. You surrender to the infinite, moment to moment, day to day. You become a servant of the infinite, surrendering to the involutionary process Sri Aurobindo describes. I'm a teacher by nature—my instinct is to learn and to share—and the laws around psychedelics interrupted that natural way of being in the world. Now that I’m retired, and the statute of limitations on my “psychedelic crimes” has passed, those two sides of my life are coming together. For the first time in my adult life, I feel I’m beginning to be a whole person again.</p>
<p>As I become more whole, something is happening in my relationship within myself and the universe, and in my relationships with others. The depth of consciousness alive in me is also alive in you, so when we come together, this deeper fluctuation surfaces in both of us. I find this when I’m teaching, in workshops or groups—there’s a deeper aliveness I used to have to tamp down, but now I can let it come through. I don’t know where this deeper integration is leading. It’s taking me to places I haven't been in ordinary consciousness before—though I glimpsed them in sessions—and there is a new transparency and wholeness, especially when I’m with people. I have no idea where it’ll lead in another 20 years, but I like it; it feels natural, and like integration is still continuing. So I don’t consider myself finished with this process at all.</p>
<p>James Jesso: Well, thank you very much for that, Chris, and thank you so much for this whole conversation today. Maybe you could end by letting listeners know where they can find out more about you, your books—including Diamonds from Heaven—and your social media handles?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Well, actually, my website is still in the process of being made, so you can't go there yet—but soon. <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>, the book that we've been talking about, will be released from Inner Traditions, probably in the second half of 2019. My three earlier books are <em>Life Cycles</em>, which is on reincarnation research; <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, where I integrate psychedelic research and incorporate my own experiences with near-death and out-of-body research—it's academically dense, but rigorous; and <em>The Living Classroom</em>, which is about something that was happening in my classroom while I was privately doing my psychedelic work. I don't talk about psychedelics there, but it's about fields of consciousness, and the contagious nature of states of consciousness. I found that when I was doing this work privately, some of my students started to be activated by it, so I began to understand and work with the contagious quality of states of consciousness.</p>
<p>With <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>, I go back to the very beginning and take people through, layer by layer, the entire sequence of events, because you can't even begin the philosophical conversation about psychedelic states unless people—editors of professional journals and such—are convinced these are legitimate experiences. The only ways to be convinced are to either have the experiences yourself, or to undergo a secondary initiation by reading other people's accounts and picking up on it through a sort of osmosis. That's what I'm hoping <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em> can offer. I don't think my experiences are special or unique—they may have gone a little further than some, but they fall within the broad range that people have. I'm just trying to present them in an organized fashion so people can become more familiar with these states. I hope it will be helpful to people in their own psychedelic work, but also to those who never take a psychedelic. What's important isn't the method, but what the method teaches us about the universe, and as a philosopher, that's my interest: letting people see the universe as it was shown to me in these sessions.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Yeah, beautiful. Thanks so much, Chris. Are you on social media anywhere?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I'm on Facebook, but I'm not really well-grounded in social media. I'll have my website up hopefully within just a couple of months. My talks are scattered all over the web—if you Google me, you'll come up with a whole bunch of videos and books. But I haven't consolidated them and presented them all in one place.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Cool. Well, I'll make an effort to consolidate some things, including links to all your books where people can buy them, and your website once it's live, at jameswjesso.com under the page with the show notes for this episode. Christopher, thank you very much for being on the show.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
James, my pleasure. It was a great conversation. I really appreciate your probing questions—really excellent.</p>

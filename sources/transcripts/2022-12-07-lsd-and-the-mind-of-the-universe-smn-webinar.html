<p>David Lorimer: 
A warm welcome, everybody. I'm tuning in from the Cathar area of South West France. As many of you will know, my name is David Lorimer. I'm the Program Director of the Scientific and Medical Network.</p>
<p>I've known Chris for a long time. He taught for 33 years in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, and is also connected with the California Institute of Integral Studies and Noetic Sciences. He's an advisor to the Grof Legacy Training, which I'm also involved in. He writes that his passion has been the study and philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, particularly psychedelic states.</p>
<p>I'd like to add a plug for his book that isn’t on this particular theme, The Living Classroom: An Exploration of Collective Fields of Consciousness in Teaching. This is particularly fascinating in terms of the synchronicities that seem to arise in Chris’s teaching with his students, and he may refer to that in passing. His two books that I’ve read and reviewed—this is the initial one here, Dark Night, Early Dawn, which I think is exactly where we are collectively at the moment, and then his prize-winning book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe. Many of you will have read his article in the current issue of Paradigm Explorer. So, Chris, I’m really looking forward to this presentation. A very warm welcome from us, and we can’t wait to hear what you have to say.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thank you, David, and thank you, everybody. It’s an honor and a pleasure to be here with you tonight. I really look forward to sharing the experiences I report in my book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe.</p>
<p>David has framed our conversation as the question of whether we can all access the cosmic mind using psychedelics. I believe that we all can, but whether we all should is another matter entirely. In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.</p>
<p>In LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves. What’s important is the vision of the cosmos they contain, and a vision of where humanity is in its long evolutionary journey and the turning point we’re coming to.</p>
<p>I want to say up front that I’m not sure what I did was wise. I pushed myself very hard on this journey—harder than was sometimes good for me—and I do not recommend this protocol to others. If I were starting over, I would be gentler with myself. I would work with lower doses and gentler psychedelics. But I made it through intact, and I would not have missed it for the world.</p>
<p>I also know that what I’m presenting tonight is a radical story. It raises many questions we won’t get to—about the reality of these experiences and how this path compares to other spiritual paths. But the radical nature is inescapable. I believe psychedelics represent a genuine turning point in philosophy, a true before-and-after advance. They give us more than new insights into consciousness and more than a new therapeutic method for healing the wounds of the personal psyche. Critically used, psychedelics give us a new philosophical method with two parts: first, immersing ourselves into temporary states of hyper-aroused consciousness; second, stepping back and critically analyzing our experiences there. By moving back and forth between non-ordinary and ordinary states of consciousness, we can gather and distill new insights into the structure of reality.</p>
<p>Of course, this method is not really new. It was present in the Eleusinian Mysteries of ancient Greece and in the ayahuasca ceremonies of Brazil that date back a thousand years. But they are new to us—new to our scientific culture—and that’s the point. We are witnessing, I think, the emergence of a true psychedelic philosophy.</p>
<p>My psychedelic lineage is rooted in the work of Stanislav Grof. I was a brand-new faculty member in 1978 when I first read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. That was followed quickly by LSD Psychotherapy in 1980, in which he laid out the method. Stan demonstrated that LSD is a nonspecific amplifier and catalyst of consciousness. It does not give us specific experiences; rather, it hypersensitizes consciousness for six to eight hours at a time. Everything that follows hinges on how we use those hours.</p>
<p>Stan’s work clearly differentiates two therapeutic modalities: psycholytic therapy (low-dose) and psychedelic therapy (high-dose). In psycholytic therapy, the mind is peeled away layer by layer, uncovering our shadow and taking us deeper into the unconscious. In psychedelic therapy, a very different protocol developed at Spring Grove Hospital was limited to three sessions and designed to trigger near-death-type experiences among patients who were terminally ill. I thought, if you could use this therapy safely three times, you could use it safely more than three times. During the years I was doing this work, I saw myself as undertaking an extended course of psychedelic therapy. But when I came to the end and looked back, I appreciated how radical this undertaking had been. It went beyond psychedelic therapy as originally conceived and practiced, and therefore called for a new term to avoid confusion. I’ve named it psychedelic exploration.</p>
<p>I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms—very high dose. The method is that of psychedelic therapy: complete isolation and protection from the outside world, trusting your care to a sitter, wearing eyeshades, and working with carefully chosen music to pace the opening and closing of the session. The difference was the high number of sessions—in my case, 73.</p>
<p>I think the stabilization of the protocol and minimizing variables contributed to the stability and clarity of the psychedelic window that opened. I always followed the same protocol: the same set and setting, the same sitter—my wife at the time, Carol, a clinical psychologist—the same substance, the same dose level, even the same location and the same recording process. This provided a very stable reception platform that allowed my sessions to develop clearly over time.</p>
<p>I did this work as rigorously as I could. I kept detailed records, making exhaustive descriptive accounts within 24 hours of each session. I tracked the dates, and, as Rick Tarnas is a good friend of mine and many of us have read his book Psyche and Cosmos, I tracked the astrological variables to see the interplay between my experiences and the astrological transits.</p>
<p>The story I’m telling in LSD and the Mind of the Universe is not primarily a personal story; it’s cosmological. The personal is the least important in my experiences. After the first ten sessions or so, the portion relevant to my personal life tended to come up at the beginnings and endings of sessions, when I was leaving and returning to space-time. At the peak hours of psychedelic arousal, I was having experiences that far transcended my personal life. That’s the philosophically interesting, universal story—and it unfolds as a developmental sequence across these peak “hilltop” perspectives.</p>
<p>There are many ways to use psychedelics. Let me identify three. First, therapeutic healing—to heal the wounds of our personal psyche. This is the dominant form being used and studied today. Second, spiritual awakening—to cultivate that radical, transparent condition in which we stand completely conscious, naked, and receptive to the ever-changing field of experience. Third, cosmological exploration. These are distinct, if mutually reinforcing, undertakings. How you use psychedelics—dose levels, circumstances, set and setting—is different in each, and it’s important not to judge one project by criteria relevant to another.</p>
<p>At very high doses of LSD, one goes through a series of death-rebirth experiences. The first takes place at the interface of our time-space consciousness and the beginnings of spiritual consciousness—usually referred to as ego death, the complete destruction of our personal time-space identity and the opening into spiritual reality. If we continue and press deeper, we go through more deaths at the psychic, subtle, and causal levels of consciousness, to use Stan’s terms.</p>
<p>I have no vested interest in a particular cosmological map delineating the strata of transpersonal consciousness. I simply want to make the point that as you go into deeper levels, you come to gateways where you must give up everything you’ve known so far to enter the new fields opening to you. One does not simply enter spiritual reality and pluck experiences like apples from a tree. Drawing on Jorge Farrah’s insights in his book Revisiting Transpersonal Theory, I hold that all psychedelic experience is participatory. Our being evokes, in complex ways, the portion of the universe we encounter. Our mind acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes certain experiences from the cosmic mind’s infinite potential. As we are gradually purified and transformed, still deeper experiences are evoked. In my case, one session more or less started where the previous session stopped; there was a gradual, consistent unfolding into deeper levels of reality. This may not be true for everyone; it simply was true for me.</p>
<p>LSD is often likened to the atomic bomb, invented in the same decade. I use the nuclear explosion as an image of the combustive fire generated in a long series of sessions—this cycle of death and rebirth. As it continues, it activates and brings into conscious awareness deeper levels of the universe, just as a nuclear explosion brings into visible form atmospheric layers that were always there but hidden. It is the power of the psychedelic dynamic that brings these dimensions into our conscious awareness. We’re not talking about literal explosions, but exploration into the mind of the universe—the cosmic mind.</p>
<p>At the end of my journey, looking back, I identified five strata I had entered systematically over 20 years: the personal mind; the collective mind (our species); archetypal mind; causal oneness; and diamond luminosity. I’ll take you into the book chapter by chapter with a few highlights, just to invite you into the dialogue.</p>
<p>First, the personal mind. There’s a chapter on crossing the boundary of birth and death—what Stan calls the perinatal level. There’s a previous chapter on methodology, laying out the method, and another that takes the reader into a typical session day. Content-wise, we begin with classic perinatal material: deep confrontations with death and fetal sensations, severe existential confrontations, tremendous perinatal seizures purifying the body and emotional field, culminating in ego death. In my ego death, I was forced to become the exact opposite of everything I had ever known myself to be. I had always known myself as male, as an intellectual, college educated, passionately interested in the meaning of life. In this session, I was forced to become the complete opposite, as if the universe were telling me: where you are going, gender does not exist. I had to let go of everything to enter what was coming next.</p>
<p>What came next surprised me: what I later called the exercises of collective death and rebirth—and first, the ocean of suffering. Over the course of two years, I was repeatedly and systematically immersed in experiences of collective anguish that shattered all my frames of reference, completely dwarfing the previous phase. I entered an ocean of suffering that expanded to encompass what appeared to be the entire history of the human species. The dying in these sessions was almost entirely collective. The surrender demanded was the ordeal of repeatedly opening to the sheer enormity and savagery of this ocean of pain. At first I thought this was a deepening of ego death, but it went on so long and involved so many beings that eventually I changed my mind. I came to the conclusion these episodes were not primarily aimed at transforming my personal consciousness; they were aimed at healing some portion of the collective unconscious of humanity—healing scars accumulated through history and still carried in our collective memory.</p>
<p>In my experience, a session has essentially two phases: the cleansing/purification phase and the ecstatic phase. The ocean of suffering lasted one year, then I took a six-year break, and then it resumed. In that first year, when I went into the ecstatic phase, I entered what I came to call deep time—deep time in the soul. Coming out of the ocean of suffering, I entered a state in which seven sessions gave me an experience of my life as a completed whole, a totality from beginning to end. The visions were stable and systematically developed. Each session built upon the previous one. The sequences repeated, unfolding in greater detail and with deepening emphasis.</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary challenge to hold on to these experiences of deep time. The first time I came back—with the most meaningful experiences of my life at that point—I couldn’t hold them. My mind had no hook to place them on. With repetition, returning to the same state again and again, I was able to hold more. This is an important epistemological point: you have to train yourself to stay conscious in these deep states. You have to commit rigorously to learning how to stay awake in states that initially completely swallow you. With practice, you can maintain epistemological clarity there. During this year, I had many teachings about reincarnation, karmic cause and effect, and the deeper intentionality operating in life.</p>
<p>I then stopped my work for six years for reasons I describe in the book. When I resumed, the ocean of suffering started exactly where it had stopped and continued to build in intensity over the remaining year—seven more sessions in a different time of my life with different expectations and under different astrological transits. The ocean began exactly where it had stopped, which I think reflects the depth and power of the intelligence and consciousness directing these episodes—certainly not my intelligence, something larger than me.</p>
<p>In the ecstatic portion of these sessions, I entered a completely different reality than deep time in the soul—what I came to call an initiation into the universe. I was given a systematic series of initiations into the universe and into the creative intelligence behind the physical universe. The sequence was deliberate and well crafted. It felt like an infinite intelligence educating me, reminding me of things long forgotten but now in need of remembering. A little note: I give my sessions names. I take detailed notes, break them down into bullet points, and name them, because my intention is to hold all my experiences in mind at the same time. When I see the name, it reminds me of the content. The names of the sessions I address in this chapter suggest the content. It was an extraordinary philosophical adventure, being taken by what appeared to be the creative intelligence of the universe deeper into the mysteries of creation and into humanity’s destiny.</p>
<p>When the ocean of suffering culminated in session 24—healing the collective wound—I was spun into archetypal reality, the domain behind physical reality and the source of the structures that exist inside space and time. This lasted one and a half years and 11 sessions. It immediately and consistently felt more real than physical reality. When I first entered archetypal reality, my identity as a human being began to fall away. I learned that we have a sense of species identity more basic than our individual identity, and surrendering this species identity represented a deeper death than ego death. To die out of human consciousness was to begin to exist in a domain completely beyond the human species field. This transition was marked by extremely high levels of energy: white-hot lava flows, exploding sun flares, liquid fire pouring through me, completely consuming me—very different from the deaths I had gone through at the perinatal level.</p>
<p>My experiences in archetypal reality broke down into two levels. At the higher subtle, which I would call the Platonic level, I encountered living forms responsible for creating space-time and its core structures. They were too vast to grasp, even in my expanded state. I could catch only glimpses, seeing them as galaxies billions of light years across—massive structures. This was simply the best my mind could do to wrap itself around what I was experiencing. These were archetypes, but not Plato’s eternal ideas in the mind of an unchanging God—rather, vast living dynamic forces embodying higher orders of intentionality and power, operating on a different order of time entirely.</p>
<p>At the lower subtle, a more Jungian level, I was immersed in the living tissue of our species through a long series of experiences. I repeatedly experienced our species as a single organism interlaced with an intelligent network of meta-functions. I experienced all our individual minds as nodal points within the collective mind. I experienced the issues we confront—psychological and biological—as part of a larger living tapestry of cause and effect weaving throughout the entire species. I experienced our individual bodies as cells within our larger collective body.</p>
<p>I began to have experiences of reincarnation as a collective process. Up to this point, I had experienced or thought about reincarnation as a personal, soul-generated process—about individual evolution and confronting individual karma. But during this time I experienced our entire species reincarnating with common cause—billions of human beings incarnating over and over, driving the evolution of our species forward. I was given many insights into the dynamics of collective purification and collective transformation. This is why, in my book Dark Night, Early Dawn, the fundamental theme is the processes and dynamics of collective transformation—the collective dark night and the early dawn of our collective evolution in history. This was simultaneously a numinous and a devastating experience: to experience billions of lives as cells within an organism evolving on our planet was both overwhelming and ecstatic. The titles of the sessions I address in this chapter reflect that duality.</p>
<p>You can see how much cleansing is involved, even at this advanced level. This reflects an important truth: deeper levels of reality are higher levels of energy. If you want to enter and stabilize your consciousness at these levels, you must adapt to this energy. It’s like mountain climbing: when you climb, you adapt to less oxygen; when you work through deeper consciousness, you adapt to more energy. You must literally become a being who can sustain these high levels for eight hours at a time.</p>
<p>Session 28 was my first, brief contact with causal-level reality—exceptionally clear, dramatic, and beautiful. But just touching the purity of the causal level was so intense it triggered hours and hours of cleansing that lasted over three sessions stretched over six months. That purification made it possible for me to return to this level and maintain coherent cognitive focus, which then led to a rather startling experience—the flash of God in session 33. After this, I entered an extraordinary year of immersion in causal oneness—a benediction of blessings—lasting one year and eight sessions.</p>
<p>After 18 months exploring archetypal reality—moving quickly, just touching base—the year that followed was one of extraordinary blessings, a veritable benediction, as I entered the great depth of causal reality. These sessions were preceded by more deaths and fierce purification. “The Forest” was an experience of causal oneness, of shunyata—emptiness of self—no self in me, no self in any other, just as sun and air move through a forest without paying attention to the particular tree they move through. “Singing the Universe Away” was an experience of the primal void that lies beneath our universe and gives birth to it day by day, second by second. “Jesus’s Blood” was an experience of cosmic love—the most intense love I had ever known. And then “The Birth of the Diamond Soul.” Previously, I had experienced my life as a completed whole. Now, 11 years later, I experienced all my former lives being rewound, one by one, coming together like winding kite string on a spool until the spool exploded in a burst of light, fusing all the strands together and giving birth to what I came to call the diamond soul. The diamond soul was composed of many lifetimes, but it was more than the sum of all their years.</p>
<p>This showed me where reincarnation is taking us. The visions of reincarnation we’ve lived with over the last 2,000 years are incomplete. We often imagine incremental growth—lifetime by lifetime, becoming more compassionate and intelligent. But I think more is afoot. Through the constant expansion and contraction—dying and returning to the soul, being born and contracting into the ego—there comes a time when all our former lives come together as one. When they do, they catapult us into a condition of being that is not simply a refined future life; it is a different order of life, a different order of being itself. Over the long story of reincarnation, the soul is being born inside time and space. This is what I call the birth of the diamond soul.</p>
<p>From here, I went into the diamond luminosity work. Notice I’ve skipped chapter nine—I wish I had written these chapters in a different order—but the work moved into the diamond luminosity material. The benediction of blessings felt like the closing of a great circle. It gave me a feeling of deep completion, a sense of inheriting blessings for work done in the ocean of suffering. I had given something to the universe that was mine to give, and the universe had given me back more treasures than I could hold. I felt complete and utterly satisfied. I had no idea where the sessions would go next, but there were still five years ahead,</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
After going through yet one more intense cycle of death and rebirth, I was spun into a brilliantly clear radiance that Buddhism calls Dharmakaya. I came to call it the domain of Diamond Luminosity. I had known light many times before, but this was an exceptionally pure light. This domain captivated me so completely that it extinguished any interest I had in exploring the other levels of existence that had previously fascinated me. This was a different order of reality altogether. Its clarity was so overwhelming, its energy so pure, that returning to it became my sole focus in future sessions. Over the next four years and 26 sessions, the Diamond Luminosity domain opened to me only four times, and these are the four sessions I present in this chapter.</p>
<p>My understanding is that Diamond Luminosity is an extra-Samsara reality—it lies outside the Bardo, outside of Samsara, outside all the cycles of physical reality and the Bardo realities of psychic reality. It is the pure light from which the universe arises and returns. It is Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. In between these four immersions, there were many intense episodes of cleansing and personal healing. In general, there were two movements during this four-year period: first, going deeper into Diamond Luminosity; then Diamond Luminosity began to crunch itself more deeply into my physical body. The turning point for this was Session 50. I only began to understand what was happening after the fact. I had no control over what was happening in the sessions; I went along with wherever the universe was taking me and only figured out afterward what had taken place. In Session 50, I was as deep into the universe as I ever went. I was in the clearest, most sublime state of Diamond Luminosity I had ever known. Then everything in my visual field pivoted 90 degrees, and I saw a reality far into the distance that looked like luminous galaxies. A ray of light from that reality hit me, and it absolutely shattered me. I call it the absolute light, just to give it a name. What it showed me is that the universe we explore in these deep states of consciousness is endless. I would never get to the end of the divine mind, the cosmic mind, even using this powerful method of exploration.</p>
<p>This was a turning point in my thinking, because I had adopted a belief inherited from others that there was an endpoint to this journey—a final destination, described as oneness with God or the return to the primal void. I had experienced oneness with God many times, and I learned there are many permutations and degrees of oneness. I had entered the primal void several times, and there, too, there are degrees of void. When I first entered Diamond Luminosity, it brought such a feeling of homecoming, of absolute peace and contentment, that I thought I had finally found my ultimate destination. And practically, it did: it completely satisfied all my philosophical and spiritual longing. But just at the peak of this satisfaction, the universe showed me it is an infinite journey. It is an infinite being we are exploring in our lives. This first shattered me and then relaxed me into infinite wonder.</p>
<p>If I were doing this today, I would be gentler with myself. One of the things I’ve learned is that the goal is not to get somewhere, to a particular state of consciousness or being. The goal, I think, is to open up to the universe and let as much of it as possible into your being—its love, intelligence, power, and consciousness—stabilize it, hold it, and live by its truths. After Session 50, the next sessions seemed to take me into the diamond light, but the diamond light was crunching itself deeper and deeper into my body, changing even what I think of as the physiological, cellular structure of my body.</p>
<p>Now to the chapter I had skipped over: the birth of the future human. When I began this work in 1979, I never imagined that humanity’s future would become part of this story, but now I think this may be the most important chapter of the book. It speaks of our children and our children’s children, of a crossroads humanity is coming to, and of powerful forces taking us into a future that will change us at the deepest levels of our being. In this chapter, I summarize bits and pieces of experiences and visions that actually go back to the initiation into the universe material and run through Session 55. I extract pieces from Sessions 23 to 47 and gather them in what I call the visions of awakening—six themes concerning humanity’s future that showed themselves over and over: divine love for all humanity; that the universe is trying to awaken all humanity; that this is being enacted by guiding intelligence shaping our evolutionary process; seeing our species as a single being—that the awakening is not simply individuals awakening, but our entire species going through an awakening; the theme of collective purification, again through the dynamics of reincarnation; and finally, the experience of the future human—being given the grace of experiencing the future human that is being born in history.</p>
<p>Nowhere in these visions over these four years was it shown how this was going to take place. The vision was a period of profound spiritual awakening, a shift in the fundamental architecture of the collective psyche that will change the foundation of human existence on this planet. But it had not shown me how. Then in Session 55, right in the middle of the Diamond Luminosity sessions, I was taken deep into deep time and given an experience of the death and rebirth of humanity. For there to be a great awakening in our collective human heart, there must first take place a great death. We must be emptied of the old before the new can fully emerge. I believe the 21st century will be such a time. It will begin the dark night of our collective soul—a time of emptying, of intense anguish, loss of control, breakdown; a collective purification unto death that will last generations. But through this hard labor we will give birth to something extraordinary, more than just a new civilization. What is emerging is nothing less than a new order of human being. Through the global systems crisis, our planet is giving birth to the future human. When I first described these themes in Dark Night, Early Dawn, it sounds appropriate for the times we’re living in now, but these visions took place in the early 1990s. The Great Awakening session took place in 1995—25 years ago. At that time, it was beyond my purview that we were going into such an enormous watershed moment in history.</p>
<p>In my visions concerning where humanity is, it was as though the transformation of humanity as a whole was the only thing that creative intelligence really cared about. Everything else—my life, our lives, everything we are struggling with in history—was part of this larger project. It framed all our endeavors. It was the work of the hour. My visions did not give me details of when and where; they showed me the fact of this collective awakening, took me into the collective psyche’s experience of this death and rebirth, and gave me insights into the mechanisms of our collective transformation. There’s probably not time here to discuss these mechanisms, though I think they’re important. They have to do with the unified field—that the collective species mind underlies all of our individual experiences—and with the perception that the enormous suffering generated by a global ecological crisis leading to a global systems crisis will impact not just individuals, but will stimulate the collective psyche so deeply it will shift the collective psyche into what we would call nonlinear conditions. We know something about nonlinear systems from physics: when pushed into nonlinear states, both physical and psychic systems can exhibit heightened creativity, higher self-organization, rapidly accelerated change, and small inputs leading to enormous outcomes.</p>
<p>To touch the final vision briefly: this was one of the most intense sessions anywhere on my journey. The universe put me through a strip-down more violent and radical than any I had ever gone through, I think to catapult me more deeply into deep time than ever before. I won’t try to reproduce it here; I’ll invite you to look at it in the book. It was the capstone to the long story of where humanity is going. It showed me things about the evolutionary process that I have held dear ever since. It showed me that our universe is a diamond maker, making diamond souls, and it cares very little whether it takes a million or a billion years to produce the souls it is creating. And it gave me my deepest experience of the future human—an extraordinary being.</p>
<p>The last chapter is “Coming Off the Mountain.” It was the longest to write. In it, I describe two things I have struggled with and confronted in the years after my journey ended. The first I called the deep sadness. I had been given so many blessings on this journey that I thought I could simply step away and spend the rest of my life digesting these treasures. But in the years following my sessions, I began to experience a deep existential sadness. I had been taken so deep into the divine expanse so many times that I was suffering from a loss of communion with the divine. Once you have known the joy of becoming light, once you have experienced the ecstasy of dissolving into the crystalline body of God, life on Earth can begin to feel dried up. I found that I no longer wanted to be here. This is similar to what some people who have near-death episodes experience when they return—plunged into the divine light, filled with overwhelming love, then suddenly back on Earth with all the limitations of earthly experience. It’s hard to make that transition. I knew I was every moment immersed in the body of the Divine. I knew she was the root and flower of my existence. But this knowledge did not save me entirely from the pain of being separated from the full intensity of her presence. It took me about ten years to become fully grounded and comfortable living inside space-time again.</p>
<p>The second factor was what I call the sickness of silence. Because of restrictive laws around psychedelics, I was not allowed to speak about my experience to others. I am a natural-born teacher. I love to learn new things and share that knowledge, but I was not allowed to teach from my psychedelic experiences in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies. I had to keep silent about the most philosophically meaningful experiences of my life. Living in a psychedelic closet is just as damaging to your soul as living in any other closet where you are forced to deny your true nature. Writing LSD and the Mind of the Universe and speaking openly about my psychedelic experiences, as I am tonight, has been part of my path to becoming whole upon this earth once again—to become in my public life what I have been in my private life.</p>
<p>In closing, I still have many questions about what it means to integrate experiences such as those I’ve described. We are in the early stages of understanding how entering such extreme states of consciousness affects us long term. What does it do to a person to hold the kind of memories that I am holding? What does integration even mean in this context? How does a time-bound being absorb excursions into deep time? How does a finite being digest forays into the infinite? What is the residual impact of merging with all of existence after returning to being just one among many? I am asking more questions than I have answers for. My life has become a living experiment in these matters, with the outcome still being determined. But I would not have missed this journey for anything in the world. It has been the philosophical and spiritual adventure of a lifetime, and I take great joy in sharing it with you tonight. Thank you.</p>
<p>David Lorimer 
Thank you very much indeed, Chris. One of the main questions raised by what you’ve been talking about is whether these experiences give us access to the deep structure—or deeper structures—of reality. My own sense is affirmative, and I find your articulation of ineffable experiences brings readers as close as one can get to a kind of ultimate knowing by identification. We’re clearly living in apocalyptic times at one level or another, and your theme of the birth of the future human has extraordinary resonance. Let me turn to a question: whenever you use the word “universe,” how should we understand it? As an astronomer might say, the universe is galaxies, stars, vast physical space. What do you mean by “universe” in your account?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
You’re absolutely right to press me on this. I struggle with language to describe these realities. I don’t like using the word “God”—it carries so much historical baggage and usually doesn’t mean what I mean. Sometimes I use “the divine,” but that can be a bit of a ruse because it comes back to the same issue. I collect images of galaxies and nebulas and play them in meditation because this is my divine; it’s what I’m orienting to. But what I’m referring to is not the outer body of the divine, though I was taken into exploring some of the body of the universe. I’m talking about the consciousness of the universe—the consciousness that has given birth to the universe. I’m just scraping the edges of it, touching pieces of it, and my experience is limited by what I can understand. I often wish I had degrees in astrophysics and quantum theory; this consciousness could have shown me so much more if my mind were tuned to that type of knowledge. What I would love is to have a hundred of our best scientists, artists, and social activists going into these states in a systematic fashion. Imagine a protocol: one day a month for two years—what body of knowledge they would return with and share. It’s never the experience of any one individual that’s most important; it’s our collective genius engaged together.</p>
<p>So I stretch language. It’s as big as the universe, deeper than time, more intelligent than any intelligence I’ve touched in space and time. And the compassion—which I experience as the emotion of oneness—overwhelms. When quantum physicists speak of the implicate order, the wholeness underlying manifest existence, touching that wholeness explodes me with love. I don’t mean love in the ordinary sense, but it’s the closest approximation I have. So yes, I’m using “universe” in a borrowed and extrapolated fashion.</p>

Thank you. Another question: you often refer to humanity as a species, but your imagery and references are cosmological. If you are contacting a greater reality—a cosmic consciousness—did you feel you were encountering something on a scale much larger than humanity, truly cosmic in scope?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Yes, absolutely. When I entered into archetypal reality and died as a human being—died to my species identity—my sessions took me outside the operational range of our collective psyche, beyond human experience and history. Moving beyond the collective psyche, everything associated with it fell away: our understandings and projections of God, the flotsam and jetsam of history. I moved into increasingly clear, contentless states of consciousness that are hard to describe. We should be careful with language: “universal mind” or “cosmic mind” are huge concepts. The only part of that mind I know is what it taught me. There was a consciousness that took me in, taught me, ground me up into dust, and took me deeper into itself. Even so, I was experiencing aspects—fractal manifestations—of its totality. My language peters out at that depth. In Diamond Luminosity, I had a clear perception of moving outside Samsara, outside the Bardo, into a reality even beyond archetypal reality. There was a period of being born into archetypal reality, and then a process of being born out of it into a level that pre-exists archetypal reality—absolutely non-physical.</p>

From the chat: in your journeys, did you get a sense of why we seem to learn only through pain and suffering—the path into matter and back into spirit? Why is this necessary? Some say we change through desperation or inspiration; the gnostic myth suggests we forget, fall into darkness, try to return to the light, and must remember who we are. Is that your view?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I agree with that framing. As I went deeper into these levels of reality, I experienced it as remembering—remembering and remembering. I don’t sense that forgetting is a tragedy, a mistake, or an original sin. It seems part of the natural order: there is the greater and the lesser. When we come into the lesser, we forget—but then we remember. Everything is constantly changing and evolving. We’ve tended to freeze our level of evolutionary maturity and form judgments about how we got here and where we’re going. We have to let go of these fixated fragments. As Sri Aurobindo said, the human being is a transitional being. We are moving from what we were to what we are becoming. Life is changing. Planets are changing. Our species is changing. We are in movement. Why things are the way they are isn’t something we can answer on an absolute scale; we can only attempt an evolving answer—which requires expanding our time horizon enormously. Just as geology expands our horizon with plate tectonics or physics with the evolution of galaxies, we have to expand beyond personal consciousness to glimpse the intentionality manifesting in this ever-evolving, magnificent universe of which we are a part.</p>
<p>David Lorimer: We’re not taking any more questions, by the way. We need to tune into that part of ourselves that knows, as you said, that we're here for the ride—fasten the seat belts, or maybe not. If we're really centered as we go through this process, we'll get the guidance we need, both individually and collectively. But we need to listen to that guidance and enable the new shoots. There's so much creative thinking going on. I was in a group this afternoon with the Spirituality and Education Alliance, and there's a huge amount of good happening that we don't hear about, except in Positive News, Humanity Rising, and Ubiquity University. We need to keep ourselves buoyed up by the positive things that are going on, but also, as you say, face down the negative with the kind of courage you demonstrated in your journey.</p>
<p>I thank you on behalf of us all for the journey you took and for bringing back these treasures—gems we can appreciate and appropriate for our own journey and understanding, because you made that journey. I salute you for that odyssey; you could translate it into the hero's journey. Just a point of information for people: I mentioned Thomas Troward a moment ago. Here's a book I would recommend as a good starter—The Wisdom of Thomas Troward—which contains four of his main sets of lectures. He was a judge in India, and you can really get to grips with this stuff. He talked about self-recognition: when the universal became the particular in us, we had to recognize ourselves back again as the universal. He was talking about these things in his own way 100 years ago. We're all trying to catch up with the perennial, as it were, and live through it.</p>
<p>Everybody on the call, thank you so much for being part of this evening. I hope you've been inspired and learned something you can apply to your own lives and your own journey. Andrew, thank you very much for all the coordination. Jessica Cornet, thank you for all the help with the publicity. And Chris, thank you so much for sharing that deep wisdom, which we all need to take on board in the rapids we are entering at the moment. I look forward to seeing everybody at a future event. Good night, and God bless—much love and light to you all.</p></body></html>

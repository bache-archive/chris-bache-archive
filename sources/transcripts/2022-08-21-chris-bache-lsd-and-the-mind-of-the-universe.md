Our program tonight was brought to us by Heather Tischbein, a personal friend of Chris's. With immense joy, Heather shared her connection with Chris, recalling that they met 20 years ago through the Holotropic Breathwork network initiated by Stan Grof. She reminisced about reading his book, *Dark Night, Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of the Mind*, and participating in an in-person workshop with him. She mentioned that when Chris's new book, *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, was advertised on the Shift Network alongside a seven-week seminar, she eagerly signed up and participated.

Over the past 20 years, Heather faced a significant health crisis that led her to a profound experience while in a coma, which she described as being off-planet. She articulated that Chris’s insights into the thematic energy of the mind of the universe resonated with her experience during that time, providing her with a deeper understanding of herself as both an individual and part of a larger whole. Despite the difficult subject matter of early childhood sexual trauma, she expressed immense gratitude for Chris's work, which has given her comfort and a sense of love for him and the worldview he presents. 

Chris opened the conversation by expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome and for being invited to share this time with everyone. He acknowledged the vast topic they were about to delve into—the birth of the future human—and emphasized the need to shape the discussion carefully, aiming to explore the core of the issue.

Chris then began discussing the current state of the planet, emphasizing that it would come as no surprise to anyone present that Earth is facing multiple crises: climate change, droughts, floods, rising sea levels, and the risk of species extinction. He noted the stark realities people are grappling with, like economic inequality and the threat posed by powerful weapons. "We are, in essence, a world on fire," he stated, highlighting the urgency of the planetary emergency that is escalating faster than anticipated.

He referenced British economist Umar Haque, who wrote about the dismal state of affairs, describing a future marked by skyrocketing inflation and societal chaos. "This is the condition we find ourselves in today," Chris observed, prefacing his remarks with a perspective rooted in his psychedelic experiences, which he elaborated in his book.

Chris provided a brief overview of his work, noting that it stemmed from the teachings of Stan Grof, whose insights altered the trajectory of his life. His exploration began after he completed graduate school in 1978 and was inspired to investigate the philosophical implications of psychedelics in understanding consciousness and the universe. Unlike traditional psychedelic therapy, which focused on terminally ill patients, Chris engaged in 73 high-dose LSD sessions over two decades, maintaining a consistent therapeutic protocol. 

He emphasized the differences between various uses of psychedelics: therapeutic healing, spiritual awakening, and cosmic exploration. Through his extensive sessions, Chris discovered that with consistent practice, he encountered deeper layers of consciousness that revealed much about the universe and humanity's place within it. 

He outlined the levels of consciousness he experienced, concluding that his work led to five fundamental categories: the personal mind, collective unconscious, archetypal mind, causal oneness, and diamond luminosity. These experiences culminated in the birth of the future human, a concept he had been exploring throughout his journey. 

Chris emphasized that these sessions revealed a series of interwoven insights about humanity's journey—a narrative of awakening that began in the early 1990s and expanded in subsequent years. He described experiencing humanity's evolution as a turning point, noting the immense challenges and transformations required for the species to awaken into a new era. 

As Chris shared excerpts from his visions, he invited listeners to enter a receptive state, encouraging them to connect with the deeper significance of his experiences rather than simply approaching them with rational thought. He delved into themes of divine love, the nobility of human suffering, and the awakening of the species as a collective being striving for greater consciousness. 

"The entire human family," he explained, "is reconnected with its fundamental nature." The process of awakening requires an understanding of collective purification—wherein humanity confronts and integrates its past to pave the way for a more refined existence. 

Chris concluded by affirming that the ideas he presented reflect a glimpse into what it means to be the future human, an experience that transcends individuality and embraces the unity of existence. He acknowledged that humanity is on the brink of a significant shift, and while the path may be fraught with difficulties, the end result promises profound transformation and clarity in the collective journey toward a higher state of consciousness.

**Chris Bache: ** Into the collective psyche, I experienced what humanity as a whole would face in the coming decades. In this visionary experience, a core scenario emerged. It began in a field of relative calm, but a small anxiety grew. Slowly, people looked up, becoming alarmed. Humanity was waking up to events that had overtaken it, and conditions worsened. Fear deepened as danger increased, forcing people to let go of their assumptions. There were fewer givens regarding how to live, where to live, what to do for a living, how society was organized, and what could be possessed. The world as they knew it was falling away.

Decades were compressed into minutes, and as people lost more of what they considered normal and necessary, a rapid reassessment of everything in their lives was forced upon them. The events that overtook Earth were so vast that no one could insulate themselves from them. Eventually, everyone was thrust into a melting pot of mere survival. Families were torn apart, life as they’d known it shattered at the core. For a time, it seemed as though no one would survive. But just when the storm peaked, the worst of it passed, and the danger slowly subsided. Many had died, but many were still alive. The survivors began to find each other, forming new social units—parents and children from different families joined to create new types of families. New social institutions sprang up, reflecting the new reality and the values discovered within the crisis.

These new social forms fueled creativity, spiraling the entire system to new levels of aliveness. It was as if the ecological crisis had triggered a vast transformation in the collective human psyche. I saw that these things would happen faster than anyone could anticipate due to the hyper-arousal of the species mind. The pace of change would be irrelevant to the pace of the past.

While my visions did not provide details about how or when this crisis would take place, it became clear we were entering a profound global systems crisis, historically unprecedented. This suffering impacts not just individuals but drives the collective psyche into what a scientist might call nonlinear conditions. Just as physical systems can perform remarkable feats when driven into non-linear states, so too can the human psyche. This condition could facilitate actions previously thought impossible. Therefore, the suffering we are entering is not punishment or a sign of failure; rather, it is instrumental in helping us let go of our narrow egoic histories and commune more deeply with the creative process of the universe.

This brings me to the question: what form will the future human take? We are undergoing a transformation that reaches deep into the fundamental substructure of the human psyche. The crisis we’re experiencing is a crisis of consciousness—an evolutionary moment. We can no longer operate as individuals driven by separate, private existences, even well-intentioned ones. We need to cultivate a deeper, more mature sense of self for this planet. In my understanding, reincarnation plays a significant role in this context.

My first book, *Life Cycles*, explored reincarnation as a fundamental concept. I believe we have empirical evidence supporting it, moving it from speculative theology to an empirical psychology. Ian Stevenson and other researchers have provided ample evidence that should convince any critical thinker that reincarnation is indeed a fact of life. 

However, through my sessions, I came to understand reincarnation beyond its traditional presentations in Eastern and Western mystical traditions. Typically, reincarnation is viewed as an individual journey of evolution, with choices made and consequences inherited. In this iterative process, individuals incrementally grow more compassionate and intelligent, ultimately maturing into spiritual awakening. Yet, this perspective leaves unexplained the purpose of space and time themselves. What were the creative impulses before these dimensions manifested? 

In a profound experience during one session, I found all my past lives merging into a single consciousness. It felt like I was wrapped in white light until they fused into one, erupting in a brilliant diamond light from my chest. From that moment, I entered a state of consciousness far beyond anything I had known. I call this the birth of the diamond soul, representing the trajectory of human evolution. 

We have incarnated for thousands of years, growing in preparation for a pivotal moment where we fully integrate past experiences into a single consciousness—the soul. After incarnation, we return to the soul, expanding from egoic awareness. This cyclical process occurs over countless lifetimes until the consciousness that contains all experiences awakens within time and space. 

Many intuitively sense we are on the cusp of a major transition in our species. We are in the process of giving birth to a new species, the nature of which is rooted in our shared history. To address the crisis we face, we must mature and integrate the larger consciousness gestating within us for millennia, allowing its wisdom to shape our choices. 

To summarize, humanity is undergoing a profound transformation during this time of planetary compression and accelerated development. This deep shift in the collective unconscious involves a tectonic shift in the psyche, awakening us to the truth of oneness—liberating individuals into deeper participation in both the human and celestial communities. 

For there to be a great awakening, a great death must precede it—purification through healing and letting go of the harms and divisions we have created among ourselves, the animosities and prejudices that have clouded our evolutionary stages. We must surrender the ego's division and cherish our shared humanity. I believe we are entering a dark night of our collective soul, marked by intense anguish, loss of control, and a systematic breakdown that may last generations. 

Yet through this labor, we will give birth to something extraordinary—more than just a new civilization; we are birthing a new order of being. The diamond soul is emerging within our history, and we are all part of this transformation. 

**Interviewer: ** That was amazing, Chris. Thank you so much. I personally resonate with what you’ve shared from my own intuitions and experiences. Let’s take a moment to breathe and open the floor to questions and conversation. 

**Chris Bache: ** I really see myself as reminding you of things you already know—things you knew before you incarnated. My sense is that everyone chooses to incarnate voluntarily, knowing beforehand what we are getting into. While we may forget upon incarnation, we recall it when we die. We are all placed here to participate in this transformative process.

**Janae: ** This is absolutely beautiful. I keep reflecting on the science surrounding DNA and our shared genome with early humans. I believe this evolution is preparing us, giving us a baseline from which to grow. And I keep wondering how long this will take. It seems you answered that—this is a process spanning generations. 

**Chris Bache: ** I don’t have specifics about the timeline; I rely on the scientists who study the escalating climate crisis and broader social ramifications. My sense is the 21st century is pivotal. By 2050, we’re likely to see a profoundly different world. The potential for near extinction is real, but extinction can accelerate evolution. If we don’t transition by the end of this century, we might not succeed at all.

**Chris Bache: ** Jean, I see you have your hand up.

**Jean Fox: ** Sorry, I was muted. I’ve been thinking about a channeler I met who wrote extensively on this and provides his insights for free. He emphasizes nature cleansing itself as part of our next steps. I believe we need to be present with each other through this process—supporting one another, especially during disasters like those happening in Kentucky. 

**Chris Bache: ** We must become the beings the world needs right now, healing ourselves and facing our shadows. There’s a synergy in humanity’s need to grow as the world seeks unity. Each of us carries different responsibilities and ways to contribute to this transformation.

**Jean Fox: ** We are of the Earth, tending our gardens and evolving symbiotically. 

**Chris Bache: ** That's right. Some people ask why I focus so much on humanity rather than other species. It's because humanity currently poses the greatest threat to life on this planet. If we heal as a species, it can ensure the safety of all others. 

**Regina: ** Thank you. I’d like to ask if you approach your work differently now compared to before.

**Chris Bache: ** Yes, I would vary the dosage levels. Initially, I believed this work was about personal transformation, but I learned it’s collective. The goal isn’t to reach a defined end point but to cultivate a deeper connection with the divine in our lives, acknowledging that it’s an infinite journey.

**Regina: ** That realization, recognizing there’s no endpoint, is profound.

**Chris Bache: ** Exactly. Whatever transition we’re experiencing is not the end of the human story. We are here for millions of years to come if we survive this crisis, and we will continue to grow. The creative intelligence of the universe, it thinks on vast scales, far beyond what we’ve imagined.

**Regina: ** Just embracing patience alone is significant—acknowledging our capacity to simply be.

**Interviewer: ** Thank you, everyone, for this deep conversation. Chris, your insights spark so much contemplation on how we engage with ourselves and our collective journey.

Chris Bache: One of the great gifts I got from Stan Grof was the understanding that when you go into these deep, cathartic, high, amplified states of consciousness, you're going to encounter stormy weather. You’ll face hard, challenging circumstances where things begin to unravel, and your instinct will be to pull back—this feels like a bad trip, and you just don’t want to be there anymore. But if you're willing to embrace it and surrender, even when you don't understand what's happening, it can take you into a crisis that eventually peaks. Some part of you will fall away, and you'll awaken into a different reality, becoming a different being with new capacities and a deeper connection to the universe. You learn to trust this cycle. You open, engage, surrender, and then are reborn, bringing back both the trauma and the ecstatic rebirth. This develops a trust that you learn through practice. 

As I've backed away from this work—having stopped my intense sessions in ’99—I've had time to live with those experiences. This brings me to your second question. Watching the shadows of history deepen, I have to rely on this deep trust. I don't know how the universe will work out what I've seen—just the tips of it—but my heart reaches out in compassion to the billions of people facing very challenging circumstances. Ultimately, you either trust or you don’t, and I choose to trust that the creative intelligence knows what it's doing. The intelligence that birthed the galaxies and life on this planet knows we are ready for this transition, and that’s why it has allowed it.

How do I live with these experiences? It hasn't always been easy. Integrating individual sessions has been manageable because I followed a strict therapeutic protocol that emphasizes clean contact and integration. I can't stress enough how important this is: if you enter psychedelics in a chaotic environment—like at a concert—you don't have that clean contact, making integration difficult. However, I found that I went deep on my journey, perhaps deeper than I should have. The challenge wasn't managing the pain; it was managing the ecstasy. Those experiences took me into divine bliss and into the ecstatic nature of transcendent reality. When I stopped my sessions, the physical world lost its appeal and couldn’t compare to the rapture I had experienced.

I know there are great spiritual beings who can live consciously in both the physical world and transcendent bliss simultaneously. I honor those great ones, but in my case, I went deeper than I could sustain. I was able to remember and record those experiences but couldn't live fully in them 24/7, which made life challenging. For decades after I stopped my sessions, I worked to integrate those experiences into my daily life. Writing *LSD and the Mind of the Universe* and going public as a psychedelic professor was part of that integration process. Living in secrecy while cultivating profound experiences was burdensome. As a philosopher, I love to learn and share what I learn, yet I couldn’t discuss these topics with students or colleagues. 

Beginning to talk about these experiences in a systematic way through my book has helped me stabilize and integrate them, allowing me to make peace with that work. Through that book, I became in the outside world what I was in my inner work, and in that, there is great peace. However, integration is an ongoing process. I don’t think I'll fully integrate this work in this lifetime, as what integration means changes as experiences deepen. Right now, we don't fully understand what entering these states of consciousness is even doing to us. We are enthusiastic about our ability to access these states, but we haven’t caught up with ourselves. We have much work to do in the area of integration. 

I would recommend a book called *Psychedelics and Psychotherapy*, edited by Maria Papa Spira and Tim Reed, as it specifically addresses the question of integration. I have an article in the book.

Interviewer: What was the name of that book?

Chris Bache: *Psychedelics and Psychotherapy*.

Interviewer: Do you find yourself being more aware of your state in each moment and making choices, or is it beyond that?

Chris Bache: I want to return to the difference between therapeutic healing, spiritual awakening, and cosmic logical exploration. Your question essentially asks how these experiences affect my psycho-spiritual condition. If I were seeking spiritual awakening, I would use a completely different protocol—perhaps working with low doses for that purpose. To realize a kind of abiding transparency, you need to work with where the ego exists in the world so you can relax into the present and into the oneness that holds all things together. Cosmic logical exploration, however, has a different agenda. Whatever I can integrate or not from those cosmic logical experiences does not significantly impact the deeper truths revealed in that cosmic adventure. As a philosopher, my pursuit was to understand how the universe works, and while some experiences can be stabilized and integrated, many simply cannot.

I was doing spiritual practices and meditation throughout all my work and will continue to do so. One way I practice today is by cultivating conscious recall of my memories. This isn't to fixate on the past but because my memories are my deepest experiences of the universe. By recalling them consciously, I can approximate that state of intimacy again. It’s not a constant 24/7 experience for me; it comes and goes and requires daily practice.

Interviewer: Thank you so much.

Jonai: That kind of leads into my question or comment about cultivating the conscious recall of your experiences. Does this include everything—past lives, this life, or whatever?

Chris Bache: In my psychedelic work, I did encounter some former lives. I’ve also encountered them in the therapy work I did for three years. But in this context, I mainly focus on my psychedelic experiences. Interestingly, I don’t focus much on integrating my former lives; they feel comfortably tucked away. Instead, I cultivate the memory of cosmic logical access.

What’s strange is that those with deep spiritual experiences often have them within a meditation or contemplative tradition, allowing them to hold onto what they’ve tapped into. This method is different; I emphasize the path of temporary immersion rather than abiding presence. You need to come to terms with the temporariness of these conditions and use those hours to affect long-term change in your psyche. Just because someone has had a powerful spiritual experience doesn’t mean they become a powerful being; people made that mistake in the early days. We need to remember that these experiences are temporary. What matters is what we do the day after our session.

Jonai: Everything is an opportunity for learning. Back in 1998, I jumped into the Nine Gates Mystery School, and from there, I did some preliminary work. I wanted to touch on reincarnation, which ties into the new trajectory you mentioned. I’ve done a lot of past life work involving karmic issues and forgiveness processes that change the energy surrounding those experiences. It makes a tremendous difference because that energy no longer affects us. I've helped others with that too. It’s about accepting what’s happened in the past, forgiving if necessary, and moving forward. 

You're also indicating that everything in this lifetime and the future is interconnected. I see reading as crucial for updating myself, learning from your book and speeches. I feel a sort of understanding even though I haven’t gone through the psychedelic experience like you have. I’ve always believed in learning from others to save time. You’ve spent years on this journey, and now you’re sharing it, providing us a place to start.

I started counting backward on my birthdays from 60, believing that our bodies should last 120 years. If I stop counting forward to avoid that aging mindset and just hang out there for however long, who knows what’s possible with our inner technology for repair and rejuvenation?

Chris Bache: Thank you. 

Jean: Chris, if someone wanted to do their own journeying, would you recommend it be guided or self-guided?

Chris Bache: I recommend working with someone who knows the territory if you’re going to use psychedelics. I have concerns about the role of guidance. I don’t see a sitter’s role as one of direction but as keeping you safe and focused during your inner work. The universe guides you; the sitter’s role includes safety and focus. If you're amplifying consciousness, it's vital to work with someone who has therapeutic skills and who understands the territory. Just so you know, psychedelics aren't the primary issue. The title *LSD and the Mind of the Universe* came from the publisher; I originally titled it *Diamonds from Heaven* because it’s a story of initiation. Psychedelics are simply another technology for accessing deep states of awareness.

I urge you to be careful and conscientious. Many who open these doors walk away traumatized and scarred, so we need to take care.

Jean: There are many different kinds of therapists, but it's hard to discern who is trustworthy.

Chris Bache: Things are changing. Various places are legalizing mushrooms, and many people are getting certified as psychedelic therapists. The future is opening up in ways we never could have anticipated 15 years ago. Thanks to people like Michael Pollan, we’re entering a new era, but we’re still transitioning and in a gray zone.

Interviewer: Thank you. Our time is running out, but I want to ask just two more questions.

Chris Bache: I appreciate your question and your answer, Chris. I think this topic is extremely important. I speak from a different experience; you've been tracking things scientifically. I had some experiences with microdosing that were more social. My last session was solitary and in nature. Emotionally, it took me to a poignant place where I experienced both joy and grief, grappling with the beauty of creation and our human failings. Without a sitter to provide guidance through that, I thought I was having a bummer time just struggling with emotions. In hindsight, I recognize that my life has been an effort to integrate that experience.

This is not to be done lightly; even with microdosing, having guidance is crucial. I appreciate your detailed response to the last question. Thank you for everything you’ve shared, Chris.

Georgena: I have a couple of quick questions. Is LSD contraindicated for those with traumatic brain injury?

Chris Bache: That's a question for a clinical professional. It would depend on the injury's nature. 

Georgena: You mentioned lack, limitation, and fear while discussing the crisis we’re facing. How can we interpret and work through those feelings as we face this crisis?

Chris Bache: Some people warn that focusing too much on the negative can bring that reality into existence. I understand that perspective, but I believe the primary danger is not facing those realities head-on. If we don’t confront the truth about our situation—how extended we are with the planet—we won't initiate the essential changes. I prefer to sit with those who bravely engage the grief of what we've done to our species and the planet, working through those feelings until resolution, and then determining how to move forward.

Georgena: Thank you.

Interviewer: Thank you, Chris, this has been amazing, inspiring, and powerful. I appreciate your contributions and the insights you’ve shared. I’m going to read your book. Which one should I read first?

Chris Bache: *LSD and the Mind of the Universe* is much simpler to read than *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, which is more academic. However, if you don't know much about reincarnation, I recommend starting with *Life Cycles*, as reincarnation is fundamental to what emerges in *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*.

Interviewer: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. This was a wonderful discussion. We may need to have you back to talk about your book later on. Thanks again, Chris. 

Chris Bache: Thank you so much.

Interviewer: Goodbye, everyone, and thank you again.

**Chris Bache: ** I have an understanding of the life process from studying cases of small children who have spontaneous memories of their most immediate former life. We have hundreds of these cases documented by Dr. Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia, and through studying child and adult psychotherapists who help people recover early trauma and the healing it produces in their present life. We've accumulated enormous evidence for the fact that we reincarnate many, many times. My concern is to consider the implications of this for how we live our life, understand our relationships, and comprehend reincarnation as a fact of life. 

When we die, we return to spirit, to soul, and to a larger intelligence. We consciously choose the circumstances of our next incarnation, focusing on experience, and then we die and expand into the larger arena again. We come back and learn. It's like college, choosing courses, focusing for the semester, stepping back at the end, and choosing another round of courses. Over hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of years, we grow. It places all our questions and relationships on a larger perspective, lifting the constriction of time from our understanding of existence. 

Having tens of thousands of years to accomplish life's purpose offers a vast landscape to create and understand. We develop the life process not just for years or decades, but for tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of years. This perspective invites us to undertake projects that we won't fully realize in this lifetime but will see fruition in lifetimes to come. It expands our sense of connection to others because relationships may not have started in this lifetime and will continue in subsequent ones. It expands our creative canvas immensely.

We don't fully understand how entering extreme non-ordinary states of consciousness impacts our incarnation. Whether gentle states, psychedelic states, or staying close to unearth pain, we have medical models to understand. If we experience life continuity and cosmic intelligence, spiritual models can help. Going very deep into the universe, beyond space and time, and immersing in the crystalline body of the Divine is something we're still trying to understand. It's changed my understanding of life, history, and the Divine—beyond conventional, cultural concepts of the Divine.

Entering into these states gives us seeds of understanding and experience. We nourish those seeds using traditional spiritual practices, meditation, and compassion. Keeping silent about these experiences limited their integration into my life. Now that I speak and teach from these experiences, it has deepened their integration. Though I've just begun to write and speak about them completely, after 20 years, the messages I take away encourage me to banish fear, cultivate love, and compassion for all beings. Fear stems from isolation, while a rich individuality relates compassionately with the world. 

Some spiritual traditions teach that everything done for oneself causes pain, while doing for others brings joy and liberation by enacting the truth of oneness. We are on a maturational journey not concluded in decades or centuries. This maturation takes tens of thousands, millions, or billions of years—a dance with the universe.

Focusing on the human race, my work gave me many visionary experiences of human evolution. Consciousness opening to the species mind brings insights into its developmental trajectory. Humanity is approaching a great awakening, but it requires a deep purification process—a dark night of the collective soul. Confronting our historical shortcomings, we open to emerging greatness. We're entering a time of purification, destructuring, and rebirth, driven by a global ecological crisis.

Our planet striving to become one parallels our individual journey to wholeness. The global systems crisis demands personal integration. The solution lies in the birth of the diamond soul—soul consciousness inside time and space. All experiences of all past lives fuse in an explosion of energy, lifting the experience of being alive to a higher register. Humanity is in labor, giving birth to a new being with expanded compassion and an open mind.

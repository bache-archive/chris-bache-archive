<p>Richard Rudd
Hi, Chris. Here we are.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
Made possible only with new technology—me in North Carolina, USA, and our guests from all over the world.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd
Absolutely—and the magic that, even though we’re doing this now, many others will be watching in another “now.” I want to welcome all those people in all of those nows, all those different timelines.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
It’s been fun having this dialogue with you, sharing ideas and perspectives on reincarnation. I’ve really been enjoying it.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd
Me too. I’ve learned a lot from you. Since I read your book—it really blew my mind and had so many resonances for me—Diamonds and LSD and the Mind of the Universe. For those who haven’t heard about it, it’s quite something. I recommend it heartily right at the beginning here. It’s afforded us a rich exploration and overlaps with my work with the Gene Keys.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
A real pleasure.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd
And it’s an ongoing journey for us, isn’t it? We haven’t finished—this is just us getting going, I think. We’ll probably explore this subject in the coming months and perhaps years, keep diving deeper, mining the insights we can, and involving a community of people to engage with us like this today.</p>
<p>So, we might as well jump straight in. We’ve got a load of questions already sent in. The plan is: Chris and I have sorted them into categories, and we’re going to rip through those first because they cover a broad range of subjects connected to reincarnation. Thank you to everyone who sent questions—they’ve helped sharpen the inquiry, and some of them lead to more questions. You should also know we don’t have all the answers, but we’ll explore together. We’ll do that first, then come round to the live Q&amp;A. We have 90 minutes—plenty of time to explore.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
We broke up the questions—there were so many good ones we could spend hours just on those already sent in. We clustered them. Let’s touch some from the first cluster so participants can get a sense of the types of questions people asked after listening to our dialogue, then we can move to the next cluster.</p>
<p>The first cluster we identified as: How can we acquire personal knowledge of our former lives? Because it’s one thing to have someone tell you about these things; it’s another to do your own research; and it’s another still to have personal experience of your own former life history. For example: “How can we get closer to completely trusting the universe and that reincarnation is true if all we have is book knowledge or stories from others?” Another: “Is it possible to have a connection with your previous lifetimes in your present life?” Another: “Can you give us a practical method that allows us to remember our past lives and see the lessons we’re working on and what needs healing in our present life?” And: “Have each of you personally experienced an awareness of your past lives leading to the present, and was it beneficial?”</p>
<p>It’s a really important question set: Can we trust this material? How can I get closer to it? How can I begin to experience these things for myself? I started to accept reincarnation on the basis of research—there are many wonderful books deserving of close attention. But it’s another thing when you start to have personal experience of your own lives, when you go inside—through contemplation, hypnosis, or past-life therapy—and begin to follow your memories back into earlier memories, having the vivid experience that your consciousness is bigger, older, and has a longer history than your body. That makes the idea live in your heart differently than before. Don’t you think?</p>
<p>Richard Rudd
Absolutely. One of my favorite questions in there was: Once I know about the soul that gathers all my lives into one, what are some practices to help me embody it in my present human life? We’re talking about contacting the energy of the soul—the part of us that’s eternal. That’s a journey we’re all on.</p>
<p>I firmly feel these memories are actually held in the physicality of our body. Begin with the premise that inside your physical body, somewhere, memories are held. This will involve some relationship with the physical—breathing, awareness, mindfulness, contemplation. There are many techniques, but I’d offer broad guidance: if you’re keen to know more about your own story beyond this lifetime (forwards or backwards), start really listening. To really listen, clear space in your life. Have a practice of listening—contemplation, meditation, prayer—anything that enhances awareness of frequencies beyond the body. Find the methods that resonate with you; that’s a good indication they’ll open the inner world.</p>
<p>Then create the space and put out the question: I’d like to know more. I’d like to remember more. You’re reaching into the ethers and inviting revelation—a series of revelations. That’s going to be a journey, as it has been for Chris and me. We’ve gone very different ways, so begin with what feels right and the rest will open up inside you. You’ve had more experience, I think, Chris, with the past-life therapy community—maybe you could give a few pointers.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
When someone asks for practical techniques to discover former lives, I’d say there are no shortcuts. It’s a matter of living with this information and systematically exploring your deep consciousness by following your memories to earlier and earlier stages. This can be done with contemplation and various meditation exercises. It can be greatly aided by working with professionals who can help you stay conscious at deeper levels of memory, because when we go beneath the personal unconscious we often get fuzzy or fall asleep. Someone can help you keep focus as you go deeper. It’s often good to focus on a particular issue, problem, or joy and follow that to its root.</p>
<p>There are many ways in. Some people’s memories are activated on a massage table; others in meditation. Once you appreciate that your being is older than your body and live with that idea every day, it becomes natural to live in a world saturated with time—relationships saturated with time and life projects. It makes less and less sense to compress everything into one lifetime and more sense to let it unfold into a larger agenda.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd
Another good tip: don’t be in a rush. Take your time. You have all the time you need to explore this mystery. The subject we’re opening isn’t just reincarnation and rebirth—it opens into all the deep questions: What are we? Why are we here? How does it work? In the Gene Keys, as many of you know, there’s an infuriating habit of pointing people back into their own wisdom. If you can begin to access the wisdom that lies inside you—start with the body—explore who you are, work through issues and shadows and trauma, forgive, let go, surrender, go through inner transformation. As you do, you open space inside for wisdom and memories to appear. They’ll tell you exactly what you need when you need it—not before, not after.</p>
<p>For some it’s visual; for others kinesthetic—arriving in a place and knowing you’ve been there, meeting a person and recognizing them. It could come through any sense, or through attunement to synchronicities. As we heighten awareness, we pick up on the interconnectivity beyond this world and resonate with other dimensions. That’s wisdom—clarity flowing from other dimensions that informs this one in an expansive, therapeutic way.</p>
<p>If you have these questions, the journey is always one of going deeper into the question itself, sinking into the heart of it. It likely has another question hidden inside, and another. Keep opening. Trust your intuition and follow the threads through the labyrinth.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
Shall we pull a couple from the “nuts and bolts” category—How does reincarnation work? Some quick ones: Do we stay in one ancestry or hop across others? We hop. Could our next incarnation be as our children or grandchildren? Research suggests yes—people can reincarnate in families. Are animals part of the reincarnation cycle? In all reincarnation cultures, yes—but animals tend to be earlier stages of reincarnational lives. Once you’ve developed to function at a human level, there’s not much to be learned by going back to animal lives. So while animals are part of our heritage, we don’t typically incarnate from human to animal, even though that’s a popular folk belief. Do you want to pull a couple from that list?</p>
<p>Richard Rudd
I’d like to go back to ancestry. I was recently talking to a wonderful man, Tyson Jung ka Porter, an Aboriginal indigenous man. In many indigenous cultures they track incarnations and hold a strong intuition that within a tribal, family, or clan grouping there’s a real link between a person and the great-grandchildren or great-grandparents. It often skips a couple of generations. There’s no fixed way of understanding it, but it’s a firm tradition.</p>
<p>Recently my father died, and I’ve been going through ancestral things. I found photographs of my great-grandparents and felt an uncanny resonance I can’t explain. I intuitively put their photographs on my desk—those were the two I wanted to look at. They’ve been looking at me for the last month or so. So yes, it seems to follow through lineages, but it also hops about. There may be a deeper storyline to that.</p>
<p>There was also a question about wounding from the past—healing trauma in the body—which connects to the nature of incarnation. As you put it, Chris, we’re moving beyond the “up and out” philosophy of attaining enlightenment and leaving Samsara. I speak more about being “down and in.” The more work we do internallly—clearing patterns, transmuting shadows, forgiving and letting go of trauma through the physical, emotional, and mental body—the more space there is for us to incarnate more deeply. Our soul is vast, most of it not here. As we clear our being—particularly the belly, the navel, where everything seems to cluster—more light can live here. You begin to radiate more; you unlock more joy and healing energy because more of your soul can come here. That’s how heaven comes to earth—through doing this shadow work so more of us incarnates.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
Two more questions stand out. First: Why do we forget our past lives in the first place? And second, a variation: If we are eternal and infinite, what’s the point of reincarnating in different bodies? Couldn’t we live eternity’s different experiences in one body?</p>
<p>I ask my students to imagine you’re the creative intelligence of the universe designing a system to maximize accelerated learning. You’ve got two scenarios: a body lives 100,000 years, gathering experiences; or a body lives 100 years and, every century, you pull it out and plug it back in with a different body, gender, and role. After 100,000 years, which system produces the more evolved being? Discontinuity leads to variety; variety accelerates learning. We forget former lives so we can fully immerse in new circumstances—the differences challenge and grow us.</p>
<p>That said, there comes a time when the soul begins bringing lives together. When we start assimilating, what often shows up first are the pains and tensions left over. As we work with those, we tap into the assets—the virtues and capacities—of those lives. Much discussion of reincarnation is influenced by past-life literature, which is therapeutic: people come because they’re carrying pain. But most past lives don’t manifest as pain in our present life—they manifest as capacities, skills, knowledge. We need to avoid tilting only toward pain. There comes a time to integrate those lives—a different stage than earlier, when we sought novelty. I think we’re at a time in history where the emphasis is on integrating our past, not simply pushing into new territory.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd
That’s a great point. It made me think about parallel universes to incarnate into. When a soul evolves to transmute more of the world’s karma, there seems to be greater elasticity—more ability to transmigrate between dimensions and to break some of the rules of linear incarnating sequences. We often imagine stitching a beautiful fabric through lives in sequence. I think many lives do that. But as we gain wisdom, time becomes more flexible.</p>
<p>Some of you asked if I have specific memories of past lives. I kind of do—and I also don’t—because part of my mindstream doesn’t wish to cling to locations in the spacetime continuum. There’s a playfulness in the way my mind operates. It reads a whole stream, a fractal, a passage down a lineage, feels a resonance, follows it—forward and backward in time. They’re not just historical, they’re more mythic. There’s interdimensional play as a soul gains experience. We can cross into other dimensions, travel with beings from other dimensions, have connectivity and memory there—sometimes even a sense of a twin energy in another dimension. Many people carry the feeling they’re not alone—something’s traveling with them—whether named or not.</p>
<p>In our talk we explored “deep time,” where you step outside spacetime and 10,000 years can pass as a single stitch. One of my last incarnations feels a long time ago—that might seem like I’ve been waiting on another plane. But that could be instantaneous—a bigger loop in the stitching rather than lots of little ones. You can also take leaps forward. The wider your evolutionary lens, the more collective it becomes, the more of the tapestry of spacetime you can see. You’re no longer doing a little stitch for yourself—you see a whole section of the weave, your place in it: “I did that little stitch there; I was part of that.” Then you pan out and it’s vast beyond comprehension—so many beings, all one being, weaving an incredible tapestry. There’s a lot of play in here. Open your heart to that.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
Beautifully said. Reincarnation answers certain questions, but it also changes the direction of our questions and opens us to a more complex universe. One question in this category we should address is suicide, because it comes from a very deep place. Someone asked: What happens with the soul of a person who commits suicide?</p>
<p>In a reincarnating universe where nothing is eternal and everything is changing, suicide is one more episode of learning. It’s not a mortal sin and doesn’t lead to eternal damnation. There are many reasons people take their lives; we may call them all “suicide,” but the motivational structures differ. Even suicides that come as acts of desperation are greeted by the universe with understanding and compassion. When we die, we go through a life review and debrief with other levels of intelligence. Life inside time and space is hard; people get desperate. Acts made in desperation do not have eternal consequences. We’re not punished; we’re met—and we learn. All actions can become habitual—anger can become a trait; suicide can become a habit that shows up across incarnations. So it’s important to confront the limits that led to such a desperate act and find a different outcome. But suicide certainly does not lead to perpetual estrangement from the intelligence or love of the universe.</p>
<p>Your thoughts, Richard?</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
I was thinking how suicide is almost loneliness taken to its far, far extreme—where it becomes so unbearable that it feels like the only option. That’s a very human condition. As you said, it’s absolutely understandable that we feel deeply lonely at times, and sometimes the conditions around us are so difficult and challenging that one can empathize with that.</p>
<p>In one of the recordings I shared with you recently—the one we’re going to link to—I called it the “rebirth sequence.” It simply lays out the stages of moving from dying through the Bardo stages. The final stage I call “the arms of the mother.” That’s what you land in after the life review, coming into self-forgiveness—because you are forgiven, but you have to forgive yourself. That includes acts of aggression and violence toward others, even things like murder—the terrible things that take place on this earth plane.</p>
<p>From outside the human plane—from the arms of the mother—it’s not about revenge or retribution. It’s about reconciliation and transmutation, and very often about forgiveness, especially self-forgiveness. The soul has to learn from whatever it’s done, absorb and integrate it, forgive, move on, and become stronger through it. That’s what this whole reincarnating journey offers us.</p>
<p>If you really tune in deeply, as you have, Chris, in your journeys into the field of wounding—as you describe in your book—you realize we’ve all done atrocious things. We carry memories of terrible deeds we were party to, part of, or on the victim side of, on all kinds of levels inside us. I have a hunch a lot of that memory is in the non-coding DNA in our body—the so-called “junk DNA” that forms almost 90% of our DNA. Somewhere in here are memories of places we’ve been, people we’ve been, things we’ve done.</p>
<p>Isn’t the most beautiful insight from an incarnating worldview that we are always forgiven, we are loved? Knowing that opens up the journey of the higher soul. The soul then begins to experience itself as light, as a Christ or Buddha impulse. It becomes a beacon, wanting to help others and be of service and enter a higher evolution. That seems the natural progression of a deep encounter with the nature of what we call evil or sin—or suffering. That edge helps us become better beings—more beautiful beings—ultimately through self-forgiveness and the forgiveness of others. I understand it’s a big stretch for some people.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes—self-forgiveness, forgiveness of others—and also restitution. There’s nothing we’ve done that we can’t repair or make better, because we have opportunity and time. We can change our past by changing our present, and by moving forward we can make restitution. We can help; we can bring healing where we brought injury before.</p>
<p>We have many questions stacking up in the Q&amp;A, but I know we wanted to touch briefly on the coming shift, because there were a couple of questions about it. One person wrote, “I feel very worried about the changes ahead that you spoke about, and wonder if you could offer a sense of hope to those of us who are struggling.” Another person said, “I think this shift that you are discussing can happen in as soon as 20 years.” Very different takes.</p>
<p>I think there are great grounds for hope—not the hope that we can avoid the suffering that’s coming or change it, but hope based on trust: trust in the intelligence of the universe. The intelligence that brought us through the oxygen crisis billions of years ago, that gave us a 50% increase in brain size 200,000 years ago, that we see bubbling up layer after layer in the natural world—that intelligence has brought the human race to this point. It’s basically forcing us to shed the limitations of living out of just our private, egoic body-mind, and summoning us to live out of a deeper soul awareness, with a felt connection to other beings, other species, the planet as a whole, and life as a whole.</p>
<p>There’s tremendous grounds for hope, but not the hope of avoiding pain and suffering—the hope born in the middle of pain and suffering, out of a deep conviction that a deeper intelligence is expressing itself. We may not see its full parameters, but we can have confidence that this intelligence is functioning here as it functions in other areas of life.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Exactly—and that intelligence is essentially benevolent. Through suffering, it comes to know its higher nature. As more of us come to that point inside our soul’s evolution, humanity as a whole moves toward the realization that we are actually one being here doing this.</p>
<p>We see this externally through the internet and global connectivity. We also see the shadows more clearly than ever, but we also have the capacity to heal more than we ever have because of this connectivity. Humanity seems to drive itself to the edge of a precipice—talking to indigenous people recently, they say their racial memory banks go back millions of years. In their memory this has happened many times: we come to crisis. We sometimes have to reach these crux points for there to be enough energy to push us over and through.</p>
<p>That’s not pleasant, and as that energy builds we’ll collectively feel more uneasy in our body-biome. However, as we expand into soul awareness and into trust—the field of trust underpinning the whole process—this can begin to inform our biology. I know that both Chris and I feel deeply safe in this world, even as it moves closer to what looks like an Armageddon-type scenario. There’s an underlying benevolence and intelligence preparing us for a quantum leap. We have to sink into that trust field embedded in the eternal nature of our soul.</p>
<p>This journey into expanding our awareness of the incarnating universe and humanity is really important. First it opens the mind to play again—like when we were teenagers. For many of us, in our 20s and 30s, materialistic conditioning fell over us like a heavy cloak. It can be a great relief to shed some of that. It doesn’t mean shedding science and its wonderful revelations—it means opening to deeper possibilities. The mind can go, “Wow, anything really is possible.” We do live in a magical universe we don’t yet fully understand. Science is methodical and moves at its own pace, but the mind can expand and open to great vistas. That’s the first stage in beginning to feel safe inside oneself again. I really hope that’s part of the journey we can build together here, Chris, by continuing to map these other realms.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes, very much. We’re committed. We’re here. One of the things I talk about in terms of this coming era is the birth of the diamond soul in history. I think the conversation you and I are having with everyone gathered with us is a small part of that process. To become aware of reincarnation—intellectually and in your heart—gives permission for that reality to manifest more deeply in your life. That awareness facilitates the emergence of the diamond soul in your own being. For some, it may come in slowly; for others, dramatically. But becoming conscious—even of the possibility—facilitates deeper integration.</p>
<p>Shall we shift to some of the questions from our live audience that we haven’t touched on?</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Before we do that, let me nail a couple of Gene Keys questions more specific to me. Someone asked about “walk-ins”—a being that comes into a body and supersedes it in some way. Some say, “I had an experience like that and was completely changed. I was a new person. Should I study a different Gene Keys profile from that date?” I’d say it’s important to have both. You need the old rootstock. If a new hybrid has come in, those two have to harmonize. Use both and explore both. It’s an added complexity, but a rich journey. Play with it as you wish.</p>
<p>There was also a question about continuity—whether Gene Keys algorithms that determine our awakening journey and incarnation themes carry across lives. I’d say yes, there’s continuity between sequences, but you don’t have the same sequences—though you might, through some sleight of hand of the Creator. There are patterns woven within the matrix and numbers, and if you could look at many lifetimes you’d begin to see them. They’re not always obvious. When I used to do Gene Keys and Human Design readings, I saw patterns between people and their families and partners—recurring numbers and sequences. It’s so densely woven that it shows something not just kept to one lifetime—it continues on. There are threads we’re weaving. More on that at a later date. Let’s move to some live questions.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
So many good questions. One touches me: Why do souls reincarnate for short periods—an infant dying after birth or a young child dying very young? These are great heartaches for any parent. Things that look very large from inside the time-space, egoic perspective don’t look the same from the soul’s perspective. It feels tragic for us, but for the soul they’re all short lives. A 10-minute life and a 100-year life are small bits of time against the vast spectrum of the soul’s lifetime.</p>
<p>Past-life therapists who have engaged souls with these experiences generally agree that, for the most part, they are chosen incarnations. They chose them, knowing what they were entering. Sometimes the lesson was for someone else—to be the grain of sand in the oyster that catalyzes growth in others. But they are chosen, part of an ongoing unfolding process. Reincarnation gives us permission to understand that life doesn’t begin at birth or end at death, so we can let go of some of the heartache. There is separation and pain when a life we wanted to spend time with ends, but life does not end at death. Relationships do not end at death, and purpose is not extinguished in death.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Beautifully answered. Such a tender question. Malabika asks about the soul outgrowing Gaia and moving on to other systems—can the soul determine where it will go, when, and as what? How much free will does the soul have, and are other forces at work?</p>
<p>For me, there are two forces: evolution and involution. Evolution is the soul evolving through experiences—coming in and out of form, becoming broader and more aware of its universal nature. Involution is the arms of the mother—the whole collective, the divine consciousness doing all this through its monads, its fractal, holographic children—different crystalline aspects of itself. The whole is also doing it. So there’s a choreography from the whole taking place, and within that there’s serpentine freedom and flow as the individual crystal souls—the diamond souls—become aware of what they really are: the whole, while also being a part of the whole. The ocean and the drop—how can both be true? It’s beyond the mind, a paradox known through revelation.</p>
<p>Both are true: we determine where we’re going, and the mother determines. The mothership has its own choreography and dance that we’re part of. It’s an incredible dance, playing with that paradox.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
A question from Catherine: Buddhists say reincarnation is like transferring the light from one candle to another. What do you think of this interpretation—transferring both personal and collective karmic stuff?</p>
<p>When the Buddha was asked what self incarnates, he lined up candles, lit the second from the first, blew out the first, lit the third from the second, and so on. At the end, is it the same flame or a different flame? The answer is both—but Buddhists emphasize it’s a different flame. In fact, it’s a different flame from second to second.</p>
<p>The teaching of no-self doesn’t mean we aren’t individuals. It means there is no permanent individuality and no separate individuality. There’s no permanent self that never changes, and no separate self cut off from the rest of existence. Individuality—the center of our experience—is open and porous. It takes in and gives out energy. It’s not static; it constantly changes.</p>
<p>If we take the candle example, it leads to a more subtle description of reincarnation. Likewise, field theory is a good set of metaphors for the soul. The soul isn’t a thing or a machine. If we think of souls as fields, fields are open at the boundaries—there’s an easy give-and-take between them. Good question.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Catherine—beautiful answer, Chris. Your knowledge of different theologies is so helpful. Nisha asks about the Bardo realms—maybe both of us can say something. She’s suggesting, is it possible this life is a Bardo? For those who don’t know, the Tibetan Buddhist—only the Tibetans, is it, Chris, who name the Bardo?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Their vocabulary, I think.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
So the Bardo is a transitory threshold state between lives—the stages as we move from one state to another. There’s a whole description of stages moving from birth to death and death to birth, with transformations and attachments at different layers.</p>
<p>In a broader sense, Westerners now use Bardo to mean an impermanent, transitional realm. From that perspective, yes, it’s possible that Earth is one of those Bardos—one of the experiences the whole is exploring. Think of theaters: in this theater, there are characters and storylines and plays. The whole is the audience, outside space and time, watching the expansion of the process. All the Bardos exist within space and time. There are heaven realms of the deities and bliss realms, and there are hell realms with all the stuff, and all the places in between. In one sense, all are Bardo experiences between states. It’s all a theater, as Shakespeare said.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Well said. The word Bardo is used in different ways. One is in terms of levels of existence—from the lowest hell realm to the hungry ghost realm, animal realm, human, lower deities and higher deity realms. These exist in the cosmos, in the spiritual world outside physical reality. We enter these various Bardos depending on the quality of consciousness accumulated over many lifetimes.</p>
<p>Then it gets intimate when teachers say all those Bardos are taking place right now in the physical world. There are deity realms—people born with a silver spoon, where everything flows. Others live in hellish conditions, where everything is turning over. Then it gets even more immediate. A samurai once asked a Zen master the difference between heaven and hell. The master insulted him—his clothes were dirty, his sword dull. The samurai, with permission to kill, drew his sword and raised it to strike. The master said, “That’s hell.” The samurai recognized the great compassion of the teacher who risked his life to teach him, felt compassion, and put away his sword. The master said, “That’s heaven.”</p>
<p>These aren’t just lifetime-long states; they can last minutes. We go in and out of levels of reality minute by minute. The invitation is: what is it that doesn’t change? What inside us witnesses everything, unchanged as emotions and bodies change? When we discover that and hold it in our awareness while living these changes, it shifts the quality of life. It grounds us deeper into the living texture of existence—to live in God-awareness, or divine awareness, or the awareness of the Living Universe.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Thank you for that great story. It occurred to me that one of the great modern metaphors for the reincarnative story is Groundhog Day. It’s a wonderful, funny film—so wise. It hits something deep in us: the repeating of trying things in different ways—first trying to take advantage, then becoming hopeless—all the dramas played out in one day. That’s a metaphor for this planet: one world, all those dramas, until you create the perfect day—your perfect life. You bring it to a crescendo. You’ve perfected your soul within it, even though you had to go through terrible things. It just came to me as you were talking. What do you think?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Here’s another good one. Sherry writes: I have had many traumas in this lifetime. I’m tired of all the spiritual practices and processing—there are so many. I’ve done so much spiritual work. This is why I love Gene Keys and Richard’s way of teaching. I just desire to be the love I know myself to be. Do you think it’s necessary to do past-life regression? I don’t have the money for it. Or will we ever just be the love and know that to be enough?</p>
<p>I don’t think you have to do past-life therapy to engage karma conscientiously, heal what needs healing, and deepen what can be deepened. What’s important is to live one’s life well. If you live your life well, all the karma from your past will come up in your life in some time and circumstance, and you’ll take care of business as you go.</p>
<p>Reincarnation has been going on for hundreds of thousands of years, whether or not we know, believe, or understand reincarnation and karma. Awareness adds acceleration—we can stop avoiding and start embracing more. As we embrace, we resolve more issues, and live a more relaxed, open, and challenging life. So no, I don’t think anyone needs past-life therapy to live a well and satisfying life. Live your life deeply. All your karma is right here around you. If you want help getting around a particular issue or moving a particular boulder, that can be helpful if you can do it, but it’s an extra.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Great—and a lovely question as well, really beautifully phrased. Being just is; it’s enough to just be. Of course it’s enough to be. That’s the most we can do, really. So I very much resonate with that question. There’s a question here about old and new souls, the number of souls, and populations expanding and contracting. It’s an interesting question. If you think about it, most of the answers lie in nature. If you’re observant, listening, looking, and really contemplating, the answers are there. You’re walking through a forest and you see all these plants and trees: old trees, middle-aged trees, young ones shooting up everywhere. There are parasite trees. There are weeds. They’re all part of the ecosphere.</p>
<p>It’s the same here on Earth—on Gaia. We have enlightened beings. We have beautiful beings. We have villains and ruffians and vagabonds. We have all different souls exploring and experimenting. We have young ones—little saplings—still learning, who maybe get involved in difficult things, deep in suffering, deep into corruption, and learning through that. And then there are older ones who’ve done all that and are trying to work more deeply into the collective or into some area where they’ve taken on a lot of suffering, to heal inside themselves on behalf of the whole, or they’re working in service in some way.</p>
<p>There are all these different storylines and threads. Sometimes the forest dies back in places and it’s less populous. Sometimes it suddenly expands and thrives. They’re all phases. None of it is healthy or unhealthy—it’s just what it is, part of the whole theater, the tapestry. One of the things the reincarnating view, the rebirth view, brings to me is a sense of amorality. That doesn’t take away true morals and ethics, which I believe are naturally inherent in human beings. But there’s this sense that it’s just going on. There’s a journey taking place, and we’re at some point in that journey right now. The collective is at some point right now. Our individuality is participating in that right now.</p>
<p>I’ve been sharing this deeply recently in a big retreat—thousands of people—in the Venus Sequence, a process of healing emotional trauma. When you heal some pattern inside your own being, you reach out and heal it in the whole, in the collective, because it is all one rippling, interconnected web. I may be saying the same thing over and over, but I really want people to understand: this is the theater—old souls, new souls. Maybe when you get to a certain stage, you have more choice available. You can leave; you can go somewhere else, as if you’ve earned enough to buy a ticket further on. And you might also come back and bring your wisdom here. A lot of imagination is needed when we enter this kind of territory.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes, very much. With reincarnation, you have to live with it for a long time and bring the questions people are asking into that paradigm, then sit with it to get intimations of the depth of how it recontextualizes the way we usually think. Here’s a question by Jacqueline that really stretches us: how can collective suffering be a creative process rooted in cosmic love? That’s a hard question, because of the sheer scale. It’s hard even for an individual life: how is suffering in our life compatible with the idea that the universe is compassionate and loving? At a collective level—of the type we were talking about in our third dialog, our coming challenging period of history—how can suffering of that magnitude be a creative process rooted in cosmic love?</p>
<p>I’m reminded that Ramakrishna, the great Hindu saint, said if you want to understand God, you must be willing to look evil in the face, because evil is not outside the Divine but part of the Divine process, and suffering is part of the Divine process. Any compassionate person wants to reduce and end suffering. That’s natural. We see suffering as the enemy, something we want to stop. But when we start to second-guess creation—Couldn’t you have given us what you want us to become without dragging us through so many centuries and millennia of pain and suffering, or taking us through more in the future?—that assumes we know what the project is, what the agenda is, and the best way to get to that outcome.</p>
<p>So we would have to ask: what is the project of cosmic love? What are we doing here? What is creation growing on this planet Earth? Could it grow a species of diamond beings, fully awakened and fully empowered, a species that can create out of the sheer power of the divine consciousness flowing in their awareness, without having gone through the ordeals we have in our long evolutionary agenda? This is challenging. On the one hand, I want to affirm the compassion behind the question. I also want to invite a deep sitting with the scale of creation. We have to look at the galaxies and the stars to appreciate the scale the universe thinks on, the scale that creative intelligence thinks on. Look at all the stages of evolution that humanity and all life on this planet have gone through. Suffering seems to be part of it—part of the grit of life that brings us forward.</p>
<p>Now, I think we may be coming into a time when we won’t have to grow through suffering as much as we have in the past. Suffering has been part of the paradigm of how we have grown, and it may be that we’ll be able to grow out of grace more in the future—that we may be challenged by creativity, not simply by our pain. But certainly suffering has been part of the stuff that has brought us where we are. Where we’re going, suffering takes things away from us. It breaks us down. It doesn’t allow us to continue the way we are. It forces us to reassess and look anew. I think we’re coming into a time where, for something radically new to come into the human story, we have to let go of what we have been. Letting go is hard work and does involve suffering, but the sooner we cooperate with this process—surrender to it, let go, and take care of each other with deep compassion rooted in cosmic love—the sooner the suffering ends and the creativity begins. It’s not a completely adequate answer to the depth of the question, but it’s a piece.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Thank you so much for that. I’ll add a layer. In the book I wrote—the Gene Keys book—I laid out, as I see it, the codes of consciousness available to humanity. You see this through shadow patterns we all play out—suffering—and hidden inside those are potential gifts. Inside those gifts—the creative flowering, the healing that grows through suffering—there’s a fruit I call the cities, the 64 cities. This is probably where we want to bring our talk to a close: the notion that something is hidden deep in the core of suffering, something beyond what we can understand now, something so beautiful. It’s another realm, another dimension, another field of learning. We might call it grace or bliss. We may be entering the epoch in which incarnation itself starts to fall apart and open up, so we no longer need to move in and out of these forms in the way we did. We may one day look back and say, “We used to have to differentiate in that way because of the shadow and its impetus inside us. But now we’ve explored that fully; we can sit in these cities.” These cities are higher states of consciousness, avataric fields of oneness. We can retain our soul’s wisdom and individuality—its journeys and continued adventures—but from within a much greater field of understanding and compassion. These Cities are the Buddhic fields opening up for us in the future.</p>
<p>Chris and I set this talk for Good Friday for good reason—it fell there beautifully—because of this notion of the constant rebirthing of the universe from within itself. If you take the image of the butterfly—the myth, the allegory, the metaphor—do you need any more proof for reincarnation than that? That is the emblem of what is hidden inside our suffering, inside this whole journey.</p>
<p>So yes, we’re moving into this next phase. It’s good to be realistic, and also to expand and open into it—to let your heart ring out with the boundless potentials inside you, of your soul. What happens if you really work those shadows through and the full soul can come in? The body would hardly be able to contain it, because of the incredible frequency of the quantum field generated from that—what we call those cities. Then we start to be co-creators with the Creator. Our thoughts become empowering, and we become children of God, or children of Christ, playing in a much vaster field: the galactic, the universal level. We become a universal consciousness and can interact with dimensions and paradigms we can’t yet fathom. I think there’s cause for great hope—more than hope, certainty really—but we have a few boulders to clear first. I invite you to have the last word.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I’m glad you brought in Easter, because it is Good Friday, a special weekend in the Christian calendar, and I know you and I have both been touched by Christianity—by its teaching and by people steeped in Christian teaching. We have been Christians and Hindus in different lifetimes, and we have been Muslims and aborigines. We have been all the religions of the world and the non-religions and atheists—we have sampled and drunk from those wells. We have been male and female. In that constant collecting and gathering of experience, bringing it to higher levels of fruition, when we encounter figures like Jesus, or Siddhartha Gautama the Buddha, or Muhammad the Prophet, they’re always pictured filled with light—halos around them, light emanating from their body. They have so much energy that they can heal with a touch.</p>
<p>Easter, of course, is death and rebirth—the indestructibility of life—death and rebirth continually cycling, and the symbol of compassion: a being who did not have to suffer but chose to suffer out of great love for the world. Every mother or father worth their salt understands that and would suffer for their children. Those precious qualities are the qualities we’re developing and empowering. As Richard said, the power and energy of the soul is huge, and to internalize the soul we must make our body capable of functioning at that level—the way Christ, the Buddha, and the Prophet were able to function.</p>
<p>I think that’s what we’re coming to in history: a time when we, who have been struggling in the shadows for so many generations, are beginning to enter a time of light, culmination, greater freedom, compassion, and wisdom. Where that will take us will be a great adventure—an adventure for us all. I really appreciate this conversation, Richard. I really appreciate everyone who’s gathered around us and made this adventure possible. Thank you very much, everybody.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Thank you from me also—to my soul, to all of you who’ve joined us and who are joining us in other timelines and dimensions. And thank you so much, Chris. We are going to continue our journey together, and we’ll have more for you in the future. Let’s see what that turns into.</p>

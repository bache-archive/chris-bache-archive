<p>Richard Rudd: 
Welcome, everyone, to a series of talks I’m doing here with my friend Chris Bache. We’re going to be discussing a subject we’re both really interested in and fascinated by: rebirth and everything that goes along with it. You might also call it reincarnation, because that’s part of the story. This began because I read a wonderful book by Chris, LSD and the Mind of the Universe, and it triggered a real recognition in me. Since I’m a teacher of spiritual matters and the founder of a system called the Gene Keys, that resonance prompted me to reach out via email to this amazing man. You never know whether you’ll hear back in those instances, but Chris very kindly did, and we started a series of dialogues. We realized we really enjoyed having conversations together, so that’s why we’re here. We’ll explore this subject in several sessions. Today we’ll begin with some introductory concepts and basics and see where it leads. I hope you enjoy it—I’m very much looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
So we’re anticipating three discussions.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Absolutely. Chris, if you want to say a few things about yourself, just so people know who you are.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It’s a pleasure to be here. I’ve enjoyed our conversations prior to this, and this present dialog grew out of those earlier exchanges. I am a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies—on the religious studies side of the shop—retired from Youngstown State University. In the course of my teaching, I’ve taught world religions, Eastern religions, transpersonal psychology of religion, comparative mysticism, Buddhism. So I’ve been teaching in areas touching on reincarnation for many years. I’ve written several books. My first was on reincarnation, starting with the scientific evidence for reincarnation, which we’ll be touching on today, and it’s been seminal in my thinking. I believe reincarnation is one of those concepts that’s like plate tectonics: at first it’s hard to see because it’s not obvious, but once you see it, it changes everything. It opens up the horizon of existence. So we thought this would be a good topic to have a shared conversation about, and I’m really pleased to be here.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Thanks, Chris. We’ll put the link in afterwards, but there are some great talks you’ve done—particularly one I watched fairly recently about whether there’s evidence for reincarnation. It’s so illuminating and extraordinary, and kind of overlooked by so many people. Tell us your story in assembling and amassing some of that evidence, or meeting the people who have.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I came from a traditional religious background, but over many years of graduate education, I finished my doctoral work in philosophy of religion as an atheistically inclined agnostic. I had basically studied my way out of religion altogether. I started my academic career as a young man in 1978, and in my first year I met the work of two people who changed the course of my life. The first was Ian Stevenson, the Carlson Professor at the University of Virginia, whose lifelong work has been to provide carefully documented cases of young children—small children—who have spontaneous memories of a previous life. He researched these children from all over the world, collected thousands of cases, published hundreds, and he convinced me that reincarnation was a simple fact of life.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Well, that’s quite a book, isn’t it? That’s a big book he’s written.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
He’s written close to a dozen now, but his first was called 20 Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation. For me, it was a life pivot, because reincarnation was never discussed in my graduate education. It was never discussed in the Western religions or in the scientific tradition that had wiped the slate clean of the religious traditions. So I erased my blackboard and began to rethink the larger questions of life, incorporating reincarnation. The second person I met was Stanislav Grof, the foremost authority on integrating psychedelics into psychotherapy. He provided a methodology that allows one to explore the deeper dimensions of one’s own consciousness. That began a second journey, which culminated eventually in the publication of the book Richard mentioned, LSD in the Mind of the Universe. But today, the focus is Ian Stevenson and the revolution he started in providing carefully documented evidence that reincarnation is simply a fact of life. It’s not a religious thing—it’s a natural phenomenon happening in the world.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
And in your talk—you as a wonderful academic—you argue both sides. You show how different people have come in and even written books to refute those things, but how they’ve fallen short. There’s this growing body of evidence that in the last 50 years has been documented. It’s fairly recent, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It is recent. Fifty years ago we didn’t have this evidence. Reincarnation was a speculative topic theologians argued back and forth about. But now it’s moved from the theologians’ table to the psychologists’ table. As we explore more deeply the deeper levels of consciousness in the depth psychology tradition, we keep bumping into this evidence. Now, the Western philosophical tradition is still saturated with the metaphysical position of naturalism, which says the only thing that is real is the physical. Therefore the brain produces your mind; once your brain dies, your mind ceases to exist. In that system, reincarnation is impossible because it implies a dimension of reality behind the physical world—consciousness existing for any interval between the death of one personality and the birth of a second. Naturally there’s been pushback from Western philosophy; mostly they’ve ignored the evidence. Even those who engage it—the foremost critic I mentioned, Paul Edwards, a substantial American philosopher—when you analyze the debate between Ian Stevenson and Paul Edwards, you see he refuses to look seriously at the evidence because he’s convinced beforehand it must be faulty. We “know” reincarnation can’t happen.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Of course, and that’s often the way with academics sometimes, isn’t it? So that’s really interesting in itself—the evidence. I don’t think we need to go more into that now, but what are the implications? This year I’ve done a series of short videos exploring the implications of “What if I say yes to this concept and really open my mind and heart to it?” The implications for our worldview and the way we move through life are huge, aren’t they?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yeah. It all hinges on time—how much time we have. If you have a sense of—well, let me back up. I’m a professor. If I give a quiz in class, I expect a certain quality of answers. If I give an exam that takes an hour, I expect a higher quality. If it’s a take-home research paper, higher still—because they have more time. Philosophically, if we believe we only live on earth once, and we have from a few minutes to maybe 100 years, we extrapolate that if there is a purpose to existence, it must be proportionate to the time we have. But if we have 100 lifetimes, 1000 lifetimes, in which to actualize the purpose of the universe, then our assessment of that purpose expands exponentially. That’s why this is such an important philosophical discussion. Once you grasp the fundamental principle of reincarnation, it lifts the constriction of time and allows us to appreciate the larger patterns of cause and effect arching over centuries. It elevates the whole discussion.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Absolutely. And if I can be blunt, if you have an inherent sense of a divinity behind creation, then it seems logical to extend that into a concept of generosity. If you had a divinity and only one life, it seems stingy. It doesn’t seem to have pattern or reason. For me, spirit is filled with generosity in terms of time. If we open to the eternal nature of life, then of course it makes sense for there to be a continuity of consciousness. The more people open to this, the more they realize it has some deep root inside them. I’ve discovered that as I’ve begun to talk about it more. One thing I’ve realized is that, other than people doing past life regression therapeutically, a lot of spiritual teachers today avoid this subject. I don’t know if they consciously avoid it, but they don’t talk about it. They get asked questions, but their answers are generally quite short, and it doesn’t get picked up. I’m really interested in something that is passed over, that should be in plain view for all of us.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Isn’t that curious? I understand why my university colleagues, who tend to be materialist and reductionist, avoid it. But why spiritual teachers wouldn’t use it to frame a larger horizon, I’m not sure. Sometimes I’ve heard people say it can dilute your intensity of commitment for realization in the present—if you think you have many lifetimes, you won’t take this one as seriously. I think that argument evaporates quickly once you look at it. It deepens the textures of the situations we find ourselves in. One example: some of Michael Newton’s research, for example in his books Journeys of the Soul and Destiny of Souls. He and other past life therapists have found evidence that we choose our incarnation. Many people may go haphazardly and take what’s available, but as you mature, you choose carefully. If we choose our incarnation carefully at a time when we knew more than we know now and could see more than we see now, and we chose the life we’re living—with its ups, downs, challenges, and opportunities—doesn’t that change how we relate to those circumstances? Not to chase hidden meanings everywhere, but to temper our self-responsibility in how we engage the people we’re with and the circumstances we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Yeah, and for me it makes me feel more like an eternal, cosmic adventurer. It enriches the time I’m in now. In many ways, it focuses me more into the present, because I’m not worrying about dying. It’s not just a concept—you have to contemplate something like this deeply for it to take root. As it takes root, it brings something out of you. I feel the truth of it is in our DNA. Once that awakening of memory is triggered, a certainty and stability grow inside that enable us to handle challenges in a more powerful way, because we’re rooted in an eternal acceptance of this. You hear it all the time on the radio—someone saying, “You’ve only got one life, so make the most of it,” which is a great thing to say. But “you’ve only got one life”—that’s a really tight reality, whatever belief system you’re operating out of.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It cuts the legs right out from under you, because correlated with that is the idea that your existence is driven by blind chance—random mutation. There’s no existential significance to your circumstances. You only get one shot; make the best of it; then when you die, it’s gone anyway, so who cares? That’s a demeaning and counterintuitive philosophy of life. When we look at the beauties of nature, the night sky, the Hubble images of magnificent patterns in the deep cosmos, the emergence of life and self-awareness on the planet—all these projects take enormous sweeps of time. We are the first generation to really appreciate how much time the universe has had to evolve into its present form. If everything the universe is doing takes enormous time and we only have one life, existentially we’re cut off; we don’t participate in that massive project. But if we live multiple lifetimes, there’s a good news/bad news situation. The bad news is it’s hard work in this lifetime, and we’d like to have it over with when we die, but if we keep coming back, there’s a larger project afoot. It’s not a simple grade; it’s a whole university education. The good news is the fear of death drops away. It allows us to feel into the deeper currents of life and think in terms of longer-term projects. You see this when people take to heart the idea—even without specific knowledge of former lives. That can be helpful, but even without it, when you let it in and realize every person you’re seeing has been here before and will be here again, you can engage life with more meaning and intensity. What we’re good at are things we’ve practiced in the past; what we’re just getting started on are things we’ll get better at in the future. With that much time, we can think in terms of a larger landscape.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
And of course there are many great thinkers, philosophers, and sages who have come to the same conclusion about rebirth. Notably in the West, Jung springs straight into center frame because he’s more contemporary and a pillar of modern psychology in how we understand the unconscious, the collective unconscious, mythology, and transformation.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
He tended to hide his belief in reincarnation. He came to it late in life and hid it because he had pushed the boundaries so much he was concerned about the backlash. But it’s there in his work.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
That’s what happens with a lot of people. They think, “I’m not sure I want to go into that area,” because it’s got a stigma. The moment you say the word reincarnation, a whole battery of skeptics comes at you—whether from Christianity or materialist science. You’re really putting your head above the parapet.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
For decades I took students into the literature on reincarnation. Once you put the preconceptions aside and just look at the cases—look at the evidence—I found 95% of my students overcame all kinds of secular and religious resistances, because in our culture they’re trained to follow the evidence. Once they saw how consistent it was and how it appeared in so many contexts—spontaneous memories, evoked memories—they accepted it. And once they accepted it, it was life-changing for many of them.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Any favorite stories you remember of those recurrences?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I have so many. The one I opened Life Cycles with is the case of a young girl named Romy Creese. Romy was born to Catholic parents in Iowa. It’s okay if they want to reincarnate in India—that’s their business—but everybody knows Catholics do not reincarnate. She had spontaneous memories of having been a man, Joe Williams, in a previous life. She remembered being married, having three children and their names, and dying in a motorcycle accident. She had a phobia of motorcycles. Long story short, the researchers got to her and brought her to the town where she remembered living as Joe Williams. She identified Joe’s mother. She insisted they pick up blue flowers on the way to the house because “those are the flowers she likes,” and that turned out to be true. She identified, from pictures, the people in Joe’s life. She developed a deep emotional bond with Joe’s mother, who was alive, and his wife, Sheila. Joe had been married to Sheila; they did have three children; and Joe and Sheila were killed in a motorcycle accident. It goes on and on.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Hundreds of these. There are so many. These little details—the little details are what get you. I remember one in a Muslim family: they took a little girl into the family, and the women were veiled, completely veiled. She identified them by body language alone—without seeing their faces—and named them. That was like, wow. That’s how deep the detail goes. It’s fun to explore those things. I recommend people take a look at the evidence. It’s very affirming. It’s difficult to refute that level of detail.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Here’s one for the cynics—one of Ian Stevenson’s cases. They brought a boy back into the life circumstances of the previous personality, and the wife of that man said, “Okay, if you’re my husband, where did you put the will? After you died, we looked all over for it.” The little boy walks over to a floorboard in the kitchen, picks up a board, reaches underneath, and pulls up the will. How many of those cases do you read before you begin to understand this is just happening? It’s part of the rhythm of life.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Totally. It is extraordinary. And there’s a whole load of documentation about marks on the body—marks that relate to previous events. We don’t need to go down that route, but it’s another whole area of documentation.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
That was Ian Stevenson’s last work. If you do want to go down that area, you can read his two-volume, 1000-page book on reincarnation and biology. He studies 187 cases with medical documentation—really rigorous. What we find is that death wounds—wounds associated with the death of the previous personality—show up as birthmarks or scars in the subsequent personality. This suggests not only does our mind influence subsequent mind, but our mind’s experience in the body can influence the formation of tissue in our subsequent body. That deepens the story.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Absolutely. And that leads into therapeutic work, doesn’t it? If you open to this idea—thinking of people with difficulties in health or relationships or addictions, or complexes hard to overcome—if we understand those things may have a root in a previous lifetime, something unfinished or incomplete, it can open a whole therapeutic journey. A therapeutic community has evolved out of this.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
The past life therapy community. Many therapists say: if you put someone into a relaxed, inward-focused state—a hypnotic state, though people misunderstand that, it just means relaxed and inward—and invite them to go to the source of the problem they’ve come to address, about 35–40% will go back to something in their present life—childhood or infancy. But a significant 50–60% will go back to something rooted in a previous lifetime. When they consciously remember that previous lifetime and reappropriate the trauma they weren’t able to fully internalize and address then—particularly circumstances surrounding their death—when they consciously assimilate it into present consciousness, consistently, underlying psychological problems and even physical problems begin to loosen their grip and untie the knots.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
Because they have roots deep in the collective unconscious, and we’re going into the collective unconscious to find them and pull them out.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Let’s be a little careful here. “Collective unconscious” in a Jungian usage refers to the unconscious of the entire species. So let’s maybe call it soul consciousness—the collective unconscious of the individual, you all through time.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
I’ve got a good question for you. I have a dear friend, a startling intellect in his late 70s—very intelligent, very spiritual—and yet he has difficulty with reincarnation. We’ve had wonderful discussions. His sophisticated spiritual intellect goes to this: you want to believe it—everyone wants to believe in the continuity of our existence. And yet the great Advaita teachers talk about the surrender of the individual ego into the ocean of being. That’s something you undergo to attain liberation. There’s a strong spiritual “up and out” cosmology: we are here to escape this samsaric cycle to attain liberation—maybe within this lifetime, maybe afterward. That’s another whole interesting area, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes. Simply because cultures have believed in reincarnation for thousands of years and developed a certain understanding doesn’t mean they’ve got it right. Once we begin to see the evidence, it deepens the inquiry. Personally, I’ve dramatically revised the understanding I borrowed from Eastern traditions. One question is: where does reincarnation go? What’s the end game? You’re right—religions of the Axial Age teach an “up and out” cosmology. We’re trapped here; this isn’t as good as spiritual reality. We want to develop—either in one lifetime, if it’s Christian salvation by grace, or multiple lifetimes to achieve moksha, escape from samsara. We achieve an enlightenment condition which is the passport to leave and not come back. Those traditions are about escape. That leaves unanswered the fundamental question: what is the purpose of physical existence in the first place? Now that we understand how many billions of years of genius have gone into the manifestation of the physical world, it’s not satisfactory to think that, as soon as we become self-aware of the deeper dimensions, the purpose of existence is to escape the entire physical world. I don’t think that’s really—</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: 
—true, and it’s rooted in that kind of slightly self-denial philosophy, isn’t it? That also is many thousands of years…</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I think basically all the axial religions got two things fundamentally wrong. They got nature wrong—they don’t really have an adequate theology or understanding of nature—and they got women wrong. The two are connected, because women are so closely connected to nature, and those traditions were patriarchally and escapist oriented. As a historian, I understand it. Four or five thousand years ago, through various psychotechnologies—yoga, meditation, or psychedelic substances—we began to have deeper experiences of the Mother Universe, the universe that surrounds the physical universe. Once you have experiential contact with that universe, it is so blissful, so ecstatic, and you recognize that’s where we’re from. You can’t help believing that’s where we belong. This is not where we belong; that is where we belong. So a theology of return developed: the savior comes to take us home, the enlightened being liberates us back into our home. But that still leaves the question: what is the purpose of creation?</p>
<p>What we’re beginning to understand now, as our experience of this Mother Universe has deepened over time—and our understanding of the physical universe as well—is that we’re not here to achieve escape velocity and leave. We’re here to incarnate more and more of spiritual reality and capacity inside our physical being, so that we can truly live and create heaven on earth. To wake up and stay—not just to wake up as individuals, but to wake up as an entire species and stay.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: We’re going to discuss that more, and come back to it, because it’s a huge window to open. You’ve touched on a lot of themes, particularly the feminine and the physical body. I interpret what you’re saying as those religions not really understanding or valuing the physical body or nature, even though there is vast beauty in physicality. Perhaps it’s here to be spiritualized. Perhaps that’s why we’re here—to bring that ecstatic realization deeper and deeper into form. If we see that as our highest purpose, we no longer want to leave, because our role, through subsequent incarnations, is to bring more and more of that light down into the earth. Then we’re also taking full responsibility for the body and the earth, which is something we haven’t done very well.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: And if that sounds at first disappointing—“Oh no, I want heaven; I don’t want a transformed body here, because here is still too difficult”—we may be underestimating what is possible and what it would really feel like to live a truly, fully spiritualized, enlightened existence. We can look at some of the god-soaked masters of history who were truly living in a primordial condition radically open to the vast mind of the universe, inside their body, inside time and space. What we see from these mahasiddhas, these great beings, is that they can do what we would call miracles, because there is so much spiritual power concentrated in their presence that it’s as if the laws of nature operate differently around them. They’re showing us a prototype of what each of us is in the process of becoming. If we imagine what it would be like to have an entire species living in that kind of presence—</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: Our physics is also pushing us in that direction—toward understandings that we’re entangled with nature and the universe. My whole teaching is based on the notion that in our DNA are contained these sleeping, dormant codes, these cities, as I call them—64 cities. They’re an activation inside us waiting for its moment so we can enter more fully into the next phase of our evolution: the magical universe, the quantum universe, where our thoughts and feelings and sensations are actually traveling outside our physical body, entangled with nature. Nature then responds to us—perhaps it already does, at a level we’re not aware of. It’s just about opening up those pathways—literal pathways in our being—into that next phase of our evolution.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: We are already plugged into nature at very deep levels—down to the quantum level, in the unified field. We’re plugged into our ecosystems in subtle, intimate feedbacks, and we’re plugged into each other. Our minds wash back and forth. We’re already there. When we become conscious of those connections—when we lift off the obstructive shadows that are carryovers from sadder times—that connection rises. It empowers a conscious participation. What was unconscious becomes conscious, and existence becomes more enlivened, with synchronicities indicating the broader intelligence alive in life around us.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: I’d love to bring our conversation into people’s lives so they can consider their relationships from this perspective, and how it might change one’s attitudes toward difficult relationships or the afflictions that come up in everyday life. It really changes all of that, doesn’t it? Life becomes a process of the opening of the heart, which the teachers have always said. Every relationship’s purpose is to show us some grace—I call this the law of unseen grace—where every relationship that shows up is offering us something, particularly the difficult ones: an incredible teaching, a virtue we haven’t yet polished, whether it’s forgiveness, clarity—some form of love we’re here to learn from those relationships. They come as part of our teaching karma. The ancients called this life a Leela—a game, a drama, a theater. It’s almost like before you come in, you’re given an envelope: here’s your script, things that will show up, what you’re going to learn—you’ve chosen it at some level. That changes the way we behave. Have you had personal experience of that in your emotional life?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: One more step: it’s not simply the envelope given to you—you were given three envelopes, and you chose the one most suited for your evolution at this particular point in history. It’s your choice to engage these challenges. When we engage our life that way—taking full responsibility for the circumstances in which we find ourselves—it allows us to meet challenges with more patience, dedication, and a long-term view. If we don’t deal with something now, it isn’t going to go away; it will come back in another form. So let’s get it done now.</p>
<p>Our understanding of reincarnation has been informed by therapists working heroically in past-life therapy. But if you only pay attention to those cases, it can tilt our understanding toward failures and traumas. Just like the school system has many faults, most of the kids still learn and pass every year. Most people rise to the karma—the challenge—of their life. That means every lifetime we’re not simply dealing with leftovers from the past; we’re building on assets. We’re spending assets and investing in greater fruition in the future. That helps us handle challenging circumstances and also embrace the positive: the hidden talent that comes forward unannounced, the partnership that emerges where we feel such deep kinship we can go forward and do something new together.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: You triggered a memory of Sri Aurobindo, who spoke very clearly about the complexity of karma and how we so easily misunderstand it by trying to oversimplify. When you look at the universe with its multiple dimensions and the quantum field, there are force fields operating at different levels, including a karmic force tending toward balance, allowing us to go through an educational process. Everything at different levels is influenced by strands of the karmic force. It relates to what I call unseen grace: if you can fully embrace it in your life, then you get the grace through unwrapping it—but you’ve got to have the courage to face it fully, take it in, let it in, transform it, transmute it so it doesn’t repeat. Does transmutation of karma play a huge part in this reincarnative theology?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: If we just look around us, it’s a web of cause and effect. We live in a continuous web: the air we breathe, the weather patterns, our biology, what we ate, the purity of what we ate, the movement of the planets. Here we’re focusing on that portion of the web that influences the development of the soul—our human psychophysical development—which is a subset of this larger cause-and-effect fabric.</p>
<p>We’ve tended to narrow our discussion of karma to the portion that immediately impinges on our spiritual maturity—whether we’re becoming a more spiritually mature person. But a lot of karma, probably the bulk, is just moral cause and effect. You have a habit, you practice something, it becomes a skill; that skill carries over into another life. You have an automobile accident, you develop a trauma; that carries over into another life. It’s not necessarily about spiritual development; it’s circumstantial cause and effect. As you open to the conditioning etching itself in your life and you engage it—lift it out—the wellspring of your life becomes freer and clearer. You’re not stepping out of the web of cause and effect, but you’re stepping into a greater freedom within it. You have greater capacity to make increasingly free choices, to ask yourself, “What do I want?” instead of acting from compulsion—of grabbing.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: It’s tempting for some to say, “Karma and reincarnation—well, that person over there was born disabled, so they must have done something terrible in their last life.” That’s an oversimplification of a very complex arena. Unless you can plug right into the soul quality inside that person, you don’t really know. They could be a hidden saint who has deliberately taken on an incredibly challenging role to polish one particular virtue or skill over a lifetime. Equally, there are very short incarnations—a child who comes in for a very short time and then leaves. That has implications for the healing of the whole, doesn’t it? Why does a child come in for a short time, a baby is born and then leaves—there’s grief, but also a feeling that it’s still part of your life. Could you explore that?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: We can recognize the principle of cause and effect—karma, vipaka—but then we often think we can determine cause and effect, when really we’re just touching the wrapping on the package. The safest position is to recognize we’re looking at a deep mystery. It would be foolish to judge anybody’s karma; that’s wasted effort. Better to stick with what you can penetrate within your own life. You’re right: we don’t know what’s happening when we see cause and effect around us. I used to tell my students: when you see great suffering, you’re seeing either a sinner or a saint, and you can never know which—so best not to judge at all. There are many hidden saints, taking on a lot of cause and effect either from their own larger soul stream or even a collective soul stream, focusing in their body and psyche what we might call negative karma for the uplift of the whole. That kind of generosity and compassion is all around us. Good parents—mothers and fathers—would do anything for their children; souls at a deeper level do that too. We can’t judge.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: I read a book—Sand Talk—by an Aboriginal man from Australia, a really intelligent writer. He tells a story of going to an elder about the problems among indigenous men who had gone down the road of alcoholism, eating terrible food, obesity—serious issues he was concerned about. The elder said, “They’re the warriors. They are warrior spirits in our tribe, holding this negativity in their bodies. One day they will move from warrior to healer.” It really stuck with him. It’s a powerful, empowering way to see someone dealing with a cultural or societal difficulty that’s more collective. We’re touching on collective karma as well.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Those deep currents running underneath require us to open to a much deeper, expanded spiritual story. We often think of reincarnation and karma in a very individualistic, atomistic fashion—an individual soul evolving through the skillful use of choice in the context of karma. If we sink into a larger understanding, we recognize each individual is a fractal point within a unified field, with deep currents running within the unconscious or soul field of humanity. We are all players in a larger evolutionary dynamic. It opens a deeper understanding of what’s taking place here. We’ve tagged this for one of our topics for our second discussion.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: We plant the seed now. When you go into that kind of worldview, the perfection of the choreography you’re describing is mind-blowing—the interconnectivity of soul groups, fractals, patternings of humans. One of the great insights I got from your “unit mind of the universe” book was a paradox you describe: being an individual soul and yet being everything at the same time. How does that hold up? You described it beautifully—the soul as “open on all sides.” It’s part of the ocean and yet still a focalized drop of awareness.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It seems commonsensical that you can’t be both a part and the whole at the same time—mutually exclusive categories. Even great spiritual teachers—say, the Vedanta tradition—have said the goal of life is to abandon individuality, dissolve it, and be absorbed into the totality, to know the bliss of absorption. In that view, all the individual capacity we’ve developed over incarnations ends in extinction. I think that’s inadequate.</p>
<p>What has emerged in my spiritual and psychedelic path is a very different worldview that I think we share: we are moving into higher, more sophisticated forms of individuality. Individuality is one of the great gifts of creation, something the divine wants to encourage. At early stages, we experience our individuality as cut off from our surrounds—us against the whole. When individuality matures into a richer expression—the birth of the diamond soul—there is both a sense of being a specific, defined individuality emerging out of a specific historical lineage, and at the same time being profoundly open to the larger patterns of existence. Open to each other, with a compassionate heart. Open to the intelligence of the universe, to perceptions and ideas that flow into us in communion with the whole. I actually believe you have to develop a very strong individuality to withstand the intensity of communion available when we enter into unity with the one. If we weren’t diamond-hard, focused, and clear when we encountered the love of the universe for us, it would shatter us. We have to be strong to participate in the deeper levels of communion.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: That’s such an empowering vision. It opens the question of our notions of enlightenment and divinity—we have to keep expanding them. Even though what we’ve inherited has been useful, it’s just a notion. What’s missing in current modalities is creativity. The idea of coming to an end and dissolving into absorption—by maintaining individuality at the same time, what you maintain is creativity itself. You become a shard of the divine creative essence. As you say in your book: “Go out and create, my children.” If there were a divinity that wanted to have children, the thing it would want is for them to be free, to go out and create, to become gods within God. That’s the vision I hold: we become creator gods within the wider God—big G.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: God within God, yes—the creative spark within the fire of creation. I share that. It changes everything. It changes how we greet the children born into our families—we know they’re not coming from us, they’re coming to us. It changes how we see old people and little people. Young people are not necessarily young in soul age; old people are not necessarily old in soul age. It opens a much larger tapestry and gives us permission to recognize our deep aspirations—towards greatness, great creativity, great love, great spiritual fulfillment—things we may or may not complete in this lifetime, but we can move toward them.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: It’s a more sophisticated spirituality—more nuanced. It requires a subtler intelligence to understand. It’s not, “Here’s the law of karma; it governs everything—bang.” As Aurobindo says, there are layers and layers of understanding and subtlety. I’m a lover of fine tea; when you find something like that—or chess, or anything—you discover the subtlest nuances as you become more attuned. That’s what we are becoming: more attuned. The more evolved that individual soul essence becomes, the more subtle we can be, the more we can understand these nuances. We’re inspired and empowered by the creative current. People always talk about past lives, but I’m interested in future lives as well. When you expand your sense of time broadly enough, you don’t need to look only backward; you can also remember forwards. We think memory travels back, but memory also travels forward—that’s what we call revelation. Revelations can come backward and forward through time into this essence, hugely expanding it, and making us more focused than ever in the present. That’s the thought I’d like to end on. Do you want to close us off?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That’s a really good thought and a good spot to end on. The principle of accumulation is fundamental to understanding what’s happening in creation. The universe is accumulating—it’s learning. It’s a self-learning system. We are constantly learning; we can’t help but learn. Even if we do a mediocre job in a lifetime, we’re still learning. As we learn, we activate capacities. In one sense, I think we’re learning to be geniuses in every area of life: a genius at chess, a genius at relationships—genius in all the different areas. Each lifetime is a petal in a flower; the soul is the flower. I sometimes meditate on a flower and imagine each hundred-year lifetime as a pistil, a stamen, a petal in this magnificent flower. To be a genius at life—to be completely unfolded and take advantage of the opportunity we’ve been given to grow and become more than we’ve been.</p>
<p>Even though many cultures have understood reincarnation, I don’t think they’ve grasped it fully. They’ve seen it within a limited frame. On the future—we’ll talk about time more—but let me leave a thought from Robert Monroe, the out-of-body researcher and founder of the Monroe Institute. In Ultimate Journey he said he reached a point in his explorations where he realized you don’t necessarily have to incarnate in the next century. Incarnation isn’t necessarily historically linear; you could have former lives lived in future time. That really challenges things. In addition to intuiting the future—the not-yet—and bringing it into the now, I wonder whether some of us have sampled future time and are inculcating that awareness in the present.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: That’s what I would call a current—the current of involution, as opposed to evolution. There is a spiritual force coming down, and an evolving force going up. It’s like a funnel.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I love you quoting Sri Aurobindo—he’s one of my heroes too. He saw that clearly, and I agree.</p>
<p>Richard Rudd: Great. What a wonderful beginning, Chris. Thank you. Where we go next—me too. Take care.</p>

Steve Thayer, welcome back to Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers, the podcast devoted to exploring the frontiers of psychedelic medicine and what it takes to cultivate a healthy mind, body, and spirit. As always, Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers is brought to you by Numinous. I'm Dr. Steve Thayer, and today my co-host, Dr. Reid Robison, and I are joined by Dr. Christopher Bache, PhD. Chris is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngtown State University, adjunct faculty at the California Institute for Integral Studies, emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. He's the author of several books, but the one that prompted us to reach out to him for this interview is LSD and the Mind of the Universe—an account of what Chris experienced and learned from 73 high-dose LSD journeys that he embarked on over the course of 20 years.</p>
<p>In today's conversation, we explore Chris's LSD session protocol; the difference between using psychedelics for what he calls cosmological exploration versus spiritual enlightenment or even psychological healing; how Chris processed and integrated his very intense experiences; what he learned about reincarnation and evolution at the collective and individual levels; what humans need to do to survive the mounting existential threats we face; what he means by Diamond Luminosity and diamond soul; and of course, much more. Chris's book had a profound impact on me. His disciplined, scholarly approach to psychedelic exploration, combined with his ability to articulate and teach what for most of us would be an overwhelming or ineffable experience, has resulted in a must-read, in my opinion, for anyone who thinks deeply about questions like, Who are we? What are we doing here? And where might we go from here?</p>

<p>Chris Bache 
It's a pleasure to be here with you today.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
Why don't we start, Chris, by having you introduce yourself to our audience. Share as much or as little as you'd like, just to give us some context.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Well, I'm a retired professor of religious studies. I've made my living teaching in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies in Youngstown State University, which is a state university in Northeast Ohio. What brings me to this program, I guess, is the book I published three years ago called LSD and the Mind of the Universe, which is a strange book for a professor of religious studies to have written.</p>
<p>Right at the beginning of my academic career, 1978, I had just finished my graduate work at Brown in philosophy of religion, and I met the work of Stan Grof. I immediately recognized that his research in LSD—psychedelics in general—was extraordinarily important, not just for clinical psychology and therapy, but for philosophy, which was what interested me the most. And so I began, even though it was illegal, a quiet, private psychedelic practice, which ended up continuing for 20 years. I worked for four years, stopped for six years for reasons I describe in the book, and then I worked for another 10 years, and then I spent another 10 years digesting the work. This was from ’79 to ’99, when I was 30 to 50, and then I spent the next 20 years trying to absorb those experiences and clarify their cosmological implications. Then I published LSD and the Mind of the Universe. That's a brief sketch of what brings me here.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
As I was reading your book, I kept thinking, what a heroic undertaking. I mean heroic in the sense of a hero’s journey. The things you describe in the book—the experiences you had—are not for the faint of heart. I've heard you say that you don't necessarily recommend the protocol you followed to others. Why is that?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
First, let me describe the protocol. Everything I did was within a strict therapeutic framework. I followed Stan’s protocols from his book LSD Psychotherapy—lying down, eye shades, earphones, listening to very carefully choreographed music to guide the session. It was always private, always protected, always with a sitter—my wife at the time, who was a clinical psychologist—so established in what I call the psychedelic kiva.</p>
<p>For reasons we can go into, I chose to work with very high doses of LSD. After about three sessions at 250 micrograms, I moved to 500–600 micrograms, which is the upper limit—the body saturation point. Naively, I thought this work was about personal transformation, even personal spiritual awakening. The spiritual literature described one’s karma as ultimately finite, even if it involved causation patterns from multiple incarnations. I imagined this was a process of clearing the conditioning of my psyche—engaging and purifying karma—and that if I worked with large doses, I could go through it faster if I could manage the intensity, essentially taking bigger bites of karma each session.</p>
<p>I found out those assumptions were wrong. At this high-dose level, the work was not about personal transformation. With gentler psychedelics or lower doses, activation, purification, and healing might be constrained to personal levels. But with a very powerful psychedelic like this much LSD, you amplify consciousness so deeply that what may begin as a personal process becomes engagement with the collective— the collective unconscious, the species mind. From there you’re off to the races into deeper and deeper levels of consciousness—cycles of death and rebirth. Ego death is just the first of many deaths you face. As you go through one level after another systematically, you encounter forms of death more foreign than ego death.</p>
<p>That’s why I don’t recommend the protocol. It’s extremely demanding. It basically becomes the central focus of your life—to engage these deep states, navigate them, absorb them, integrate them into your life, your social world, and your body. I also assumed there was an endpoint to this journey—enlightenment, union with God, the primal void. I had all of those experiences and discovered many levels of divinity and many levels of the pure, fertile void. About 15 years into my experience, I reached what I call the Diamond Luminosity domain—about as deep into the universe as I would ever go. I saw reality far, far into the distance. A beam of light hit me from that reality and shattered me. In a high, subtle state of consciousness, I realized: it’s an infinite journey. You’ll never get to the end of the universe. The depth of divinity is just too great.</p>
<p>If I were to start over, I’d be much gentler. I’d balance low and high doses, organic and synthetic psychedelics, because I now understand the real goal is to open yourself to let in as much of the love, intelligence, and wisdom of the universe as you can—then digest it, hold it, draw it into your life, and let it guide you. It’s not about reaching a final destination.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
That’s beautiful, Chris, thank you for sharing. What do you think the risks are of going straight to those deeper states—higher doses—and perhaps bypassing some of the healing work or lower-dose work? How might you use different dose ranges as tools?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Any work with psychedelics—especially higher doses in a therapeutic protocol—can be challenging, and calls for good psychological screening to make sure your psyche is ready for these depths. Some people should never go near psychedelics. Some should work only very gently, if at all. I happen to have a constitution that can flow into expansive states readily and recongeal smoothly at the end. Not everybody is wired like that. All the clinical cautions apply.</p>
<p>Can you bypass? You can chase a level of experience and bypass others, but that didn’t happen to me. I spent the first 10 sessions—two and a half years—in very grueling work at what Stan calls the perinatal level, the interface between the personal unconscious and the collective or transpersonal. You’re reliving your birth, dealing with existential crises—really grinding things deeply at that level.</p>
<p>There were personal healings along the way. Often they took place at the beginning and ending of sessions—when I was leaving space-time and when I was coming back. In the peaks, especially after the first two or three years, I was working in states far beyond personal consciousness and even beyond space-time. Late in the work, some very quick healings of pieces of my life occurred. If I had been working with lower doses, those healings might have happened earlier. But I don’t think I was jumping over or avoiding problems, because what you confront in the deep psyche is much more severe than anything at the personal level.</p>
<p>I came into this without personal trauma—I had a pretty easy start in life, good parents, a good home. The deeper wound, really, is the wound every human carries entering time and space: stabilizing here, understanding why we are here, discovering our reason for being, and entering into communion with the intelligence that saturates existence.</p>
<p>What I found—and I say this carefully, because to someone unfamiliar with my work it may sound grandiose—is that my personal wounds were not fully healed until late, because they anchored me in the larger fields of consciousness in a way that allowed me to be used in some of the healing of the collective psyche that took place in my work. My personal wound anchored one side of a bridge; the other side was the collective psyche. With that bridge, when I went deep, my sessions became a conduit to pull some of the pain of the collective psyche out and transform it. If my personal wounds had been healed early, that ability would have been compromised. Along the way I learned that this specific function—engaging the collective psyche to bring a measure of healing—was part of my soul’s work, something I signed up for in this incarnation. And I think many people are doing this kind of work. There’s nothing especially unique about my choice.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
I’m also curious about the disposition you mentioned, because it comes up in people we work with. How much of the ability to expand and hold those states is nature versus nurture? How much can you cultivate without shattering into overwhelm?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
We can definitely learn to enter these states more skillfully. Some people have a natural aptitude, but whatever the starting point, careful practice matters. If you enter carefully, process carefully, and debrief carefully, you learn how to enter better in future sessions. Integration and careful debrief—recording your session, sitting with the content—are crucial. They establish the baseline for your next entry. It’s cyclical, and integrating your work is key to the next step.</p>
<p>Because my work was driven by highly amplified states, I kept as many variables stable as possible: same set and setting, same substance, same dose, same sitter, same recording process, even the same part of the country. Any variable can change the texture. That’s not bad, but by standardizing, I think it created a container that allowed my conversation—my communion—with the universe to progressively deepen. Stabilizing the zone of contact allowed deeper contact over time.</p>
<p>The kind of contact we have partly depends on the headroom of the psychedelic. Different medicines—psilocybin, ibogaine, MDMA, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD—have different qualities and ranges. One reason I kept breaking through one level after another over 20 years had to do with holding the posture and setting, but also the sheer power and headroom of LSD. If I had worked with psilocybin, I’m sure there would have been significant overlap, but likely with less cosmological headroom.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
How did your wife feel about the trip-sitting duty? Kudos to her for that dedication. Was it hard to convince her, or was she with you in the purpose of the philosophical adventure?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Carol did this out of love for me. She was never particularly drawn to psychedelics—too much, too fast in her opinion. She’s a deeply spiritual person. After 24 years of marriage we separated, and we’re friends; we stay in contact, especially around our children. She went on to complete her three-year, three-month retreat in the Vajrayana tradition. She’s a serious practitioner with a lifelong spiritual orientation. It was tremendously valuable to have her spiritual wisdom grounding me while I entered this work. But it was never her work. She did it because she knew I wanted to, and we always supported each other in our spiritual paths.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
That's really neat. Thanks for sharing all this.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
I’m really captivated by the very scientific, careful, and disciplined approach you took. The way I imagine it: by controlling variables, you were able to return to the same drill site and auger down—getting a very deep core sample of the cosmos as it manifested in you and you in it. As opposed to what some psychonauts or people seeking therapeutic or spiritual exploration do when they pockmark the surface—varying set and setting or experimenting widely.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I think that’s true. There’s no single right or wrong way to use psychedelics—there are many good ways. I just happen to represent one strategy. Trained as a philosopher of religion, I have a natural orientation toward precision and analysis. Particularly since I didn’t fully know what I was getting into, I wanted to leave breadcrumbs in case I needed to work my way back out again. It turns out that wasn’t necessary.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
As a trained philosopher of religion, I think I read—if not in the book, perhaps in the postscript you wrote for Paradigm Explorer—that when you started this work, you might have described yourself as an atheistically leaning agnostic. How did your belief in or relationship to the divine change, if at all, as a result of your experience with this substance and protocol?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Through all my graduate studies, I basically studied my way out of religion entirely—out of theism and any belief in divinity as I had learned it through world religions and the history of theology and philosophy. I began this work not just as an agnostic but an atheistically inclined agnostic. It was like, okay, put up or shut up. Because at that point, it didn’t look good. Science had wiped out anything that smacked of traditional religion. The God of the Axial Age religions is just too small for the universe science shows us—the massive scale, scope, and intelligence of it. It erased the blackboard, and we’re still catching up.</p>
<p>So I brought a mind not adverse to religion, but adverse to theology. When you begin to have experiences of the reality the religions have been pointing toward, that changes everything. You go through cycles of death and rebirth—surrendering your reality as you’ve known it inside time and space—dying to that reality and being reborn into another level, another dimension of existence. You do that again and again, systematically. The reality of a reality beyond space and time becomes overwhelmingly clear. Your ability to understand, absorb, and taste it becomes second nature.</p>
<p>In all the years I did this work and all the levels of consciousness I entered, I never encountered anything that might be recognized as a deity or even a personal spiritual guide, which is common in many shamanic traditions. But I always felt I was engaging an intelligence essentially guiding my experiences—feeding them to me in an interactive manner. The boundaries of this consciousness kept deepening as my practice deepened. In that context, I could speak about God, but I don’t like to, because “God” carries Western connotations I’m not comfortable with. I could speak about the divine, but that can feel like smuggling. I tend to speak about the creative intelligence of the universe. The universe has a mind, and in fact arises out of a mind—a consciousness—and is sustained and nurtured by a more fundamental reality. Call it spiritual; call it dark energy or dark matter. We now know 96% of the universe is invisible—dark energy and dark matter—so it’s not that radical to suggest a reality behind physical reality.</p>
<p>Our historical concepts of God have been profoundly incomplete. We’re entering a period where we’ll be rewriting that story. Psychedelics have an important role because they let ordinary mortals have first-hand contact with this vast expanse of spiritual reality—experiences that earlier generations might have described as experiences of God.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
So, who are we in this story? Are we— as others have stated—unique organizations of molecules through which the universe experiences itself, each of us a fractal that lets the universe enjoy experiencing itself in ways it otherwise couldn’t? What do you think we are?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
That question has many levels. We are clearly part of the creative experiment the universe is. We’re an aspect of it, not separate from it. Our bodies arise from this evolutionary masterpiece, and our minds derive from the universe too. We’re taught the universe is a machine, evolving through random mutation and screening by necessity. That story hasn’t been all bad, but it’s profoundly incomplete.</p>
<p>When you sink into the depths of your mind, you eventually drop out of your individual mind into deeper layers—species mind, even solar system or galactic mind. As you drop down, you’re dissolved into an intelligence that is stunningly vast, with a depth of love and compassion behind it. This intelligence is manifesting the universe we experience—it manifests itself as the universe. We are fortunate to be cells within this body of divine self-manifestation, fractally embedded in it, so that our story is part of its story and its story part of ours.</p>
<p>At a deeper level, add reincarnation. That’s assumed in my worldview not from faith but from empirical evidence we’ve amassed. My first book was on reincarnation. I think it’s part of how nature functions. Nature has found a way to fold learning forward—not only at the species level in a broad evolutionary sense, but at the individual level. Reincarnation is a higher octave of evolution. Once we understand we are participants in this evolving universe not for 100 years but for 100,000 years, the plot thickens. The universe is intensely involved in manifesting galaxies, solar systems, planets, life, self-aware life, and then evolving, reincarnating life. That puts us on a profound co-footing with creation. Our evolution and its evolution are part of the same fabric—human evolution and individual evolution are two aspects of the same process.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
If you’ll permit me to keep pulling on this thread: when we’re preoccupied with the mundane—paying taxes, going to work—and we think of ourselves as a fractal piece of this practically infinite intelligence, the substrate of which sounds like love, it makes me wonder: have we always existed in some way as individualized intelligence related to this grander one? With reincarnation, is there continuity to “Steve Thayer” that goes back hundreds of thousands of years that I just don’t remember? Or are we deconstructed to our constituent parts and reassembled with new parts each time, with only pieces moving forward? What do you think?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
We don't know the answers to all those questions. We don't really know how reincarnation works—what its physics are. Even if we have evidence that reincarnation is a fact of nature, we don't know its nature, how it goes, how it works. It seems the universe is a learning system, and reincarnation is part of that system. Because our consciousness did not begin with our body but goes back farther, we can use a concept like “soul”—something that holds and gathers the learning from all the incarnations we've experienced. How far back does it go? Nobody knows for sure. Cultures that believe in reincarnation say it doesn't start with human beings; it starts before human beings. How far before? We're not sure. My sense is it starts when individuality begins to emerge within the evolutionary matrix. I use the term evolution to mean progressive development or unfolding, but not the standard reductive, determinist textbook theory of what's driving evolution or reincarnation.</p>
<p>It's about learning. How far back does it go? Somewhere between grasses and chimpanzees. It's hard to think of individual blades of grass having individual consciousness; we usually think in terms of broad classes. But somewhere in the evolutionary process, individuality emerges, and as it does, learning deepens that individuality over time. That's when I think reincarnation becomes possible. Classically, people look to animals lower than the mammalian chain, somewhere in animal life. Wherever individuality emerges, the next question is: What are we underneath these evolved changes? That takes us down to a deeper level underneath the soul. What is the essence of the soul, of our individuality—what makes this evolving individuality possible? In psychedelic work, we find the same answers as in the classic mystical traditions: the essence of the individual is the essence of the Divine. The essence of the one is the essence of the totality. We are, in essence, derived from the Divine—sparks of the Divine teased out of the unitive matrix and given the privilege of individuated existence, which is then polished and refined over thousands of years of going back and forth between spirit and matter, taking us along a developmental process. The essence of what we are is the Divine itself. The manifestation of what we are depends on how long we’ve been cooking.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
That's fascinating. You mentioned karma earlier—how you viewed it going into this work, and that maybe it changed. How do you view karma now, in this broad perspective you’ve been sharing?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Simply as cause and effect—karma-vipaka. The universe pulses with cause and effect at all levels. Here we’re talking about the causes set in motion by our capacity to choose. We make choices and inherit the consequences. In that new context, we make new choices and inherit those consequences. If we've been smoking two packs a day for five years, we're not free to not want the next cigarette, but we are free to set in motion choices that can free us from that addiction. One way my thinking has changed since writing Life Cycles, my first book, is a deeper appreciation of the synergistic relationship between individual development (individual karma) and collective development (collective karma). In the West, we tend to over-personalize karma, telling the story of the individual soul maturing over lifetimes and reaching enlightenment. But our species is evolving, pulsing every hundred years in reincarnation, and there is a collective learning process taking place of which our individual learning is a part. The boundary between collective and individual learning is porous, and I have much more sensitivity to collective karma I might previously have seen as personal karma.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
Earlier you mentioned the role psychedelics might be playing in this evolution of consciousness. When we were talking about that place between blades of grass and chimpanzees, what are your thoughts on Terence McKenna’s stoned-ape hypothesis? Was that an example of the universe, between spirit and matter, learning as it evolved? Do you view psychedelics as playing a role in history as well?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Terence’s hypothesis is interesting, but I don't have an opinion or any new insights to add. I hold it as an interesting hypothesis without an independent way of assessing it. I do think we are at a turning point in history—a make-or-break point—and psychedelics have a significant role to play. They give us extra awareness when we desperately need it, and a form of accelerated, deep healing when we desperately need that. There is a tremendous inner fermentation and detoxification happening at the collective as well as individual level. It manifests in our individual lives as an up-rushing of karmic content, conditioning, pain, and trauma we’ve been carrying in our soul history. This is happening not just to a few middle-class individuals who can attend to it, but underneath our social movements and the world at large. Psychedelics, by amplifying consciousness—our own and the consciousness we are part of—help us heal and manage this purification process, and they widen our worldview. One good deep experience of communion with the deep structure of the universe can shatter materialism—the philosophy that matter is the only thing that's real. I think Huston Smith was right: a mystical experience does not a mystic make, but a mystical experience can an atheist unmake. How far will this go? How deep will psychedelic healing reach in our culture? How fast will insights realized under psychedelic communion contribute to the paradigm shift, which is being driven by multiple disciplines right now? I don't know. But the fact that LSD was invented in the same decade as the nuclear bomb, and the nuclear bomb changed the global order, may be a significant synchronicity.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
Speaking of this time in human development—as someone who’s dedicated his academic and personal life to exploring what it means to be human—do you have an opinion on artificial intelligence? Some folks say psychedelics are helping us learn who we are, which might be really important given we might be creating something different but also conscious. Do you have an opinion?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I don't really have an opinion. It never came up in my sessions; I finished my sessions in 1999. I stand on the sidelines as a layperson—and an older one. I'm 74, and this is really a younger generation’s work. I watch from the edges. It’s developing much faster than I can keep track of. I'm concerned about it, but clearly it's here and will have a huge impact. I don't know what role it will play—friend or enemy over time. I'm more concerned about the ecological cliff we’re going over. We can extrapolate and are getting a clearer vision of how imbalances generated in the industrial era are manifesting with catastrophic consequences. The cumulative effect of these ecological crises will keep hitting again and again until we get on top of this, and we're nowhere near that. This is turning the 21st century into a period of tremendous global instability, unraveling, and crisis. That’s been my focal point. How AI plays into it, I don't know.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
On the ecological front, how much of that realization came from your psychedelic deep dives versus life experience? Did you get any insights into how psychedelics or raised awareness might help us find a better path forward?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Let’s hold the second part—how psychedelics might help—and address the first, because it was one of the biggest surprises in my work. First I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey and healing. I got involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then was catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper causal levels. I understand that what I’m about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative. But when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and the creative intent underlying evolution—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a post-Newtonian, quantum paradigm.</p>
<p>There’s a chapter I call “The Birth of the Future Human,” where I gather experiences from my journey that bear on where humanity is and where we’re going. It was a complete surprise that this came up in my sessions. This was long ago, before I had any ecological awareness—before I had absorbed the information we're all absorbing today. These visions took place between 1991 and 1995. I was naive about hitting environmental and ecological limits and the building crisis. Tucked around the edges, I was given visions of where humanity was in its evolutionary saga: that we were coming to a definitive turning point, an evolutionary pivot; that we were entering a magnificent period of profound transformation, with tremendous blessings; that the future of humanity would be radically unlike its present and past; and that some fundamental process was taking us there. For the first three or four years I was given consistent visions of the future but no indication of how we would get there. How would nature pull it off? Looking around, it didn't look positive—more people at the shopping mall than in transformative workshops, violence escalating. How would we make this transition?</p>
<p>In December 1995, when I was very far along in my work and deep in what I call the Diamond Luminosity material, I expected to be taken back into that state. Instead, I was dissolved into the species mind. As the species, I experienced a death and rebirth of the human family: a tremendous building crisis, the unraveling of life as we had known it, the shattering of expectations and systems, until humanity was reduced to the bare challenge of survival. For a while it looked like an extinction event—a global systems crisis that appeared to be driven by a cascading series of eco-crises. I wasn’t given details, a timetable, or how it would happen—just taken into a deep collective crisis. Then, when it was at its worst, we moved through it. On the other side, we had been changed—radically. There was an opening of the human heart, an opening of compassion—a profound change in what we’d classically call human nature. I’d describe it as a shift in the fundamental structure of the collective unconscious—a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. As we reassembled ourselves, the world was saturated with new values, new perceptions of the good, new social institutions. This was a huge transformation of the human heart.</p>
<p>I was given instructions on mechanisms that would make us move through this crisis faster than history usually allows, having to do with the collective psyche as a unified field. The crisis would be so severe it would shove not only individual psyches but the collective psyche into a far-from-equilibrium condition. From chaos theory and other areas, we know how physical systems behave under such conditions: rapid change, emergence of new structures, small iterations producing dramatic outcomes. I was shown that the human psyche, pushed into similar conditions, would exhibit some of the same characteristics. Bottom line: we would move through this crisis much faster than we’d think possible because of its severity and impact worldwide.</p>
<p>In subsequent sessions, moving beyond linear time, I experienced what I call the future human—the archetypal form of humanity. This being is extraordinarily beautiful, in some ways as far beyond us as we are beyond Homo erectus: a being with a massive, healed heart and an open mind. Not just transformed heart and mind, but a transformation of our sensory experience. We tend to have a mechanical theory of how senses work, but I was shown that the more consciousness is consolidated in the body, the more refined our sensory experiences become. At the end of my journey I had a vision of sight a hundred times sharper than in ordinary consciousness—and the same applies to hearing and other senses. This is a pivot to a radically transformed human species: a radically open heart, a radically open mind, and a radically augmented physical capacity. I think this is the story of our century: How do we make this transition—this pivot—from our present condition into our next evolutionary form? This is what I call the birth of the Diamond Soul.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
One follow-up on that, and I want to get into the birth of the Diamond Soul. As a professor of religious studies, do any religious or philosophical views line up with what you're describing? I’m thinking of the Kali Yuga from Hinduism—the dark age of materialism and corruption and the turn into the Golden Age or Satya Yuga with the return of wisdom, intelligence, compassion. Do you apply any frameworks from your studies to understand this?</p>

In addition to what you mention, we have Hopi prophecies and others from indigenous cultures that have long spoken of profound transformation. It does line up. The general perception is that we are in a period of darkness, but I’d conceptualize that darkness as the conditioning of the past—the karmic patterns shaping the human psyche at deep structural levels—being driven to the surface. We are entering a period of infusion of grace and energy that’s driving the past up so we can deal with it: the hatreds of history, the divisions of race, gender, nationality, haves and have-nots—all the patterns of splitting the world into categories—are being driven out of us. They have to come out to make us available to the influx of divine energy entering us, whether you think of it as coming from above or from within. There’s something deeply true in these ancient prophecies: we are, in a sense, in the age of the Kali Yuga and coming into a profound new age. When and how we get there, I don't know, but there’s a relationship.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
As I hear you talk, it feels very true. As a psychologist, I’ve been curious about the human psyche. When I look at the human organism, I see a being capable of so much more than we tend to produce—capable of great violence and fear-based behaviors, but also great creativity, adaptation, love, inclusion, compassion. We’re such a paradox. As terrifying as your description is, this next stage of development sounds necessary—that some kind of crisis might force or draw out the next stage. My own psychedelic experiences—and those of my clients—are almost exercises in existential crisis, a refining fire to burn away the dross so the purity of what you really are can come forward. But because of how intense and confusing it can be, it’s hard to make use of in our day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It can. Once we get into this work deeply, we realize we're playing on a different field than we thought. It’s a much bigger game. It's not just about our personal transformation; we’re involved in historic processes of enormous import. If you engage the deep psyche, you’re going into the deep end of the pool. The deep water is moving very fast right now, with a tremendous bubbling. Everyone has a certain tolerance for the complexity and intensity at that level. When we come back, we not only need to record our visionary experience carefully, we have to take care of ourselves to integrate it. It took me a year to recover from the session I mentioned—the death and rebirth of humanity—to stabilize it. Even then, you have to practice the arts of grounding if you’re going deep: physically, emotionally, psychologically, and socially with your peer groups. It’s demanding.</p>
<p>My understanding of reincarnation is that we get to choose the life we incarnate in. We’re given options; we see what we’re going into before we choose. That means every person here chose to be here in the form they are. We chose to incarnate at this very demanding time in history—to be a player. I want to be careful not to go too far too fast, but I think we knew what we were getting into and chose to be part of this process for our benefit, for our children and grandchildren around the world, and for the benefit of the Divine itself. The Divine is working. This is not something humanity is doing; it’s something nature is doing—whatever intelligence lies behind and within nature.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
I've always had a question about choosing to incarnate. How does the reincarnation perspective grapple with realities like a baby born with fetal alcohol syndrome, or a child born in a war-torn country or a place of disease and conflict?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Terrible, terrible suffering—babies born without a neocortex, babies born into violent circumstances, destined to die after a very short life with terrible pain. How can we assert intelligence, let alone compassion, in such a universe? To see the wisdom and intelligence, we have to look very deep and very wide. On the surface, life can be cruel—decimated by circumstances that crush the human heart. From a reincarnation perspective, our life did not begin at birth and does not end at death; it’s part of a larger story. Why someone would choose a life with so much suffering may be impossible to answer from within time-space and an individual perspective. To glimpse larger patterns, we have to open to a very large evolutionary and spiritual perspective.</p>
<p>Most important, I think, is understanding that all our suffering is preserved, conserved, and used. All human suffering is experienced by the Divine. There is no Divine outside human suffering watching us. Everything humanity suffers—everything the animal kingdom suffers—the spiritual world suffers at a very deep level.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
If we are the universe experiencing itself, it's not just the people with awesome lives that the universe is experiencing. It's every instantiation of the universe—every life, the ones that suffer and the ones that don't suffer as much.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
And I address this in Lifecycles: human suffering brings us to our knees, and I don’t think we have an adequate understanding or explanation of it. In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
That was a beautiful answer, and I really appreciate you taking it on, Chris, because I certainly feel like I’m on my knees. I read somewhere—maybe this was yours or someone else’s—that the divine, as you’ve described it, is something we can experience but not necessarily comprehend. That concept has brought me a lot of peace as a self-described truth seeker—wanting to understand things, thinking that would give me assurance that everything would be okay or help me know what I should or shouldn’t do. Permission to not know all the answers is quite comforting.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
Chris, do you have certain people you count as teachers—your philosophical and spiritual perspective and leanings? I’m thinking of the question of how one proceeds on a path of exploration like this wisely. What are good preparatory philosophies, spiritual frameworks, and systems to check out or try on?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I had the benefit of being a professor of religious studies, and I spent much of my professional life teaching courses in comparative mysticism, Buddhism, and introductory courses in Eastern and Western traditions. I got to study a lot of the masters and learn their stories, and they were always my guideposts. The great masters—the great spiritual beings—were my touchstones. Even though my work was not focused on spiritual awakening—we haven’t talked too much about that—the great masters were the standards I tried to hold myself accountable to as I conducted myself in this unusual spiritual practice.</p>
<p>Indigenous cultures I have tremendous respect for. I haven’t academically studied them; I have a layman’s reading of a number of books, and a real respect for them. I deeply appreciate that for people undertaking this type of work, it’s very beneficial to do it under the tutelage of an experienced teacher or guide—someone who can help process what they’re experiencing. That hasn’t been my particular destiny. I’ve never had a teacher. I’ve never been advised by an elder in a psychedelic community. My only teacher has been the universe itself, and she has been a fierce and loyal teacher. She’s broken me down, ground me up, spit me out, and beaten me severely—and she’s also helped me, blessed me, loved me, and taught me more than I ever imagined possible.</p>
<p>It’s foolish to do this type of work alone. Those were my circumstances, and I had the constitution to survive it. I had the companionship of my partner, a very wise spiritual woman who helped keep me grounded, and I had the advice of the elders I was studying in my courses. For most people, it’s good to do this work in groups, under the guidance of someone with more experience in these states than we have, because this is new territory. By guidance, I don’t mind someone who’s gently shaping our experiences, but really someone who can help us enter these states safely and help us understand and process our experiences when we come back. It’s important to have people we can talk to.</p>
<p>One of the burdens of my particular journey was working in isolation. Because it was illegal, I could not bring it to the office, or to campus. I couldn’t talk to my students about it. I’m a teacher—I love to learn and share, and I’m a gabber—so I could not talk about this. That’s not a healthy way to be. It’s good to have a community you can share with, and to listen to other people’s experiences. As that mutual experience grows, we know we’re all in this together. We really learn from each other as we go deeper. It’s important to do this work responsibly, with the guidance or tutelage of people who have more experience than you do.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
Thank you for that. I know time is whizzing by, but I’m on the edge of my seat. Is there anything you could share about the birth of the diamond soul—or however you put it—or that second part of the evolution and ecology of consciousness? Where might we focus our intentions on a path forward?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
About halfway through my journey, in the 38th session, in a year of enormous blessings, I was taken on an experience preceded by very intense purification—very intense death-rebirth processes. At one phase in this journey, I experienced all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before. I was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives, and I’d already written a book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But this was different: my former lives began coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They hit a critical mass and fused. There was an explosion of energy, and all these separate lives fused into one life. A burst of diamond light came out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. Then I was given a lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening. It changed my understanding of how reincarnation works and where it’s taking us.</p>
<p>The classic understanding in Eastern cultures is that you incarnate, you self-challenge, make mistakes, make progress, and get better and more compassionate over time until you reach some type of spiritual realization. Once you reach that, you’re free to leave the system of space-time—an up-and-out cosmology. The religions of the Axial Age are all up-and-out cosmologies: you achieve salvation or enlightenment and the fruition comes in an off-planet spiritual paradise. The teaching I received is that this is not an adequate description. It’s a first-stage approximation that humanity made when people began to have sufficient depth of experience to contact spiritual reality and understand reincarnation—but it stops halfway.</p>
<p>What I was shown is that humanity is not simply evolving one lifetime after another, making small, incremental improvements in the soul’s quality. Sooner or later, all our lives come together inside our physical existence. We die and expand into the soul; we incarnate into our narrow, egoic experience; we die and expand into the soul again. We know the soul between lifetimes. But if we keep this incarnational rhythm up long enough—each lifetime expanding out—sooner or later the soul wakes up inside our physical existence. This is what I call the birth of the diamond soul.</p>
<p>When the soul wakes up inside our physical existence, there’s a tremendous expansion of heart and mind, and it changes our entire orientation. We focus on the long-term vision, the long-term good—the wide good—because we have an intuitive awareness of the hundreds or thousands of people we’ve been in relationship with throughout history. We’ve been every race, every religion, up and down the economic ladder, in all the roles history can offer. When all those lives come together and wake up into a singular consciousness, it radically changes our perception of what’s taking place, who we are, and where we’re going.</p>
<p>People ask what form the future human will take. I think it’s simpler than we imagine. We’ve been gestating the future human through reincarnation for hundreds of thousands of years. Gestation is long; labor is short and intense. I think we’re entering a period of labor. We are desperately trying to grow into the largest, deepest, richest version of ourselves—and that is the diamond soul. I think the diamond soul is being born in history. Imagine if the entire species went through this process—not just a few like Christ, the Buddha, Muhammad, and a handful of saints, but the entire species awakening to this deeper identity that’s been gestating inside us all these years. What an extraordinary species—and what an extraordinary history—it would create.</p>
<p>We’ve reached a point where we simply cannot run this planet out of egoic consciousness. We either grow up or we go extinct. Extinction is a tremendous evolutionary accelerator. I think the crisis evolving this century is going to take us to our edge. But my experience is that we do make it through this crisis. I’ve experienced the future human as a task to be actualized and also as an accomplishment already realized. From my perspective, I deeply believe we will make it through the developmental challenges, and when we do—looking back over human history and our individual soul histories—we will recognize that everything we suffered, all the hardship we endured to get to this place, has been worth it. We’re giving birth to a new child in history, and it will be worth it.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
Chris, I’m feeling very grateful to you for your life’s work and your willingness to share it. I’m glad you decided to come forward and share with all of us—not just your students, where you had to do so almost covertly just by living the difference—but also now through your written work and by coming on podcasts like ours. It means a lot to me personally. I’m so grateful for your willingness to come on our show.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It’s an honor to have this discussion with you, gentlemen, and to share these ideas and this teaching with your audience. It truly is.</p>
<p>Reid Robison 
Thank you, Chris. This has been such a delightful honor and pleasure. We’ll cherish this conversation. Thank you for your generosity in sharing with us.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Thank you for your work, gentlemen. Thank you for the healing and insight you bring into the world.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
And Chris, is there anywhere in particular you’d like to point people—a website, any of your current work? Where can they find out more about you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
They can contact me through my website: chrisbache.com. It’s a website in need of an overhaul, but it’s there, and I’ve posted things I’ve written. I’m all over YouTube—various podcasts and talks I’ve given are there. If the articles I’ve written are not on my website, they’ll be on academia.edu under my name; all my articles are published there, so the most important things I’ve written are available. They can reach me on my website. I’m not doing any structured teaching at present. I may be doing some retreats in the near future, but those are still in the planning stages. Right now I’m doing some talks here and there at conferences, maybe some retreats being coordinated by people I’ve been working with individually. Basically, I’m just following the work that’s gotten into the world. I don’t have an agenda. I’m responding to where the book takes me. People read the book, they get interested—like you—and I’m just following it out.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer 
Well, a Chris Bache retreat sounds awesome. I’ll put it on my bucket list. I’ll be looking for it, and we’ll link to your website and places where people can find your work in our episode show notes. Again, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
You bet. Thank you.</p>

<p>Bas de Cock 
Thank you all for joining. We have two and a half hours together—plenty of time—and you’ll see it will pass quickly. Tonight we’ll begin with a meditation to settle into the theme of this Wisdom Keepers gathering. Then we’ll look ahead to the next hour or hour and a half with Chris and Duane—two different angles, two different paradigms in a beautiful dance. What are the possibilities for creating a new mindset as humans, a mindset of the whole universe? Because it’s not only about technological evolution or world leaders. Yes, we can cut greenhouse gases, drive electric cars, plant more trees, and be kinder to our neighbors—that’s where the mindset starts. After an hour and a half with Chris and Duane, we’ll use the last 30 to 45 minutes to look ahead at creating more circles as a community, as a human family, to practice this new mindset. We’ll guide you step by step. Please sit comfortably and have a good evening.</p>
<p>Before we start, I’d like you to close your eyes and trust us as hosts. We’re good people with a good mission. Ask yourself: Why are you here tonight? What is your real intention for being present with Duane, Chris, and this human family?</p>
<p>Are you here out of curiosity? Are you here to learn? Are you here to thrive?</p>
<p>Whatever your intention is, it doesn’t matter—really sense the reason why you’re here. It’s already present in this moment.</p>
<p>Visualize your intention for this evening as if it is here now, in the present.</p>
<p>What’s your contribution to this beautiful world we’re living in? What do you sense from your core, from your heart? Why are you here to contribute to the whole human family?</p>
<p>If you find a deeper understanding of why you’re contributing tonight, try to remember it for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>Please feel guided as we begin the meditation. Take some deep breaths, just to settle in. Allow yourself to open to this visualization I’m going to guide now.</p>
<p>Sense that you are floating in a galaxy with a clear, bright view of Mother Earth. Floating in the universe, you see our common ground—Mother Earth. You feel at peace and deeply connected to this beautiful planet in a sky full of stars. You can feel you’ve made this journey before, and now you feel so grateful to see Planet Earth from this perspective again. You sense a pull from Mother Earth drawing you toward her body. You can see all the continents and oceans coming into view. Closer still, you see your own continent, your country, your province. You zoom into your city and feel your neighborhood you know so well. Instantly you see your house, its interior, the furniture, and your loved ones sitting in your beautiful home.</p>
<p>Now sense that you’re back in your body. Feel your skin, your organs, your bones. Become aware of your breath and the heartbeat of your beautiful heart. Feel instantly at home—the same feeling you had when you watched Mother Earth from above.</p>
<p>Make contact with your breath again—deepen it—and take your time to open your eyes and come back outward.</p>
<p>To all who joined this gathering, feel free to make a little contact—look at the faces on the screen. Before we introduce Chris and Duane, I want to thank you for the donations. A beautiful amount has been given as a gift to the Choosing Life project, and we’ll hear more about it from Duane. I also want to introduce Maya, my co-host for the Wisdom Keepers each month. Melanie is also one of the hosts, but she can’t contribute tonight because she has a course running. Maya, before we go to Duane and Chris and open up, please feel free to share something from your side. Duane, your microphone is still off.</p>
<p>Yes, before we start with Chris and Duane and introduce them— and highlight why we’re here together—if you feel called to write something down, a question, an emotion, something arising in your system, feel comfortable doing so. In the second part of the gathering we’ll have a Q&amp;A and sharing time. Feel open to share, and trust this environment; we’re here with a good heart. We may use a whiteboard to integrate what’s emerging; if so, I’ll explain how.</p>
<p>A personal note: my background is as a medical doctor, an ENT specialist. Then life called me into integrative medicine, and now I’m in the Grof Legacy Training for transpersonal psychology and psychedelic therapy. That’s where I met Chris. I took your beautiful Shift Network course, LSD and the Mind of the Universe, and it opened something in me about how we take care of this planet and this universe—it’s all one life system. After my own psychedelic experiences, this has only deepened. It feels like we’re creating a tribe where these important things can be shared—a mind shift in itself.</p>
<p>Chris, it’s beautiful to start with you, since the initial outreach was to you and then Duane came in. You’re Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, specialized in Buddhist studies; you’re also connected with the California Institute of Integral Studies and on the Advisory Council of my Grof Legacy Training, and related to the Institute of Noetic Sciences. You are hardly “retired”—you’re fully alive and contributing to the mind shift underway. You’ve authored several books; the latest, LSD and the Mind of the Universe, sits on my desk every day. Even if you’re not in LSD or psychedelics, I recommend it; it contains very important information. You describe your empirical research—76 deep, high-dose LSD sessions with your former wife’s support—entering nonordinary states of consciousness and encountering a vision of our impending global crisis and the birth of the future human. These visions matter because they come from a field we’re not usually aware of. Thank you for being here and contributing to this gathering.</p>
<p>And Duane, during Chris’s course he mentioned your work, and afterward I dove in. Your last book, Choosing Earth, was mind-blowing—so full of information. You’ve authored several important books for us humans, but Choosing Earth especially. The link to the Choosing Earth website and book is in the chat; you can download the PDF. In the early 1970s you worked as senior staff for the Presidential–Congressional Commission on the American Future of the last 30 years of the 20th century, an important position. You’ve been acknowledged as a social visionary exploring deeper trends transforming our world, and recognized with an international peace award for a global vision and a consciousness and lifestyle that contribute to a more sustainable and spiritual culture.</p>
<p>It’s an honor to have you both here. Let’s open with our main question: How can we, as humans, create a new mindset that transforms our global crisis? Can we transform it—or must we go through it with a new mindset? Let’s start there and see how the dance evolves. Thank you both for being here.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It’s a pleasure to be here, everyone. Bas, thank you for the invitation. My voice is a little rough—I’ve come down with a cold. I wouldn’t have canceled, because this material is too important, and I wouldn’t pass up a chance to talk with Duane. I’d have to be near dead to miss this. We’ve been friends for over 20, 25 years. Our research and writing brought us together, and as we’ve come to know each other, our friendship has deepened into a lifelong brotherhood.</p>
<p>For today, Duane and I see this as a conversation—an opportunity to sink into the kind of exchange we have when we get together. Let me affirm some common ground. I’m a philosopher of religion, an academic all my life in Northeast Ohio. Duane is a visionary social activist. We’ve both written books and have been completely committed to our life’s work. We share a vision of the universe that can be reached intellectually and experientially—a universe saturated with intelligence: orders upon orders of intelligence, and the intelligence that stands behind the manifest universe—the source out of which the universe sprang in the Big Bang and continues to unfold.</p>
<p>We also share the sense that our consciousness—if you sit quietly or amplify it—descends from personal unconsciousness into what Jung called the collective unconscious, and if you keep going, into levels beyond species, beyond time and space, into deep communion with what we think of as the mind of the universe—both manifest and unmanifest. We both hold that this intelligence is profoundly wise. Duane asked me before we began, “How would you describe the IQ of the universe?” I had to think in terms of millions or billions. Look around: the intelligence that manifests everything we see—how could we possibly measure its depth?</p>
<p>And compassion. That’s trickier. It’s easy to see intelligence—look at DNA, the structure of stars and galaxies. But compassion? On the surface, life is hard. One could conclude the universe is run by a mean son of a bitch—it hurts so much. To see the wisdom and compassion behind the hard conditions in which we live, you have to look very deep—far beyond sensory consciousness, beyond the personal and collective psyche. Ramakrishna said, to see God you must be willing to look evil in the face. To see the wisdom of the universe, you must be willing to sit with the pain of existence. Nothing Duane or I say will dilute, sidestep, or sublimate the deep suffering required to live a fully embodied spiritual life.</p>
<p>That’s a warm-up. We’ll toss this back and forth and move toward the times we’re living in—the crisis we’re entering, its depth, and what we might do to move through it with courage, to accelerate our way through it with intelligence and compassion, exploring what the universe wants of humanity now—what we’re being invited to become. We share the vision that we’re coming to a triggering point, a bifurcation: either we take the next step in our long evolutionary journey, or we go extinct. We can’t survive on this planet under these conditions at the level of consciousness that brought us here. We either grow up, as Duane says, or we die. That potential extinction is an enormous evolutionary accelerator. With that, over to my brother, Duane.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin 
Thank you, brother Chris. You are one of my dearest friends, and I’m grateful for our lifelong journey, our mutual passion for looking deeply into the nature of the universe and where it is leading us in this dangerous, creative, transformative time. The suffering present in the world is a catalyst for awakening—pushing back on ourselves and opening freshly to where we are and where we might go.</p>
<p>I appreciated Bas saying he trained as a doctor. Early in my life, I was going to become a doctor, too, but I encountered the violence of the Vietnam era and shifted—from physical healing to social healing. That’s a theme I’d like to explore. Underneath social healing is our connection with the aliveness of a living universe. That is where Chris and I meet—in our shared exploration of that possibility, that reality. Let’s begin.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Where do you want to start? Dig in.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin 
Let’s acknowledge where we are. The crisis of transition isn’t in the future; it’s happening now. The head of the United Nations recently said humanity is on a “climate highway to hell.” And that’s just climate. We’re also on a path to extincting a huge proportion of plant and animal species—by the end of this century, it’s estimated a million species will be gone. We’re impoverishing the Earth. We’re in overshoot—far beyond the Earth’s resource base. It’s estimated the Earth can carry roughly 2 billion people into the far future; we have 8 billion now. If we take that to heart, we’re roughly 6 billion over carrying capacity. We are in for a rough ride—a rough initiation—moving from overshoot, collapse, extinctions, climate catastrophe, resource depletion, and more, into a new, healthy relationship with the Earth and the capacity to live far into the future.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
A question on people’s minds: Can we avoid this crisis now? If we really mobilize, can we stop what’s happening and bring it under control?</p>
<p>Duane Elgin 
No. It’s too late. Had we started a half-century ago—when I began my research in the early 1970s—there was an opportunity to pull back, take a hard look, and choose a new path. But we used those 50 years to consume ourselves into a corner. Now we’re up against it: overshoot, a growing climate catastrophe, accelerating extinctions, and more. Now is the time for choice—a new understanding of who we are, where we are, and where we’re going. Not just philosophically, but practically, as a species. Let’s begin that inquiry.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
The destabilization coming at us has already begun. We see a deep unraveling in the social fabric. Political discourse is increasingly polarized. We’re moving toward fascism on one side, totalitarianism on others; repression of discourse; denial of facts and science. It’s harder to assume common ground—symptoms that the ground is shifting beneath our feet. We’re in a slow-moving earthquake building year by year, shaking systems to their foundations. If you look at the research, you can see it. This will deepen for decades—our generation, our children’s, our grandchildren’s. It’s hard to imagine how bad it will get. When I think about it, my heart explodes with pain. Everyone who looks hard at the data feels that pain and would do anything to avoid this. But this is what we’re going into. That makes it essential to understand what is happening at a deep structural level. If we don’t, we’ll give way to despair, to destructive theodicies, to toxic political philosophies. We have to understand this deeply. Over to you, brother.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin 
Here’s what I’ve encountered over the last 40 years speaking around the world. Before a talk, I often ask one question: If you look at the entire human family and our behaviors, what life stage are we expressing? I give four possibilities: toddlers, teenagers (adolescents), early adults, or elders. Across contexts—church groups, college audiences, business communities—it doesn’t matter. Roughly three-quarters consistently say: adolescents.</p>
<p>If we are a species in adolescence, what will it take to move into early adulthood? That’s the fire of initiation we face now—pushing us into a new sense of ourselves, a new sense of the universe we live in, and a new sense of the evolutionary journey we’re engaged in. This is a rite of passage. All the suffering and pain are part of what every adolescent goes through in their way. We don’t move into adulthood without the fire of initiation. Let’s accept that this is how evolution works—we’re being pushed out of the nest of comfort into a transforming future. It’s extraordinary. Without some sense of where we might be going, we’ll be reluctant to go. That’s why I appreciate Chris’s exploration of the birth of the future human, and my own work—we’re both looking at the maturation of the species: our relationship with the universe, with one another, and within ourselves. That’s a conversation Chris and I have had again and again over the years.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
To give context to Duane’s observations, I want to point to his book Awakening Earth, where he describes stages of human evolution in terms of our conscious capacities. If I have this right—Duane, correct me—you say we could move through the last three evolutionary stages in as little as 500 years. Given the tens and hundreds of thousands of years leading up to that, it would represent an enormous, exponential acceleration—very intense, dramatically sped up. Yes, Duane?</p>
<p>Duane Elgin 
Indeed, we're moving into a time of intense compression. This is going to be a heated journey—humanity passing through the fire of initiation that we’re already beginning to experience as we look beyond nation-state boundaries to the Earth as a whole system. What we’re doing now will not carry us to the end of this century. We’re going to be pushed outside our usual circumstances and into new conditions—not simply as nations, but as a species. That will be the catalyst for a rapid acceleration of evolutionary potentials already surfacing. This gathering is one expression of that, as is the role of psychedelics in catalyzing an awakening to a new understanding of ourselves and the human journey. Here we go as a species—into the fire, into initiation, and, hopefully, into our higher humanity.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
In that context, I want to put on the table one fundamental axiom of my thought. I know Duane shares it, and I suspect many here do too: reincarnation. My first book was on reincarnation, starting with the empirical evidence, which I believe is overwhelming. I came to this conclusion as a philosopher of religion. When I look at human beings, I tend to see souls. There are old souls in small, young bodies, and young souls in old, withered bodies. The key is understanding that reincarnation is a higher order of evolution. It’s one of the fundamental truths of a self-manifesting, self-evolving universe.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve told the reincarnation story through the lens of theologies and philosophies focused on individual evolution: the soul’s development over countless lifetimes, awakening into individual enlightenment. That’s true, but it’s incomplete. When we recognize that every human being on the planet is a reincarnating essence, we begin to see reincarnation as a collective driver, not just an individual one. It’s not about personal salvation alone. It’s an evolutionary driver of the highest magnitude.</p>
<p>If you read my book “Diamonds from Heaven,” or as the publisher titled it, “LSD in the Mind of the Universe,” there’s a section where I record experiences that kept opening me and showing me the entire species pulsing in and out of time-space every hundred years or so—evolving together, with all our individual karmic agendas woven skillfully into a collective karmic agenda, and the collective informing the individual. It became impossible to separate individual evolution from collective evolution. That became a core theme of my second book, “Dark Night, Early Dawn,” where I talk about the dark night not only of the individual soul before spiritual awakening, but of our collective soul. From my sessions, I came to understand that our individual work serves not only our personal development, but directly serves our collective development. There are no personal problems that are not also collective problems. Try to think of one—any personal issue echoed or reflected in our culture. I’ll pause there. Hand it back to you, Duane.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin 
Chris held up a book or two. I can’t let that pass without holding up one of my own that relates directly to what he’s speaking about: a reincarnational perspective—how can that happen? Here’s a book I worked on for 30 years, “The Living Universe.” The universe, according to modern science and as I have encountered so many times, is considered nonliving at the foundations—dead matter and empty space. In modern consumer society, it’s all just dead matter and empty space. And people like Chris come along and say, “Wait a minute—I’ve explored the deeper reaches of the universe. It’s a living system.” In a living system, life can reconnect with itself and evolve with itself. Reincarnation then is not losing the thread of our existence as we move through multiple cycles of life in this larger aliveness.</p>
<p>We can explore the foundations of a living universe and that perspective, but I want to give Chris a chance to connect the living universe with the evolution of life through that living system.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
In that context, let me say something hard and consoling at the same time. From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.</p>
<p>When we talk about the deaths that are coming, we have to relate at two levels, both fundamentally true. One: the death of a human being is painful, horrendous—a terrible ending of a precious cycle of life. That hurts like hell. Another perspective says that in a deeper sense, no one dies. Cycles end and begin, but the consciousness alive within that being is not extinguished—only paused—while we go home, recalibrate, refresh, rejuvenate, and then re-enter the fray. That’s consoling because death is not the end. But if you look carefully, it also means this pattern of leaving loved ones and returning in new configurations—again and again—shreds, in some ways, the social, family, and individual fabric. It’s part of how life works. We have to look deeply to understand. The universe thinks in very different terms than we do—on a time frame much larger, on a completely higher order of scale. We have to learn to think like a mountain, to think like the universe, to think large and deep—and to look at every human being as a precious soul, a companion on this long journey. Whatever our short-term relationships, underneath we stand together in this long evolutionary trajectory, working for the collective good of our planet and the entire human family.</p>
<p>To be committed to your species, your generation, the planet, and the other forms of life that share it—these are expressions of a maturing soul. A young soul is small; a maturing soul is large. When we look at Gandhi, Martin Luther King—great souls who hold large swaths of humanity in their heart—those are symptoms of a maturing soul. Great, Duane.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin 
So well said, Chris. Part of growing up—a maturing soul—is to grow into the reality that we have a soul and to keep the fire in the soul alive so we can grow into the future you’re speaking about. I’ve often wondered: why doesn’t the larger world recognize what we’re speaking about here? This is wisdom known through history and across cultures. Where is that wisdom today?</p>
<p>I’m reminded of three miracles from the American Indian tradition. The first miracle is that anything exists at all. The second miracle is that living things exist—plants and animals. The third miracle is that living things exist that know they exist and have the capacity to explore the nature of that existence. We get so enamored with the third miracle—which elevates our capacities as a species—that we forget the first miracle: that anything is here at all.</p>
<p>One thing I appreciate about what Chris is doing is not only learning about reincarnation and the individual soul moving through time, but also the nature of the universe that would carry that process—the first miracle. The universe is itself a living system, and we are beginning the evolutionary journey of learning how to live in that larger aliveness. That’s an extraordinary transition from living in a “dead” universe of dead matter and empty space. If all we have is a physical body here for a short time, what do we do with that short time? We consume as much as we can for as much pleasure as we can before we’re thrown into the mystery of nonexistence. Chris is talking about a different journey: we are deeply alive in a living universe, moving through that larger aliveness. We’re trying to move beyond a consumer society that is overconsuming the Earth, into a greater wisdom: look at who you are. Yes, you have a physical body, but beyond the physical body is the body of consciousness that lives in our living universe. That is who you are, more deeply and profoundly. Whether encountered through psychedelics, meditation, and so on, that is who we are at a foundational level. That’s what Chris is pointing to, and that’s what I’m working with as well.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
You’re pointing to me, Duane, but come on—you wrote “The Living Universe.” You spent years looking at the scientific evidence, trying to marshal the kind of evidence that would convince my atheistic philosophy department, where they reject all of this out of hand because they’re committed to materialism. I present evidence for reincarnation, and they say, “That’s nonsense, it all reduces to brain.” You took that on. You laid out and hammered the evidence, and you drew on cross-cultural testimony from multiple continents testifying to a deeper mystery, a deeper intelligence we can experience.</p>
<p>My philosophical colleagues are skeptical of experience. But a philosophical revolution begins with the question, “What is it possible for a human being to experience?” They tell me, “You can’t experience what you say you’re experiencing,” and I say, come on—bullshit. We have a method. Hundreds of thousands of people have used it. With LSD psychotherapy, we’ve pushed these boundaries. We have longitudinal studies showing what happens. You can’t dismiss that and say, “That couldn’t be real because my metaphysics says matter is the only reality and you’re talking about things that aren’t materially based.” Yes—you’re knocking on their door hard, brother.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin 
Let’s look beyond philosophy to direct experience. The psychedelic experience is direct and immediate—you don’t think about it, you’re overwhelmed by encounter with life in a different mode. Let me briefly share my experience in parapsychology. Almost half a century ago, the U.S. government began the first research into so-called psychic potentials. I don’t like the word “psychic.” I prefer to say “it’s alive.” To what extent can we relate to and experience the aliveness of the living universe, and what does that reveal?</p>
<p>There were two things that came back after three years of in-depth research at the engineering laboratory of the Stanford Research Institute. I had the extraordinary opportunity, funded by NASA, to explore our intuitive capacities. They wanted to know: if there’s an astronaut on the far side of the moon, is there any way to intuitively understand their situation? Can our intuition reach behind the far side of the moon and get meaningful information about their condition? That was the premise that launched three years of inquiry. I dropped out after three years because it was taken over by the CIA—the information was so compelling—and it continued for another 20 years. In those first three years, here’s what was learned: there are two aspects to our intuitive potentials. First, we can receive information far beyond our normal perceptual capacities—what’s sometimes called remote viewing. Second, we can extend our energetic impact on the universe far beyond our body—sometimes called psychokinesis, mind manifesting in matter.</p>
<p>That expressive side took me into the realm of a living universe—exploring its ecology and how we dance with it, expanding into the larger selves we actually inhabit. We have a physical body, but that body is an anchor for an unbounded awareness, an unbounded consciousness that reaches without limit into the larger universe and beyond. We are bounded for a short while. Then, as Chris mentioned, that boundary gives way. The body dies, but the consciousness carried through the body does not; it migrates into larger realms. I don’t presume to know where we’re going, but I have unshakable confidence we are learning to live in this larger aliveness—and that is the core journey we’re on as a species. If we think we’re here to consume more so we can be happy with material things, we’re missing what this is about. This is a place to learn who we are beneath and beyond the physical body, to recognize we are part of a journey of aliveness with infinitely deep origins and infinitely deep potential into the future.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Boy, do I want to jump on that. As we develop our potentials and make this turning point—as we mature as a species—what kind of human being are we becoming? What are the potentials we are activating? I think it’s far beyond what we see even in science fiction. I want to build up to that by pivoting more directly to psychedelics.</p>
<p>This is something both Duane and I share, and I suspect a high percentage of people in this room have used psychedelics responsibly as part of their personal history or spiritual practice, just as many do yoga or meditation. Psychedelics are part of the arsenal not only of spiritual healing—healing the soul—but of becoming more aware of what our lives are about and what life itself is about.</p>
<p>Personally: I was a brand-new professor, fresh out of graduate school, when I read Stan Grof’s work. I immediately felt I saw my life’s vocation. I had to do this work. It had been made illegal in 1970. This was 1978. I loved teaching and didn’t want to lose my job, so I developed a sideline to my career. I was an academic—teaching at the university, sitting on committees, writing papers—but in my nighttime job I began a systematic course using a psychedelic protocol I inherited from Stan Grof: totally internalized sessions, lying down, eye shades, earphones, a sitter—the drill.</p>
<p>Unwisely, after three sessions I chose a protocol of very high doses of LSD because I was in a hurry. I thought this would get me where I wanted to go faster—that it was about personal awakening, personal enlightenment. I thought, it’ll be harder, but I’ll burn off my karma faster. Let’s put the pedal to the metal. That turned out to be wrong on many points. The goal was not personal enlightenment. If you work with very high doses in a carefully controlled setting and start shattering boundaries, within a few years you can find, as I did, that what’s driving your sessions is not your personal development or healing but a larger historical drama of our collective development. So much of the healing in my sessions was not about healing Chris Bache or even my soul; it was engaging and healing aspects of the human family—pains stored within the collective unconscious from all the wars, unhealed traumas, abuses, droughts, men-versus-women violence, race-versus-race violence, and so on. All that unresolved trauma accumulates in the human psyche.</p>
<p>For us to make this evolutionary pivot, we have to heal humanity—the being that, for me, is a single being: the human species, in which we are all cells. To make the transition Duane has talked about—from an adolescent stage of soul development to a mature adult stage—we have to heal. Healing is the first step to establish a new foundation where we can download deeper, more mature energy, light, and insight from the universe. We’re too fragmented to take advantage of all the wisdom and healing available to us. As we do this work, we can take in more of the light of the universe.</p>
<p>When you start shattering the shells that hold awareness in fixed, narrow formations, you break through the first layers—people talk about ego death—and you’re reborn into a deeper level of consciousness. If you work steadily at those boundaries, you hit limits and go through another death and rebirth—not ego death repeating, but a deeper dying at the species level. The rebirth pitches you into some aspect of humanity’s awakening.</p>
<p>If you continue this process—systematically, taking care of your body (and I don’t recommend doing it the way I did; it’s a lot of wear and tear; I’d be gentler now)—if you keep pushing those boundaries, you begin to enter a communion with the intelligence within the species that’s driving the species. It begins to teach you what’s happening and where humanity is going. About eight or nine years into my work, I began having a series of visions being poured into me. I think of Black Elk when I talk about this. When he was 12, he had a visionary experience of the fate of the Lakota people that shook him so deeply he was unconscious for days. When he came back, he held this vision and didn’t talk about it for years.</p>
<p>In my case, I was downloading visions of the fate of the human species—not all at once, but in pieces over sessions stretched over years. The fundamental teaching kept repeating and deepening: humanity is coming to a turning point, a very challenging period, but a time of profound spiritual fruition—the beginning and end of history, an epochal shift. We are coming into a time of collective awakening. It’s not about individuals anymore. This is species-wide. The time of individual salvation is over. The time of collective salvation is at our doorstep. Again and again it said: this is a massive turning point; we have been building to this transition for eons.</p>
<p>It kept showing me a future that was ecstatic—a species of Buddhas and Christs and prophets, totally awakened from the soul-center of our being. But in all those years, it never told me how we were going to get there. I had no insight into how we would make this transition as fast as we have to, given that extinction is pressing down on us—hard and fast. The crisis is moving in on us now.</p>
<p>I share this because as I’ve talked about it (and in “LSD in the Mind of the Universe”), many people have told me they’ve had the same kind of visions in deep meditation: we’re coming to a turning point; this is a collective force. There’s nothing private or personal about it. It’s not unique to me. I’m simply witnessing to something many of us have been experiencing. And I know you’ve experienced this kind of material, Duane. I’m turning…</p>
<p>Duane Elgin
Let me summarize, from my perspective, what we've been speaking about. Three elements stand out. First, we’re not recognizing the nature of the universe in which we live. The universe is a living system, but much of current science treats it as dead matter in empty space. We’re prepared to work with the material dimensions, but the deeper aliveness is not recognized. Second, we don’t recognize who we are. We think we’re merely biological beings in a dead universe, making the best of it in a consumer society. We’re not recognizing that we are part of that larger aliveness. Third, we’re not recognizing the evolutionary journey and its dimensions. We think we die and the lights go out. No—we go on. As you’ve been speaking about, Chris, in a reincarnation universe we go on evolving.</p>
<p>So the transition I see is threefold: a new recognition of where we are—it’s a living system; a recognition of who we are—we’re part of that larger aliveness; and a recognition of where we’re going—beyond consumerism, into learning to live in that larger aliveness. What an extraordinary journey, to be blessed with the gift of entering into it.</p>
<p>You raised the question, Chris: how do we make that threefold transition—understanding the universe freshly, who we are freshly, and where we’re going? A lot of attention now is going toward material systems: climate crisis, too much CO2, cut back on cars. That’s a material response to a trans-material challenge. Again and again people ask, What are you going to do about it? One of the key things I’ve worked on for decades is media. People say, Isn’t media the problem—hypnotizing us into a materialistic mindset, leaving us with more consumerism? No, it goes way beyond that. Mass media is the access to the mass mind. Here we are on a call with people in different parts of the world, and we’re beginning to grow the neurological structures of the species as we use media to speak with one another and grow a new understanding, a new consensus, a new consciousness of who we are.</p>
<p>One critical element of a transforming future is to transform our uses of media. This gathering now is an example—there are so many more. We’re exploding into a new opportunity to use media as a mirror: Who are we? And then to communicate back: I’ve seen myself in that mirror, I see a new possibility, and let’s evolve into it. We’re on the cusp, on the threshold of using extraordinary media potentials. Two-thirds of the people on this planet have a cell phone. All we have to do is pick it up and we have access to a majority of humanity. By the end of this decade, it’ll be three-quarters. Through that, we have access to the collective mind.</p>
<p>We are over-endowed right now with tools and capacities to communicate and to grow into a new collective consciousness around those three dimensions of transformation. We’re right on the threshold, and the world is pushing back. It’s a learning time, an awakening time, a growing time—and we’re over-endowed with all the tools we need to go through that learning journey.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
This is one area where our work is complementary. You are a deeply committed, lifelong social activist who understands, far beyond me, how social transformation can take place—what roots keep us stuck and where the opportunities are for facilitating deep social change at a practical, tangible level. My work has been more internally focused, so let me speak to the inside of this process. While my psychedelic experience has been deeply collective, it takes place in one room, in one house, on one street—a very different way to access the collective.</p>
<p>Let me point to the next installment in my journey. Personal death-rebirth—I went through that. Collective death-rebirth—I went through that. I began having visionary experiences of where the human species was being taken—an extraordinary future, with no explanation of how we’d get there. Then I was carried into a series of profound mystical experiences of non-duality and shunyata—emptiness—and deep, ecstatic joy. Then it took me into the Diamond Luminosity work, which occupied the last five years of my practice.</p>
<p>In the midst of those Diamond Luminosity sessions—where I was expecting to be returned to that state periodically, after rounds of purification—something else happened. In my 55th session in 1995, I dissolved completely into the species. I became dissolved into the collective unconscious so deeply that my individual consciousness was just a slow remnant, and I entered what I call deep time. I’d gone beyond linear time many times before, but this dissolved me very deeply into deep time—both trans-spatial and transtemporal—and it took me further into the future than I’d been taken before.</p>
<p>I began to experience, systematically and clearly, the death and rebirth of the human family. It was like experiencing a thunderstorm where you see the pattern of the storm as a whole and also experience all the individual drops simultaneously—both aggregate and particular. I experienced the entire human family moving into crisis. The ordinary structures of our world were breaking down. We were losing control. Civilization was being shattered. Lives were torn apart. It was extraordinarily painful. The whole human family was being shoved to the edge of apparent extinction. It built and built for a long time in the session. Then, just when it looked like that was it, the worst of the storm passed. Things began to get lighter. People began to pick themselves up. We began to find each other. Many had died, but many survived. As we survived, we discovered we had been changed. The crisis drove us so deep into our being that it unlocked something in us. We shed assumptions and accumulations and were tapped into what I came to call the One Heart—our individual hearts as expressions of a single heart.</p>
<p>As we met each other, creativity catalyzed new social forms and cultural innovations. Feedback loops formed—creativity fed new creativity—and there was exponential growth in awareness grounded in new values, new perceptions of the good, new understandings of human nature, nature itself, and the Divine. This was not so much a forecast as an experience in deep time—something already happening and yet to happen. It was a both–and experience that can open in very deep psychedelic states.</p>
<p>It took me about a year to recover. I would walk around my town in Ohio and see all these beautiful souls who didn’t consciously know what they were coming into, but at a soul level, had chosen to incarnate at this time. I felt surrounded by courageous souls entering consciously into this very intense century of transformation. It was like walking around Hiroshima the week before the bomb dropped. Everyone, I saw, was entering into a terrible catalyst of pain, and yet they were profound spiritual warriors. It took time to learn how to live with that vision, but I did, and eventually I brought it into Dark Night, Early Dawn and then more fully into LSD and the Mind of the Universe. That’s a perspective I know I share with you.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin
As a long-time social activist, I want to add another note before we conclude. There are no guarantees here. We’ve seen the possibilities and felt them in our souls and bones. We know what’s possible, but there’s no guarantee we’ll realize it as a species. I see three great possibilities ahead. One is what we’ve just been speaking about: an extraordinary invitation into greater aliveness and possibility.</p>
<p>But there are two other very real futures. One is collapse and functional extinction—not complete extinction, but becoming no longer a force in evolution on Earth, and no longer connected well enough with one another to make a difference in our collective lives. We could become so fragmented and diminished that we never pull the species body together in its learning potentials. The third is an authoritarian future. We can see it in Russia, China, beginning in India and other parts of the world, and in the United States. The authoritarian orientation is strong; people are ready to surrender their freedoms. What you and I are speaking about is: claim your freedom. Claim your freedom to be a living participant in a living universe. Grow into that freedom. Don’t surrender it to scientists who look at only a material universe. Don’t surrender it to media and politicians who say it’s only about more and more material well-being.</p>
<p>There are three great paths before us. The one you’ve been speaking about, and I have as well, is a narrow pathway into the future. We’ll have to do everything we can as a community—not just as individuals—to elevate and awaken ourselves, to grow into that future of evolutionary potential, to learn to live in that larger aliveness. So bless you, brother, and thank you for your life of contribution and service to that future.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
And you too, brother. As we transition into questions and answers, I want to share a view I think we both hold: this century is a century of labor. We have been gestating the future human for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years through reincarnation—over and over, deeper and deeper. But now we’ve come into labor. Gestation is long; labor is short. Gestation can be gentle while life goes on at the surface; labor is intense. It requires a complete interruption of ordinary life and a deep turning within. We are in the process of collectively giving birth to what I call the future human. Many have seen and felt it—Homo spiritualis, Homo noeticus, different names—but the fundamental idea is the same: we are giving birth to a more evolved form of humanity.</p>
<p>What might this future human look like? Here I return to reincarnation and some experiences I describe in LSD and the Mind of the Universe. I’d done past-life therapy before and was familiar with about a dozen former lives—nothing special, ordinary lives. But in one particular session, all my former lives began to come back into me, fast and furious. I’d already gone through tremendous purification and death-rebirth. Then these lives started wrapping into me like filaments of light around a kite spool—each wrap a life. At a certain point they hit critical mass. There was an explosion of energy—diamond light blew out my chest—catapulting me into a completely new state of consciousness. All those individual lives fused into one, into a singularity. Then a teaching unfolded, illuminating the experience.</p>
<p>The vision that emerged is different from many Eastern views of reincarnation. The classical view says: reincarnate, grow more compassionate and wise, and when you achieve enlightenment—moksha—you’re permitted to leave time and space. But that’s not what came forward. What emerged was the birth of the diamond soul. We reach a point in human evolution where, after long work healing negative karma—purifying, healing relationships, resolving personal and civilizational scars—our entire history begins to coalesce. Early stages feel like cleaning out the basement; then there comes a point when the work is done, the lives congeal, and there is an explosion of consciousness. We no longer experience ourselves as a 100-year-old being; we experience ourselves as a 100,000-year-old being. We experience ourselves as souls—not a human being with a soul, but as the consciousness that holds all our former lives as one.</p>
<p>Usually we experience that diamond soul after we die: we go small to big, then back to small when we reincarnate. But if we keep at it long enough, the soul wakes up inside physical existence. When that happens, heaven manifests on Earth. Nirvana is samsara. We realize we don’t have to go anywhere to experience absolute bliss and joy. The goal of spiritual evolution is not to mature and then leave. That older view made sense historically—before we knew how old and vast the universe is and how much intelligence is sunk into building it. The goal is to awaken—to truly awaken to our soul consciousness—which opens a different relationship with all beings and with the intelligence continuously regenerating time and space. The task is to embody that awakening, not as a disembodied transcendence, but embodied, and to bring that consciousness into the making of history, of the planet, of a civilization that truly works for all.</p>
<p>How far can we take this? As our traditions say, mind creates our destiny. As the mind leads, destiny follows. When our mind is fragmented and conflicted, we live in a fragmented and conflicted reality. This is not simply an individual story; it’s a collective story with dynamic feedback between individual and collective manifestation. We are learning how to control the nuclear energy of the soul—fiery, luminous, divine—cosmic energy. We are learning how to be gods—not in any superficial sense, but evolving into beings at peace with ourselves and each other, with capacities to manifest creativity inside time and space that today we know mostly from mystical literature—the mahasiddhas, the great beings who work “miracles.” They have gathered so much conscious power that they can manifest in ways that bend the apparent laws of physics. I suspect they’re manifesting deeper laws of physics at higher energy levels.</p>
<p>We’re maturing into a soul-centered human being who lives at peace with self and others. And of course this isn’t the end of the story. Let’s assume we make this transition in one, two, or three centuries. The universe isn’t stopping. We’ll be here for millions, billions of years. We have at least four billion years before the sun goes supernova; we’ll need to be off the planet in about two billion. This is just the beginning. We’re like children in the crib created by the universe, waking into the room—just activating our potential and moving forward. I agree with you, Duane: there are no guarantees. We all have to show up and do everything possible to bring us through this transition.</p>
<p>At the same time, from within my psychedelic experience, I’ve been taken so deep into the future so many times that, in my last great vision—the 70th session—I experienced this transformation as a given, as something we had accomplished. Not an open-ended possibility, but something truly achieved. From my heart, I cannot doubt we will make this transition. I worry deeply about the cost—how many of our children will die, how many across the world will starve. It’s going to take maximum exertion from all of us. But we’re not driving this. Nature is driving this. The creative intelligence of nature is driving this. We didn’t give ourselves the big brain; we didn’t give ourselves the evolutionary qualities embodied in us. A larger process is driving this. The most we can do is cooperate: wake up, recognize what’s happening, collaborate as co-creators of the future human—into which we will incarnate in our future lives.</p>
<p>The shift grinding forward is like a change in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche—at the deepest structure. After we make this shift, every human being born will operate from a different collective psyche, a different level of soul awareness. That’s the work of the hour. We all knew what we were getting into when we were born; we chose to be part of this process. With that knowledge, we can relax even as we go to work—taking spiritual nurturance from the universe while doing our best.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
Let’s open it up and see where these good people want to go.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin
Thank you, brother. This has been a delight to share this hour with you, and I’m deeply grateful for our friendship over these decades. Bless you.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock
From this place—what amazing, deep words. It’s not about the words so much as the energy felt during your dance; it’s transformative by itself. I’m honored. I have a thousand questions, and a thousand more now, but given the time, I want to open the microphone for our fellow Wisdom Keepers. If you have a question or a sharing, now is the time and place. Our questions as hosts can come at the end.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
And how could we not mention this great book by Duane—Choosing Earth. There’s a film that he and Colleen have created, a course they’ve created, and a number of initiatives. This is an extraordinarily powerful book. One of the things I love is he’s given it away—it’s too important to make money off. In the PDF version, all the references are hot-linked, so you can jump into articles and research institutes and go very deep.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin
The one thing I would say, moderating my optimism: this book looks 60 or 70 years into the future, and I’ve been doing futures research for a half century. It’s the accumulation of that work. I want to be optimistic, but it’s fierce. The world is coming down on us now—not ten years from now. We could run through the elements again, but the reality is, we’re up against it now. It requires our courage now. It requires our collective consciousness now. It requires new media to reflect back to us new possibilities, new priorities, new perspectives on where we are, who we are, and where we’re going—now. To those watching: get on with your work. Get on with your life. Choose the freedom you have. Offer your creativity to our wounded world to move into a transforming future.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock
Thank you. I see a hand from Henrik. You can open up your mic.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock: 
I came here curious and I’m going to risk sounding flippant. I’ve heard a lot today—reincarnation, karma, the soul’s path, that we come from a source intelligence. It’s a profound worldview. I came from a Christian background and I’m no longer in that world. What makes you so convinced this is actually real—and not just LSD messing with your heads?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Absolutely—good question. Thank you. I’ll take a shot, then Duane can take a shot.</p>
<p>Ken Ring, founder of near-death studies and the Journal of Near-Death Studies—a longtime friend—pushed me hard on exactly this. Our back-and-forth was so rich we decided to publish it. If you go to Medium, you can find our dialogue titled “Are Deep Psychedelic Experiences Trustable?” How do we know I’m not just picking up echoes of my personal mind or the collective psyche? What are the criteria we can use to evaluate these experiences? I lay it out as clearly as I can; Ken punches at me, I respond. It’s an important question—are they trustable? There isn’t a simple answer. You have to look at it deeply, because it’s not enough to say that experientially they’re trustable—there has to be more meat on the bones.</p>
<p>I think we do have some empirical evidence that certain experiences are verifiable and trustworthy—some of them, not all. Then there are others where cross-disciplinary coherence adds another layer of trustability. I would never say what I said today if I were speaking 30 years ago. If you look at my scholarship—and I know Duane’s—it’s not just that we’re sharing visionary experiences; we’ve done our homework. I don’t offer reincarnation as a philosophical or theoretical perspective based only on experience. I looked at the available evidence for reincarnation. I looked deeply at Stan Grof’s work and the evidence supporting the hypotheses and cosmology he presents in many books. So it’s a combination of rigorous scholarship and carefully recorded psychedelic experiences. And we find the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work is essentially the same as the cosmology that emerges in deep contemplative and mystical traditions. It’s not new—it’s a new way of accessing the same core worldview.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin: 
That’s a really important question. In my book The Living Universe, I spent 30 years looking across cultures and different dimensions of science to ask: is there any agreement across the world’s wisdom traditions about the nature of reality, human identity, and the evolutionary journey—or am I just fantasizing that we’re living in a living entity? There’s a surprisingly strong consensus. If we had more time, I’d love to get into that.</p>
<p>If you want other evidence, I spent three years in a laboratory setting with experiment after experiment exploring the intuitive potentials of human beings—the capacities required to reach into the larger universe and draw insights that Chris has spoken of. I assure you the CIA would not have continued this work for 20 years after declaring it secret unless they were getting meaningful, validated scientific information about our expanded capacities. We can go to different sources of validation and verification—it’s there. We’re just beginning to accumulate that evidence, whether through psychedelic vehicles or meditation. Beautiful question—thank you.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In addition to that dialogue with Ken, you’ll see references at my website, chrisbache.com, and on academia.edu where I’ve posted many major articles. There’s a section from the first chapter of Dark Night, Early Dawn that drills down on this question: the epistemic value of psychedelic experience—the epistemological value. I really lean on that, and hard. Important question.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock: 
I’m hearing a related question: has our collective consciousness gone down rather than up? With reincarnation the idea is we learn and come back, but it feels like earlier cultures—say goddess cultures, Minoans—held very high consciousness. Through materialism, our consciousness seems to have narrowed. How does reincarnation taking us forward fit with an apparent decline in awareness of our living universe?</p>
<p>Duane Elgin: 
I have a very simple response. We’ve only become a collective species—a civilization—over the last few decades with mass media after World War II. We’re becoming a collective entity, a collective being, if you will. That’s not to diminish the wakefulness of earlier peoples and civilizations; it’s to recognize this is a new epoch, a new era, a new condition. The whole human family is being pushed together by multiple crises—climate, species extinction, and more. We’re being compressed and squeezed as a species to awaken in a new way. We didn’t have those pressures in earlier times at a planetary scale. So this is a unique situation—not to diminish the past, but to awaken to the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I’d offer a simple analogy—both in meditation and physiology. If you fast for health, after a day or two you feel flu-like symptoms—miserable—then after several days you move through it and feel better than when you started. Meditation is similar. You quiet your mind—fast your mind—and your unconscious throws up its garbage. It feels worse, not better. If you hold it, it works through, and you move into deeper well-being.</p>
<p>Reincarnation is happening not just individually but collectively. One way to understand the rhythms of our era is that humanity has begun to detoxify itself. Souls are taking into their current incarnation more karma than in earlier generations—stacking up more collective and individual karma to work on in a lifetime. From the outside it can look like we’re devolving because we’re dealing with more basic, elemental problems. But from an evolutionary perspective, we’re getting down to business—healing the past. The only way to heal is to confront it—let it into awareness. We heal the past by expanding consciousness and embracing it; likewise, socially, by manifesting states of awareness where we heal racism, gender-ism, species-ism—by holding them in awareness and saying, We’re not going to do that anymore. We’re moving into a better world. It’s complex, but from a deep enough perspective it begins to make more sense.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock: 
I’d like to add something as a holistic doctor. From a biological perspective, as you see brain development during evolution, trauma—especially collective trauma—has had a major effect. It’s made us less receptive to the collective view, favoring separateness. We’re now waking up from that collective trauma into healing, as you said. Several aspects—biological, social, spiritual—are coming together and giving us deeper insights into these evolutionary swings in recent decades.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock: 
How do we change—how do we move forward and take action?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
When I’m asked that in public lectures, I say: read Duane Elgin’s book. Talk to Duane. This one’s yours.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin: 
Thank you. First, separation is breaking down. Like it or not, we’re being pushed into a sense of unity as a species organism, and we need to step up to address the emergencies surrounding us. Separation has been amplified by a consumerist, materialist mindset—but that mindset is breaking down. It’s creating the crises we face. The first thing is to withdraw legitimacy from that worldview—and we are. Look at young people: a recent global survey showed 57% feel “we’re doomed.” Politicians aren’t saying that; corporate leaders aren’t; typical academics and religious leaders aren’t. But it’s surfacing because it reflects reality: the legitimacy of old institutions is declining. We have an opportunity to choose new pathways—personally, institutionally, collectively.</p>
<p>This is an extraordinary time in human history when we have an interval of freedom to make new choices. I’m 80, and when I was young there wasn’t this freedom. Now there is. This is an awakening time for the human family. Use media and computer systems to create new memes—memes for possibility. That’s what Chris is doing; that’s what I’m doing; and clearly it’s what many here are doing. Keep going—we’re just getting started.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Let me add a footnote. When I was doing my psychedelic work, I never told my students. I taught psychedelic research and Stan Grof’s work, but only a few friends knew I was doing it personally. I had two silos: my psychedelic work, and my ordinary teaching. The deeper I went, the more its effects spilled over into the classroom. Students were being impacted by my journey even though they didn’t know about it. There was a porosity. I began to have access to aspects of their lives; I’d answer a question by reaching into the fertile void of my imagination, and they’d later tell me the answer mirrored exactly what was happening in their lives that week. This rattled me, and I had to study what the hell was going on—how personal work could produce collective manifestations.</p>
<p>I eventually wrote The Living Classroom. It’s really about dynamics of the collective psyche in group states of consciousness. There is no such thing as private realization. States of consciousness are inherently collective. An awakened state naturally distributes around us—like ripples when you throw a rock in a lake. As a person sheds layers of distortion and pain and moves into deeper clarity, people around them are naturally, inevitably affected.</p>
<p>We can accelerate and intensify this contagion. We can meet online and dissolve distances of thousands of miles by bringing our minds together in one space. Psychically, we energize the field of this collective space. If we met once a week for several years, we’d experience an even stronger field—shaped not only by the energy of the group but, per Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic field theory, by all who have ever gathered to study or discuss these issues. I found in my classes that students generated a field; it persisted after they left and was reinforced by subsequent students. Learning happened within semesters and across semesters over years. Psychically, where one of us goes, all of us go—to a degree. And we can reinforce that with technology that supports collective sharing. It doesn’t have to be simply psychic; it can be physical distribution and creativity as well.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Aren’t they just amazing? Young people are so much farther along than we were at their age. When the going gets tough, God sends in the A team. They’re extraordinary in their capacities and drive.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock: 
A question about the “labor pains” and creative intelligence: is it possible that things like COVID and the climate crisis are part of the labor pains—catalysts to bring us into awakening, connection, and a worldwide union of spiritual souls?</p>
<p>Duane Elgin: 
Absolutely yes. The traumas of our time are catalysts for awakening. A trauma isn’t something to avoid but to embrace, learn from, and rise above. We’re being pushed by the traumas of our own creation—species extinction, resource depletion, climate crisis, and more. Our creations are coming back to impact us and push us into a larger sense of who we are as a species and where we’re going. This is part of the labor pains of the birth of a species, a civilization, and a soul.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I agree. You know what we’re seeing going into this century: decade by decade, things are going to get worse—a deeper unraveling, a falling apart. Some of it we can anticipate; some we can’t. It’s going to hurt like hell. But these are problems of our own making, which means we’ll have to confront in ourselves what made them.</p>
<p>And remember who is confronting this crisis: souls. Each human carries multiple incarnations woven into psyche and body—potentially thousands of years of experience. Some of that is negative and destructive; much of it is mature and wise. If the world is at odds with itself, so are we. We have to come to terms with our own limitations. What’s happening in the world mirrors what’s happening intrapsychically. The world is trying to become one, confronting the limitations of its past; we carry those tendencies inside us. As the world struggles to become one, we struggle to become coherent within ourselves—to become one soul. There’s a synergy there. The drivers of global systems crisis, climate change, and diseases are driving a global awakening and, simultaneously, an internal awakening. It’s a both/and situation.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Good question. Duane, you’re asking us to put it on the line here—give us three specific things you want to take. The first one, golly—</p>
<p>Duane Elgin: I’m going to give one that I think you’ll be surprised by. Early on I was going to be a doctor—I was thinking about being a vet or a physician—and one thing I do when I look at the world and how we humans are creating it is watch animal rescue videos. If you go online—dog rescues, animal rescues—it just breaks the heart open, and love for the well-being of all life, not just human life, floods into your heart, your soul, your mind, your consciousness. When you look at the suffering of animals and say, “It could be better. It doesn’t have to be like that,” it pushes back against us. So number one, I would say: go online and look at how animals are suffering. This goes beyond whether we eat meat or not. It’s about life and how it’s being lived by the other creatures on this Earth we share. It’s really powerful.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I agree. The first thing that came into my mind was: take some suffering out of the world. Look at our lives—how we’re impacting and causing suffering—and take it out, not only between human beings, leading toward a gentler, clearer life, but also toward other species. In Buddhist practice, the first thing you do when you begin any meditation is cultivate bodhicitta, the aspiration to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for yourself. The last thing you do is the distribution of merit: you give away all the merit generated to all levels of being. This shatters the illusion of individual enlightenment. It’s not about personal transformation; it’s about collective transformation.</p>
<p>And in terms of taking suffering out of the world—Duane, how could you not mention your work, Voluntary Simplicity, your first book? This is common sense for a world living beyond its means. Simpler—not to starve or deny yourself, but to liberate and integrate yourself, to give yourself options you don’t have if you’re committed to complexity and affluence. So: gentler, shared, and simpler.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin: Great question about media as well. The Choosing Earth Project—choosingearth.org—is attempting to build networks of care and compassion for the well-being of all life. That’s explicit in our work: not just for humans, but for all life. We rise or fall together. Let’s build relationships of awareness, compassion, and love on behalf of all life. It’s exploding onto the Earth right now—countless avenues for tapping into creativity, consciousness, care. We need to meet the opportunity that’s available, and I’m thinking of young people too—how far along this path they are relative to us “olders.” And by the way, I don’t think Chris is anywhere near 80—he’s a kid on the block.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: In the broader sense, beyond specific media, this transformation is going to take all the skills and capacities we have. It’s going to take doctors, social activists, educators, politicians, artists, musicians. If we start making an itemized list of what we “should” do, we inevitably shrink it to something reflecting our personal strengths or agendas. I don’t think the hard part is figuring out what we can do. The hard part is finding the courage to do what we already know we can do, right here, right now. We’re already standing where we’ve chosen to stand as our awareness comes online. Do we have the courage to act without delay? Each of us will do different things—different aptitudes, agendas, karmic trajectories. We don’t need to do what someone else is doing; we need to do what we can do, as deeply as we can. In that lies deep existential satisfaction—to come to the end of our life and know we did our part. That’s what we want, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yeah, I don’t doubt that what you’re asking about—living beyond the need for a dense physical form—is a potential that can be actualized over the long arc of evolution. But my focus has been different. We’re coming out of a 5,000-year period with a transcendent orientation—the Axial Age religions. We began to have experiential access to the Mother Universe—through meditation, yoga, psychedelics—and when we got there we encountered joy, bliss, ecstasy: “This is home.” That leads to a story of the fall and salvation to get back home. The goal becomes leaving here—valuing transcendence over immanence, spirit over body.</p>
<p>But in the 20th and 21st centuries, science has pulled back the curtain and shown how old and vast the universe is—measured in billions of light years, filled with genius. It doesn’t have the same appeal to say the goal is to leave it behind. My work—really not “my” work, I just let the universe speak—has emphasized embodying spirituality, transforming the body, bringing spirit deeper into the body so it literally changes our biochemistry, allows us to be healthier and live longer. Sri Aurobindo thought it would take 300 years of continuous spiritual practice before we could begin to become biologically self-regenerating—basically live indefinitely in a human body. The body doesn’t have to break down, but we have to increase the energy within it. First we have to extend life expectancy to give us those 300 years to do the practice. His vision is doing more and more spiritual work inside the beauty of the physical universe—becoming co-creators with it. Are there aspects that are purely transcendental? Sure—why not? How many physical universes are there? We don’t know. We know we don’t know how big the arena is that we can incarnate into.</p>
<p>Duane Elgin: Wonderful question. I’d point out that even though our universe is 13.8 billion years old, in cosmic time that’s just an instant. My sense is that in addition to our universe, we’re embedded within the life force of a Mother Universe—our universe is a daughter universe within the spaciousness of a Mother Universe. The Mother Universe is unbounded dimensionally. Here we are living in the second, third, fourth dimensions—just a couple of steps above a black hole—we’re just getting started. Three, four dimensions are nothing compared to the depth of the Mother Universe. A body is very useful if you’re confined to two, three, four dimensions—get a body for that. But if you’re living in the context of the Mother Universe, where aliveness goes vastly beyond into 200, 300, 400 dimensions—who knows what kind of vehicle is most fitting? We’re early in the evolutionary game. Let’s embrace our physicality, knowing that further on lies the transcendent possibility of hyper-dimensionality and new forms of being, learning, loving, and living.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock: I invite one more question, and then I have to be strict as a moderator.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: May I make a different suggestion? I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the group. Duane and I have been carrying the weight of some of the discussion, but what an extraordinary group this is. Each of you has come into this moment with a long history of development, and the minds, bodies, and awareness you brought made this conversation what it became. I express deep appreciation not only to Bas and Mayo, but to all of you for coming together, for holding these questions, for holding this driving force that’s taking us all forward. Thank you—so very much.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock: Sending love from this space to all—it’s all felt as a community, dear family. Thank you for your contributions and donations as a gift. Beautiful energy is coming to the Choosing Earth Project. Let’s go on together as a family, and see each other along the way. Thank you for joining, and love from this space. Thank you, Chris and Duane, for your work and your wisdom. Thank you.</p>
<p>Bas de Cock: Bye-bye, everybody.</p></body></html>

Regina Meredith welcomes philosopher and religious-studies scholar **Christopher Bache** for an

exploration of his twenty-year odyssey with 73 high-dose LSD sessions. Bache recounts the strict

protocol he followed, the alternating agony and ecstasy of ego dissolution, and the vast

transpersonal realms he encountered—from archetypal feminine identity to collective human

suffering, cosmic architects, and visionary glimpses of humanity’s evolutionary future. He

describes the “diamond soul” awaiting birth within the species, explains how karma operates across

lifetimes, and reflects on the global crisis as a multi-decade rite of passage toward higher

consciousness. Throughout, Bache emphasizes that psychedelics are merely amplifiers; it is

consciousness itself that drives transformation. The conversation offers both cautionary notes on

extreme psychedelic practice and an inspiring vision of humanity’s potential.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Hi, everybody. We’re about to have a phenomenal conversation with

**Christopher Bache**, whom I consider a hero for undertaking a journey most of us could not

withstand—73 carefully structured LSD sessions to probe the nature of consciousness. Welcome,

Christopher.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Hi, Regina. It’s good to see you.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** After reading your book *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, everyone asks the

same thing halfway through: why did you keep going? You endured pain so intense it sometimes took

months to recover, yet you returned again and again. Why?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Looking back, it was probably foolish to push so hard, but I was young and

driven. Trained as a philosopher of religion, I wanted to understand the deep structure of reality.

When I discovered Stan Grof’s protocol, I decided to pursue it relentlessly. Each bout of

suffering was followed by breakthroughs of ecstatic bliss and profound insight—rewards that far

outweighed the pain.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Your first phase was the “death of ego,” and you wondered, *What was I

thinking?* Describe that initial dissolution.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** To reach broader consciousness you must surrender the narrow bandwidth of

body-mind ego. Whether gradual or sudden, that identity must shatter. Once it does, awareness

expands into deeper registers. Over a long journey you die many deaths, but the first ego death is

the gateway from time-space identity into spiritual reality.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Later you became a woman—experiencing life, birth, and connection from a

female perspective. How did that change you?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** About two-and-a-half years in, the universe forced me to perceive solely

through a feminine identity—the opposite of my male academic self. At first it was terrifying; then

an ecstatic world opened. I became hundreds of women under the Great Mother’s arm. Gender roles

dissolved, preparing me for realms where gender doesn’t exist.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Session 11 plunged you into archetypal mass suffering—war, violence, horror.

What did that teach you?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** The pivotal vision was the *killing of the children*, awakening soul-level

compassion. I learned that historical trauma is buried in the collective psyche much as personal

trauma lodges in the individual. My sessions shifted: I was no longer the patient; some aspect of

humanity was being healed through me.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Today many see current conflicts as “end times.” From your vantage, how do you

interpret this era?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** In 1995 I experienced humanity’s death-and-rebirth: a global systems crisis

triggered by escalating ecological breakdown. I wasn’t shown dates or specific events, only a long

period of destabilization that forces spiritual evolution. Current turmoil is just the overture of

decades of deepening challenge that will birth the future human.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Session 15 revealed karma in action. What did you see?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Beyond theory, I witnessed my entire life—beginning to end—as a completed

whole, embedded in a karmic fabric with everyone around me. Choices ripple through time; our task

is to respond skillfully within that meaningful weave.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky just claimed free will is an illusion. Your

thoughts?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** That view rests on a 19th-century deterministic metaphysics. Quantum

reality values indeterminacy. Yes, much of our psychology is conditioned, yet within conditioning

we choose—and those choices can increase or decrease conditioning.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** You define the soul as “a story of individual consciousness ultimately sourced

in cosmic intelligence, moving between physical universe and metaverse.” Can you expand?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** The soul is a center of integration collecting experiences across all

lifetimes. Its essence is the same light that is the essence of the totality. Our evolutionary

challenge now is to awaken that soul *inside* time and space—what I call the birth of the diamond

soul.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** You paused for six years at your wife’s request, then resumed at the exact

point you’d left off.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Yes. The work restarted in the same ocean of suffering, then vaulted into a

crash course in cosmology—encounters with vast pre-temporal beings whose actions shape time and

space.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Tell us about those galaxy-sized beings.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** They were unimaginably ancient, more real than time-space—archetypal

architects of creation. Human experience, even male–female polarity, expresses their intentions.

Our minds are fractal sparks within a species mind, nested in planetary, solar, and galactic

intelligence.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** You saw reincarnation as collective purification.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Exactly. Individual journeys are facets of a species-wide evolution. We

incarnate in historical waves to heal unfinished business together.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Many assume oneness is the final goal. You discovered otherwise.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Oneness is foundational—awakening compassion and revealing our true nature—

but evolution continues. The universe has billions of years of creativity ahead. My final visions

hinted at futures that sound like science fiction.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Please share.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** The future human—the diamond soul—embodies healed heart, expansive mind, and

radically enhanced senses. In my 73rd session I experienced “diamond vision,” seeing with

thousand-fold clarity. Humanity is a hothouse for consciousness that may ultimately seed other

worlds.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Sessions 71–73 showed that the human vehicle is built for rapid

transformation.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Individual learning accumulates in a deeper collective structure. Periodic

shifts in that “plate tectonics of the psyche” re-basement all future incarnations. We are entering

one now.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Final thoughts?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Psychedelics are just amplifiers. Consciousness does the work. Many

pathways—meditation, prayer, service—lead to the same depths. Use whatever method safely opens your

heart and mind.

**REGINA MEREDITH:** Christopher, thank you. I look forward to continuing this in the studio.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Thank you, Regina. I do too.

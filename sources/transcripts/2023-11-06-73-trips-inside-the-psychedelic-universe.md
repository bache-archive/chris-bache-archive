**Regina Meredith: ** Chris, hi everybody. We're going to have a phenomenal conversation in just a moment here with Christopher Bache, who I consider to be—and I know he'll be blushing if I say this, but really a hero of our times for being willing to take on a journey that most of us would not be able to withstand, to find out about the nature of consciousness, the mind of the universe. In his book, *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, he shares with us his experiences of some, I think, 73 different journeys he did with a very prescribed protocol and with someone sitting with him and protecting him over decades to be able to journey sequentially further and further out into what the future of humanity looks like. So here we go. Meet Christopher Bache, if you don't already know him. Hello, Christopher. It's so good to see you. How are you?

**Chris Bache: ** I'm doing well, thank you. I say that very sincerely. After reading your book, and from the other people who I know who've read your book as well, the question that comes up about halfway through is, why in the world did he continue when you went through that much pain, that much suffering, enough that it took months, even a year, to recover from a journey? But you would come back. You were relentless in your search. So to just set it up briefly for people, what made you do this? You're a professor of theology and philosophy. What made you go on this journey starting way back when?

**Chris Bache: ** At first, I think it was a foolish strategy to push it as hard as I did, but I didn't know any better at the time, or I was young and naive. I was trained as a philosopher of religion with a passionate desire to understand the deep structure of the universe. I had studied some of the great minds in our Western philosophical and Eastern traditions. When I found this methodology that Stan made available, I just decided to push it as long and as hard as I could. There was a great deal of suffering on it, episodically and periodically. But at the end of every episode of intense suffering, there would be a breakthrough into an episode of deep, ecstatic bliss and deep transpersonal encounter, and the value of those insights and that ecstasy balanced out, more than balanced out, the transient episodes of suffering.

**Regina Meredith: ** In the beginning, when you first started the journey, the very beginning part was what you title in the book. It took you 20 years or so, after all these experiences, to finally write this book and put it out for the rest of us. It was called the death of the ego. While you were in the midst of it, you were saying, "What was I thinking?" So let's just set it up with what that very first phase was. And we only have about 45 minutes, so people are going to have to read the book themselves. We're going to hopscotch through the phases you went through. But let's start with, "What was I thinking?" What happens upon the dissolution of the ego?

**Chris Bache: ** If you want to allow your consciousness to expand into the broader dimensions, the deeper dimensions of consciousness, you must surrender the narrow bandwidth of your individual body, mind, and ego. This happens slowly or fast, convulsively or smoothly, but that identity that we hold has to be shattered, has to be destroyed. When it's destroyed, then your consciousness naturally expands into a deeper register, a wider spectrum of consciousness. If your journey continues repeatedly, as we'll get to, you go through many such death sequences, but it's not repeating the original ego death. The original ego death is kind of the first transition from your time-space identity into a deeper spiritual experience of the universe.

**Regina Meredith: ** Thank you for that. And on the subject of death, as you come to say toward the end of the book, you relished the death process. By the end, death was something you looked forward to in each one of these journeys, because it freed you so much from all of the constraints in terms of consciousness. And so we'll build up to that. But one of the phases you went through was you became a woman. You started experiencing the life birthing all these elements of being a woman, which was part of your identity, being a male, to be an academic, and so forth. What was your experience? What did that do to you when you suddenly connected with the female experience after being male?

**Chris Bache: ** About two and a half years into my journey, about 10 or 11 sessions in, the universe put me into the situation where I could experience nothing except from within a feminine identity. It was a feminine form, a womanly form that was the exact opposite of my own male, academic, intellectually oriented form. It was totally terrifying to experience myself being me, but not being me within any framework that I'd ever known before, and it snapped me. When I let go and yielded, then I became hundreds, potentially thousands, of women and was given a journey into the world of women under the arm of the great mother. It was an ecstatic experience, a wonderful experience. In fact, when it opened, I thought, "What was I so afraid of? Why was I afraid of this? This is marvelous." What the universe was doing was teaching me that where I was going, gender does not exist. So all gender, all roles based on gender, and any aspect of my historical personality had to be surrendered if I were going to experience more intimately what is there in the universe.

**Regina Meredith: ** So I would ask you this on behalf of the men and women watching this: What was the most either terrifying or irritating and difficult part initially of being confronted with a woman's reality?

**Chris Bache: ** The most terrifying part in the beginning was it just wasn't my reality. It was a reality, but it wasn't my reality, and I couldn't get out of it. I was trapped within a feminine mode of experience that just wasn't me. There was nothing inherently frightening about it. Then when I let go and flowed with that experience, it was like having half of the human race open to me that had not been open to me before. Now, I believe in reincarnation, and I believe we've been men and women many times, so there's nothing foreign in that way. This was different. This was kind of opening almost into, I don't want to say, an archetypal dimension of womanhood, but certainly to the collective life being lived by women in history, in time. So the joy was just to experience a whole different way of being alive than I had known as Chris Bache, as the academic, as the male.

**Regina Meredith: ** Engaging in academic conversation, and here you're dealing with a very different kind of connection and flow between women. I thought that was fascinating. It's an interesting part of your book.

**Chris Bache: ** I wish every man could have an experience like this. It truly changes things profoundly.

**Regina Meredith: ** And the other way around. Women should have the other so we understand what each other is contending with in our bodies, in this reality. So let's move forward to session 11. Much has happened since then. Time has passed, of course, but when we go into session 11, it really becomes about archetypal, deep mass suffering that you had to go through, witness, and experience. If you could tell us what that body of collective memory felt like and what it looked like to you, that would be helpful, because we're still in it.

**Chris Bache: ** My transition from an ego death process, which is very personal, related to what came over the next two years. It was a series of excruciatingly difficult, horrendous waves of vast landscapes of human suffering, war, violence, just unimaginable suffering. It was transitioned by an experience called the killing of the children. I just want to mention that, because it's an important signal in between those two. I had this experience of being an old woman confronting soldiers who were just killing thousands and thousands of children, just smashing their heads on rocks—a terrible, terrible ordeal. I think this experience was given to prepare me for what was going to come, this ocean of suffering phase. It awakened a depth of compassion in me, which I think was embedded at a soul level, to prepare me to take on the work, which is something my soul had chosen to do in this lifetime. What I learned was that just as individual trauma gets buried in our individual psyche and can compromise our individual health, the trauma of history is buried in the collective psyche of humanity. So anything which is not resolved by the species, that any one generation accumulates in these massive memory structures that I call metacoic systems. And what I think was happening was that something guiding my sessions began to use my sessions in order to confront, absorb, and transmute vast territories of collective anguish that were embedded in the collective psyche, meaning the patient stopped being Chris Bache, and in some way, the patient became some aspect of the human species.

**Regina Meredith: ** So with that, I want to ask you about something that's happening currently. We have all this going on in the Middle East between Palestine and Israel, and we have collective side taking, we have collective anger, depression, anxiety all occurring. We have a propensity toward people who have proclivities toward prophecy to look at this as the End Times, whether it's a Christian community waiting for rapture, or whether it's conspiracy groups saying, "No, this is a planned end time for humanity." We get into these End Times stories that start circulating. But I want to ask you, having been through what you went through, you have this overlay to it in your psyche that I'd like to know about. Could you tell us how you see these times laid into what you went through?

**Chris Bache: ** Jumping many years ahead in my work, I summarized my experiences of our time in history, what's happening underneath the surface, where we're going, in a chapter called The Birth of the Future Human. There I was given a number of visions over many years of humanity coming to a turning point, humanity coming to a spiritual breakthrough, an evolutionary turning point, a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. And then eventually, in 1995, was taken in a very deep experience, dissolved into the species mind, dissolved into what I call deep time, being taken into the future, where I experienced a death and rebirth process of the human family, altogether, not as an individual, but the death and rebirth of humanity. It was a global systems crisis that seemed to be precipitated by a series of escalating ecological crises. Beyond that, I wasn't given any details about it. I wasn't given dates. I wasn't given any specifics—nothing about artificial intelligence, nothing about a third world war, nothing like that, just the experience of the human family going through a prolonged period of absolute loss of control and a collapse of everything they had considered the normal and necessary goods or standards of their world. Ever since that time, I've lived with this awareness. For me, it's not a projected fantasy. It's not something I envisioned. It's something I experienced. So for me, I don't question the truth of it. I experience this period of history as a period of increasing destabilization and increasing escalation of conflicts and breaking down all our norms—conflict between races, conflict between religions, conflict between sexes, between classes—all the tremendous things that we've been doing to each other, terrible things over thousands and thousands of years. We have to go beyond where we are and grow spiritually into the next form that's emerging, I think, in an evolutionary sense, in the human. So I think this is what we're going into. That's why we're beginning to experience so much destabilization. I think what's happening now is not, in any way, a final or turning point, or any final register. I think we're in a process which will continue to deepen for decades to come. This is, I think, just the overture of what's coming. The terrible events unfolding in the Middle East, in many African countries, in the United States—these are bringing to the surface age-old hatreds, and we have to transform these hatreds. I don't offer any political or social solution to the events we're looking at. My perspective is not at the ground level. My perspective is from far above the Earth, looking at the long evolutionary trajectory.

**Regina Meredith: ** Thank you for that incredibly thoughtful and articulate answer. And now, what we'll do, because we did jump ahead a bit there, is work our way back toward some other things in there. Let's go back now to session 15, where you learned about karma, because all of this has karma embedded in it. You learned about the essence of karma. Tell us what you learned about karma at that time.

**Chris Bache: ** I was an academic and a professor of religious studies, so I had an intellectual understanding of karma, which is simply cause and effect generated by choices that we make. There are physical cause and effect processes, and there are psychological cause and effect processes. In traditional karmic thought, every choice we make sets in motion a series of events, which eventually we receive the consequences of. We receive the effects of. By receiving the effects of our choices, we learn from those choices, and we make a new set of choices. What I learned in session 15 wasn't so much a theoretical interpretation of karma, because I had that. It was seeing and being shown the karma of my particular life. I went through a series of sessions for a year where I experienced the entirety of my life, from beginning to end, as a happening, as a totality, as a finished, complete totality. This was my first entry into what I came to call deep time. In that context, when I looked at relationships, the people around me, and the issues I was working with in my professional life, I could see how deeply embedded they were in a deeper series of karmic, causal processes. My position in history was not accidental. The people I was with were not accidental. It was a meaningful fabric. Then the question became simply, how do you respond most effectively to a meaningful fabric that your life is part of?

**Regina Meredith: ** That brings us to something that I wasn't going to ask you about, but it seems like the right point. Two days ago, a book was released by Dr. Robert Sapolsky, and it has to do with the science of living with no free will. The title is something like that. Essentially, he came to the conclusion that there is no such thing as making a decision in free will, that we're machines, and we cannot lay anything that we do upon ourselves any more than we would any other machine. I would love for you to respond to that.

**Chris Bache: ** Well, I haven't read that book, of course, but that's a familiar position among philosophers, and it derives from a vision of the universe which is based upon a 19th-century metaphysics, which sees the universe as a deterministic machine, with all parts determined by the larger movement of the whole, and we have no freedom. But I think that's a deeply outmoded and outdated vision of reality. We're now looking at a quantum world. We're in a world that values indeterminacy; there's much more flexibility in the system than we had thought before. 96% of the entirety of reality is dark matter or dark energy, and we don't know anything about it. I think if we just step back, it's clear that much of our psychological life is highly conditioned, but within that conditioned context, we make choices, and those choices can increase the conditioning or reduce it, and we can increase our freedom. But nobody exists in pure, absolute freedom, except perhaps the fully enlightened beings. But we can increase freedom by skillful choices.

That also gives you access to insider commentary, my live book club, and other live events with special guests. So join in. Thanks. I was very disturbed because the media picked right up on this, and he got a loud speaker off of this one. I thought, this is so archaic and essentially saying we have no self-responsibility either. Yes, we can't take credit for the best of us, but we also don't take credit for the worst of ourselves. We have no part in what we do, acting as machines. I thought, like you, how outdated is this, considering the quantum reality that we're becoming aware of? So one thing I wanted to read out of your book, because your talk feeds into it, is the notion of us having a soul, something that transcends this physical reality, which that author does not recognize, by the way. So when at the end of the karma, it says energy started must simply complete itself, and that's the nature of karma. Then I go into this area that I chose, where you're defining the soul itself. Because a lot of people wonder, "What is it I'm made of?" At the most etheric, most sublime part of myself, you say it's a story of individual consciousness ultimately sourced in the creative intelligence of the cosmos, systematically moving back and forth between the physical universe and a surround Metaverse in a long journey of self-development. I think that's one of the best definitions of soul, and the one I probably relate most strongly to in my own system of understanding. Anything you'd like to add to that so people can understand that this soul is here for expansion, experience, choice, and anything you’d like to add to that, in terms of what you came to understand is what our soul is and what it's here to do?

**Chris Bache: ** Just as we have a center of integration that integrates all of our experiences from this lifetime—though we're not quite sure how to describe that or what it is, we know what it feels like—the soul is a center of integration that integrates all of our experiences from all of our lifetimes and our times in between. It is a learning system continuously growing, expanding, and deepening. If we ask what the essence of that consciousness is, classic spiritual traditions have said the essence of every individual, the soul, is the essence of the totality. Atman is Brahman. The essence of the soul is the essence of the Divine. For me, in my deepest experience, the form of the soul and all reality is light—not as we experience it in the physical world, but a much more profound form of light. It is light that is self-aware and learning over vast epochs of time. I think we are coming to a transformation that's going to change us. I think we are actually giving birth to the soul inside time and space. Usually, we die, we expand to the soul, we incarnate, we contract to ego, and if we keep that up for a few hundred thousand years, sooner or later, the soul, the integrated consciousness we return to when we die, wakes up inside the individual human being. That's what I call the birth of the diamond soul. I think that is the challenge we are facing in this century. We no longer have the luxury of running this planet based on the psychological structure of the individual ego. The ego is a magnificent entity, but it's limited, cut off from each other and the larger universe. We need to grow up fast, and in this case, growing up is to awaken to the soul that we already are but haven't experienced fully inside time and space.

**Regina Meredith: ** Well, that's an understatement. Yes, we do need to wake up fast. And so now we come to a point where you had a session, and after that you did not have another one for six years. You quit for six years. Just briefly, a synopsis of the session, why you stopped for six years, and what happened when you picked it back up. Because that's the fascinating part to me.

**Chris Bache: ** I stopped for six years because my wife, who was my sitter, asked me to—too many things were coming up out of my sessions that were very novel and disruptive, and she just wanted the whole thing to slow down, and she asked me to stop. So I did. And when I resumed, I always knew I would resume, and when I did, I had my wife’s support, and she continued to be my sitter through all the remaining sessions. So it was a husband-wife negotiation.

**Regina Meredith: ** Yes. And the other part I found interesting is that when you picked it back up six years later, you're being picked up at the exact same spot you left off.

**Chris Bache: ** That was striking because I was in the middle of the ocean of suffering work. So I was in horrendous suffering six years later—different period of my life, different expectations, different astrological aspects. My sessions began exactly where it had stopped and continued to deepen the ocean of suffering for another year. Meanwhile, in the ecstatic portion of my sessions, when I had stopped, I was experiencing the whole of my life, from start to finish. Boom. Now I left all that behind, and I was going into subtle structure reality, and being given a crash course in cosmology, how the universe works.

**Regina Meredith: ** And then we start going to lessons 25, 26. I was absolutely fascinated. I was trying to read into it through my own lens and filter of understanding. You were out in the cosmos, and you started encountering vast beings, vast beings that were almost like galaxies in themselves. None of us have ever seen this or felt this or experienced this. Maybe just give us a glimpse into what seemed to be the makeup of these beings. But the thing that fascinated me was that you said these beings live through humanity, experience through humanity, love through humanity. Fill us in.

**Chris Bache: ** I've often had reservations about that particular line in my sessions, but I kept it in because it's in my original notes. When the ocean of suffering came to a culmination, it exploded me into a deeper level of consciousness. The distinctive quality of this level of consciousness is two things: it was incredibly old, ancient beyond anything I'd ever imagined before—very, very old—and it was more real than time and space. I was being catapulted into what I eventually came to understand as archetypal reality, a level of reality that historically exists before time and space, which contributes some of the fundamental structures of both. The vision here is that all of reality emerges out of a primal one, which starts as a void and manifests in the form of the Big Bang. But in between the one and even the Big Bang, there are many gradations of being, many unfoldings that take place of the Divine—though I don't like to use that word because we have so many connotations. There are many layers, and our lower levels are sourced in the actions of higher levels. I was encountering these—whether to call them beings or principles, vast beings. Other people have experienced them too because I think it's a universal structure we're bumping into. The best my mind could do to give it form was to see them as galaxies because I've watched the Hubble telescope and the James Webb, and we see these galaxies that are billions of light years across, so big we can hardly even imagine them. My mind was using those images just to give a picture to these beings that were not galaxies, but they have that massive scale. These beings were part of the process of creation, creating time and space and some structures within time and space. Far, far down the line, we have human beings. The insight here was that in some way, all human beings—and actually, all existence—was an expression of the intentions of these deeper cosmological principles and beings. In some way, I'm not sure that I got all the pieces lined up correctly, but I do think all human experience—male, female, all versions—are aspects of a species intelligence, and that species intelligence is an aspect of a planetary, solar system, and galactic intelligence. There's a way in which these deeper intelligences manifest as our lives, and they are experiencing the world as we experience it, and they're experiencing the adventures we are having as we have them.

**Regina Meredith: ** That would bring us to the question then that our experiences, and again, we're all watching this through our mind, our egoic lens, all the filters of our past. Each one of us is hearing this in our own way, but it makes us wonder if we're kind of the end result of these vast systems of consciousness, intelligence, desire, and creativity. How much of what we're expressing in the world is sovereign at all?

**Chris Bache: ** When I experience this embeddedness in these higher orders of creation, I never experienced it as manipulative, and I never experienced it as representing a compromise of my individual agenda or freedom. I experience this downward flow of causation as part of a profound, gracious, compassionate, intelligent process, giving me—and all of us—opportunities to grow and develop that we might not otherwise have. We live in a conditioned universe at levels upon levels, and at the same time, it's a creative universe constantly manifesting new levels, new things emerging from our deep structure. I experienced this as seeing a complexity that had always been there but I hadn't appreciated before. Whatever is happening has always been the way it's happening. It's just that we're beginning to be aware of what's happening.

**Regina Meredith: ** Thank you. That gives each one of us pause. We could just go over this piece repeatedly to try to get our minds around the vastness of it. Thank you for that, and also for sharing that it was filled with grace. I very much appreciate that part of the story. Another one we move on to is purification through reincarnation. But we're looking at groups of people, tribal epochs, periods of history involved when we're looking at reincarnation and purification through groups throughout history. Can you talk about what that looks like a little bit?

**Chris Bache: ** Well, my focus was not on groups of people but on all of humanity. When I moved into the archetypal domain, I encountered these cosmic archetypes and was then dropped into more of a Jungian level of archetypal reality. I experienced all of humanity repeatedly as a single organism, and I was shown that each of our minds were like a fractal spark within a species mind, each of our bodies were cells within an integrated human body. There was a continuous flowback system from the whole of humanity into each of us individually, and then the choices we were making flowed back into the collective, very similar to Rupert Sheldrake's morphic fields theory.

**Regina Meredith: ** We tend to incarnate during different periods of history to purify a previous period of history, but we’re doing it together as a species, you know, as almost tribal geographic groups.

**Chris Bache: ** One of the things that happened in this period is that I began to have certain visionary experiences of the entire human species incarnating as a single organism, and each of our individual lives were cells within that organism. Previously, I had written a book on reincarnation and always thought of reincarnation as the story of the individual's soul journey towards enlightenment. But now I saw all of our individual journeys as an aspect of this collective journey. What each of us were dealing with was not just personal; it was also collective. It wasn't just this century. It was an expression of something taking place in a larger pattern. I think I was given this teaching, which went on for years, to prepare me for what was beginning to unfold: a deeper vision of where humanity is in its evolutionary story, the challenges we're beginning to face, and the death and rebirth involved in the birth of the next iteration of human consciousness, soul, consciousness, diamond soul.

**Regina Meredith: ** We're going to get to the diamond soul in just a moment. I have one more question I wanted to ask before that because this is a big one for a lot of people watching. You had assumptions about reincarnation—as we all have assumptions about everything—and this has been your life's path. Many people watching this have in common with your previous belief that to reach oneness is the end of the road. The notion of oneness is the end of the journey. Can you tell us what you discovered when you finally found that oneness?

**Chris Bache: ** Oneness is a profound truth. It is an absolutely foundational, profound truth, which is a seminal understanding running through all the world's spiritual traditions. It's a bedrock because oneness brings us in touch with our essential nature, beneath the variability of our surface nature. Oneness generates deep compassion. When you experience oneness, you become naturally gentle with everyone around you, including yourself. You'll be compassionate beyond measure. And to experience oneness is a profound step in our spiritual journey. But I don't think it's the end step. Sometimes the end step is described as dissolving into the primal void that precedes even the manifestation of the physical universe. But in my experience, even that is not the end step.

**Regina Meredith: ** You said it does not exhaust all cosmological truths.

**Chris Bache: ** Yes, and oneness is a profound stage in our development, but the universe has been evolving for 13.7 billion years. It's going to continue evolving for billions and billions of years. An individual and a species awakening to the truth of oneness is a profound turning point in their life, but evolution continues, and challenges continue. It's not simply that we achieve oneness and become spiritually realized, then leave the planet and go into some kind of off-planet paradise. Oneness is a profound stage in our journey. I would sound like science fiction if I tried to share some things I've been shown about the magnificent being that humanity is evolving into.

**Regina Meredith: ** Please go there. This audience is open to science fiction.

**Chris Bache: ** The future human, which I think we are in the process of giving birth to in history, I have described as the birth of the diamond soul. The future human is not just a human being with an open heart, a healed heart, and an expanded heart that holds the entire world in compassion. It's not just an open mind able to commune deeply with the intelligence of the cosmos and incarnate that intelligence within their own being. It actually transforms the fundamental physiology of our body and our sensory experience. We tend to have a mechanistic understanding of sensation: light comes into the eyes, the brain processes, senses touch—it's all very mechanical. But in my sessions, it's not quite that simple. The more consciousness we consolidate—not just consciousness from experience over thousands of years but over vast timescales—it not only heals our hearts and opens our minds but also enlivens our senses. Our visual experience is becoming hundreds of times more sensitive than normal today. Our taste, touch, sexuality—all the physical senses are in the process of being transformed.

**Regina Meredith: ** You had an experience where you didn't understand what was going on initially. As I recall from your book, you were looking at something, but it didn't look as you normally saw it. I think you were looking at your hands. Is that correct?

**Chris Bache: ** Yes, it was the very last session, the 73rd session, and I was about five hours in. I was given an experience I call diamond vision. Suddenly, my vision was a thousand times sharper than I had ever known. I could discriminate colors, shades, and textures. I looked at my hands and could see every pore and every hair follicle. It was amazingly detailed. I could see dust floating in the air with precision and count leaves on a tree. Then after about ten minutes, it disappeared, and I returned to ordinary vision. That's when I understood I was seeing through the eyes of the future human. The future human involves a transformation of our physical sensations, as our existence is being polished and brought forward into deeper forms of manifestation by the universe.

**Regina Meredith: ** This is beautiful. In sessions 71 through 73, you were shown that our human vehicle is designed for rapid transformation. Please expand on that before we close.

**Chris Bache: ** In the 70th vision, I was given what I consider the last great vision of my journey. In that journey, I was taken deeply into deep time and given three core experiences. One experience revealed how humanity is built for accelerated evolution. We have the surface of our being through reincarnation; we incarnate, learn, grow, and change. But underneath the incarnating self is a deeper structure holding all our incarnational memories and serving as a fundamental blueprint from within which we act. All of humanity grows and changes. There is a structure to the collective psyche holding and storing this information. Periodically, that deeper structure undergoes what I call a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. It's the genius of creation that we learn at an individual level, but it's collected at a deeper level. That deeper level changes, and after it transforms, all individual experiences are based on that changed psyche. After the birth of the future human, all future incarnations will operate out of this transformed collective psyche. It's an ongoing, continuous, evolving process.

**Regina Meredith: ** Over the last 20 years, I've interviewed many people, some channeling beings from other times and spaces, and repeatedly I've heard that humanity is moving toward an expansive being that operates through the heart center. This species will model for other species throughout the universes. Did you see it that way too?

**Chris Bache: ** There was one line in all of my sessions that suggested something like that. I intuited that Earth was a hothouse growing a form of consciousness that would, in time, be exported to other solar systems in our galaxy. I don't think we're the origin of all life, and there is evolution taking place in highly developed forms elsewhere. But here, we seem to be growing something destined for more than just Earth.

**Regina Meredith: ** I just wanted to say you have validation from other sources for that information. We just have to navigate through these times. I can't thank you enough for the courage it took you. We didn't discuss what you went through, but I mean, we're talking about life-wrecking consequences from taking such high doses of LSD, which you now say was really insane to have done. Thank you for pulling through it.

**Chris Bache: ** Yes, I truly do not recommend it. I'd be much gentler if doing it again, and I recommend a gentler protocol for anyone working with psychedelics.

**Regina Meredith: ** Yes, and you say that repeatedly in the book. I recommend people dive into it, as we've only touched a few places in this story of the collective human being. Any final thoughts?

**Chris Bache: ** First, thank you for helping bring this work forward. Psychedelics are simply a protocol, a modern methodology for accessing deep states of consciousness. They're not important; they're merely amplifiers. It's consciousness that does the work. So I would de-emphasize the psychedelics and emphasize the consciousness they amplify.

**Regina Meredith: ** And there are many ways to reach that. Christopher, thank you so much. I look forward to meeting you at the Gaia Studios to fill in some pieces we couldn't cover today.

**Chris Bache: ** Okay. Thank you, Regina. I look forward to that too.

**Regina Meredith: ** Thank you, everyone. The book, "LSD and the Mind of the Universe" by Christopher Bache, is highly recommended.

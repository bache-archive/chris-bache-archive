**Abstract**

Richard Rudd and Chris Bache open a three-part dialogue on reincarnation, moving from evidence to implications. Rudd frames the series after resonating with Bache’s book, *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. Bache recounts how Ian Stevenson’s meticulous cases of children with spontaneous past-life memories, alongside Stanislav Grof’s psychedelic research, reshaped his worldview. They explore why Western academia and even many spiritual teachers avoid reincarnation, and why expanding our horizon of time changes the stakes and purposes of life. The conversation examines therapeutic past-life work, nuanced understandings of karma, choosing incarnations, and the “up-and-out” escape cosmology of Axial-age religions versus incarnating divinity on Earth. They touch on Jung, Mahasiddhas, quantum entanglement, soul-as-diamond individuality open to the whole, and even non-linear time and future lives, setting the stage for deeper inquiry in parts two and three.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Welcome, everyone, to a series of talks I’m doing with my friend Chris Bache. We’re exploring rebirth, or reincarnation, and all that comes with it. This began because I read Chris’s wonderful book, *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. It triggered a deep recognition in me. As the founder of the Gene Keys, that resonance led me to reach out to Chris. He kindly replied, we started dialoguing, and found we really enjoyed it. Today we’ll begin with introductory concepts and basics and see where it takes us. We’re anticipating three discussions. Chris, would you share a bit about yourself?

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s a pleasure to be here. I’ve enjoyed our earlier conversations, and this dialogue grew from them. I’m a professor of philosophy and religious studies—on the religious studies side—retired from Youngstown State University. I taught world and Eastern religions, transpersonal psychology of religion, comparative mysticism, and Buddhism, so I’ve been teaching in areas touching on reincarnation for many years. My first book was on reincarnation, beginning with the scientific evidence, which we’ll touch on today. For me reincarnation is like plate tectonics: at first it’s not obvious, but once you see it, it changes everything and opens the horizon of existence. I’m pleased to explore it together.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Great, thanks, Chris. We’ll link to your talks, especially the one on evidence for reincarnation. It’s illuminating and overlooked. Tell us how you assembled that evidence and the people you met along the way.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I came from a traditional religious background, but by the end of graduate school in philosophy of religion I’d become an atheistically inclined agnostic. I started my academic career in 1978 and immediately encountered two thinkers who changed my life. First, Ian Stevenson, the Carlson Professor at the University of Virginia, whose lifelong work carefully documented thousands of cases of small children with spontaneous memories of previous lives, publishing hundreds. He convinced me reincarnation is a fact of life. Second, Stanislav Grof, the foremost authority on integrating psychedelics into psychotherapy, whose methods allow exploration of deeper dimensions of consciousness. That began another journey culminating in *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. But today the focus is Stevenson’s revolution—rigorous evidence that reincarnation is a natural phenomenon, not merely religious.

**RICHARD RUDD:** He wrote a big book, didn’t he?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Many. One early classic is *Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation*. It was a pivot for me, because reincarnation wasn’t discussed in my graduate education—neither in Western religions nor in the scientific tradition that had wiped the slate clean. I erased my blackboard and re-thought life’s larger questions with reincarnation included.

**RICHARD RUDD:** In your talk you also present the debate, showing attempts to refute the evidence and how they fall short. This body of evidence has grown largely in the last fifty years, right?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. Fifty years ago we didn’t have it. Reincarnation was a speculative topic for theologians. Now it has moved to psychology. As depth psychology explores more deeply, we keep bumping into these events. Western philosophy, saturated with naturalism, says only the physical is real, the brain produces mind, and when the brain dies, mind ceases. Reincarnation implies a dimension behind the physical, with consciousness existing between death and rebirth, so it’s resisted. Many ignore the evidence; critics like philosopher Paul Edwards assumed beforehand that reincarnation can’t happen, so the evidence must be faulty. That’s not a dispassionate analysis.

**RICHARD RUDD:** The evidence is fascinating, but let’s ask: what are the implications if we say yes to this and explore it? The shift to our worldview and how we move through life is huge.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It all hinges on time—how much time we have. As a professor, if I give a quiz, I expect a certain performance; an hour exam, more; a take-home paper, more still. If we live only once, for minutes to a century, any purpose of existence must be proportionate to that time. If we live a hundred or a thousand lives to actualize the universe’s purpose, our assessment of that purpose expands exponentially. Grasping reincarnation lifts the constriction of time and lets us appreciate larger cause-and-effect arcs over centuries. The discussion rises.

**RICHARD RUDD:** If you sense divinity behind creation, generosity of time follows. One life only would feel stingy and patternless. Opening to the eternal makes continuity of consciousness logical. Yet many spiritual teachers avoid the subject. They’re asked, but their answers are brief and it doesn’t take root. I’m curious why something so obvious is passed over.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I understand why materialist colleagues avoid it. But why would spiritual teachers not use it to frame an expanded horizon? Some argue it dilutes commitment to realization now—if you believe you have many lives, you won’t take this one seriously. That evaporates on inspection. The recognition deepens the texture of situations we’re in. For example, Michael Newton’s research (*Journey of Souls*, *Destiny of Souls*) suggests that as we mature, we choose our incarnations. If we chose this life when we knew more, with all its challenges and opportunities, that changes how we relate to our circumstances. Not to chase hidden missions, but to temper self-responsibility in how we engage people and conditions.

**RICHARD RUDD:** It also makes me feel like an eternal, cosmic adventurer. It focuses me more in the present because I’m not worrying about dying. You have to contemplate this deeply so it takes root. It feels like a truth encoded in our DNA. As it awakens, a stability grows that helps us handle challenges with more power. We often hear, “You’ve only got one life,” which is encouraging, but it’s also a tight reality.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That view often pairs with: the universe is driven by blind chance; there’s no existential significance; you get one shot; when you die, who cares? That’s demeaning and counterintuitive. Look at nature’s beauty, the night sky, Hubble’s images, Earth’s emergence of life and self-awareness across vast time. We’re the first generation to grasp how much time the universe had to evolve. If everything takes eons and we have one life, we’re existentially cut off. If we live many lives, the bad news is: it’s hard work and death isn’t an exit from growth. The good news: fear of death drops away; we can feel deeper currents and conceive longer-term projects. Even without specific past-life recall, recognizing that everyone has been here before lets us engage life with more meaning. What we’re good at, we’ve practiced; what we’re starting, we’ll improve in the future.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Many great thinkers have affirmed rebirth. Jung, pillar of modern psychology, came to it late and hid it to avoid backlash, but it’s there in his work. The word “reincarnation” draws skeptics from Christianity and materialist science. You really put your head above the parapet.

**CHRIS BACHE:** For decades I took students into the literature. Once you set aside preconceptions and look at cases, about 95% of students accepted it, secular and religious alike, because they were trained to follow evidence. It was life-changing for many.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Do you have favorite stories?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I open *Life Cycles* with Romy Crees, born to Catholic parents in Iowa. She had spontaneous memories of being a man, Joe Williams, who died in a motorcycle accident; she had a motorcycle phobia. She remembered his wife, Sheila, three children by name, and details of the town. Researchers brought her to Joe’s town, and she identified his mother, insisted on blue flowers she knew the mother liked, identified people from photos, and formed deep bonds with the mother and Sheila. Another case: a widow asked a boy claiming to be her late husband, “Where’s the will? We never found it.” He went to a kitchen floorboard, lifted it, and pulled out the will. How many such cases must one read before accepting this as part of life’s rhythm?

**RICHARD RUDD:** The small details are stunning—like a veiled woman identified by body language alone. There’s also documentation of bodily marks relating to past deaths.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Stevenson’s final work, the two-volume, thousand-page *Reincarnation and Biology*, studies 187 medically documented cases. Death wounds often appear as birthmarks or scars in the subsequent personality, suggesting mind-in-body experience can influence later tissue formation. That deepens the story.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Which leads to therapy. If difficulties in health, relationships, addictions, or stubborn complexes have roots in previous lives, a therapeutic journey opens.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Many therapists report that if you guide clients into a relaxed, inward-focused state and invite them to the source of their presenting problem, about 35–40% return to present-life events; a significant 50–60% return to previous-life roots. Consciously remembering and assimilating unresolved trauma—often around death—consistently loosens psychological and even physical problems.

**RICHARD RUDD:** I called those roots “collective unconscious,” but that’s Jung’s term for the species’ unconscious. You’d call it soul consciousness—the individual’s collective across time.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Exactly.

**RICHARD RUDD:** A dear friend, a brilliant spiritual man, struggles with reincarnation. Many want to believe in continuity, yet Advaita teachers emphasize surrender of the individual into the ocean of Being—escape from samsara. There’s a strong “up-and-out” cosmology: attain liberation and leave.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Cultures can believe in reincarnation for millennia and still misconstrue it. The key questions are: Where does it go? What’s the endgame? Axial-age religions (3–5,000 years ago) teach escape: salvation or moksha as leaving the physical. That leaves unanswered the purpose of creation. Now that we appreciate billions of years of genius behind the physical world, it’s unsatisfying to claim that once we awaken, the purpose is to depart. I think they got two big things wrong: nature and women, which are linked. They’re patriarchal and escapist. When we first experienced the “mother universe” through yoga, meditation, or psychedelics, its bliss made us think, “That’s where we belong.” A theology of return followed. But what is creation for? I think we’re here to incarnate more and more spiritual reality into the physical, to create heaven on Earth, to wake up and stay—not only as individuals, but as a species.

**RICHARD RUDD:** That reframes the feminine and the body. Perhaps we’re here to spiritualize matter, bringing ecstatic realization deeper into form, taking responsibility for body and Earth.

**CHRIS BACHE:** If at first that sounds disappointing—“I want heaven, not a transformed body”—we may underestimate what’s possible. Look at God-soaked masters whose presence concentrates so much spiritual power that nature’s laws seem to bend around them. They prototype what we’re becoming. Imagine a whole species living that way.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Physics also nudges us there—entanglement, an informational universe. In my work I speak of dormant codes in our DNA—64 Siddhis—awaiting activation so we can enter the magical, quantum universe where thoughts and feelings extend beyond the body, entangled with nature. Perhaps nature already responds more than we realize; it’s about opening pathways into the next phase.

**CHRIS BACHE:** We’re already plugged into nature down to the quantum unified field, into ecosystems and subtle feedback, into each other’s minds. When we become conscious of those connections and lift obstructive shadows carried over from sadder times, the connections rise and empower conscious participation. Life enlivens with synchronicities that reveal the larger intelligence in and around us.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Let’s bring this into people’s lives—relationships, difficulties, afflictions. From this view, life becomes opening the heart. Every relationship, especially difficult ones, offers unseen grace, polishing some virtue—forgiveness, clarity, some form of love—because they come as part of our teaching-karma. The ancients called life a Lila, a divine play. It’s like we arrive with an envelope containing our script: themes we chose to learn.

**CHRIS BACHE:** And perhaps three envelopes were offered, and you chose the one best suited to your evolution now. That stance deepens responsibility, patience, and long-term dedication. If we don’t address something now, it returns later, so let’s work with it. Also, a therapy-only lens skews toward failures and trauma. Most people rise to their karma; we build on assets too. Hidden talents emerge unannounced; deep partnerships form with old kinship, letting us do something new together.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Sri Aurobindo spoke about karma’s complexity. We oversimplify it. The karmic force tends toward balance across multiple levels, allowing education through transmutation. If we fully embrace it, grace flows through the unwrapping of suffering.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Cause and effect is everywhere: air, weather, biology, diet, planets. Here we focus on the web shaping the soul’s psycho-physical development. Many teachers address only the slice that impinges on spiritual maturity. But much karma is amoral cause-and-effect: practised habits become skills that carry forward; accidents become traumas that carry forward. As we lift conditionings, our life-spring clears. We don’t step out of cause and effect; we enter greater freedom within it, with more capacity to choose rather than be compelled.

**RICHARD RUDD:** It’s tempting to say, “That person was born disabled; did they do something terrible?” That’s an oversimplification. Unless you can see into the soul quality, you don’t know. They may be a hidden saint who took on a challenging role to polish a virtue. What about short incarnations—children who arrive briefly and leave, leaving grief and a lasting presence?

**CHRIS BACHE:** We can recognize karma-vipaka, but we’re often only touching the wrapping on a deep mystery. It’s foolish to judge others’ karma. Better to penetrate our own. When you see great suffering, you’re seeing either a sinner or a saint—you can’t know which—so don’t judge. Many hidden saints focus “negative” cause-and-effect in their body and psyche for the uplift of the whole, drawing from their own stream or a collective stream. Souls do for humanity what good parents do for their children.

**RICHARD RUDD:** In *Sand Talk*, an Aboriginal elder reframed alcoholic, obese men as warriors carrying collective negativity in their bodies, on a path from warrior to healer. It’s an empowering way to see collective problems.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That points to a larger spiritual story. We often think of reincarnation atomistically—the individual soul evolving through choices in karma. But each individual is a fractal in a unified field; deep currents run in humanity’s unconscious or soul-field. We’re players in a larger evolutionary dynamic—something we’ll explore more in part two.

**RICHARD RUDD:** The choreography is mind-blowing—interconnected soul groups and patterns. Your book clarified the paradox of being an individual soul and everything at once. You wrote that the soul is “open on all sides,” a focalized drop and the ocean. You also named it “time and awareness.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** Common sense says you can’t be both the part and the whole. Some traditions say the goal is to abandon individuality into absorption—ending the individuality developed across incarnations. I think that’s inadequate. What has emerged for me is that we’re moving into higher, more sophisticated individuality. Individuality is a gift creation wants to cultivate. Early individuality feels cut off from the whole; mature individuality—what I call the birth of the diamond soul—is distinctly itself, emerging from a specific lineage, yet profoundly open: to larger patterns, to each other in compassion, to the universe’s intelligence and the communion of ideas. You need a very strong individuality to withstand the intensity of communion; otherwise the universe’s love would shatter you. Strength allows deeper participation.

**RICHARD RUDD:** That expands our notion of enlightenment and divinity. What’s missing in many models is creativity. If individuality dissolves entirely, creativity ends. Keeping individuality means keeping creativity. We become gods within God—small g within big G. As you write: “Go out and create, my children.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** Lovely—gods within God, the creative spark within the fire of creation. It changes everything. We greet children knowing they come to us, not from us. We see that young bodies may house old souls and vice versa. It gives permission to honor aspirations toward great love and creativity—whether or not we finish in this life, we can move toward them.

**RICHARD RUDD:** It’s a more nuanced spirituality. Like fine tea or chess, there are layers upon layers. As the soul refines, subtler nuances become intelligible. I’m also interested in future lives. When you expand time enough, you don’t just look back; you can remember forward—what we call revelation. Memory can travel both ways, expanding our essence while focusing us more precisely in the present.

**CHRIS BACHE:** One of my guiding principles is accumulation: the universe is a self-learning system. We can’t help but learn, whether we do a mediocre job or a great one. We’re learning to be geniuses in every area of life. I sometimes meditate on a flower and imagine each hundred-year lifetime as a petal, pistil, or stamen. Many cultures that embraced reincarnation still haven’t grasped its full potential. On time’s directionality, Robert Monroe, the out-of-body researcher, reported discovering that incarnation isn’t necessarily linear; some “former” lives may be in the future. In addition to intuiting what is “not yet,” perhaps some of us have sampled future time and are inculcating its awareness now—a current of involution descending even as evolution ascends, as Aurobindo said.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Wonderful beginning, Chris. Thank you.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, Richard. I look forward to where we go next.

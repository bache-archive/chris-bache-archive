<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Hi everybody. It's nice to see your faces. Short introduction: I've made my living as a university professor in Ohio. I taught in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State. I focused on Eastern religion, psychology of mysticism, comparative spirituality, and Eastern thought. But what brings me here today is not that work; it's my work with psychedelics, which I did for 20 years while I was an academic. I wasn't really allowed to speak about those things in the academic environment, and it was only after I retired that I wrote a book I'd like to speak from today. </p>
<p>This book tells the story of where I went over 20 years of working with LSD. I followed a protocol established by Stan Grof, working in psychedelic therapy, which involved a completely isolated environment. I used headphones, eyeshades, and music, and worked with very high doses. I had 73 sessions over 20 years, working with 500 to 600 micrograms. I don't recommend this protocol—I wouldn't do it the same way if I were starting over—but that's what I did, and this is the story. </p>
<p>When someone asks me what it's like taking that high dose of LSD, I say it’s like being in the middle of a nuclear explosion. It completely shatters all dimensions of your mind and the boundaries of consciousness. If you keep this up for long periods, it reveals levels of reality beyond time and space. When you work systematically with psychedelics, whether in an indigenous context or a contemporary one, you go through a process that reveals levels of existence beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p>
<p>Very briefly, in the book, I describe the levels of consciousness I went through in this process: a series of death and rebirth experiences, starting with the personal level of mind, going through ego death, then reaching the collective level of mind, engaging deep structures within the collective psyche. Third, the archetypal dimension of mind, going beyond time-space reality, dissolving into archetypal structures that underlie physical existence. Fourth, entering causal level reality, causal oneness. And finally, entering what I call the Diamond Luminosity, what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. </p>
<p>Transitioning from one level to another involves going through a series of deaths and rebirths—not simply ego death—but also at the collective and archetypal levels, entering deeper intimacy with the universe. </p>
<p>Such a long journey, so many years, so many levels of consciousness—it’s impossible for me to summarize them succinctly. But for today, I want to focus on two aspects that are relevant to the discussion of consciousness and building a regenerative society. The first has to do with the collective level of mind and the second with what I call the birth of the Future Human.</p>
<p>After undergoing ego death and working for years through various experiences, I entered a domain involving vast territories of collective suffering. I call this the Ocean of Suffering. It eventually expanded to encompass hundreds of thousands of beings and thousands of years of time. Initially confusing, because I, like many, thought psychedelics were a personal benefit, for self-healing and enlightenment. But this ocean of suffering shattered that model; I abandoned the individual transformation model for a collective one. </p>
<p>I believed that the Ocean of Suffering was not focused on my personal soul but aimed at the collective psyche, facilitating a healing of unresolved trauma from thousands of years of human history. This work culminated in an orgy of cleansing, purification, and healing, and launched me into the archetypal reality, never returning to that ocean.</p>
<p>My point is: everything we do in deep states of consciousness affects not only our personal being but also the beings around us. It reaches deep into the collective psyche of humanity. I think we are given opportunities for transformation affecting our species and extending far beyond our personal lives and time.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps because of this strong collective orientation, I began to experience visions about humanity's evolutionary trajectory. I entered repeatedly into a state I describe as Deep Time—not eternity or timelessness, but a condition where you experience vast periods in a compressed frame, sometimes as a simultaneous now. I received teachings about humanity’s evolution and where we are heading.</p>
<p>There is a chapter in the book called "The Birth of the Future Human," focusing on visions of humanity reaching a culmination point, a before-and-after, a transformation affecting the entire human family. This transformation isn't merely about awakening individuals; the creative intelligence of the universe is trying to awaken the human species as a whole. This profound transformation will change not just our economy, ecological values, and social orientation but the bedrock of the human psyche, altering the fundamental archetypal blueprint.</p>
<p>The visions took place between 1979 and 1999, experiencing the death and rebirth of humanity. As mystics teach, before a Great Awakening, a great death—the dark night of the soul—occurs. Humanity is entering this dark night, confronting historical karma. In these sessions, I witnessed the collapse of civilization, seemingly driven by an ecological crisis leading to a global disintegration. </p>
<p>At the depth of this process, when impending extinction seemed inevitable, the storm passed. Survivors began anew, transformed into new human beings, shedding fundamental past beliefs and engaging the future with an expanded heart and innate sense of oneness. This was a before-and-after point in time. It took me years to recover from this immense time expansion and the profound encounter with the human story.</p>
<p>This understanding is the reality with which I've lived, informing my view of history today and the COVID-19 crisis, which I see as an overture to forthcoming historical crises in the 21st century. There’s a correlation between the outer world seeking planetary integration and the inner world’s quest for oneness, merging all our past-life experiences into a higher consciousness—a new platform for humanity in future time.</p>
<p>I think I'm near the end of my time, having introduced many large ideas. I'll stop here and see where we take this.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> Christopher, that was wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing. I really love your work and vision. Extraordinary to talk with someone exploring the depths of the LSD space, perhaps as much as anyone alive. I'm curious about your perspective on LSD. Do you see it as an entity? Is it a being, or just a chemical catalyst? Is it here accidentally, or is there some intentionality to it?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Given the synchronicity of the atomic bomb's birth and LSD in the same decade, I don't think it's accidental. I see it as an amplifier and catalyst of consciousness, akin to Psilocybin, Ayahuasca, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT. Each substance has its own characteristics. LSD, relatively new, has little historical background, making it unusually clean compared to Psilocybin and Ayahuasca—substances with rich historical overlays.</p>
<p>LSD is distinctively clean, especially at high levels, which I worked with—500 to 600 micrograms—driving to the high cosmological ceiling. Psilocybin is more grounded in the body, whereas LSD explores higher cosmologies.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> I'm curious if you have a Buddhist orientation. You mention reincarnation and past lives. Any insights?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> That's true. Reincarnation is part of my worldview. My first book, "Lifecycles," discusses empirical evidence for reincarnation. As a philosopher, I believe the scientific evidence, like Ian Stevenson's work with young children at the University of Virginia, overwhelmingly supports reincarnation. It shows nature retains its learning, reincarnation being evolution’s higher octave. Through history, individuals learn and evolve. Eventually, all reincarnational history integrates into a higher order of intelligence—a collective intelligence—beyond individual frames of reference.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> We had a question from Deanna about reaching deep insights without psychedelics. Your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Absolutely. Many have written to me saying they've had similar experiences without psychedelics, through meditation. LSD is an amplifier of consciousness, but it’s consciousness that does the work. There are many ways to amplify consciousness, psychedelics being just one key.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> Considering your insights into the future, even without exact time frames, how can we prepare practically? Should these psychedelic explorations be part of our preparation, or can we minimize the destructive impacts simulating what's coming?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> There is, indeed, an express of destruction—a kind of Kali destroyer—to make space for the new. I think we are collectively facing our shadow. Handling our personal shadow, through any process that confronts our dark dimensions, is essential. We can then participate collectively by helping others to address the shadow of our culture and history, embracing social and political action.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> Beautiful, Christopher. That would be great. Let's have David Luke come on and speak, then perhaps a dialog after. David, are you there? Would you like to jump in?</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> Yeah, sure. Hi. Can you hear me okay?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> Oh, great. Yeah, good to be here. Thanks for inviting me along. Good to see everybody. Thanks for that, Chris. Fantastic to hear you talk. So I'll just give you a little bit of background about me, and I'm going to give you a kind of précis of what I've been doing for the last few decades, or the insights I've kind of come to. So, I'm a psychologist by training, primarily a parapsychologist and a transpersonal psychologist. My big umbrella area of interest is altered states of consciousness and anomalous or transpersonal experiences. I've done a lot of research on all kinds of altered states. Specifically, I've done a lot of research with psychedelics. I do a lot of research when I'm not on psychedelics as well, but it's not as much fun.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to give you a bit of an overview of some of the insights I've had that come from the research, but also my own particular journey as well. Insights that are coming from the research and what the journey involves and what it leads to can pretty much summarize where we are currently with our intellectual quest: Psychedelics and altered states in general, because I think all altered states have continuity with psychedelic experiences, just perhaps the volume is turned up more with psychedelic experiences. They increase connectivity across the whole spectrum of experience, from the biological through the psychological, sociological, ecological, and even into the cosmological or spiritual realms.</p>
<p>On a biological level, we know from research at Imperial College, for instance, they increase connectivity within different brain regions. Areas of the brain that don't normally communicate with each other suddenly become very communicative—they have hyper-connectivity. On a cognitive level, this explains things like synesthesia, divergent thinking, increased creativity, cognitive flexibility, and so on. Psychologically, they connect us with ourselves, give us access to our unconscious material, tap straight into our shadow, personal history, past traumas, and hopefully, through assistance or guidance, lead to some resolution of prior traumas.</p>
<p>I found a brilliant quote by Gabor Maté about half an hour ago: Every human being has a true, genuine, authentic self, and trauma is the disconnection from it, and healing is the reconnection. We know this results in enhanced mood, well-being, and enhanced mindfulness. From a psychological, scientific perspective, on a sociological level, psychedelics and altered states can increase our connection to each other. They can increase our openness to experience, willingness to engage with culture and art, different perspectives; they increase our empathy and compassion. This can lead to increased pro-social behavior and enhanced value orientations.</p>
<p>Where my recent deep dive has been is into the ecological perspective: we find that these states can increase our connection to nature, which I think is vital right now. We see an increase in eco-consciousness or biophilia; interspecies communications or connections increase, leading to ecologically oriented behavior. From a big survey, we found people who had taken psychedelics said their experiences led them to change their diet—more raw, vegan, local, vegetarian. It also increased the amount of gardening they do, which is significant: psychedelics increase gardening. This is big news. They can also increase ecological activism, even lead people to change their careers as a result of their experiences.</p>
<p>Beyond the environment and the ecosystem into the cosmological levels, we find people have a greater sense of connection to the universe, God, the other—whatever it might be. Transpersonal and mystical experiences help reduce fear of death, enhance spirituality, sense of purpose and meaning, increase self-transcendence. Clinical research shows those with mystical experiences often have the best outcomes, like dealing with addictions, depression, anxiety, even end-of-life fears. But this needs the appropriate set, setting, substance, preparation, and integration.</p>
<p>For insights directly from the journey, John Lilly encapsulated it: What one believes to be true is either true or becomes true within certain limits. These are to be found experimentally and experientially and, when found, become more beliefs to transcend. In the mind, there are no limits. He added, after near-death experiences, bodily limits aren't to be transcended, but the mind is limitless. Beliefs are our reality; they can be prisons, because of psychological rabbit holes, confirmation bias, etc. Science and research into consciousness often get constrained by materialist reductionism, so fields like transpersonal and parapsychology don't receive much attention. We should argue for agnosticism and plurality, beware of beliefs, as we're in a post-truth era since communication began.</p>
<p>The mind is infinite, evidenced by genius, creativity, and parapsychology findings. We can transcend time and space with our minds. Research and theory in physics are increasingly aligned with parapsychology. Time is subjective, and precognition is becoming more plausible. Finally, everything is connected; parapsychology, psychedelics, transpersonal psychology show this, transcending time and space, precognition, empathy, clairvoyance, synchronicities. But this is circumscribed by our beliefs and should guide actions with openness, transparency, compassion, and reciprocity, moving away from all kinds of isms—ethnocentric, species-centric, cognoscentric. Value everything from dreams to meditation to psychedelics, moving towards increased connectivity.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> David, that was awesome. Thank you so much. And, yeah, the work you're doing is tremendous. I'm curious about what you wrote in the book about extraordinary experiences, like psychic and paranormal experiences common in psychedelic states, and what that reveals about consciousness from your perspective.</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> I think it poses an enormous question mark against the idea that consciousness is confined to the brain. We already have 135 years of evidence from parapsychology about psychic abilities and the transcendence of time and space. Psychedelics amplify those experiences. People have significantly more psychic, paranormal, and transpersonal experiences with psychedelics, and I believe many are genuine. Some may be delusional, but many are genuine.</p>
<p>There's a lot of shamanic practice using psychedelics for that purpose. The academy is starting to explore psychedelics seriously, acknowledging many transpersonal and parapsychological experiences. We should investigate them with an open mind rather than trying to explain them away.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> My understanding is that psychic and paranormal effects are tough to study under traditional research methods. I've heard even when an effect seems demonstrable at first, it loses correlation with repeated experiments. It's almost like there's a secret protecting itself or that doesn't want to make itself known to humanity right now.</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> You could ask Dean [Radin] more about that. There's a sense many parapsychology experiments aren't immediately repeatable, but meta-analyses show significant data when combined. The effects may reduce over time but hit a plateau. Overall, stacked data show the effects, yet it's challenging due to complexity.</p>
<p>We're turning a mirror on consciousness, creating a slippery endeavor. Psychic abilities' origins remain uncertain; experimenters could influence outcomes through their own psychic abilities. This complexity affects all scientific endeavors. The Higgs boson discovery, comparable to the global consciousness project, reflects similar collective effort and outcomes: probabilistic results as significant as global consciousness initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> What about the positive ecological and psychological effects of psychedelics? Then, we have experiences with substances like DMT, which are incredibly alien. How do you interpret that? Do you think there's evidence for entities or other-dimensional realities, or is it a brain wiring switch?</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> The DMT question is super interesting, as it most reliably gives encounter experiences with sentient entities, often believed to be real. It's under-researched since science tends to reinforce existing belief systems with neuroscience. Thus, DMT entities haven't been studied extensively—primarily by Psychonauts. There are commonalities like elf-like beings or dispassionate entities conducting experiments. Separating cultural influences is difficult, but these commonalities need more exploration.</p>
<p>A Johns Hopkins study showed atheists often change their views after DMT experience—underscoring its transformative impact. Grappling with the empirical validity of these encounters will be challenging but important.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> In your book on extraordinary experiences, you envision a future research institute into consciousness itself. It fascinates me, and maybe with the ecological situation, it's time to manifest this. How would you construct such a thing? Is a kind of Hogwarts for consciousness possible? What research would you prioritize?</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> Thanks for that question, Daniel. We need to bring all perspectives together, not just science and medicine. We need psychiatrists, psychotherapists, psychopharmacologists, plus wisdom traditions like the Huichol with their shamanic practices, alongside inputs from traditions like Tibetan Buddhism. We need a multidisciplinary, multinational center for exchanging ideas.</p>
<p>As substances like psilocybin get licensed for depression, practitioners must understand the transpersonal spectrum, including experiences of telepathy, entity encounters, and out-of-body experiences. We can't leave it to psychiatrists or neuroscientists alone; we need shamans, monks, and all spiritual traditions sitting together.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> One speaker I invited was Sergio Magana, a Nahuatl Shaman, though he hasn't appeared yet. He's written on transitions from the fifth to the sixth sun in Mesoamerican cosmology—moving from rational, material focus to psyche and dream world prominence. I'm curious how this resonates with you. The resurgence of psychedelics seems tied to an unpredictable collective shift.</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> Certainly, the psychedelic revival affects collective consciousness, especially in the West. Reconnecting with the dreamy, associative parts of our brain and mythological, unconscious aspects is beneficial. Ian McGilchrist illustrates this in his book—emphasizing reconnection with imagination and mythological aspects. We're skewed towards rationality, neglecting dream time, imagination, and associative thought, to our detriment. Our intelligence has overtaken our wisdom, creating crisis.</p>
<p>Psychedelics can play a significant role; similarly, the internet, our technological telepathy, could realize our inherent abilities. But we're wading through an ocean of misinformation. Chris, want to add?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> The analogy I use in "Dark Night, Early Dawn" is that we are like a culture not seeing the night sky—missing the far away and greater context. We've limited ourselves to the sunlit, nearby world, missing profound cosmological insights. Without seeing consciousness's depth and engaging with the universe's consciousness, we're limited. Rebalancing provides a transformative worldview impact.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> David, what practical advice or caution would you offer? Is it the right time to explore alternative dimensions through entheogens? Are there dangers? How about potential negative effects on character?</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> It's up to individuals to decide if it's right for them. Psychedelics aren't for everyone, though they can help many. Alternative paths include dreams, lucid dreaming, meditation, and yoga, offering more controlled exploration. In fast-paced modern life, psychedelics can offer a fast track for people in sticky ruts due to urbanization and contemporary living.</p>
<p>Is there a dark side? Yes, both in how psychedelics are distributed or experienced and potentially in the experiences themselves. Whether individual experiences can be negative—Daniel, I see you're asking about that, or if there's a darker communal aspect.</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> I mean, I certainly can do, and it's not all light. And I think you have to look at it as more of a process. From the clinical work that's been done, a lot of people may have challenging experiences that are very difficult, but they usually pass through them. Those are the ones that typically give a lot of insight, and people feel they grow more from, even if it wasn't particularly pleasant. Very few people have traumatic experiences and regret doing it in the first place. Maybe they shouldn't be taking psychedelics, or they're not necessary for them, or they started a process that threw up too much stuff for them to immediately deal with. I haven't really got a clear answer for that, but there can be heavy, dark experiences. When you go into the shadow, when you turn up the volume on the mirror, you're not always going to like what you see. And there are problems of spiritual bypass and potential narcissism that may arise as part of the journey, but this is part of any journey of personal or spiritual development, not just with psychedelics. I'll hand over to Chris.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> I completely agree with you, David. There are dark experiences that serve. In these states, you have to be well prepared. You have to fasten your seatbelt, choose a very careful location, and work with all the safety precautions. My experience is that all these dark experiences are forms of purification and clarification. The deepest breakthroughs into ecstatic knowledge and visionary knowing came after the deepest purification, dark experiences. So, in my work, I created conditions that would facilitate the deepest and darkest encounters, not because I was fond of suffering, but because of what lay on the other side of that suffering. It's really important to take psychedelics in a very carefully structured setting, not recreationally or casually, with a lot of forethought and disciplined preparation, not only going into the session but coming out of it for the integration process, for the retention process, and eventually the debrief afterward. A good, thorough debrief is a very good way to prevent problems that emerge in subsequent sessions. It's very important.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> I guess, Christopher, or actually for both of you, what's the best way to prepare for a psychedelic experience? How do you approach these sessions for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> In the southwestern United States, the Hopi Indians have a Kiva, a hole in the ground with a circle on the top, where you climb down with a ladder, and then they pull up the ladder, and you're in a completely isolated environment for the duration of the experience. I think of my work with psychedelics like I'm in a Kiva—completely isolated, protected, with someone who takes care of my body. I'm not in a talking relationship; it's highly internal and engaged. I want clean contact and eliminate all outside influences. It can be wonderful to take psychedelics and go into nature, but when facing personal, collective, and historical shadows, that work is best done in isolation. I do a lot of spiritual practice before and after a session, take care of my body, and make sure it's well-tuned, relaxed, and aligned. With high-dose psychedelics, your body processes enormous quantities of energy, which is demanding on your subtle energy system. A lot of care is necessary for your body, subtle energy system, and spiritual practice beforehand, followed by a careful and sustained debrief afterward. That's my approach. David?</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> I guess it depends on your level of experience, the context, and what you hope to get from the experience. If you're inexperienced, do your homework. Know what you're taking, dosage, substance purity, where it came from, and whether you trust the source. Consider set and setting, where you are psychologically and physically, preparation, and integration afterward, as Chris pointed out. It needn't always be a 600 milligram deep dive like Chris's process, which is brilliant. For instance, we've experimented with 100 microgram low doses with top-level scientists for creative insight and problem-solving, which is a completely different agenda than a deep philosophical, spiritual journey. It all depends on the context of use, but you must pay attention to the context, intentions, set, setting, substance preparation, and integration.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> David, I know that England, particularly Imperial College, is now a center for psychedelic research. I wonder if you could tell us what's going on there now, what's active, and what discoveries are being made.</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> I'm loosely affiliated with Imperial College's psychedelic research center. There hasn't been much going on recently due to lockdown, but they're beginning to recruit participants for various studies. Some of it is clinical, looking at Psilocybin for depression as part of a global endeavor to get Psilocybin licensed as medicament for depression treatment. Most of their focus is on the neuroscientific, neuropsychopharmacological research—how these substances work in the brain and what they tell us about consciousness. They're doing neuroimaging of MDMA, Psilocybin, LSD, and DMT. I'm collaborating on a DMT study exploring slow infusion for high-dose breakthrough experiences over extended periods, exploring both neuroscience and experience. As a parapsychologist, I'm looking to explore shared visionary experiences. We're exploring getting two people on DMT at the same time, separated in different rooms, to look at their brain activity and the correlation of their experiences. This takes us into some far-out transpersonal realms. They're doing a lot of great research and survey work, also working with retreat centers and more.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> I'm tempted to ask both of you a question that may sound funny, but it's always on one's mind. From your different personal psychedelic explorations, what’s your philosophy on the purpose of life and argument experience?</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> Nice, small question. Chris, do you want to go first?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Goodness, that is a large one. The universe has been unfolding for 13.7 billion years, and there's no evidence it's stopping anytime soon. Attempts to say the purpose of life will always be inadequate given the project's enormity. What we can see and project may carry us some distance, but it won't take us through the entire process. To me, it's about learning, loving, deeply experiencing, opening, exploring, and expanding our capacities. Exploring is really important. Once, in a deep encounter with creative intelligence, I asked about the purpose of existence. I was popping in and out between non-being or the pure void and suddenly being. It generated the question, "What is the purpose of being?" The consciousness said to me, "Have we not learned anything?" It just shattered me; it seemed all about learning. The idea of this consciousness trying to learn about itself doesn't persuade me as much as the importance of learning.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> Okay, David, what do you have for us?</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> Not that much. We are on a quest for meaning, trying to establish it. I'm not sure all species try to find meaning, but we are kind of lost in a materialist, reductionist universe that's led us into difficult places. The quest for meaning is worthwhile, but ultimately, it might not be about meaning. It might be just about being, as Chris said—that's really the important thing. But I'm a bit confused. What do you think, Daniel?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> Good question. Learning, creativity, expression, play. I don't think there's a necessity to it. Meaning itself is a human-created term. Dreaming, experiencing, creating, discovering, loving—maybe multiple purposes. We had a few questions about the value of microdosing and I was curious if you had a perspective on whether it's a helpful tool for people at this point in time.</p>
<p><strong>David Luke:</strong> I guess that might be for me because Chris seems more in the macro dosing end. Microdosing may have potential, but we don't have enough data yet. There's a lot of uncontrolled data from non-placebo, randomized-controlled studies suggesting people feel it's beneficial for depression, creativity, and other areas. Little research shows those outcomes may be genuine. It could be a massive placebo effect, but if people think it's beneficial, that might be enough. Most of my research focuses on low to high macro dosing. There's potentially room for microdosing, but dangers too, like the co-opting of psychedelics as mere psychovitamins when they can do much more. Fortunately, most people who microdose end up accidentally macro dosing at some point, which could be beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> I'll leave that one to you, David, because I don't have much experience with microdosing. When I tried microdosing with LSD, it was after years of working at high dose levels, and I found I really don't like LSD in my body anymore. I drove it so hard with massive doses that my body developed an allergy to it, so it's not good for me to use now, and I haven't for years. I read the literature, and like you, there's much anecdotal positive literature but not as much solid scientific literature on microdosing. I'm sure it's coming along. Your phrase about psychedelics being like a psycho micro pill, a vitamin pill, is spot on. They can do so much more.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> Later on, we'll have Andrew Camargo present on his work with Santo Daime and the Ayahuasca tradition. But first, if he's up for it, I’d like Jeremy Johnson to give us insight into the integral model. Jeremy, are you here for a ten-minute overview of Gebser's integral consciousness model?</p>
<p>Audience: ** Sure, thank you, Daniel. I've been enjoying today's presentations. Some of you may be familiar with integral theory. Rory mentioned spiral dynamics in context with Extinction Rebellion. The history of consciousness can be very abstract. Gene Gebser's work is foundational for integral theory, alongside Ken Wilber, but Gebser is different as he's not a developmentalist. His work is phenomenological, encouraging exploration of our own consciousness. We've talked about left and right brain theories, and Gebser guides us in that. I've been with the Gebser Society for ten years and plan to pursue my PhD at CIIS. Gepser's phenomenology involves the archeology of meaning-making through art, language, and literature, tracing consciousness from magic and mythical structures into the rational, secular age. There are gains and losses in this. Understanding these modes can make them concrete rather than abstract, allowing us to live the magic and mythic again. Our challenge is not to move to a next level but to present the wealth of our consciousness, integrating rational, scientific thinking with cyclical and participatory cosmologies. Gebser speaks of diaphaneity—an openness that enables states of being. Integral consciousness, to me, speaks of being both in the past and future, where the potential of newness is made tangible in the present.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Pinchbeck:</strong> Jyoti will join us briefly soon, but regarding structure of consciousness, as Gebser mentions—archaic, magic, mythical, mental, integral—each one reaches a crisis requiring mutation or transmutation into a new consciousness. Maybe delve into that?</p>
<p>Audience: ** Sure, reading Gebser about a decade ago, his work proposed a civilizational juncture point with destabilization and restructuration. He lived through the first half of the 20th century and saw the end of the mental-rational perspective age and the opening of the integral structure of consciousness. There's civilizational collapse alongside opening. He's essential as he articulated themes of letting go and embracing new modes of time and space beyond Cartesianism tied to the mental rational. His framework is beneficial because it's poetical and allows phenomenological self-exploration in relation to time and space. There's an overall structure: archaic, magic, mythic, mental, integral—each goes through leaps. Let's delve more later into how this frames discussions on subject matters from Chris and David.</p>

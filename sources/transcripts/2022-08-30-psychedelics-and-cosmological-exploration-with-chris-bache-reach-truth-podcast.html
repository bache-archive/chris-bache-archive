<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
Hi, friend—thanks for joining me.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I'm glad to be here, Tasshin. Thank you for the invitation.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
My pleasure. I've read three out of four of your books in the last month or so and have been devouring them. It's been a real treat, and I've been very excited to have this conversation. To begin, I'd love to hear your background and life story—anything you'd like to share about yourself, biographically and personally.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Basically, I made my living as a university professor at a modest university in Northeast Ohio. I'm a professor of religious studies. My background is a degree in theology from Notre Dame, study in New Testament criticism at Cambridge, and a PhD in Philosophy of Religion from Brown—very classically educated. I was raised in the Deep South, in Mississippi. When I finished my graduate training and came to Youngstown State University, where I taught for 33 years, I met the work of Stanislav Grof, one of the foremost authorities in integrating psychedelics into psychotherapy, and his work was a turning point in my life.</p>
<p>I kept doing the things professors do—week in, week out, year after year—in the classroom. But in my private life I began a 20-year journey working with high doses of LSD in a therapeutic protocol pioneered by Stan and other early researchers, exploring the deep structure not only of my own consciousness but of the consciousness of the universe itself—at least, that’s my best interpretation of where I went. I did this work between 1979 and 1999, then sat on it and digested it for another 20 years before releasing LSD in the Mind of the Universe, the story of that journey. So basically, I'm a university professor who's part of the underground psychedelic movement in this country.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
It's been incredible to learn about. You allude at a few points to who you were before you started this journey—your younger self. I got the picture of you as straight-laced and analytic, someone who might not have expected to go down this path. What were you like at that time before you started all this?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I began my life seeking to be a Catholic priest. I was in the seminary for three years in high school and got a degree in theology from Notre Dame. So I began very conventionally. By the time I finished graduate school, because of my education, I became an atheistically inclined agnostic. The study of philosophy of religion and science had basically wiped my theological slate clean, and that’s how I began this work. It was the LSD work that opened me to a broader understanding of existence.</p>
<p>I’ve been a meditator since college and have practiced within different Buddhist traditions—the Vipassana tradition and Zen, eventually settling into the Vajrayana tradition. That evolution came after the psychedelic work had begun. I’ve raised three kids, been married—mortgages, the standard kind of affair. And look at me—I mean, I look like an accountant, kind of like I was designed to be an undercover agent—</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
—for psychedelics. Wow, I love that description. What was it that so captured you about Grof’s work when you encountered it?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I immediately saw that if what he was saying was correct, it had enormous implications—for philosophy, which was my interest—not just for healing in clinical psychology. Here was a method that allowed deep, firsthand access to dimensions of consciousness and, through those dimensions, to dimensions of reality I had seen described in many spiritual literatures. This was a protocol that allowed people to be initiated, if only temporarily—what I call the path of temporary immersion. We have to be careful not to confuse a path of temporary immersion with what I would call the path of abiding presence, the more contemplative, meditational path. But this gave temporary access to states far beyond ordinary egoic awareness and far beyond space-time, to explore the deep structure of the universe itself.</p>
<p>This is a philosopher’s dream, particularly in a culture with materialist metaphysical convictions—believing that nothing exists outside what can be explained by its material substrate, that matter is the only thing that’s real. Here was a method challenging that assumption, giving experiences that are very difficult to explain in terms of that materialist hypothesis. That immediately perked up my philosopher’s ears.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
When you decided to go on this journey—being inspired by Grof and adapting his protocol for your own use—what did that look like practically? How did you embark?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I followed a very strict protocol, which I think made my work a little unusual. In a therapeutic protocol, you are totally isolated from the world. You don’t take psychedelics and go for a walk in the woods or go to a concert or even stay up talking with friends. You’re protected by a sitter who manages all the logistics of your day, handling carefully curated music; with headphones and eyeshades, you turn your attention totally within, like in a meditation retreat.</p>
<p>Psychedelics are an amplifier. They amplify the condition of your unconscious and allow subtle dimensions of mind—normally requiring real effort to access—to come forward. If you meet them conscientiously and with focus, a cleaning and healing process begins—confrontational and therapeutic engagement—but you’re totally isolated. Basically, it’s a whole-weekend agenda. If I was working on Saturday, I’d start in the early morning and go all day until after suppertime. There are protocols beforehand: preparing the body and diet, and specific spiritual practices before and after a session. It’s one very intense day, with several days of preparation and integration around it.</p>
<p>After several medium-dose sessions, I chose to work at very high levels using psychedelic therapy—not low-dose psycholytic therapy. This is a protocol I don’t recommend today. It’s not that I’m against occasional high doses of LSD, but consistently exploding consciousness so aggressively is not something I encourage now. I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms for 73 sessions over 20 years—on average about five sessions a year. I worked for four years, took a six-year hiatus, then worked in a very aggressive 10 years. It averaged about five sessions a year.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
Can you explain the difference between psychedelic and psycholytic protocols?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
A psycholytic protocol is a low-dose protocol that stimulates the unconscious more gently and peels it layer by layer. Traumas or problematic material surface in smaller increments. High-dose LSD—in the early years these were limited to three sessions—was used in Stan’s work at Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore with terminally ill cancer patients dealing with death anxiety. They were trying to precipitate something approximating a near-death experience, to give people who were dying a glimpse of where they were going.</p>
<p>It’s a much more evocative state. Instead of processing the layers of the personal psyche one by one, it tends to blow through them and drive consciousness into a more radical state of awareness. I thought, if you could do this safely three times, you could do it more than three times. Early on I was thinking in a personal model: cleaning my own consciousness, but in bigger exercises—eating my karma in fewer and larger bites. It turns out that model was completely incorrect, as I learned by the second or third year.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
Did you have a sense when you were starting out that this would be a long-term endeavor, that you’d do these journeys many times?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
No. I had been meditating and hit the usual blocks everyone hits early on. I first thought I’d do some therapy to push through and clear those blocks, to accelerate my personal awakening. That was a false model. But once the adventure started—once I began to break into experiences of the cosmos—I was hooked. I didn’t expect it to take up such a large proportion of my life.</p>
<p>If you go very deeply into this work, you don’t integrate it around the edges and continue to live an ordinary life. Deep spiritual practice becomes your life; you wrap your life around it. That happened to me. My students and teaching were a central focus. My children, family, and marriage were a central focus. But my psychedelic work became the core of my deeper philosophical undertaking.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
How did those aspects of your life relate to and influence each other?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
My marriage and my teaching were very grounding. I love being a parent and being married. I love teaching and being in the classroom. Those commitments kept me grounded. When I was off exploring different dimensions of reality on the weekend, I’d come back to dishes to wash and students to teach. They complemented each other completely.</p>
<p>Any deep explorer has this experience: you go in and out of periods of deep absorption, like retreat. That’s why I never say I’ve “tripped.” I say I do a session—like a Zen session—a period set aside for intense spiritual practice. A psychedelic session is a period set aside for intense spiritual practice. You go back and forth between these states and ordinary life. It’s important to keep them in balance, and my life was organized in a way that did keep them in balance and helped each side support the other.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
You distinguish between using psychedelics for therapy, for spirituality, and for the cosmological explorations you ended up leaning toward. Can you speak to that distinction?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I became more articulate about this as the journey went on and especially when I wrote it up. Many readers tried to understand my work within frameworks that were too small. I now differentiate three projects you can do with psychedelics. There are others, of course, but three here: </p>
<ul>
<li>Therapeutic healing: the primary work of the psychedelic renaissance—healing wounds of the personal unconscious: PTSD, death anxiety, depression, alcohol addiction. This is personal-level work.</li>
<li>Spiritual awakening: awakening to the truth of one’s inner being—to have experiential access to the center of consciousness, which turns out to be the same unified reality as the entire field of consciousness underlying existence. This is different from therapeutic healing; it’s spiritual healing and awakening.</li>
<li>Cosmological exploration: not simply becoming aware of spiritual truths, but exploring beyond them into the deep structure of existence—beyond space and time, into deep time, deep space, archetypal reality. You don’t have to go into these dimensions to wake up or become fully realized. You don’t have to go to the beginning of the universe before the Big Bang and watch creation emerge out of the great void. That’s a different agenda, and it’s important to keep apples and oranges separate. They reinforce and support each other, and in my journey—which became primarily cosmological—there was also a great deal of personal healing and episodes of rich spiritual awakening. But if I were aimed just at spiritual awakening or psychological healing, I would have organized the sessions differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cosmological exploration is like a demanding extreme sport—climbing Everest or going to the North Pole. It requires tremendous safeguards. You’re going into places very few people have gone. It’s not the same as spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
On the one hand, I find the distinction persuasive because it characterizes your work and discoveries. If you held it as purely separate, that wouldn’t align with my own experiences. It sounds like you’re saying they can all happen, but it’s more about what you’re aiming for or your intentions.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes—and they overlap.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
In that case, how did you structure your sessions to aim toward cosmological exploration? And how might someone structure them if they’re aimed at the other goals?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I didn’t understand much of this at the time; I understood it only after going a long way down the road and looking back at how my choices affected the trajectory. The dose decision is significant. Working with high doses, you completely surrender to the process. It’s impossible to direct it. You can set all the good intentions you want, but the states that arise with high doses, amplified by carefully selected music and internalization in a kiva-like practice, set in motion processes so powerful you can’t control them. The strategy is to surrender—let consciousness take you wherever it wants, show you whatever it wants, no matter how inscrutable, painful, or absurd it seems at the time.</p>
<p>It’s only after the fact, when you put it together, that you may understand the dynamics of the unfolding. You integrate after each individual session, but over a string of sessions there’s a sequential development. More or less, where one session ended, the next would begin—like keeping a dream journal—you go deeper and deeper. You may not understand what’s happening until multiple sessions down the road, and then, looking back, you see a continuity of development across sessions. Beyond dose and setting, it’s not a matter of aiming intention; it’s a matter of complete surrender and then figuring out afterward what has happened.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
What is the word “kiva” that you used?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In the Native American Southwestern tradition, when they would do sacred ceremonies with peyote or other sacraments, a kiva is a hole in the ground with a ladder. You sit deep in this chamber around a fire; the ladder is pulled up; you stay isolated all night doing ceremony until morning, when the ladder is lowered again. I use it as a metaphor for a good psychedelic session. You’re totally isolated from the world. You don’t get up and move around or talk a lot. Whatever you’re confronting is coming from within or through yourself, not being triggered by outside stimuli.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
There’s a question on my mind about your work. It’s almost as if you’re presenting cosmological findings. I find them persuasive and consistent with my own explorations, but why should someone take these findings seriously as saying something about the nature of reality, rather than just an inner adventure?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Good question—and the critical one. Why isn’t this just echoes of my personal unconscious or of the collective unconscious, rather than something that goes beyond those canyon walls? A couple of things.</p>
<p>First, are the experiences replicable? Do they show up in the sessions of other people? If it were just me describing these levels of reality, it might be as you say. But the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic states is echoed in the work of other psychedelicists—if they’re using a method and substance with sufficient power to break through the same number of layers. There is a convergence of experience at deep levels; when I describe my experiences, other journeyers recognize them as reflecting their own.</p>
<p>It’s important to put all our experiences on the table together, not just one person’s, and compare them in the context of the methodology used. Then we better understand what’s idiosyncratic and what’s common ground. In that context, my work sits largely within the common ground Grof has outlined, integrating thousands of sessions from hundreds of people over time.</p>
<p>Also, what emerges in psychedelic cosmology is not unique to psychedelics. It’s the same cosmology that emerges in deep mystical traditions. Different traditions have different interpretive canvases, of course, but if you do a phenomenological analysis—looking at the lineages of witnessing across world mystical cultures—and compare them to psychedelic cosmology, they are fundamentally the same. In that sense there’s nothing unique in what I’m saying; the only unique thing is the particular method of gaining access to these dimensions.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
I agree the method is unique, and some of your findings felt novel to me. In particular, the emphasis on reincarnation as a process akin to evolution and development. I’d heard similar things, but connecting it to evolution felt new. You said that two or three years into the process you started to understand the work differently—it was less about your personal blocks. What did you discover as that transition happened?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
For the first two and a half years, I was plunged into a level of consciousness at the very bottom of the personal psyche—a dimension Stan calls the perinatal level of consciousness. It’s the interface between the limits of physical consciousness and the beginning of spiritual consciousness. Typically, people relive their own birth and their fear of death. Birth and death are the revolving door of life—we get here by being born and leave time and space by dying. In order for consciousness to expand beyond time-space reality, one has to confront all the conditioning that tells us we are a time-space self: “I am my egoic physical body-mind.” Many of us believe nothing happens when we die. We have fears and anxieties surrounding death, and in confronting these perinatal dynamics, one engages those fears—that the universe is ultimately meaningless, that it destroys our attempts to do something of enduring value. One often re-experiences one’s birth.</p>
<p>Eventually, if you keep at it, this culminates in an existential crisis often called ego death. Your physical identity is shattered, and you transition into a deeper level of spiritual reality beyond the parameters of physical consciousness. This is common in mystical and psychedelic traditions.</p>
<p>What happened next shifted my perspective. I expected that after ego death I would have unfettered access to spiritual reality. Instead, the purification process began again at a deeper level. I was drawn into exercises of vast collective suffering—tremendous pain and physical ordeals—like being swallowed by Dante’s Inferno. This went on session after session for two years, deeper into landscapes of horrific pain and brutality far beyond anything my life had touched.</p>
<p>At first I thought this represented a deeper ego death. In time I concluded it wasn’t about cleansing my personal psyche. Somehow, a shift had taken place and the focus had become the healing of the entire human species. I was tapping into festering fields of pain within the collective unconscious—war, drought, violence—experiences that aggregate and burden the collective psyche, just as individual trauma burdens the personal psyche. I had been given the opportunity, and I volunteered, to cooperate with a process in which, by making these vast tracts of pain conscious, they were being lifted out of the collective psyche, just as confronting personal trauma lifts it from one’s system.</p>
<p>After two years there was a crescendo of this process—a huge healing—which then threw me into a still deeper level of consciousness. I began to understand that there are cycles of death and rebirth in this work, and that the cycles deepen as the level of consciousness deepens. The first level of healing and cleansing was at the perinatal, personal level. The second was at the collective level. Then there were levels deeper still. This cycle of death and rebirth—purification and transformation—repeats multiple times if you keep going into the great expanse.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
What words would you use to describe the levels you went to beyond the personal and collective?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Looking back, I divided the journey into five broad, overlapping categories: working at the level of personal mind; working at the level of the collective mind; moving into archetypal reality beyond the collective psyche; then the level of causal reality, or the One Mind, where the entire universe moves as one; and beyond that, entering—during the last five years—what I came to call the Diamond Luminosity: an exceptionally clear, hyper-hyper-clear expression of pure light. When I looked for correlations in spiritual traditions, in Buddhism I think this is what they call Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality out of which existence springs. So: personal mind, collective mind, archetypal mind, the One Mind, and Diamond Luminosity.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
I'd like to return to that. One of the themes in your work is giving a really persuasive case for reincarnation. I already sort of believed in reincarnation from my own explorations, but you make a really solid case for it. You wrote a book, Life Cycles, about it, and then later on, in your most recent book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe, you said there were things you didn’t quite get to in that book. Could you describe your current understanding of reincarnation?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
As a philosopher, I think reincarnation is a fundamental concept to examine, because philosophical traditions diverge: if you believe there is no reincarnation versus if you believe there is, you end up with two different understandings of reality. Early in my academic career, I looked seriously at whether there is empirical evidence for reincarnation. Fifty years ago, this evidence did not exist, but today it does. I think we have ample empirical evidence that reincarnation is a simple fact of life.</p>
<p>The primary work here comes from Ian Stevenson’s studies of young children around the world who have spontaneous, detailed memories of previous lifetimes. Where possible, these memories have been verified, and the possibility that they could have been acquired through ordinary means has been carefully eliminated. In addition, evidence from past-life therapy strengthens the philosophical case. That doesn’t mean we understand how it takes place—we don’t understand the physics of it. We may even have an incomplete understanding of its purpose. I’ve come to see the classic Eastern interpretation as a first approximation, not the complete story.</p>
<p>Because of this available evidence, my first book presented the evidence and then asked: so what? If reincarnation is a fact of life, what does this tell us about how the universe works? The classic story I used is the story of the individual soul making choices, inheriting the consequences of those choices, out of which we then make new choices. There’s a learning cycle—choosing and inheriting—within a lifetime and across multiple lifetimes. It’s the story of the individual becoming more spiritually mature, more capable, more compassionate, more talented. It’s an individual story.</p>
<p>What I found in my psychedelic work, when I opened into the collective psyche and deep collective fields of consciousness, is that in addition to this individual story, there is a collective story. The entire human species, in some fundamental ways, operates as a single organism. There is an intelligence operating within the entire species, and our individual incarnations are profoundly and subtly integrated into the evolution of the species. The intelligence of the species manifests in patterns of detoxification, purification, and breakthrough that are happening collectively. So it isn’t just individual choices driving it all; there are also collective choices and a collective intelligence driving the process.</p>
<p>I also came into a series of experiences that gave me a different understanding of where reincarnation is taking humanity. The classic Eastern vision is that reincarnation evolves you to a certain point until you have a core breakthrough—moksha or nirvana—where you escape ego and samsara, escaping physical existence. The goal becomes to achieve spiritual fruition and then graduate from space-time to some off-planet paradise, whether it’s the Muslim garden, the Christian heaven, or the Buddha Pure Land. But that leaves unanswered: what is the purpose of time and space? That might have been acceptable when we thought time and space had been around only a few thousand years. Now we understand we’re talking billions of years of evolution. It doesn’t seem satisfying to say that after billions of years, and millions of years of human evolution—the work of learning to walk upright, use tools—and only about 5,000 years since we became conscious of the deep common ground of the psyche, that as soon as we become aware of our essential nature, the goal is simply to leave.</p>
<p>What happened in my sessions was quite different. I had done past-life therapy before—hypnotherapy, healing and integrating a dozen or so of my former lives. But in one pivotal session, my former lives started coming into me. It was like wrapping filaments of white light around a kite spool—more and more consciousness, more and more lives coming into me. They had been healed, they came into me, and they reached a point where they fused—these individual lives fused into one life. When they fused, there was an explosion of diamond light from my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of awareness beyond anything I had known. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had previously known. I came to understand this as the birth of the Diamond Soul. I language it this way—other people give it different words—but the idea is that reincarnation doesn’t just grow us step by step. There comes a time when our entire history aggregates and integrates into a single consciousness, and that single consciousness becomes one’s working identity.</p>
<p>The soul is being born inside history. And by “soul,” I think there are ways of understanding it that are completely compatible with the Buddhist teaching on anatta and no-self. This is not an egoic soul; it’s not bounded or inherently self-centered in its appetites. Once the soul emerges, there’s a tremendous breadth of intellect, breadth of compassion, and deep communion with the spiritual forces of the universe.</p>
<p>So the goal of reincarnation is not simply to evolve us to the point where we awaken and leave. The goal is to evolve us into the next iteration of human evolution: a species of incarnate souls, so we are never tempted to take the private ego as our true identity. We know ourselves to be a time traveler. We know ourselves to be deeper than that, and we know we have kinship relations with thousands of people and with the Earth. We know the Earth we leave will be the Earth we inherit in our next incarnation. Souls live on Earth differently than egos do. I think that’s the pivot we’re making now.</p>
<p>I understand why, four or five thousand years ago in the Axial Age, when we first discovered spiritual reality—which is so much more satisfying than time-space reality—an “up and out” cosmology developed: the purpose is to go home; we don’t belong here; this is our fallen condition. I understand that, but I think it’s an incomplete understanding of the deeper project of creation. The project of creation is to awaken and bring heaven to earth, to live the Buddha world here inside our physical existence.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
In my own life, I’ve been really moved by Buddhism and other traditions. I find what you’re saying compelling: there was truth in the teachings of the Axial Age, and yet also incompleteness. How would you describe the relationship between your current perspective and the teachings we’ve received from the past—perhaps Buddhism in particular?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Once again, I want to emphasize that the work I did is a path of temporary immersion. Temporary immersion does not easily or conventionally lead to permanent shifts in awareness. You have to do a lot of spiritual practice before what we experience in an amplified psychedelic state can become our ordinary consciousness.</p>
<p>The great masters of the spiritual traditions, and of Buddhism in particular, have always been my heroes. Their teachings have been my guiding light for how to engage psychedelic states responsibly, and how to invest in them in ways that can be converted into long-term transformations of one’s baseline consciousness. Truly, all honor to the great beings of these traditions.</p>
<p>At the same time, we know there is patriarchy in Buddhist traditions, and Buddhism has had to clear itself of it, just as other traditions have. I think there are other limitations: a subtle disparagement of the physical body and nature, which Buddhism itself is becoming aware of and is having to transcend. There are elements within Buddhism with a deep appreciation of the joy of living Buddha-nature, seeing that Buddha-nature is intended to be lived within time and space—that samsara truly is nirvana when understood completely. Nirvana does not require abandoning samsara but is coherent with it. Yet the mainstream, popular sources still often have an “up and out” cosmology—also present in Christianity: you achieve salvation and then escape to heaven.</p>
<p>As a historian, I see this as understanding the historical context within which these great masters were working, which both helped and hindered them in giving full expression to their realization. And even within an incomplete cosmology, the levels of spiritual realization achieved are extraordinary. What the great mahasiddhas can do is deserving of all respect. So in criticizing the cosmology, I’m not criticizing the level of realization.</p>
<p>I also want to emphasize: having unusually deep spiritual experiences in a psychedelic state is not the same as stabilizing those experiences in ordinary consciousness. There is still a great deal of work to do before such states can become abiding in any serious sense. I always want to qualify insights that emerge in psychedelic work.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
Yes, and certainly for myself, this comes from a place of deep respect. Buddhism is like my home in a certain way, and I appreciate your clarifications. You spoke earlier about your spiritual practice and the different traditions you’ve been exposed to. It seems like you found a home in Vajrayana Buddhism—is that right?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It is, and it’s a kind of modified Vajrayana. I did intense Vajrayana practice for a number of years, and I’ve modified it from my psychedelic experiences. It’s not that I’ve realized those states, but I have an understanding and experiential memory of those levels of reality. They live inside me as active memories. I’ve developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols.</p>
<p>For example, in classic Vajrayana we distinguish between the Samaya Safa and the Jnana sattva. The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa. The living memory of the diamond luminosity is, for me, a more effective spiritual vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.</p>
<p>I also have a sense—because I’ve “died” so many times and gone where I will go when I die physically—that I feel very comfortable with that domain. We’re told over and over that we practice to prepare for the moment of death because it has great potential for accelerating our evolution. I agree. My psychedelic practice has been done in a way to prepare me for the moment of death. The result is that I feel comfortable with death and with navigating what comes after, because I feel I’ve already encountered it in many ways.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
What do you think it was about Vajrayana Buddhism that attracted you and felt like a home?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It was my first wife, Carol—my sitter in my sessions and a clinical psychologist—who really brought me into Vajrayana. I was more interested in the Zen tradition. I wasn’t interested in all the bells, candles, incense, and fanfare that comes with Vajrayana. But she went there, and I followed her. Through her, I met teachers gathering at the Tara Mandala Buddhist retreat center—Lama sutra malayonis established the center in Colorado—and I began to study there and go into retreats with that lineage. I met their lineage of awakened beings, and they made a deep impression on me. If my karma had introduced me to the great awakened beings of the Zen lineage, I could have gone there just as easily. It was the opportunity to meet these beings and receive teachings that made a large impression.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
Coming back to your explorations, you use the phrase “deep time.” Can you say what you mean by that?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
When I first began to enter the ocean of suffering—after ego death, moving into episodes of collective anguish—each session tended to divide into two halves: a purification half followed by an ecstatic half. If you submit to the purification, it crescendos to a breakthrough and then you’re spun into a transpersonal section of ecstatic teachings.</p>
<p>After very intense collective purification, I began entering states of consciousness that were extremely novel for me. I first called it “whole time,” then “deep time.” I began to experience my entire life, start to finish, as a completed whole. It was like every time-moment in my life was a tree, and I experienced the whole of my life as a single tree. I experienced my old age, my middle age; I experienced the themes of my life as simultaneously present. This was such a dramatic expansion of my cognitive frame that after the session I couldn’t hold it—it disappeared. But with repetition, going back into that state again and again—seven sessions over a year—I learned to stabilize it, remember it, and become cognitively competent in deep time.</p>
<p>I came to believe there are multiple modalities of time operating within the universe. Later, going deeper toward archetypal reality, I experienced larger swaths of time than just my personal life—the first was about a hundred years, then whole time in 100,000-year increments, and maybe even larger. Not only was my sense of time expanding, but the being having the experience was expanding. It’s not like a disembodied ego visits a transpersonal reality and brings it back. Your ego is shattered and dissolves into a deeper level of consciousness, and it is that deeper level that opens into deeper modalities of time. Still deeper, you literally become a different being for hours at a time. Dissolved into the fabric of existence, you sometimes have experiences of how existence itself experiences time.</p>
<p>Some trends in physics hypothesize, as string theory does for dimensions beyond time and space, that there are different modalities of time. I don’t know the exact relationship to my experiences, but my experience is that as you go to the edges of space-time, you enter different modalities of time, and different insights emerge there. I understand how absurd this can sound to academic and scientific colleagues who think the universe works within linear time. I think the edge of quantum thinking goes beyond that—and certainly my psychospiritual experiences did. Time became very porous in my work, as did all boundaries.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
I imagine it’s difficult to put into words, but is there anything more you can say about what the experience is like—either seeing the whole of your personal life at once, or the larger scales?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Once you acclimate to it, it’s not confusing at all. It’s very clear—simply a different way of relating to time. Insights emerge out of an extended fabric of time. At the personal level, experiencing my life as a completed whole naturally gave me a deeper understanding of its structure and themes. I saw how recurring issues in my philosophical inquiry and personal life would consume me throughout my life. I could feel my future—not all the details, but as though all time-moments congealed to give a deep reading of what the substance of my life is about.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you dissolve into the human species and a large swath of time—hundreds of thousands of years—insights arise about the developmental stages of human evolution. I began to have experiences not just of my personal future but of humanity’s future. I know that can sound arrogant, but it’s natural that when you dissolve into the full species-mind and deep time simultaneously, aspects of the species’ developmental future come into view. You don’t experience it as something yet to be; you experience it as something that already has been—and both are held simultaneously. It is yet to be, and it also has been. So it has a certainty about it. I don’t know how to reconcile all of this with free will and related questions, but a breadth of understanding opens: not only about my personal life, but about the time in history humanity has entered—an evolutionary pivot with particular characteristics of crisis and breakthrough. These become visible when you shed the limitations of linear time and enter deeper dimensions of time.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
I was definitely thinking about free will just now. It’s a long debate, but what sensibilities did these experiences give you about your own life and free will? Having a sense of your whole life, did you feel fated to make certain choices, or that you had free will? How did that impact you personally?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Free will is tricky, and much of our popular discussion skim the surface. Advocates of free will tend to understate the level of conditioning that qualifies our freedom, and determinists often conclude our choices are so highly conditioned that there really isn’t free will. I don’t find either camp satisfying.</p>
<p>To me, one of the themes that has come through repeatedly in my work is that we do have free will. It’s conditioned, but within those conditions we have the opportunity to make choices. If we didn’t, we wouldn’t truly be learning. If incarnation were simply inheriting a predetermined fate, we’d just be going through mechanical actualization. A genuine learning adventure requires the possibility of mistakes and real crossroads—A or B—with consequences.</p>
<p>The universe wants us to learn. Freedom is an absolutely important quality. At early stages there is very little freedom—when grass grows, it doesn’t have much freedom in responding to photosynthesis. As consciousness develops, more choice enters the picture. As individuation deepens, the cycle of learning becomes more important. Our choices remain conditioned, but the conditioning gets lighter, and the sense of freedom to make clear choices emerges.</p>
<p>To make free, clear choices requires stepping out of the conditioning of our minds. The meditation traditions are well aware of this. When we quiet the mind, we become very aware of all the voices inside us and the layers of conditioning shaping our awareness. We have to let them exhaust themselves. As we do, clarity—unconditioned consciousness—dawns. That distinct experience becomes highly desirable to cultivate: to enter our true, unconditioned nature.</p>
<p>These insights replicate in psychedelic work as well. One encounters conditioning—throwing off layer after layer, purifying, like one long ngöndro, one long practice of purification to uncover what is already there but covered over. In cosmological exploration, you go beyond simply uncovering what’s there, but shedding conditioning remains core to having a deeper experience of the clarity present in the awakened mind.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
Can you say more about the visions you had for humanity’s future and the time that we’re in?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
This was one of the great surprises for me, because I never expected anything like this to emerge in my work. I thought it was about personal transformation, even personal enlightenment. I never imagined that the evolution of the species would become such a dominant theme. Going back to about halfway through the work in the early ’90s, starting in 1991, I began to have a series of visions—just dropped into my sessions—that humanity was coming to a turning point, a true before-and-after point in history. We were entering a time of intense purification, essentially purifying the human psyche of the sins of our fathers—lifting the conditioning of the past to make us more receptive to, and capable of internalizing, the spiritual infusion, insights, and power becoming available at this time in history. There was a tremendous sense of rebirth coming.</p>
<p>All of this was contextualized within an initial experience of creation as love. The act of creation—the Big Bang—is not simply an act of power or intelligence; it is an act of love. Creation itself is an act of cosmic love. Therefore all the suffering since the Big Bang—especially in the human story—takes place in the context of love. This is not something being done to us. We are not guilty in some fundamental way. This is part of a creative process we entered into voluntarily. It’s hard, very difficult, but it is a noble gift that we are giving to the creative process—to participate in the evolution of this species at such an early and barbaric time in its life, when we do terrible things to each other. All of this was coming to a crescendo, a moment where we would pivot into a higher order of spiritual awareness and psycho-spiritual realization.</p>
<p>This went on for years, and I eventually cataloged them in a section of the book I call “Visions of Awakening”—six core visions—showing that creative intelligence was trying not just to awaken individuals, but to awaken the entire species. It gave me no insight into how it was going to pull this off. I had no idea how a breakthrough of that magnitude in human evolution could happen. Then right before Christmas in 1995, I had a session in which I was taken into deep time. I dissolved into the species—there was no more Chris Bache—and experienced the death and rebirth of humanity in a transtemporal context.</p>
<p>I experienced a time of increasing destabilization, of chaos and tumultuous unraveling. The systems of life were being unraveled. There seemed to be wave after wave of ecological crises that eventually triggered a global systems crisis—a breakdown of structures at deeper and deeper levels, an unraveling of life. We were losing control. We couldn’t fix our way out of this. It was a profound shattering of life as we had known it.</p>
<p>In the midst of this—at the point where it looked like we were all going to die—it was as if a storm passed over an island, like a hurricane over a Pacific island. The metaphorical winds began to subside. The worst of the crisis passed, and we began to pick ourselves up off our knees. As we rebuilt and reconnected on the other side, we found we were different beings. We were not the same as when we entered the crisis. Something happens in this multi-generational process. I don’t have details of when, where, or how—it wasn’t that kind of experience. It was the fact of a profound global systems crisis that would break through deep layers of conditioning in the human heart, tearing away self-centered behaviors not only of individuals but of culture. It breaks us down, and in moving through it we discover values inside our being—new values, insights, ways of being in the world and with each other.</p>
<p>This wasn’t simply the birth of an ecologically responsible civilization or a cultural rebirth. It represented a shift in the core structure of the human psyche, a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. In asking, “What is this future human that is so much more than the present human?” I think it is the emergence of the diamond soul in history. We’ve been growing and gestating the diamond soul for incarnation after incarnation for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years. The birth of the diamond soul in history is a relatively short, traumatic, convulsive period. Gestation is long; birth is short.</p>
<p>We’re entering a time where we can no longer afford the luxury of a planet run by egos—even well-intentioned egos. We have to grow up into our deeper spiritual identity. That deeper identity is the diamond soul—or the soul, however you want to language it. I think we’ve entered the very early stages of an unraveling of life as we’ve known it and are moving into a future where it’s really important to have a vision. That’s why, at the end of the book, I focus on the visions I was given of the future human. If we don’t understand what’s going on—what nature is producing—the pain will be so intense that we could fall into despair and a terrible apocalyptic interpretation that would be counter to our survival. We need a deep understanding of where nature is taking us.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
How does this phrase you use—diamond soul—relate to the Diamond Luminosity that you began to experience in your sessions? Is it the same thing or something different?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think it’s a variation of the same thing. The Diamond Luminosity I experienced is, I believe, a level of reality in the cosmos. In Buddhist terminology, I’d describe it as an extra-samsaric reality—beyond cyclic existence, beyond the Bardo. There are many layers of the Bardo—the low animal hell realms, the high deity realms—but the Diamond Luminosity is beyond all of those. There is a clear phenomenological difference between the high deity realms and then moving into the Diamond Luminosity, which is beyond all deities, archetypes, or any dimension we normally encounter.</p>
<p>When the soul congealed in my being in the Diamond Luminosity—when the soul exploded from my chest—it had that same quality of light as the Diamond Luminosity but at a slightly lower intensity. Let me back up. We experience light many times in psychedelic journeys. It’s common: going through ego death, entering light; entering collective dimensions, experiencing dimensions of light. I had known light many times. “Diamond Luminosity” is not just a fancy metaphor. I learned there are many degrees and dimensions of light, and the Diamond Luminosity is an exceptionally pure, exceptionally clear dimension of light. I think the diamond soul, as an assay light being, is a manifestation of this quality of light inside individuated existence. So on the one hand it’s the same, and on the other it’s a variation. I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily identical, but it’s very close.</p>
<p>I will say that over five years of Diamond Luminosity work, I only entered what I call the Diamond Luminosity four times—about once a year for four years. I would do very intense purification for session after session, tap into the Diamond Luminosity, then be brought back for another year of very intense purification before being brought back into it again. It wasn’t easy to access, and even once gained, I only touched that reality four times in its total purity.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
From the way you’re describing it, I’m getting a sense of almost a different kind of humanity—like the scientific name for humanity is Homo sapiens, and maybe there’s a “diamond human.” I don’t know the Latin for diamond, but is that consistent with what you’re saying?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It is. People give it different names. Some call it Homo noeticus—a knowing humanity; homo spiritualis; some call it homo luminance—a light humanity. Many of us have the intuition that humanity is going into a next iteration. About 100,000 years ago the size of our brain increased roughly 50% in a very short period of time. Suddenly we were dealing with a much larger brain. Nature triggered it—gave us bigger equipment. Something like that is happening now. We’re cooperating with an evolutionary process, but we’re not driving it. Nature is driving the process and bringing us into this new condition.</p>
<p>Many indigenous cultures have the intuition of this time of global crisis followed by breakthrough. There’s no absolute certainty we will survive birth; it’s a dangerous time. Not all fetuses survive the birth process. So it’s not a foregone conclusion, but so many beings have had this intuition and bring different names to describe the future human.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
There’s a term you borrow from Grof—COEX systems—and then you describe meta-COEX systems. A lot of what you’re talking about seems related. Could you verbally describe what those are and explain them a little?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
What Stan found is that the psyche organizes its experiences—its memories—into clusters, thematically integrated clusters. All our experiences of abandonment, for example, form one tight experiential cluster he calls a COEX system—a system of condensed experience. Carl Jung called it a complex. We can have COEX systems around anger, fear, unrequited love. It’s like taking a novel, highlighting all the emotions in different colors, cutting up the novel, and putting all the green in one pile, all the yellow in another, all the red in another. When we encounter a problem in the psyche, we don’t encounter one instance of it; we encounter a cluster of experiences that date back sometimes to our birth and sometimes to former lives. We melt this problem in layers—the less problematic outer layers first—until we eventually get to the core, the seed problem, which may date from this lifetime, from birth, or from a former lifetime, and we dissolve the COEX system.</p>
<p>My experience is that the same is true for the collective psyche—that the mind of the universe and the mind of our species store history in massive thematic clusters. All the trauma associated with war; with drought and dying on the plains; male–female violence; patterns of violence, pain, suffering, fear of death—these don’t exist as free-floating private memories within the Bardo of our individual souls. The collective psyche aggregates its history into massive collective structures I call meta-COEX systems. So you have COEX systems within the personal psyche and meta-COEX systems within the collective psyche. I think when I was moved into the ocean of suffering, my system was engaging meta-COEX systems within the collective psyche and making some small contribution to removing those clusters—not all of them, certainly not any one all the way down. This is the work of generations, and all spiritual traditions—saints, sages, contemplatives—tap into levels of suffering that are not personal. That’s why bodhichitta—the will to save all sentient beings—is the only appropriate motivation for spiritual practice. You quickly realize this is not a private game. We’re in this together. It’s a collective evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
What is this species aiming at, as you understand it?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I don’t know that we can identify a fixed aim, except that we are constantly growing. If anything, we are aiming at growing. If we identify what we’re growing to, we’re only identifying the next stage. It’s taken 13.7 billion years to get here, and assuming we survive this crisis, we’ll be at it for millions and billions more. Whatever this crisis is—growing beyond ego, beyond the narrow confines of self-clinging, into a larger sense of being and presence in the universe and communion with the universe—that’s just the next phase. Then there will be more thresholds and challenges into yet another phase.</p>
<p>If I step back and ask, “What is the project?” I think the project is to grow and become more than we were before. It’s a process description, not a content description. On the short term, all spiritual teachings tell us the essence of the individual is the same as the essence of the totality—Atman is Brahman. Our Buddha nature, our awakened nature, is the same as the Buddha nature of all things. When one awakens to one’s essential nature, you awaken to the love, compassion, and power that created and manifests the universe. There are many stages: first the joy of awakening, then learning how to actualize it so one’s life becomes a conscious manifestation of our essential nature in the physical world.</p>
<p>I don’t want to reduce this to simplistic philosophies like “you become what you love” or “as you think, so you become,” but there is a feedback process between what we put out and what comes back at a deep psycho-spiritual level. Once you understand and take responsibility for that process, you begin to consciously manifest your chosen destiny rather than inherit a destiny created by your unconscious. We are becoming, at this stage, conscious creators of our own destiny. We’re learning how to become creators because our nature is the creative principle—the same nature that manifested the physical universe. First discover, then actualize, then participate consciously in creation inside time and space. What we do with that as a species—imagine what we can do operating from that kind of consciousness.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
I’m getting the sense—coming back to what might be incomplete about Buddhism or earlier teachings—that the sensibility I received was: existence is a cycle of birth and death that is, in some ways, hellish, and you should escape. From what I’m hearing, both individually and collectively, the aim isn’t to escape but to learn, grow, evolve, increase complexity and nuance and understanding of oneself and the universe, and really to manifest that, rather than just getting out or eradicating it.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes, I think so. In the end, once we make this transition, we understand that what we have escaped is not time and space, but a constricted consciousness associated with living inside time and space. When that bubble pops—when we truly escape that small world—we experience time and space completely differently: as the Buddha world, as Buddha nature.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
If you don’t mind me asking, what is your everyday consciousness like now after all of these experiences and explorations?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I wish I could tell you I’m a fully enlightened being cruising the cosmic planes all the time, but that’s not the case. Integrating these experiences is a lifelong undertaking. In the 20 years after I stopped this work, I’ve come to appreciate how large the integration process is—even to the point that I don’t think we really know how entering these deep levels of reality is influencing us as human beings. We’re just scratching the surface. If we’re working therapeutically and bringing out issues from the personal unconscious, we have a model for integration. If we go deeper and have spiritual experiences of the intelligence running through life, we have spiritual models. But when we go really deep—beyond space and time, dissolving into the luminous body of creation—how are those experiences integrated in us?</p>
<p>In the end, I don’t think you can integrate the infinite into the finite. The only thing you can do is integrate your finite existence into infinity. That brings us back to the nuts and bolts of spiritual practice: you must remove from your being everything that keeps you smaller than the reality you seek to enter. That’s a lifelong undertaking. I used to think that maybe by the end of my lifetime I would have succeeded in integrating all of this. Now I think that’s too optimistic. This work changed not only my present lifetime; it changed the trajectory of my entire soul’s evolution.</p>
<p>I’ve also come to the conclusion that I pushed myself harder and farther than was wise for me. It’s possible to go too deep in one lifetime. It’s not that the suffering is problematic, or the pain inherent in deep purification. It’s the joy—the ecstasy—of being dissolved into unspeakable beauty and intelligence, which can make physical existence feel dried up, not worth living. I think I suffered from that after stopping my work. I’ve had to make conscious lifestyle choices to manage the memories that now live within me. I don’t recommend doing it the way I did. It’s very demanding, and I don’t think I needed to do it this way. If I were starting over, I would be gentler—have gentler ambitions, and take more care of this precious body–mind.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
What would that look like, practically—to be gentler?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Fewer high-dose sessions. If you’re working with psychedelics, integrate a substance like LSD—which pushes the high cosmological ceiling—with substances like psilocybin or ayahuasca, which tend to be more body-grounded, staying closer to the emotional, textured body. And always integrate intermittent psychedelic work with daily spiritual practice. The more I’ve moved in this direction, the more I’ve come to understand that daily practice is absolutely essential to handle the enormous swings of energy and insight that open in psychedelic work.</p>
<p>One reason I pushed as hard as I did is I had adopted what I’ve learned is a false model—the idea that the purpose was to reach a particular state: the awakened state, to go home, to dissolve into the body of God, or the meta-cosmic void. What I found is that there are many degrees of oneness and even of the void, and no matter how deep I went there were dimensions beyond. The key came in the 50th session, when I was in the Diamond Luminosity as deeply as I would ever go. Right in the middle of that, my field opened and I saw reality far into the distance filled with a light greater than the Diamond Luminosity. A beam of light hit me and shattered my mind. That’s when I realized it’s an infinite progression. The idea of “getting to the end” underestimates the breadth of what we’re dealing with.</p>
<p>Once I understood it’s not about reaching a particular condition, I became more patient. You open up, bring as much of that reality into your life as you can, then you crunch it, sit on it, integrate it into daily life. I’d be gentler and have more modest expectations. I’m more patient with our human psycho-spiritual evolution than I was as a young man.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
What would you recommend to someone embarking on a similar journey if they were inspired by your work?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Don’t do it—please. Honestly, don’t do it the way I did it. I get lots of letters from people who’ve never done psychedelics but know what I’m speaking about through decades of meditation. Psychedelics are not unique in opening these experiences. My recommendation: go slow. Always work within a therapeutic modality. Pay a lot of attention to set and setting—not only on the day of sessions, but because when you do this work, everyone around you is impacted: family, friends. I found my students were being drawn into my psychedelic practice. I wrote The Living Classroom to describe how what I thought was a private spiritual practice was registering and impacting the lives of my students. Consciousness is like water in a lake: you throw in a rock and ripples spread. It’s natural that people are touched.</p>
<p>Be gentler. This is not a recreational undertaking. It’s a serious, lifelong commitment. It’s wiser to explore closer to home, in ways that keep the journey focused on the nuts and bolts of daily life. I have more respect for using psychedelics as therapy and for spiritual awakening—and it’s a relatively rare individual who has the circumstances and constitution to go as deep as I did. There are dangers. If you open up under less than ideal circumstances—mixing it up with other people, at dance raves—you can open prematurely, fail to close, and hurt yourself, sometimes with long-term damage that may take years to recover. This is not an end-run around traditional spirituality. It’s not an easy path. It’s tricky and potentially dangerous, and you have to be very cautious when working with mind amplifiers.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
I imagine the kind of person drawn to doing the work you did wouldn’t take your advice to not do it. They might take your advice to be gentler, but they might still be bullish and say, “I’m going to do it anyway.”</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
One of my hopes is that by seeing what I learned—by seeing the description of the universe I was able to bring back—people’s existential longing to know these things might be satisfied so they don’t have to go there. They can be more comfortable living within a more inwardly textured, closer-to-Earth spiritual practice. When people went to the moon, it satisfied so many who had that longing but would never make the trip—just to see the pictures and what it was like. I think something similar can happen with spiritual practice.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
That’s a good metaphor. It describes my own experience reading your book. I’m grateful for the picture of the Earth taken from the moon—it’s as if you took that kind of picture for us, and it’s a really beautiful one. Earthrise, I think it’s called. I’m curious: at this time there’s a larger contemporary renaissance in psychedelics. What do you make of that movement, and what’s happening there more broadly?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think it's very exciting, and I think it's about time. I'm very glad that we're going back in the direction of integrating psychedelics into our culture. Right now, the psychedelic renaissance is focused on therapeutic healing. It's by demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of these amplifying substances that we are opening the door to these substances in our culture—by demonstrating that they help us deal with post-traumatic stress, depression, alcohol addiction, and death anxiety; by healing us of the wounds of life. We are demonstrating that these substances have therapeutic value and efficacy. And we're also taking pictures of how the brain behaves on psychedelics, and we're doing this in very carefully controlled studies, with control groups versus testing groups, and so on and so forth. This is all really important. I think it's a very important stage, but I do see it as only a stage.</p>
<p>What we're going to find is the same thing we found in the early decades of the psychedelic movement: this amplification of the psyche, which allows us to heal the wounds of the personal psyche—when continued—gives us access to deeper and deeper dimensions of consciousness. Now, there is a resistance to these deeper dimensions right now because of our metaphysical commitment to materialism. Our, of course, pre-quantum commitment is to believe that only things which are physical are real. Therefore, when someone is having an experience of something which goes beyond physical reality, we call the substances that open up these experiences hallucinogens, because a hallucination is something which is not real. It feels real, but it's not real. But I think, when better understood, these substances are mind amplifiers. They are psychedelics—mind openers. Once we consolidate and provide sufficient evidence for the healing potential of these substances, we will then begin to harness their deeper manifesting potential, their philosophical potential.</p>
<p>I think psychedelics represent an enormous philosophical revolution because they allow those of us who have modest capacities to have temporary access to states of awareness and states of reality that lie far beyond space-time—awareness that has profound metaphysical and philosophical implications. I mean, a mystical experience does not a mystic make—that's paraphrasing Huston Smith—and that's true, but a mystical experience does a materialist unmake. I think it can undo some of the metaphysical constrictions of our era and open us up to a deeper understanding of what's actually taking place. Once you dissolve into the intelligence of the universe—the intelligence of the mind of the universe—and into the compassionate center of the mind of the universe, it radically transforms your understanding of what life is about, what we are doing here, what the process is. That has enormous ramifications, and I think we will be moving in that direction, but first we have to earn the right, in a way. We have to earn that access through demonstrating its clinical efficacy.</p>
<p>I am not a clinician. I'm not a psychologist. I was not primarily interested in healing. I was trained as a philosopher of religion, and I simply could not wait for us to get to this point in time. If I had waited for us to get to this point in time, I would have missed the opportunity of a lifetime. So I did the work I did underground, undercover, privately, quietly. I wish I didn't have to. I wish I could have done it publicly. I wish I could have been in public discussion during all this time. But I did it with the belief, as the early researchers did, that there would come a time when we would reclaim these sacraments and begin to systematically harness their deeper potential. And I think that's where we're going.</p>
<p>There is a movement among the pharmaceutical industry that wants to make money off these substances, to try to strip the magic out of the mushrooms—to basically extract substances which come from the psychedelic substances but do not induce some of the more exotic or demanding states of consciousness that these substances do in their natural state—so that they can give us a pill which you can take every day, and they can sell us every day. You can't make money on psychedelics because you don't use enough of them. You only use them intermittently, and the healing effect is so powerful that you don't need to take them every day. The pharmaceutical industry wants to make money off of them, and I think that's a danger; we have to really watch that.</p>
<p>I also think the medicalization of psychedelics is a danger. It's understandable that it's important for the scientists to maintain research in these early years, but I think entering into these states of consciousness is a human right, and I don't think it belongs under the governance of the medical community only. I think we're going to come to a point where we recognize that there is a broader community of specialists who are skilled in navigating these landscapes, who are not necessarily MDs and PhDs.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
You know, in the movement, there are various organizations that have formed structured around what you call the therapeutic use of psychedelics. I wonder if, in the future, there might be institutions structured around the more philosophical or cosmological explorations of the kind that you did. What do you imagine those might look like?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think it's just a matter of time. In the near future, there will be clinics, institutional settings—hopefully deep in nature—where people who want to explore the deeper dimensions of their consciousness can go and do so under careful supervision. They can do so safely. There is backup, but they can do it with a nonclinical or nonmedical set of expectations. It's kind of like the transition from taking birth out of hospitals and turning it over to midwives, where you have medical care nearby if you need it, but birth is not a medical procedure. Birth is an entirely natural procedure. Likewise, opening up into deep levels of your online and the mind of the universe is not a medical procedure, even if medicine can be very helpful in the early stages. So I would anticipate that there will be organizations and structures—places where you can go to work with sacred medicines, various psychedelics—in a safe and effective manner that goes beyond therapeutic healing. I think it's just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
What kind of affordances might those structures need that might be different from a more clinical or medical therapeutic usage?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Well, first, we should recognize that humanity has already been doing this for thousands of years. Among indigenous people—among First Nations peoples in America, among the indigenous peoples in Brazil and in South America—they've been working ceremonially with sacred substances for hundreds, thousands of years. So we have a great deal of historical precedent for how to do this: how to open up not only individuals but whole communities into sacred space and bring the entire community back, putting them through a series of exercises so that they come back grounded—really well grounded—into their physical lives. We're not reinventing the wheel here. We have much to learn from indigenous people and First Nations people on how to work with these substances.</p>
<p>Now, there are screening criteria. You really want to screen people who are going into these states. There are some people who really should not be entering into these states, either because of physical health problems that they're carrying or psychological problems that they're carrying. It's just not a wise procedure to adopt if you're carrying certain tensions within your body and mind. So there is a place for screening. But these indigenous cultures knew that; they screened, even though they didn't have MDs screening the process. So it's simply a matter of building on what we're doing, incorporating the collected wisdom from indigenous cultures, and moving in to create our own unique forms.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
Coming back to the vision for humanity writ large, do you have any advice for the coming generations?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Well, the first thing I would say is that I think we know enough about the universe through reincarnation. If you really do your homework and you really look at the data—if you look at the data from near-death episode research, if you look at out-of-body research—we know enough, just enough, to know that we choose our incarnations. Before we were born, we made an informed choice of the life that we were being born into. At a time when we knew more than we remember now, we made the choice to live the life that we're living now—not that we could see every detail, but the fundamental core components we could see before we were born. And that means that whether or not we have conscious recall of that choice, I think we have reasons to be confident that we are where we belong as we enter this time in history; all of us, every one of us, has volunteered to participate in this very, very challenging time.</p>
<p>So the first level is to be centered in your core and to know that you don't have to run around or go someplace else or do something else; you are already planted on a trajectory that allows you to participate in this process. And this process is the process of the transformation of an entire culture. There is not one person or one type of person—not just a healer or therapist or artist—that's going to make this transition work. It's going to take all of us. It's going to take all the skills that humanity has to make this work. The real question is not how do we engage this process meaningfully so we can help us transform; the real question is, do we have the courage to do what we know we can do—what is at hand? Do we have the courage to really enter into this process consciously? And that means we basically have to have the courage to become the future human that we know the world needs. We need to become the human that the world needs in order to survive this crisis. We need to become more compassionate. We need to work to create a culture which is more egalitarian, more fair, more just. We need to show greater respect to the Earth and to our animal cousins who live on this Earth with us. We need to basically become in our own personal lives what humanity is trying to forge in our collective life—more aware—and that means doing inward practice. It also means doing outward practice of social transformation, clearing our own hearts of anything which keeps us small and helping clean out those things in our culture which keep our culture small and focused on values which are destroying the Earth.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
Thank you for sharing that, and also for answering all my questions and speaking on so many topics. I wonder if there's anything else that you'd like to say or talk about.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
We are coming into a hard time in history. We're coming into a time when, decade by decade, things are going to be getting worse and worse. There will be tremendous social anxiety and personal anxiety as we basically inherit the consequences of our abuse of the Earth for all the hundreds of years that we've been creating this extractive economy. But I hope, in everybody's own individual spiritual practices, one encounters enough of the universe to experience the profound wisdom—the great intelligence—that's behind this moment of transformation, and the great compassion and love that's behind this time in our history. We are not victims. This is not an accident. It is a time that calls for us to become the heroes that we have the possibility of being—nothing less than deep, deep heroic sacrifice and actualization is called for. But the universe will support us. Every time we make a change to live to the larger good, the universe will support us. It will help us overcome our shortcomings. This is the game of life. This is the great time of our life. In the end, we don't want to live a comfortable life so much as we want to live a life that's meaningful, and this is going to give us all an opportunity to live very meaningful lives.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
I appreciate you putting that in perspective and speaking so clearly about it. Thank you for your time today. It's been a real pleasure to speak with you.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Tazim, thank you for this conversation. Thank you for the conversations you've been having with many people, all focused on helping us know more and become more that we have the possibility of becoming. Thank you.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman: 
You're so welcome. It's an honor and a privilege. Thank you.</p></body></html>

Roger Walsh: 
Welcome to today's episode of Deep Transformation: Self, Society, Spirit. I'm Roger Walsh, and our co-host is the distinguished John Dupuy. Our guest today is the truly remarkable Chris Bache, an internationally known professor of philosophy and religious studies, an author, an award-winning teacher, and a widely respected speaker.

Usually, John and I try to stay in the background, but the topic today is so remarkable—the experiences described so literally out of this world—that I want to take a moment to give some context. Compared to the world’s many cultures, Western culture is unusual in a variety of ways. Researchers have recently described it as WEIRD—Western, industrialized, educated, rich, and democratic. So much research has been done on Westerners that it was assumed our characteristics were common across cultures. We now see that’s not true; other cultures have distinct richness and gifts.

One very important distinction between traditional Western culture and most of the world’s cultures is in their attitude toward and use of altered states of consciousness. The anthropologist who surveyed cultures worldwide found that over 90% of them have institutionalized altered states of consciousness: they use a variety of practices to induce specific states and then mine them for information and wisdom. They venerate states such as dreams, hypnosis, trance, and states induced by meditation, contemplation, yoga, and asceticism. Anthropologists call these cultures polyphasic, meaning they draw their understanding of reality from many phases of consciousness. By contrast, until very recently, Western culture has been largely monophasic, drawing its understanding of self and world almost entirely from the usual waking state, and often looking down on other states as inferior or deluded.

That began to change in the 1960s with the introduction of psychedelics to the culture, followed by an influx of Asian practices—meditation, yoga, contemplation—and later by the rediscovery of Western contemplative practices. Now we have in the West a wide variety of methods for inducing altered states. The West is undergoing a dramatic and very important, though often unrecognized, transformation from a monophasic to a polyphasic culture—one in which we research and draw our understanding of ourselves and reality from multiple states of consciousness.

One of the most potent ways to induce altered states is with psychedelics. That helped start our culture’s transformation and is now the subject of solid research at places like Johns Hopkins University, where scientists and clinicians are finding that psychedelics have a wide variety of therapeutic applications and, perhaps most surprising, very profound spiritual applications—capacities for inducing openings to radically altered states in which profound vistas and understandings become available. That isn’t new to the rest of the world, but it is new to Western research, and the findings are remarkable.

We’re very fortunate to have with us a man who has devoted his life to studying these curious chemicals—through academic research and comparative cultural analysis, and through a remarkably intense, long-lasting, carefully analyzed, and documented systematic exploration of their use. His experiences are nothing less than extraordinary and have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality and ourselves. He undertook a systematic investigation into the nature of reality, reflecting on his firsthand observations with the eye of a trained researcher, philosopher, theologian, and then integrated cross-cultural, historical, and religious evidence to illuminate his investigations.

Chris is a prolific author. His books include Dark Night, Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind. He has written about education as an award-winning educator in The Living Classroom. And most recently, he wrote the literally mind-boggling LSD and the Mind of the Universe, in which he details his explorations and the insights they opened for him.

That’s a long introduction, but it felt important to provide a context for the remarkable experiences Chris will be sharing. I’ve just spent the weekend revisiting the book. I read it a couple of years ago in manuscript and was impressed enough to write a review. Once again, I’ve had my worldview expanded and my understanding of myself and reality challenged, all in valuable ways. Chris, it’s a delight and an honor to be with you today. Thank you so much for being here.

Chris Bache: 
Thank you, Roger. It’s a very warm introduction, and I’m delighted to be here with you and John today. It’s a pleasure.

Roger Walsh: 
There are many places we can go with this, and hopefully we will—

John Dupuy: 
Allow me to give my two cents, please. Last week Roger asked me, “Would you like to have Christopher Bache on?” I was like, seriously—yes. I had less than a week, so I ordered the book and got the audio version—thank God—and that’s what kept me through the weekend.

I want to put out there: your book Dark Night, Early Dawn was one of the more important books I’ve ever read, personally. When your name came up again and we had the possibility to have this conversation—I’ll tell you, I can’t remember all the specifics after twenty years, but when I first read it, I had a stabilized understanding of nonduality based on my explorations—journeys, vision questing, fasting, prayer, meditation. I kind of “got it,” but the way you expressed it, something in that book consolidated it, and it’s been accessible to me in a stable form ever since. That’s a tremendous gift.

This new book I’ve been listening to is unlike anything I’ve experienced. It’s either you’re absolutely sane or you’re completely insane. My experiences along these lines say this really stinks of deep truth. And the very human, humble way you present it—self-revelatory about what’s going on in your personal life and how you did it—someone with an open mind ends up trusting you. I felt in the hands of somebody I could listen to.

From there it goes very big. This may be a bringing together of everything we’ve been working on in our generation, but in a new holistic religious-scientific-everything vision that transforms us—from a reality where a lot of us are killing ourselves or living in deep depression, to an absolutely 1,000% changed view of reality. I’m not using that as hyperbole; it’s that big, that radical. Pay attention to this.

Chris Bache: 
Thank you. Your description, John, touches me very deeply, and it really moves me that something I’ve written influenced your experience of nonduality. Thank you.

Roger Walsh: 
Beautiful. Chris, I think everyone will want to know what motivated you to begin this extraordinary quest. And what was the nature of what you actually did to induce these experiences?

Chris Bache: 
All my life, I’ve had a deep passion to understand our universe. I was in the seminary starting in high school, training to be a Catholic priest. I left that, got a degree in theology from Notre Dame, then studied at Cambridge and Brown, finishing at Brown in philosophy of religion—by then an absolutely convinced agnostic with strong atheistic inclinations. But the passion to understand what’s real—why there’s so much suffering in the world, whether there’s an intelligence in existence—was still pushing me.

I had finished my dissertation and was looking for where to go next when I encountered Stan Grof’s book Realms of the Human Unconscious. That extraordinary book turned my life around. In one reading he convinced me that LSD—or psychedelics—could be used safely, with proper precautions, to explore the deep structure of consciousness. Some of his anecdotes also suggested that one could reach beyond the personal unconscious to deeper fabrics of consciousness. I quickly realized the philosophical significance—not just the psychological significance—of his work.

I realized that in my profession—philosophy of religion—the most important contributions would soon be written out of an experiential basis, not just an intellectual one. To do that, you can’t have just a few experiences; you have to undergo systematic training in the discipline. So that’s what I did.

I began in 1979 what became a 20-year journey. I worked for four years, stopped for six years for reasons I give in the book, then resumed for ten years. Overall, over 20 years, I did 73 high-dose LSD sessions following Stan’s protocol. This is a regimen I wouldn’t recommend. With hindsight, I pushed myself harder than was sometimes wise. But I used a lot of precautions. I did all the classic training and safeguards for fully internalized sessions with a sitter—my sitter was a clinical psychologist whom I was married to at the time, Carol—using carefully selected evocative music.

I worked with high doses of LSD initially because I was still thinking in terms of a model of individual awakening or healing. I knew from Eastern models that karma is finite. I wanted to accelerate my spiritual development and thought that if I could sustain the intensity of the confrontation, I could bite off bigger pieces of karma in each session with high doses, rather than melt it more slowly with low doses. It was a matter of efficiency. It was hard to find time for sessions in a dual-career marriage, so I thought I’d work more aggressively.

That turned out to be based on a false set of assumptions. Within a few years I was entering domains far beyond an individual model of transformation. I began to understand that my sessions had catalyzed something aimed at nothing less than some type of healing or transformation of the human species as a whole. Working with very high doses hyper-amplifies consciousness. It changes not only how deep you go, but how wide you are when you go there—activating a larger field of consciousness, which then triggers the cycles of death and rebirth that therapeutic psychedelic work does.

I finished in 1999 and then digested those experiences for another 20 years. It was very challenging. It took a long time to connect the dots and absorb them, and it took me five years to write the book. I would have been more comfortable releasing it posthumously because it’s so exposing—your most intimate relationship with the divine. But the Mother told me no; there’s no time for that indulgence. The work was needed now. It would support others in their work in the times we’re entering. All hands on deck.

Roger Walsh: 
Beautiful. It really feels that what you did—this exploration and the writing—was done out of a very large motive. Our culture has a naïve media view of psychedelics as getting high and having a good time. Yes, that can happen, and you had ecstatic experiences. But you also went through the hell realms, not once, but multiple times—opening to levels of not only your own suffering but collective suffering, the history of human cruelty. I found myself bowing to the courage you brought to this time after time. Yet you always seem to find that ultimately there was value in the suffering. What kept you going, and what value did you find there?

Chris Bache: 
This was the great gift Stan gave me: he taught me to trust the process. My experience affirmed that. If you completely trust the process and let your session take you where it wants, it may get worse and worse. You may enter experiences that are completely inscrutable and horrifying. But if you surrender completely, it will eventually culminate in a death-rebirth cycle. Some part of you will slough off; you’ll be taken through a transition and awaken in a different level of reality. For the remainder of that session, you’ll experience teaching within a completely ecstatic framework.

So there is the purification side of a session and the ecstatic side. What you internalize at the end of the day is not just the suffering but the entire cycle: suffering reaches a peak, there’s a breakthrough, then joy and ecstasy and communion, and then integration at the end. It’s the balance of joy and ecstatic insight with purification that makes it manageable. If I had to go through all the suffering for years without the ecstatic teaching, I couldn’t have done it.

When I was going through the ocean of suffering—in the third, fourth, and fifth years—the morning of a session was difficult because I had a sense of what I was getting into. But I don’t think it’s any more difficult than a soldier on the eve of battle or a mother on the eve of labor. If it’s your second or third birth, you know it’s going to be a hard day. You gird your loins and prepare. In my case, I don’t think what I did is any more exotic than someone who wants to climb Mount Everest or go to the North Pole. Personally, I don’t know why anyone in their right mind would want to climb Everest, but I understand the explorer’s mentality. I wanted to see, to understand, to know. And no matter how deep I went, there was always more to be shown.

John Dupuy: 
Did you feel you were being held or guided—in some sense taken care of—in this journey?

Chris Bache: 
At every step along the way. When I would go through, consciousness was waiting for me. I might not understand the logic of the sequence for years—there are things I only began to understand when I wrote the book—but I had enough structure to know there was a logic to the process. I always felt met and engaged—sometimes very consciously, where I would ask questions and it would orchestrate my experience. There was an intelligence meeting me, taking me, educating me, breaking me down, reducing me to dust, taking me further, taking me back, over and over until I understood something—and then it would take me deeper.

There was a systematic progression. That’s important because when you enter a new level of consciousness, it’s very disorienting. Cognitively it’s confusing, and that manifests as not being able to remember everything that happened—you don’t yet have a framework to hold it. But if you go back again and again, are systematic and rigorous, and record carefully, your system will acclimate. You learn how to stay conscious in dimensions that previously swallowed you.

Over time I realized deeper consciousness was titrating the experiences of transcendence, giving me time to absorb and acclimate, even when I wanted to run on. It fed me in small steps so I could retain and hold what it had given me. The purpose, I found, was not simply to transcend and experience ecstasy; it was to bring that ecstasy back into time-space consciousness—first to remember it, and then to digest it and let it seep into your bones as deeply as possible.

John Dupuy: 
You talk in the book about how you came to understand that the hell realms—the suffering realms you had to visit—were for your benefit, for purification, preparing you for revelation.

Chris Bache: 
It’s complicated. It took me about two and a half years to go through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal dimension of consciousness—very intense physical and emotional purifications, which eventually ended in ego death, being shattered, my entire physical identity turned inside out. Then the ocean of suffering began. At first I thought it was a deeper form of personal suffering, a deeper form of ego death. Eventually—and this is why I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn at core, to solve the riddle of why the suffering got as large as it did—I concluded it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation at all. It was aimed at healing the human species.

In the aggregate, in the collective unconscious, there are wounds humanity has not healed—the things we’ve done to each other in war, disasters, the accumulated suffering that still festers. Every spiritual tradition recognizes that in deep practice you may be invited—if you’re willing—to take on some of that suffering. If you become aware of it, it can move through you and resolve itself, just as personal suffering does. For two years I did the ocean-of-suffering work. It wasn’t until about halfway through that I began to understand this wasn’t for me; it was for my family—the human family. Only later did I understand the historical circumstances of our times that made healing our past so important, to clear the foundation for an imminent transformation in history.

John Dupuy: 
I’m sure that gave you—you mentioned girding your loins—that warrior perspective: it’s not just about you, Chris. To keep coming back as it shifts from an individual quest to everybody and everything.

Chris Bache: 
It may be largely a function of my choice to work with very high doses that blow you deeply into the structure of reality. Not everyone may enter these domains. Over the course of my journey I learned this was a task my soul took on before I was born. It was part of my karmic choice, not forced on me and not a tragedy—simply part of my life’s work. The universe more than rewarded me for this phase. Following the ocean of suffering—indeed within it and afterwards—it took me places and more than repaid me for taking it on. As always, whenever you do anything for others, the universe has no choice but to give back to you—because it acts out of oneness. If we do something for others, it comes back in one form or another.

Roger Walsh: 
Beautiful. It sounds as though you shifted from entering this work for your own understanding and transformation to being forced—almost against your inclinations—to see it in a larger context: opening to and allowing yourself to be an instrument for the transformation of collective consciousness. I can understand how challenging that is. It’s a very different worldview and set of assumptions about the nature of self and reality. Would you like to say more?

Chris Bache: 
My first concern was that it sounded like ego gone amok—ego inflation. I had to sit with that a long time, because my experiences told me that’s not what was happening. As you said, it’s a very different worldview. In the classic individual patient model, the individual is having experiences. The individual has transpersonal experiences, and the individual is always at the center. In this model, my individual existence was completely secondary. It becomes not a matter of my being central. I got the system started, but I dissolved completely into preexisting fields of consciousness. Those fields are the dynamic force having the experiences.

That manifested not only in the ocean of suffering, but later in archetypal reality and causal oneness. In many experiences, Chris Bache was a bit player. In the book I have an appendix: what dies and is reborn? After so many deaths and rebirths, it becomes a cognitive question. What is actually dying? It feels personal. Is it just ego dying over and over?

The answers I offer push far. On the one hand it’s ego; then it becomes species ego; then something I call the shamanic persona. In the end, what is dying, I think, is literally some aspect of cosmic consciousness—some dimension of cosmic reality softening, surrendering, opening to a still deeper dimension of cosmic consciousness. That deeper dimension pours its blessings into me at the bottom—but not primarily into me. It pours into the deeper dimension of cosmic consciousness itself.

I know those are hard concepts and a very different way of thinking, and my description is tentative. But something like that is required to understand what happens when you explode consciousness this radically. And I don’t think it’s wise to explode consciousness this radically. If I were doing it again, I’d work with lower doses and with psilocybin—gentler substances. LSD in this quantity, when contained and intensified in a therapeutic modality, shatters your consciousness far beyond physical limits. You spend hours dissolved into some stratum of the universe, then you congeal and consolidate—then shatter again, leaving your historical existence radically behind, dissolving into another stratum. You live there for a while—it lives you, as part of it. Then you congeal, bring it back, and hold it.

Roger Walsh: 
I’d love to tease out several things, but first a specific question: you’ve referred to very high doses of LSD. What doses did you use?

Chris Bache: 
I aimed to be working at 600 micrograms. Because I wasn’t using a pharmaceutical-identified dose, I’d say 500–600 micrograms to be safe, but not less than 500.

Roger Walsh: 
That’s a lot of LSD, to put it mildly. I want to tease out your description of death-rebirth. It’s recognized across the world’s spiritual traditions as a profound psycho-spiritual birth experience and deliberately sought in traditions such as shamanism. You describe it in a radically expanded way—as a repetitive process of dying to one identity and limitation after another, reconstituting a new, more porous, expanded identity, and then having to offer that into the whole.

Let me check my understanding against yours. It seems what dies is what we confuse ourselves to be—our self-representation. We mistake a self-image or concept or narrative for our true self. What needs to die is that representation. It dies, and we find ourselves opened to a much larger perspective of our identity and reality. I tended to think that, for psychological reasons, habitual patterns reestablish themselves and another self-representation forms.

You’re putting this in a larger, more cosmic or ontological perspective—suggesting that, as part of the cosmic play, separation is built into the game. Identity is reconstituted in a rebirth process because of the very nature of the universe and consciousness—that consciousness separates so as to play again. Am I understanding you correctly?

Chris Bache: 
I think your description of ego death is spot on. What dies—what is consumed—is our self-representation, our sense of identity amassed from our physical, time-space experience. And every medicine has a certain range, a signature and power. Psilocybin has a depth that, even if you repeat it many times and it takes you into the upper register, still has an upper register. Ayahuasca has a range—maybe a deeper upper register. Salvia divinorum has a range; ketamine, 5-MeO-DMT, and DMT all have ranges. LSD has a range too, and of course doses affect that range.

I tend to experience psilocybin as very body-grounded, tuned to my emotional body. It opens a range, but it stays, in a sense, within parameters. It stretches but does not shatter as aggressively as LSD the parameters of individual identity—though it can dissolve and soften them, and open things up. In my work with high doses of LSD, all of these things happen, but because of the particular intensity of the substance and its lack of anthropological history—therefore lacking the fields associated with psilocybin and mescaline/peyote—it tends to shatter our time-space identity and throw us into a level of experience beyond that reality, into a spiritual reality. If we go back to that place again and again, our experience there begins to congeal, and we develop an alternative identity persona. I call it the shamanic persona—an identity comprised of all my experiences at that level of transpersonal reality. It’s superordinate to my individual egoic identity, and it can be stable if my experiences have been well managed.

So when I enter a psychedelic space and transition away from time and space, I enter into a familiar sense of self at a certain level of spiritual reality. I acclimate there; I learn the ropes. But if I keep pushing the edge—if the chemical is strong enough and the intent is focused enough—eventually you come to a ceiling, and at that ceiling a cost is exacted. Another round of death takes place. What’s dying is not the ego, but that shamanic persona, that second identity, because it’s a holder of a certain level of transpersonal experience. If you want to go deeper—you don’t have to, but if you do—you have to die at that lower shamanic level. The shamanic identity dies, and you transition into yet another level of reality in which the whole working of the universe is different—different rules, different phenomena, different bandwidth, so to speak. And you must acclimate to that level of reality.

Every step deeper into the universe is a step into a higher level of energy. To stabilize consciousness at a particular level, you must acclimate to the energy—and that’s some of the very intense cleansing that continues to take place 30, 40, 50 sessions in. You’re learning how to stabilize consciousness at extremely high levels of energy. That just takes a long time.

What eventually came out of all this is an appreciation that death and rebirth are stage-specific. There are many levels of the universe, and if you systematically push through those levels there are gates you come to, and at each gate there is a sacrifice asked. Eventually, once you’ve died so many times, death becomes a meaningless concept because you always learn you’re going to be reborn. Some essence of identity continues. The Phoenix always rises. The concept of death, as an interpretation of what’s happening, yielded to a concept of purification. I learned that all dying is, in fact, purification. When purification reaches so deep that it destructures whatever self-representation or reality-representation you’re operating within, it becomes purification unto death. It’s dissolving the structures within which you are holding reality. So it’s death, but a fluid death—a purification process.

John Dupuy: 
So, Chris, following up on what Roger asked about what dies—what doesn’t die? Because in your book you talk a lot about reincarnation as a given in the universe as it was revealed to you—this universe, multiverse, whatever this mysterium tremendum is that you’ve brought back to us. So what doesn’t die?

Chris Bache: 
When we go deep, we realize that everything is dying and living, dying and living, constantly. There are no stable things which are not dying in this universe. To see that clearly is considered a great accomplishment—to really understand that everything is temporary, transitional, moving, fluid. People have asked me, “What is it that dies?” What I will say is there is always continuity of memory. If you organize your session well, there is continuity of recall; therefore there is continuity of memory. You might say that memory doesn’t die, but I don’t think that’s the best way to describe it. I think memory is shattered and reconstituted. I don’t know what doesn’t die, but—

John Dupuy: 
—is being purified, right? What is it that’s being purified?

Chris Bache: 
I’d go farther and say that in this process life gives birth to individuality—not an ego, not a self, but an individuality—and that individuality matures and deepens as the soul matures and deepens, and as one’s spiritual experiences deepen. Many traditions, including Vedanta, basically believe that the individual is an illusion and the goal is to shatter the illusion and dissolve irretrievably into the oneness of all existence. I understand that cosmology, but I think it’s a mistake, and it doesn’t jibe with my experience. My experience is that the universe is very intensely interested in birthing an individuality and in aging and refining and maturing it, so that in the end we die in order to grow up—and we die again in order to grow up.

This is what I call the birth of the diamond soul. Reincarnation is aging us stage by stage, level by level, helping us grow to become more than we were. Sooner or later, we reach a point where all of our former lives—the history, experiences, wisdom, and mistakes—come together into an integrated singularity. When that happened in my sessions, I was catapulted into a state of awareness beyond anything I’d experienced up to that point. I was an individual in pure Shunyata—emptiness—transparent, open to all existence. Individual within a boundless existence, with my full memory intact. I think this is where the Divine is taking all human beings. Individuality is not the problem; separation is the problem. Ego-boundedness is the problem. Individuality is the great beauty, one of the great gifts the Creator gives us: the opportunity to be an individual.

Roger Walsh: 
Chris, can you draw a distinction between the individual, individuality, and separation? It sounds as though there can be a sense of individuality within the recognition of one’s innate connection with, dependence on, and ultimate unity with the All, or pure consciousness. Is that how you’d distinguish it from separation, where there is a forgetting of the connection to the greater whole?

Chris Bache: 
Yeah. When Buddhism teaches Shunyata and when it teaches anata—no self—it’s defining a type of self-experience where we experience ourselves cut off from other selves and from the universe itself. When that self dies, one experiences an individuality that is porous to others. We live in compassion. We experience an individuality in communion with surrounding layers and layers of consciousness, with a spiritual openness and compassionate openness to other beings. We are still an individual, but situated within the boundaryless condition.

Roger Walsh: 
It sounds as though you’re saying there’s a value in that individuality. I’m reminded of Ramakrishna, who described being lost in unity but then longing for separation so that he could worship and relate to the Mother—both sides. Some traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta, regard the self as an illusion and Non-duality as the fundamental reality. Yet out of your own experience, it feels like you came to the sense that there is a beauty and perfection in individuality in and of itself. Is that correct?

Chris Bache: 
It is. Let me frame it this way: before time and space existed—before the physical universe—everything was in the pure, fertile void. When the Absolute made a choice to manifest physical existence, the physical universe was the only thing strong enough, I think, to shatter the oneness of the Absolute into pieces that then can become individually awakened to what they are within the body of the Divine. One of the great gifts of the physical universe is literally the density that causes the oneness of the Divine to shatter into pieces so those pieces can become operational as the Divine within the body of the Divine. In that context, individuality is one of the great gifts of creation.

I don’t think the Creator wants to destroy that individuality after billions of years of getting us to this point. When we wake up and become conscious, when we can drop our consciousness down to Source and identify that part of us which is universal—oneness with what is alive—I don’t think the intention is to simply say, “Okay, let’s destroy that.” I think we’re growing, and will be growing for billions of years more. We’re just getting started in waking up to the vast expanse of existence, and we’re waking up in a way in which we become lovers of it, servants of it, a fractal embodiment of it. These are different metaphors for this mystery of the dance.

John Dupuy: 
I’ve seen the same thing, and you expressed it much more eloquently. I feel like I’m a yellow belt talking to a 10th Dan. Somehow the preciousness of the individual becomes infinitely more precious at the same time. It’s a yes-and; it’s this and that. I had to rethink a lot of my ideas about psychology given that, and it feels deeply human at a deep level.

What you were describing is that at some point self awakens—something just opens. Jesus said a man must be born again. When you’re born, you’re a helpless infant—precious, but just beginning. Then it seems you’re talking about a Christ-like or Bodhisattva responsibility: at a certain point we take on responsibility not just for our own awakening, mistakes, and suffering, but for the all, for the collective. That adds a nobility to the task that otherwise could be narcissistic, chasing your tail.

We have the archetype of Jesus—a human being, an individual, crucified and murdered in a most horrible way, who goes down into the underworld and comes back still him, barely recognizable to some disciples, but at a transformed level that has kept the rest of us running in his path for a couple of thousand years. That’s a story of the individual contained within our Western treasure chest of wisdom stories.

Chris Bache: 
Yeah. It is a story of divine incarnation come to fruition. And I think that story has archetypal ramifications much larger than the Christology developed to interpret it, which ended up making Jesus into a unique being when really he’s a prototype.

Roger Walsh: 
That seems to be a major division that occurs in each of the great religions—perhaps reflecting different psychological developmental stages in those who make the interpretations. The founder is either elevated to a unique status which the rest of us can only approximate, or recognized as an exemplar—a prototype of capacities and potentials latent within us. That seems a very important distinction you point to.

Chris Bache: 
As you said, John, when you begin to experientially tap into that in us which is universal, eventually all aspects of your life come into alignment with that. That’s why love—not eros, but agape—compassion, social justice, fairness, naturally arise as one’s spiritual practice deepens. You discover this hybrid nature within yourself: individually awake, and awake to a universal bond. That becomes an expression of your true nature. It’s spontaneous.

And I also want to mention that you certainly don’t have to go where I went in order to spiritually awaken, even if you wanted to use psychedelics. For me there are three uses: psychedelics for healing; psychedelics for spiritual awakening; and a third, which my journey became, cosmological exploration. If I wanted psychedelics for spiritual awakening, I would recommend a protocol working with very low doses, because it’s about dissolving the ego—and you’ve got to get after where the ego lives in the world, closer to time-space realities. You do not need to shatter time to become spiritually awakened. You don’t need to enter archetypal reality or go back to the beginning of the universe to be genuinely, enthusiastically spiritually awakened.

I started aiming at spiritual awakening, but the method was so powerful it shoved me past that—through that—into a deeper, different agenda. I’m entirely sympathetic to spiritual teachers who would say, Your time would be better spent cultivating the abiding presence of the transparent condition than going on a quest to learn how the universe is put together in these different levels. I understand that critique, and I share it to a degree. I wonder sometimes whether my time would have been better spent focusing more on the enlightenment side of things than the cosmic exploration side. But what happened in my work is that it pushed deeper into cosmological exploration.

John Dupuy: 
You said you were a philosopher, and you went with a philosopher’s quest into this journey—exactly what you said, exactly what you did. No flip-flopping there.

Roger Walsh: 
And you did it with a very specific aspiration and intention. Chris, I recall that before each session you would effectively offer yourself as an instrument for the highest good of all—very similar to the Bodhisattva aspiration, even reminiscent of Jesus’ “not my will, but thine.” It felt like an unrestricted offering of yourself as an instrument for acquiring whatever wisdom you were opened to, gifted, or graced with, in order to be an instrument of transmission to others. It feels like your prayer was answered.

You wondered whether it would have been as valuable to just do spiritual practice. Perhaps. But let a thousand spiritual flowers bloom. You gave us a new kind of flower, and we are benefiting from it—and who knows how many others will benefit. Wonderful that you did what you did, and beautiful that you did it with that aspiration and prayer. It feels like your prayer was answered.

John Dupuy: 
Chris, what do you do these days to keep yourself—having gone on such a remarkable journey and come back? You mentioned teaching. Do you have a way of staying awake to what you were gifted and shown, or do you find that the transmission and teaching keep you crisp in this limited reality while staying in touch with and transmitting what you learned on the other side?

Chris Bache: 
There’s a question I ask in the book: What is the value of true but temporary knowledge? I don’t doubt that any of the experiences I had were true, and I also know they were temporary. I cannot live in those places. The idea of bringing them back and integrating them as a stable state may be true for certain levels of experience, but for some of the deeper experiences it’s not possible—at least not at my present level of psycho-spiritual development. I know there are great beings who are masters of these domains, and they are my guiding light. But Chris’s abilities cannot stabilize these states of consciousness.

I use those experiences in my meditation practice, in my vara practice. They are the Samaya sattva that opens me to the Jnana sattva—the being of practice that opens me to the being of reality of these things. I also spend a lot of time grounding—staying in touch with the Earth—because I spent so many years out in the far reaches of the cosmos. It’s good to be grounded on the Earth.

Most of all, I’m a teacher. I love to find things and share them. During the years when I was doing this work, I couldn’t share them directly in my classes. The first time I shared was in Dark Night, Early Dawn, where I addressed experiences from the first half of my journey up to about the halfway point. In LSD and the Mind of the Universe—or, as I prefer to call it by the name it had for me all the years I wrote it, Diamonds from Heaven—I shared the whole journey. To me, the most important part is the chapter on the birth of the future human and the final vision.

Because the work was so little focused on me and so much on the human family, the story that kept being pounded into me—the story I kept being shown—was the human story: where humanity is in its evolution; the pivot point we’re coming into; the absolute shift taking place at an archetypal level—really, at the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. We’re coming to a tipping point that will change the condition of the human psyche at the collective level—not just an aggregate of individuals, but a shift beneath us at the collective psychic level that will mark a before and after in human history. This was shown to me again and again.

Years later, I was dissolved into the human species—dissolved without remainder—and then taken into the death and rebirth of humanity. Not in any details—no when, where, or how—but that humanity would go through an era of completely losing control. All the assumptions of life would be stripped away. We would go through a crushing ordeal as a species—so terrible that for a time we would think this is the end, that we’re going extinct. But in my visionary experience, we come through this. We survive, and we are absolutely changed in the process. When we come through this long crisis, we have reached something inside ourselves; we have cracked open our heart and mind. The humanity that emerges is deeper, more open, more mature.

Putting together different things from my sessions, I’ve come to believe that this is a global systems crisis driven by a series of ecological crises—tremendous converging forces we’re increasingly aware of. But this is a crisis of consciousness. We cannot afford to try to run this planet from an egoic level of consciousness. The ego is separated and leads to a divided world. I think the soul is coming forward in history. I mentioned the diamond soul—I think we are literally growing up into our full soul being. We are coming to a point where, when we incarnate, we will never be tempted to identify just with this body; we will know ourselves to be a 100,000-year-old being. We will know the planet we are leaving is the planet we will return to. We will know we have deep karmic connections with everyone around us, and that we are all embedded in the oneness of divine consciousness.

This is the magnitude of the transition we’re going through. All of us, in all our spiritual practices, are contributing to it. It’s why so many people are having intense yogic practices, meditation, past-life therapy—there’s tremendous unloading taking place as part of a collective healing, making way for the awakening of something new in history.

Roger Walsh: 
You gave a beautiful description of one of your profound openings—your recognition of a possible future ahead of us as a species. Your insights resonate with a growing sense among many that we’re coming to a time of extraordinary crisis and opportunity. I think of that being well expressed by a mutual friend, Dewayne Elgin, whose books on the transition we face point to the current time as a bottleneck—at worst, a civilizational collapse or loss of many capacities and lives, yet also the possibility of a collective rebirth if we bring enough awareness, aspiration, and pure-heartedness. I’d love to hear more about how that emerging vision meshes with the insight you were given.

Chris Bache: 
Yeah, Dewayne is a real brother in all of this, and I’ve been deeply informed, as I’ve digested my experiences, by his methodical combing through ecological and social data and the converging forces in history. I should speak out of my visionary experience, because my sense of this is informed primarily by that.

These visions took place for me going back to 1990 through 1995–96. I was very ecologically uninformed 25 years ago when they occurred. When I first had the experience of the death and rebirth of humanity, it took me about a year to recover. I felt like I was walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb was to be dropped—knowing what was coming—with profound compassion and deep respect for all human beings on the planet, knowing they had all volunteered to participate in this grand exercise and, at a deep soul level, knew what was coming even if at an egoic level they did not. It took a year and a lot of work to stabilize, and ever since then I’ve held this knowing in my body.

As I became more informed by historians, ecologists, and environmentalists—getting a better grip on global climate change and so on—it meshed very well with the inner experience, with the caveat that some serious students of the data believe we’re not going to make it, that we’re essentially extinct already. All I can say is that, in my experience, that’s not what happens. And it’s not because the crunch that’s coming is less bad than we think—it’s going to bring us to our collective knees. It’s going to be worse than we are now envisioning. It’s going to break us down completely.

Roger Walsh: 
That’s a very painful and probably very realistic vision, at least from what I understand of the data. And we come through—we come through.

Chris Bache: 
We don’t come through; a new “we” is born. I believe the historical pressures building now are literally a birth—truly giving birth to the future human. The question is, what will this future human look like? What is actually being born in history? Is “birth” just an analogy, or do we mean something more?

I look at this through a reincarnational lens. I believe reincarnation is an empirically demonstrated fact of life. Ian Stevenson and other scholars have demonstrated that reincarnation is true. My first book on life cycles was about reincarnation. When I look at the universe, I see our planet pulsing in and out of time and space, reincarnating beings century by century, millennia by millennia. Gestation is long; labor and birth are short and intense. I think the human family has been gestating the future human for hundreds of thousands of years in the dynamics of reincarnation. The labor taking place is a short, intense, convulsive period.

What we’re giving birth to is foreshadowed once we understand reincarnation. What’s coming forward, I think, is a consciousness that holds all of our reincarnational experience as a simultaneous present. This is a consciousness we all contact, if all goes well, when we die. When we’re born, we contract into a small ego. When we die, we return to the soul that holds all our memories, not fragmented but integrated as a single being. If we keep this up, sooner or later the soul awakens inside human incarnation. I think that’s the being being born in this historical crisis. Souls will live on this planet differently than egos live on this planet.

All the great spiritual leaders of the Axial Age foreshadowed this. They gave teachings to help bring it about—teaching us to think deep, to look deep, to feel deep, and to allow the needs of others to become superordinate to our individual needs without canceling them. They invited us to live wide.

Now, as we try to become one planet—ecologically, politically—the world citizen is emerging, and that’s being matched by something taking place inside us. As the world tries to become one, we are trying to become one soul integrated within ourselves. I think we’re going to make it. While nothing is decided or predetermined, my visionary experience is that we make it. But this is not the end of the story; it’s simply the next stage of human evolution, which will continue as long as the universe is alive. Whatever we do now will eventually be superseded by yet another stage of our development. This stage is particularly important.

Roger Walsh: 
And, Chris, in one sentence you elucidated a pivot point for this possible rebirth of the human species. You said, “Nothing is predestined. It’s up to us.” That’s a big statement.

Chris Bache: 
If everything were predestined, there’d be no point to incarnating. If everything had to be the way it’s got to be, we wouldn’t be learning, and there would be no adventure here. It’s open-ended. We could lose the planet. We could lose this opportunity. It’s going to require our very, very best and deepest efforts to come through this changed and built better.

Roger Walsh: 
So your vision may not be, “This is the way it’s going to be,” but rather, “Here is the possibility to which we can open ourselves.”

Chris Bache: 
Yes, and I have to acknowledge that. Sometimes people who nearly die have, as part of their life review, a life preview. Sometimes what they see of the future comes true, and sometimes they see a future they can change. I talk about this in Ken Ring’s work, Heading Toward Omega. If they’re seeing a future they can change, they’re seeing a conditional future, not an absolute preset future. So what I’m seeing is a possible future—maybe even a probable future—but still a future we have to enact.

And I have to add a postscript. Some experiences have taken me so far into what I call deep time—not eternity, but a different modality of time—that they gave me an experience of this historical transition not as a future event but as a past event, as something we have accomplished. From that deep cosmological perspective, I would say: we will make this transition. Nature knows what it’s doing. The genius of the universe we see in DNA and galaxies saturates everything. It knows what it’s doing in bringing us to this critical turning point. We will make it. We will become more than we have ever been.

Roger Walsh: 
Beautiful. May it be so. From my own perspective—without having had your visions and agnostic about whether we’ll make it or not—it seems that whatever perspective we hold, the only thing to do with our lives is what you did: offer them in service of human well-being and survival. Is that congruent with you?

Chris Bache: 
Absolutely. It’s going to take our very best to move forward—deeply, with a deep heart and an open mind. All hands on deck.

Roger Walsh: 
Beautiful.

John Dupuy: 
Chris, I get a feeling from you—as a man who has heeded the calls in his life. You got educated and squared away so that later on you’d be in a much better position to share what you were called to learn. And you had the courage to keep it up—my God, a miracle in itself—over those 73 journeys. And you’re also at peace with yourself because now you’re giving back. You did this work, and the work continues in the sharing of it. That’s a pretty good place to be.

Chris Bache: 
Yes, it is a good place to be. It’s always good when one reaches a point in life where one feels one has done what was asked. Then the rest is gravy. When I finished writing the book, I knew I could die at peace. That was the closure of the project. Now I’m in a new phase, trying to figure out how to make what I did useful to other people. How can I serve others, carrying the knowledge and memories I have? I’m still figuring that out—how to be useful to people on their spiritual and intellectual paths, doing wonderful things I can’t imagine. How can I support them as we enter this time in history?

Roger Walsh: 
Beautiful. It sounds like that question has been with you and challenging you. I want to put it in a context. There are knowledge questions—“Is it raining outside?” Look outside; end of the question. And there are wisdom questions, like koans, that you can ask repeatedly; each time they take you deeper into the question, into yourself, into life. It sounds like your wisdom, or sacred, question is now at the forefront.

Chris Bache: 
It is. I know that when I’m with like-minded spirits and we talk about these things, something happens inside me. My shell is thin anyway, but I get porous, and a larger knowing flows through me. I become irrelevant; the teaching teaches itself. That’s why I wrote The Living Classroom—because this was happening in my classroom. I never talked about my psychedelic work to my students. I built a firewall between my spiritual practice and my teaching. But the deeper I went into the consciousness of the universe, the more it began to activate students. There was an unconscious transmission, an activation taking place, which I had to learn how to manage to keep everything safe for everyone.

I learned that when you throw a stone into a lake, it naturally ripples out. When we do deep practice, people around us are touched and influenced. When people’s questions lead me to reflect on life in ways informed by my experiences, there’s a gathering and reinforcing between their psyches and mine. Together we become more. Sometimes there’s a transmission and a healing that no one controls, and yet it seems to be the work.

Since the book came out, COVID has shut down personal contact of that sort, so I’ve been in a period of incubation. Lots of Zoom meetings—incubating, seeing where this wants to go. I’m about to begin a seven-week online course on the book, which will give us another opportunity to push this farther. How much can we actually give this transmission online? I’d rather be doing it in person, but right now it’s an online world.

John Dupuy: 
Well, from where I’m sitting, it feels like it works.

Roger Walsh: 
Pretty well. And, Chris, what’s the name of the course, so listeners can find it?

Chris Bache: 
It hasn’t been given a name yet. It’s on the Shift Network. It will be on LSD and the Mind of the Universe. It may be called Diamonds from Heaven, or A Spiritual Journey into the Mind and Heart of the Universe. It’ll be on Shift Network starting in the middle of November, beginning November 30.

John Dupuy: 
Do you find that people are responding, given the times we live in? How’s it going? Are the books selling? Are people going, “Oh my God”? Have you met fellow travelers with similar experiences? From my experience, what you’re saying corresponds, deepens, and fills out what I’ve learned in my own journey. So how’s it going?

Chris Bache: 
It’s going just as you say. There’s nothing unique about my experiences—they’re part of our collective experiences that push the boundaries in certain ways. Many people have written to say I clarified their experiences—“Here’s what I experienced around this topic.” Many have written, “I’ve never touched psychedelics in my life, but I’ve had experiences completely in alignment with yours. Let me explain mine.” Clearly this is a large pattern emerging within the collective psyche. It’s a joy to share and to enter into conversation with other journeyers.

What’s important is not any one person’s experience, but the psychedelic and spiritual experiences of the entire human family. When we put all our experiences on the table, we can sort out what’s idiosyncratic and find what’s universal and more epistemologically valuable. To do that, we have to put it all on the table. I’m simply putting mine on the table in dialogue with others as we all do the same. We’re still in the early stages. The book you edited, Roger, on early psychedelic elders put one generation’s insights on the table. I think it’s beginning again.

The tricky part as people absorb my work is that the focus of the psychedelic renaissance is psychedelic therapy—and that’s exactly where it should be: healing the human psyche, careful controlled studies, lots of brainwave maps, very careful protocols. To a degree, my work rocks that boat. It doesn’t follow that protocol. It uses extreme, high doses of a very powerful medicine that doesn’t lend itself to healing as well as MDMA or psilocybin. So there’s a tension between the therapeutic focus of the present—very important work—and my work. Yet there is a huge underground psychedelic community that hasn’t waited for scientific validation. That community has been having a conversation for many years, and my work is being received very well there.

Roger Walsh: 
Beautiful. You spoke of still exploring the next question—and of a period of years, perhaps 20, integrating these experiences. It sounds like the process of integration has been very long and had its own challenges. Perhaps that topic doesn’t get enough attention. There’s a lot of focus on practices and opening certain states and insights, but not so much on the essential work of integration—assimilating the experiences, reflecting on them, recognizing their implications, dialoguing in community—anything that allows us to understand their implications and possibilities and their implications for how we should live now.

Chris Bache: 
Yes. There’s a book just published called Psychedelics and Psychotherapy that focuses on integration. I have an article in it. We’re getting past the stage where the excitement over breaking through to these dimensions of consciousness dominates. We’re beginning to realize the real issue is: What do we do with these experiences? How can we hold them? How do we integrate them individually and in small communities? How do we integrate them intellectually so we shift the paradigm we live within?

Psychedelic experiences support the paradigm of a living universe—not dead matter, but a universe that is alive, with orders and orders and orders of intelligence behind and within physical existence. There are many levels to it. I would offer my own experiences as some of what not to do. I’m deadly serious when I say I pushed myself harder than was wise at the end. The hardest chapter to write was the last one, “Coming Off the Mountain,” where I reflect on the years after I stopped my sessions. It took me a year just to write it.

I paid a lot of attention to integration throughout—writing all my sessions down, doing a lot of spiritual practice, keeping conversation with my partner, tending to individual integration. I wrote The Living Classroom to tell how I took care of my students who were being touched by the work—social integration. I thought that when I stopped I’d be able to step away and live with the bounty of the extraordinary gifts I’d been given, especially the Diamond Luminosity sessions—immersions into Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.

But in the five or six years after stopping, I entered what I call the deep sadness—a withdrawal into loneliness from not being able to return to ecstatic experiences of being dissolved into light. I knew I needed to stop; I had to spend years absorbing what I had. But there was such an unfulfilled longing to return that I reached a point where I realized I was just waiting to die. I was taking care of my children and my students. I wasn’t suicidal; I was living a balanced life. But in my heart, I was waiting to die. Eventually I realized something’s wrong. This is not how this work is supposed to end. I must have made a mistake. I even wondered, Is it possible to have too much God? But I knew the entire physical universe is God; the Divine is everything that exists. So it wasn’t too much God—it was too much transcendence.

There is a balance between transcending time and space and being embodied within time and space, with truths in each reality. I had plunged so deeply beyond time and space so many times, into such intimacy with that which supports time and space, that I lost my bearings here. I made an absolute decision to ground myself in time and space and let what I had experienced in subtle states work its way into me. I had to not alter my consciousness so these states could enter my physical being. Previously they entered my altered being; now, if they were ever going to enter my body, I had to sit still and let them come.

In these states, nothing in reality changes—we don’t do anything; we wake up to what’s always been there. I reached a point where I had to be patient and let the transformation take place. In one sense, there’s nothing more for me to do; in another, yes, there is.

Roger Walsh: 
You’re talking about the traps that can go with deep work. Usually we talk about earlier traps—overwhelm, fear, acting out psychodynamics, ego inflation, taking experiences as proof of our unique specialness. You’re pointing to traps that can occur further along: the dark night of the soul—tasting something so transcendent and divine and then losing contact; the sheer energy coursing through; the possibility of transmission and being seduced by capacities. This is a gift—pointing out the beginnings of a map of more advanced traps.

Chris Bache: 
The traps that happen when everything goes right. Not deficiency, but when everything goes right, you can have too much of a good thing. I didn’t know that at the beginning.

Roger Walsh: 
Is it too much, or our attitude toward it?

Chris Bache: 
I think you can have too much of a good thing in the sense that, in one lifetime, most of us can only integrate so much productively. It’s possible to bite off more than we can thoroughly chew, and sometimes I did that. You’re absolutely right: there are so many pitfalls—ego inflation, thinking you’re special because of a special experience. It’s so important to stay grounded—grounded, grounded—so all of this washes through you. My wife was very good at reminding me: what’s important is not what happens on the day of your session. What’s important is what you can do the day after your session—how you live your life in the world, carrying the insights into your fallible life, recommitting to purifying your messy garbage, and living a clean, compassionate, proper life.

Honestly, these days I don’t know why anyone would want to become one with God, because once you do, it triggers enormous purification processes that don’t stop. It goes on and on; it deepens. There are lots of ways for this path to go wrong.

Roger Walsh: 
And yet, in the way you approached this, though you got caught in subtle ways—the dark night of the soul—you didn’t harm others. You worked your way out. What do you attribute that to?

Chris Bache: 
Good company. The people I was with. My former wife, Carol—we were married 24 years; she’s the mother of my children and was my sitter for all my sessions. She never did a session herself. She’s a very serious varana practitioner. She went on to complete a three-year retreat; she’s a lama, acknowledged as such. She was a great help keeping me grounded while I was going in and out of the universe.

My children kept me grounded. Teaching kept me grounded. Studying the great masters kept me honest; their greatness showed me my own imperfections. My students kept me honest. I had to earn a living teaching at an open-enrollment university—walking into classrooms where many people didn’t want to be there and persuading them to be interested. Hard work. I wasn’t teaching graduate students; I was teaching first-time college students. It was good, hard, honest work that kept me focused and gave my body and mind time to absorb the enormity of what came forward.

Eventually I faced what I call the sickness of silence—the isolation of doing psychedelics in a psychedelic-phobic society where they’re illegal. Even if you can share in small groups, you can’t share professionally. I’m a teacher, a public person. I literally had to retire from my work as a philosopher of religion before I could begin my deepest work as a philosopher of religion. That’s the irony. I retired a little early to give myself time to write this book. It took me about three years just to get into the psychological position where I was willing to let people this deep into my life. The only way was to truly let go and remind myself over and over that these experiences were not given to me for me. They were never private. They were always given to share, to help the human community as a whole. By taking myself out of the picture and just sharing the visions—without owning them—it was easier to let them have their impact without appropriating that impact myself.

Roger Walsh: 
And there were so many experiences. If we look across the great religious traditions, we almost always find a worldview that posits some final experience toward which we are working. You get that final experience and then it’s bliss and roses. That wasn’t what you found. There was an endless opening—the possibilities you opened to kept unfolding. There aren’t many examples of that. Perhaps the best in our time is the teacher Almas, the pen name he writes under. In his two most recent books, Runaway Realization and The Alchemy of Transformation, after decades of profound study and a kind of spiritual genius opening to an enormous number of states—and building an extraordinary psycho-spiritual map—he stepped off his own map and said, no, there’s no final goal. Every opening can be a portal to another opening. He has a statement that only a handful of people could make: “I’ve been enlightened many times, and every time someone says, ‘That’s the final experience.’ But I always find there’s something more.” That seems your experience.

Chris Bache 
It is, I think, particularly the experience when you use psychedelics—this is a path of temporary immersion. All of our practices are temporary, but this psychedelic path is especially so, and that temporariness makes it tricky. Like you, I thought I was doing this to reach an end state—a goal I’d recognize when I got there that would solve everything. People describe becoming one with God or dissolving into the meta-cosmic void. What I found was that I became one with God, or the mind of the universe, many times. There are gradations—many levels—of oneness with God, and even levels of the primal void. There were many levels of homecoming and peace and reunion, relaxing into the bliss of return.

When the diamond luminosity opened—15 years into the work—I entered a hyper-clear, unbelievably clear level of awareness. Over the next four years and 26 sessions, I touched that reality only four times—lots of purification, lots of cleansing, but only four direct touches. The second time, in my 50th session, I was as deep into the universe as I would ever go, far beyond time and space, dissolved into the ecstasy of pure luminosity. Then my visual field pivoted 90 degrees, and I saw reality far in the distance, filled with an even greater light than the diamond luminosity. A ray of light hit me from that reality and absolutely shattered me. It took me ten minutes to recover. That’s when it sunk in that it’s an infinite progression. There isn’t an ending spot. You stop when you can take it no longer—when you can no longer take the ecstasy or the cycle of death and rebirth. It’s endless. If I were to do it again, I’d be gentler with myself, and I recommend others do the same. It’s not about reaching an end state. It’s about opening up, letting the wisdom, beauty, and healing in, going through purification, and becoming a little more alive and conscious in the dance of life—but not about arriving anywhere final.

Roger Walsh 
You recognized there was always more, and each “more” required another level of purification—each taste calling for a new refinement. You’ve alluded to what you called the diamond illumination, which in some ways, without ranking, felt like one of the most impactful experiences you had—one for which, as you wrote, you would gladly die. You relate that diamond illumination to culmination points in other traditions. Could you give us a feel for this realization, to whatever extent you can, and how it relates to the goals of other traditions?

Chris Bache 
As I understand it, the reality I was taken into in those four sessions is outside the bardo—an extra-samsaric reality beyond time and space and what I call the echoes of time-space bardo reality. The first two times, I was taken deeper into it and had the encounter with what I call the absolute light, which showed me it’s an infinite progression. The next two times, the diamond luminosity began to crunch itself deeper into my physical being. I wasn’t going out; it was coming in—into my psyche and body. It felt like it was changing me at a cellular level. By the very end of my journey, my perception had changed—how I literally see things. Not permanently, but it gave me a temporary experience I call diamond vision. I was seeing a hundred, a thousand times more sharply and clearly than ever before. I realized I was seeing through the eyes of the future human—seeing in a way all humanity will one day see. All our senses—sight, touch, taste—are being elevated to higher levels the more consciousness we can internalize in our bodies.

So this crunching into me is actually an acceleration of something happening more slowly for all of us across our evolutionary reincarnation process. One reason I had to stop my sessions was that the movement was no longer going out; it was the “out” coming into me, deeper and deeper. I literally had to stop to let this process reach its natural conclusion.

Reflecting on the diamond luminosity and drawing parallels to traditions I know, all spiritual traditions speak about light, and reincarnational traditions about extra-samsaric reality. The clearest descriptions I’ve found are in the Buddhist traditions, especially their description of Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality—the clear light which is the seed reality out of which all existence emerges, the love out of which all love emerges, the pure distilled power out of which all energy of creation arises, in its absolute, transcendent, hyper-clear form, containing everything within it and yet beyond creation itself.

I understand why touching that reality even once undoes centuries of living in karmic shadows. Karmic vision is always conditioned, approximate. To touch the profoundly unconditioned—and then slowly shape one’s life so one can live a conditioned existence in abiding communion with the unconditioned—is the task. To live the light in one’s physical manifestation. I’m just getting started. I won’t conclude this in one lifetime. But what the universe seems to have promised is that when I die, I will return to that condition. There’s nothing I need to do between now and my death to return to it. If obstacles arise, I’ve learned how to dissolve them—by taking them into me until they dissolve of their own weight.

Roger Walsh 
What a wonderful vision. Even as you recount it now, I can see you going into your experience, deeply touched decades later. It’s an exquisite example of how these experiences continue to incarnate in and as you. And you emphasized again that awakenings aren’t the end point; beyond them is integration—allowing the realization to incarnate through us. You pointed to diamond vision and its resonance with Tibetan Buddhism. Interestingly, Tibetan Buddhism speaks of a further stage—pure perception—where one’s perception is transformed so that this world is seen not as mundane materiality but as an expression of that diamond illumination, a pure land optimized for awakening. Your description of both the illumination and its effects mirrors what’s recognized and highly valued in certain traditions.

Chris Bache 
There is nothing unique in my journey. I’m rediscovering what many people in many traditions have already discovered. The technology may differ, but the core understandings—the truths and insights—have been with us a long time, embodied by great beings and passed on. There’s nothing unique in my work.

Roger Walsh 
And you opened to experiences others have opened to, yet you brought your own unique constellation—your gifts as a philosopher and theologian. So it’s the “yes, and.”

Chris Bache 
At the end, when I wasn’t sure what to do with all of this, the Mother—my naming of the Absolute tends to run feminine—spoke. I see myself as a servant of the Great Mother, with physical existence as her embodiment and the transcendent divine as more male, the embodied divine more female. She said, “Let them see me as you have seen me. That’s all. They’ll know what to do with it. It will serve them in ways you can’t anticipate. Just let them see me.”

She was very clear: “You didn’t give yourself these visions. You didn’t decide what visions you were given on any particular day. You had no control over when you were broken and when you were nourished. We did that. None of this is your doing. It was all our doing, and you have no right to hold on to any of it.” I think people who give themselves over to intimacy with the universe have always felt this—that their practice is not their own, the fruition of their practice is not their own, and they have no right to hold on to it. It’s in the nature of the awareness that the divine serves all. The Divine is all. In the end, it’s the Mother speaking to her children—her love and her desire to wake us all.

Roger Walsh 
I was struck by your use of the first-person plural—“we have given you these gifts”—echoing, as you pointed out, the Qur’an, where Allah speaks as “we.”

Chris Bache 
Yes. I don’t think it’s a plural like polytheism. It’s a plural of vastness—so enormous we can’t wrap our minds around it. “We” speaks to that more effectively than “I.” And no matter how profound our masters are now, if we go forward hundreds of thousands of years, the great masters of that time will see more and go deeper still. The experience of any individual is, in a sense, held within the capacity of the herd. They push the edge, but they’re limited by the collective psyche. As the collective evolves, it extends the limits of individual spiritual genius. It’s an ever-unfolding deepening of rapport between the creative intelligence and we who are its result.

Roger Walsh 
Yes. I’m going to ask a question that would take several more sessions, but it has to be asked. After all these experiences—openings and gifts that dramatically impacted your sense of self, your purpose, and the nature of reality, exploding your understanding multiple times—how would you describe, to the extent you can, your understanding of the nature of reality now? How would you characterize your worldview?

Chris Bache 
I’ll do my best to answer and not weep as I do so.

John Dupuy 
Go ahead and weep if you need to.

Chris Bache 
I see the universe as pure genius—saturated with genius and the creative impulse. The birth of stars, galaxies, planets, species, the emergence of self-aware species, and a reincarnating species on this planet are acts of profound genius and love—the sharing of existence, the gestation of conditions that make infinite progression possible.

I see death and rebirth, reincarnation, the bardo—a graded series of levels that reflect our limits and capacities after death. I used to think of the bardo as an opposition, a cloud getting in the way. Now I see it as a compassionate blanket that keeps us safe as we enter deeper communion with the true power. Call it the divine, though our concepts of God are childish compared to the reality. To touch that power before we are fully formed and strong enough would shatter us. We have to be very congealed as individuals to touch that reality and stay conscious and coherent within it. And that’s just the level outside the bardo of this piece of time and space. I don’t know what lies beyond the Dharmakaya or the absolute dimension.

Everywhere I’ve journeyed, there is genius arising—purposeful intent. Not always easy to recognize—sometimes very complex and subtle—but present behind everything, always pressing for more and uplifting us all. In saying this, I’m echoing the teachings of the great lineages. There’s nothing original here. I’m echoing what I have seen elsewhere: it’s all alive.

And the depth of love that holds existence is proportionate to the genius that orchestrates existence. That was hard for me to take in. The genius I could see; the love proportionate to that genius took longer. I’ve become much more bhakti than I ever expected.

Impatient and patient—wake up now, wake up in 100,000 years, wake up in a million years. It doesn’t make much difference to the Creator, who doesn’t think short-term. She thinks long-term, and not about individuals but about all of us—the entire planet, the entire galaxy—the magnitude of it all.

As far as I’ve gotten in this work, I’ve just touched the edges.

Roger Walsh 
Thank you, Chris. That was a true transmission—not only of the magnitude and genius, but of the heart, the boundlessness of love you saw. Yes, you keep saying there’s nothing new in what you saw, but the fact that you did see it and report your own direct phenomenology—rather than quoting texts—echoes the discoveries of saints and sages and of other deep explorers. Stan Grof, in The Cosmic Game, synthesized the deepest insights of the thousand people he worked with into a cosmology remarkably similar to the great traditions, and perhaps most congruent with Kashmir Shaivism. From one perspective, we can say, “You just saw what’s been reported umpteen times.” From another: thank you. An integrated report of these trans-egoic, transpersonal openings, from a different modality, affirms perennial wisdom. Nothing is left out.

John Dupuy 
You include the All somehow. Listening to you is like hearing someone describe the burning bush—I can smell the smoke. And you hold your humility and humanity and come back as a human being. Such a gift. Thank you, brother.

Roger Walsh 
There’s one more theme I want to point out that’s been underlying so much of what you’ve said. You’ve talked about being guided, taken into, offered, graced by an intelligence and love beyond understanding. What I take from that—resonant with my own far more mundane explorations and with great psychologists, therapists, and psychedelic explorers—is that most of us live at war with our own minds, deeply distrusting our psyches. Yet the deeper we go, the more we discover what you discovered: we can trust ourselves. When we open as fully as we can, we find our minds are not malevolent cesspools of pain and trauma. Yes, those elements are there to face, but there’s so much more. Treated well, our minds are self-healing, self-actualizing, self-correcting, self-transcending. That leads to profound trust in ourselves and in greater reality.

Chris Bache 
Yes, absolutely. We all have knots. We’re born with them; we bring in garbage from previous lifetimes. But when we bring those knots into awareness, they open; they untie themselves. When we bring our pain into awareness, it heals itself; it clarifies. As those shadows lighten, we get clearer and more relaxed, and the genius of our being shows itself more easily and strongly.

The wonderful discovery is that there is ultimately no membrane between our individual existence and the existence of the universe. We drop right through. The awareness bubbling up inside our individual life and the awareness growing around us—in our neighbors, each other, the planet—is the same life, not a separate life. Then we can relate to the beauty of the universe and own it as a reflection of our beauty. Without understanding reincarnation and how life works, we remain estranged from the magnificence of a sunrise or the stars at night. As we get clearer, everything becomes simpler, more transparent. We are, as you say, self-healing, self-clarifying, self-arising.

Roger Walsh 
Wow, Chris, you’ve given us such a gift. I know you’re aware it’s not “your” gift—you’re the instrument through which it’s come, which was your aspiration entering this decades-long investigation. Because of that, this is an extraordinary transmission—perennial discoveries, yet unique in form, time, and its capacity to contextualize within contemporary knowledge and the great traditions. It’s priceless. I bow to you.

Chris Bache 
Gentlemen, I know enough of each of your work to know who I’m with here, and I bow to you deeply. All three of us have been working these fields a long time, nurtured by the wisdom and contributing to it. The bow is returned, brothers—truly.

Roger Walsh 
Thank you. That’s the way it is in the spiritual traditions—we bow to each other, recognizing who we really are. Chris, is there anything you’d like to say by way of completion?

Chris Bache 
First, thank you. I become more whole when I get to speak about these things. Then I get to do what I was designed to do, and there still aren’t many places where I can have the conversation you pulled from me today. So thank you. As a footnote: if there were one gift I could give people straight out of these experiences, it would be letting go of the fear of death. If you’re afraid of death, you have life turned upside down. This is where the hard work is done. Death—we have so many stupid ideas about it—is the great liberation, even a partial liberation. Death is joy. Death is return—return to the arms of the Beloved. To be born begins the hard cycle. To die ends the hard cycle and begins the easy part.

Roger Walsh 
That’s a wonderful flip on our conventional understanding. I’ll close by mentioning your books again: Dark Night, Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind; The Living Classroom, about teaching as transmission; and most recently, the extraordinary LSD and the Mind of the Universe, which we’ve focused on today. John and I can’t recommend it highly enough. Chris, it’s been a sheer delight to do this dialogue with you. Thank you on our behalf, on behalf of our listeners, and all those you’re touching. Deep gratitude. Thank you. This has been Deep Transformation: Self, Society, Spirit, talking with Chris Bache.

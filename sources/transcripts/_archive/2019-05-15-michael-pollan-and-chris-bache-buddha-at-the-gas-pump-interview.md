**Abstract**

Rick Archer hosts Michael Pollan and CHRIS BACHE for a wide-ranging conversation on psychedelics,

consciousness, science, and spirituality. Pollan traces his path from food and nature writing to

investigating the “psychedelic renaissance,” describing clinical research with psilocybin for

cancer-related distress, depression, addiction, and more, and explains current neuroscience around

the default mode network, ego dissolution, and brain network integration. BACHE affirms the value of

rigorous phenomenology alongside biology, discusses reincarnation research, and outlines his

twenty-year, high-dose LSD regimen conducted with Stanislav Grof’s method—its ordeals,

purifications, and transpersonal dimensions, including collective healing and the “ocean of

suffering.” Together they explore integration, ethics, decriminalization, and whether meditation can

reach the same realizations. In the final act, BACHE shares his vision of the “future human”—the

“diamond soul”—and a coming civilizational labor that births deeper planetary oneness.

**RICK ARCHER:** Welcome to Buddha at the Gas Pump. I’m Rick Archer. This is an ongoing series of

interviews with spiritually awakening people. There are over 500 interviews at batgap.com, where you

can browse past episodes. This program is made possible by the support of appreciative listeners and

viewers; there are donation options on the site.

**RICK ARCHER:** My guests today are Michael Pollan and CHRIS BACHE. I’ll introduce Michael first.

He’s the author of eight books, including *How to Change Your Mind*, and earlier bestsellers on food

such as *Cooked*, *Food Rules*, *In Defense of Food*, and *The Botany of Desire*. He’s a longtime

contributor to *The New York Times Magazine* and teaches at Harvard and UC Berkeley, where he is the

John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Science Journalism. In 2010, *Time* named him one of the

100 most influential people in the world.

**RICK ARCHER:** Chris has been on BatGap before in a panel. He is Professor Emeritus in Philosophy

and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct faculty at CIIS, and a fellow at IONS.

An award-winning teacher, he explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary consciousness,

especially psychedelics. His books include *Life Cycles*, *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, *The Living

Classroom*, and the forthcoming *LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*.

**RICK ARCHER:** Michael, some folks still think of you as “the food guy.” How did you shift into

writing about psychedelics?

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** Before food I was really “the nature guy.” I’ve long been fascinated by the

reciprocal relationship between humans and other species—co-evolution—especially plants. In *The

Botany of Desire* I suggested that domesticated plants manipulate us as much as we manipulate them,

evolving to gratify human desires. Food is one desire, beauty another. I was most intrigued by the

plants—and fungi—that thrive by gratifying our desire to change consciousness.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** I’d written on cannabis and plant intelligence, then set it aside while doing

food work. I stumbled on new research giving psilocybin to people with cancer to help with fear of

death or recurrence. As a journalist I sensed something was in the air—serious scientific interest.

At a dinner party a prominent developmental psychologist my age was casually discussing a recent

acid trip and the insights it gave her. A few data points and I thought: there’s a story here.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** I pitched *The New Yorker* and wrote “The Trip Treatment” in 2015—straight

science journalism: researchers, volunteers, the neuroscience and psychology. The volunteer

interviews were extraordinary. One guided journey could completely reset a person’s relationship to

death; about 80% found relief from existential distress. It’s remarkable—a single intervention in a

field where we rarely see that.

**RICK ARCHER:** Beyond cancer, what else is being studied?

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** Depression is big. In the cancer trials, depression scores dropped, so the FDA

encouraged dedicated depression studies. Early work at Imperial College with treatment-resistant

patients showed significant but sometimes short-lived improvements—months rather than years—yet

encouraging. There are trials for alcohol, nicotine, and cocaine addiction; behavioral change may be

a key application. Johns Hopkins is looking at eating disorders; anorexia is notoriously hard to

treat. There’s been a small OCD study and work with high-functioning autistic people with social

anxiety. These conditions share rigid, ruminative patterns—deep grooves of thought and behavior.

Psychedelics deliver a jolt that can break loops and give perspective, provided there’s careful

preparation, guided sessions, and integration afterwards.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** The model is two guides—a man and a woman—non-interventionist but providing a

sense of safety so you can surrender. Then you meet soon after for integration: tell the story,

interpret it, and translate insights into life.

**RICK ARCHER:** Do the therapists themselves take psilocybin to understand it?

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** Off the record, some have; none will say it publicly for reputational reasons.

Frankly, curiosity arises naturally. I realized I couldn’t really grasp the volunteers’ experiences

without having my own, so part of my book is autobiographical work with underground guides, since I

couldn’t enroll in the trials.

**RICK ARCHER:** Since the 1970s there’s been a clampdown. Is research still a trickle?

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** The bottleneck is funding. There’s no federal money; it’s private philanthropy.

But the FDA decided back in ’92 to treat psychedelics like any other drug. If you make the case,

they’ll allow trials; the DEA will license. Now there are multi-site depression trials. Serious

researchers aren’t being blocked; they’re constrained by resources.

**RICK ARCHER:** These aren’t dulling drugs; they open awareness. People say, “Most profound

experience of my life, and I don’t want to drink or smoke anymore.”

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** Exactly. Most psychiatric drugs manage symptoms and are taken daily, sometimes

for life. Here, one or two sessions with a short-acting, non-toxic compound can catalyze enduring

change. A leading hypothesis involves the default mode network (DMN), a tightly linked midline

network connecting prefrontal areas with memory and emotion centers. It’s implicated in the sense of

self, autobiographical memory, mental time travel, and theory of mind.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** Under psychedelics the DMN down-regulates dramatically. That surprised

researchers expecting fireworks everywhere. The degree of DMN quieting correlates with reported ego

dissolution. When the conductor steps back, previously segregated networks start talking directly.

You see increased global connectivity—potentially explaining synesthesia and novel associations.

Temporary rewiring creates new pathways that, if exercised, can persist.

**RICK ARCHER:** If the brain filters rather than produces consciousness, DMN quieting could reduce

filtration so more consciousness shines through. Meditation research shows something similar; Judson

Brewer’s fMRI work found DMN down-regulation in experienced meditators.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** Yes—different vocabularies for a shared phenomenon. You say “reducing valve,” I

say “ego walls.” Either way, the boundaries soften, allowing merging—internally and externally.

**RICK ARCHER:** Chris, thoughts so far?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I appreciate Michael’s careful reporting. He’s brought a rigorous, accessible voice

to a topic many would not otherwise consider. It’s invaluable.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Shunryu Suzuki spoke of little mind and big mind. Little mind gets things done.

When ego becomes transparent, big mind—vast, inclusive—surfaces. The traditions agree there are many

layers of ego to clarify. As ego quiets, the background field of awareness comes forward. Then we

ask: what is mind itself? If there is mind-at-large, we’re off to the races.

**RICK ARCHER:** Science and spirituality can complement each other: treat spiritual claims as

hypotheses and investigate them experientially. Our nervous system is the instrument; psychedelics

can be a tool.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Science excels at quantifying correlates; we can also rigorously study the

qualitative nature of experience—careful screening, shared regimens, detailed phenomenological

reports, cross-comparison, and cross-cultural synthesis. Critical doesn’t only mean neurological.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** A big question is whether brains produce consciousness or whether mind precedes

matter. Consensus science assumes production, though no one knows how cells yield subjectivity. Many

people flip after psychedelic experience.

**RICK ARCHER:** See Mark Gober’s *An End to Upside-Down Thinking* and Jeffrey Kripal’s *The Flip*.

Anomalies keep pecking at strict materialism.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Reincarnation research shifted me. Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia

documented detailed cases of young children recounting prior lives with verifiable specifics,

including birthmarks matching fatal wounds in his two-volume *Reincarnation and Biology*. If

memories predate the current body, mind cannot be only brain-made.

**RICK ARCHER:** Like radios receiving fields. But individuality and its continuity are subtle

questions. Here’s another: traditions describe a subtle body. Is it prudent that anyone can ingest a

psychedelic without that preparation, or can psychedelics themselves help prepare?

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** Chris?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I won’t assume fixed answers about the subtle body. But I do have convictions about

how deep psychedelic work impacts subtle energies. My background: immediately after grad school in

’78 I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work. Convinced that, in carefully controlled settings,

psychedelics could open deeper structures of mind, I adopted his methods.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Grof distinguishes lower-dose, incremental peeling (15–200 micrograms LSD) from

high-dose work (up to ~500–600 micrograms), originally used with the terminally ill to catalyze

near-death-like encounters that reduce anxiety. After a few lower-dose sessions, I undertook a

20-year regimen of high-dose, fully internalized sessions—73 in total at 500–600 micrograms—always

with a trained sitter. My wife, Carol, a clinical psychologist, sat every session.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I do not recommend this protocol. It’s more demanding than early models envisioned.

But done cautiously—about five sessions a year with deep integration—it revealed opportunities and

challenges. One challenge: each descent stabilized at a deeper level of consciousness and a higher

energy state, triggering intense purification—physical, emotional, mental. You must work the body

and subtle energies: detoxifying, clarifying emotions, strengthening the system.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Vajrayana Buddhists do ngöndro—hundreds of thousands of foundational practices,

including prostrations—to purify and strengthen before advanced teachings. Psychedelics can compress

this, but they still demand purification. If you go deep quickly, catharsis is powerful.

**RICK ARCHER:** Your book describes convulsions, vomiting, excruciating ordeals, followed by

ecstatic breakthroughs—core cycles of crisis and higher health.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Psychologically, psychedelics are amplifiers and catalysts. They make what is small

loud and what is distant close. Early on I imagined it was about “fixing Chris.” After a crushing

ego death, a two-year passage through an “ocean of suffering” followed—so vast I concluded it was

not merely personal. The universe seemed to be using my sessions to process lodged pain in the

collective psyche. As each of us retains our own history, the species “mind” retains the totality of

human experience. Healing at that level benefits us all.

**RICK ARCHER:** Like Christ carrying the sins of the world—or the bodhisattva vow—though you frame

it as a natural impulse to relieve suffering when given the chance.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Exactly. You sometimes get that chance in deep work.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** How did the shift from personal to collective occur? Was it in the session or in

later processing?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Both, but the reframe matured over years of study and writing *Dark Night, Early

Dawn*. Existing paradigms focused on individual therapy or enlightenment. Integrating Rupert

Sheldrake’s morphic fields with Grof’s model gave me intellectual permission to interpret the data

collectively. Subsequent archetypal experiences showed the two-way flow between individual and

species mind.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** Skeptics will say: “Drug-induced delusions.” Why should a molecule afford true

insight?

**CHRIS BACHE:** We should be cautious. But several considerations argue for taking these data

seriously. Sometimes knowledge arises that the experiencer could not have known and is later

verified—perinatal details, accurate ethological or physiological information. Grof even reports a

case where, after a session, a sitter contacted parents at a number given in the session and

verified their son had died and “was okay.” Unusual, but not dismissible out of hand.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** You also said you wouldn’t recommend your regimen. Why not—and how did you keep

returning after such agony? Weren’t you worried about frying the circuits or opening to negative

realms?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I trusted Grof’s scholarship and method, especially the imperative to surrender

fully to the process. It can be horrific and take months to understand, but it moves toward healing.

I paced the work, cared for my body, maintained spiritual practice, kept detailed records, and

integrated carefully. The deeper reason I wouldn’t repeat that intensity is what I learned late:

there is no terminus. After many permutations of unity, I was immersed in the diamond luminosity—a

Buddhist Dharmakaya-like clarity—when my visual field pivoted as a ray of light shattered me. I

understood viscerally: the universe is an infinite progression. You cannot “finish” it. That insight

made me gentler about trajectory and pace.

**RICK ARCHER:** Are psychedelic visions projections or perceptions of realities ordinarily beyond

our range?

**CHRIS BACHE:** If there is a creative intelligence—mind of the universe—then methods that open

into it afford genuine contact. Temporary immersion in infinity leaves lasting impress: of truth,

love, and meaning. We still must contend with distortion and incompleteness, but the noetic quality

William James noted is unmistakable.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** With discipline, can meditation reach the same places?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I believe so, with caveats. My north stars are the great contemplatives. Sustaining

these states for months or years commands the highest respect. Carol, my former sitter, later

completed a traditional three-year retreat. I see deep resonance between psychedelic cosmology and

the meditative traditions, while noting that classic maps are stage-specific, reflecting their

contexts. Psychedelics can push edges in areas like trans-temporal immersion. I began with an

“enlightenment track” but was drawn into a second track—cosmological exploration. Late in the work

those tracks began to braid.

**RICK ARCHER:** After 51 years of meditation I resonate with your gentler pacing. Whatever the

path, safety first.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Agreed. If psychedelics are amplifiers, they do nothing that consciousness cannot

do by other means; they accelerate and focus.

**RICK ARCHER:** Audience questions. Amit from New Zealand: after ayahuasca I woke deeply fatigued

for months. Any practices to integrate and minimize detrimental energetic effects?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Each medicine has its character, and strong doses impact physiology and psychology.

Be gentle. Cultivate contemplative practice, tend the body and subtle energies, and stabilize

emotionally and mentally. There is no one formula; assemble a regimen—meditation, breathwork,

stretching, movement, clean diet, community, and time—that supports recovery and integration.

**RICK ARCHER:** Bobby from Georgia: If psychedelics glimpse true nature, is ordinary life veiled by

a sheath formed in childhood? Are infancy and early childhood akin to psychedelics?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Children may retain sensitivities later conditioned out, but I wouldn’t wish the

extremes of psychedelic experience on a child. More broadly, many lines of research—NDEs, OBEs,

reincarnation—suggest a rhythm: death expands us; incarnation contracts us. Over many lives those

polarities gradually reconcile so spiritual and physical dimensions integrate within a lifetime.

**RICK ARCHER:** David from Cambridge: If widely available, could psychedelics harm society? Are

restrictions prudent?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Traditional cultures with long relationships to entheogens use them ritually, not

recreationally. We must learn from them: careful containers, trained guides, communal context. I

favor decriminalization—no one should be jailed for mushrooms—and robust education. These substances

are non-addictive and physiologically safe when used wisely, but they are powerful and deserve

respect.

**RICK ARCHER:** Michael, thank you for joining us today.

**MICHAEL POLLAN:** Thank you. My paperback is out Tuesday; by the time this posts it will be

available.

**RICK ARCHER:** We’ll link it on batgap.com. Chris, let’s continue a bit longer.

**RICK ARCHER:** I want to save time to discuss your “future human” vision—the diamond soul. First,

one last audience question…

**CHRIS BACHE:** Let’s do it.

**RICK ARCHER:** If psilocybin were widely available, could all hell break loose?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Again, ritual wisdom, education, and decriminalization over commercialization. Move

slowly and build responsible culture.

**RICK ARCHER:** Great. Now, the birth of the future human.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In high-dose sessions your identity explodes. For hours you become another kind of

being—taught by the universe according to your capacity. About twenty-three sessions in, a series of

visions began concerning human evolution. The message repeated: we’re poised on the edge of a

breakthrough that will alter the baseline of human consciousness. Pressure is building; detoxification

is accelerating across generations.

**CHRIS BACHE:** For years the “how” was hidden. Then, in 1995, after a grueling descent into deep

time, I experienced the death and rebirth of humanity—not as “Chris having a vision,” but as the

species itself. A global systems crisis—driven foremost by ecological breakdown—precipitates a

collective labor. The suffering is terrible. It feels like extinction. Yet at the peak, the storm

passes. Survivors emerge into unprecedented connection—new values, technologies, social forms, and a

lived sense of oneness with responsibility to all life.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Parallel to this, reincarnational integration accelerates. Former lives fuse—light

winds on a spool—until they culminate in a qualitative shift: the “diamond soul.” An individuality

more whole than the sum of lives, with mind and heart open to the universe and to each other. That,

to me, is the future human.

**RICK ARCHER:** If that arc sounds frightening, the best preparation isn’t stockpiling goods but

stockpiling consciousness—ethics, service, compassion.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Exactly. Survivalism clings to ego. What carries us forward is generosity, clarity,

and courage—together.

**RICK ARCHER:** Anne Baring wrote of your book: “Once or twice in a century a book appears with the

explosive force of a supernova… opening our minds and hearts to a new vision of the universe and our

inseparability from the ineffable being we have called God.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** I did the work over twenty years and waited another twenty before publishing. It

took that long to digest.

**RICK ARCHER:** Chris, thank you. And thanks again to Michael. Visit batgap.com for newsletters,

audio podcast links, and ways to support the show. Until next time.

      <p>Chris Bache delivers a candid, high-energy talk on what three decades of front-line teaching taught him</p>
<p>about learning fields, improvisation, and spiritual responsibility. Framing his book *The Living</p>
<p>Classroom* as a “second Saturn return” summation, Bache recounts starting at Youngstown State in 1979,</p>
<p>surrendering his career plans, and committing to “full-contact” pedagogy with open-enrollment students.</p>
<p>Running parallel was his deep psychedelic practice, which he kept private, even as its aftershocks</p>
<p>spilled into class as synchronicities, intensified attention, and collective catharses. He distinguishes</p>
<p>class fields from course fields, outlines practical ways to open, tend, and close them, and shares</p>
<p>karmic cord-cutting and compassion practices to protect students. In Q&amp;A, Robert McDermott and Rick</p>
<p>Tarnas widen the frame to cultural and astrological currents. Bache speaks vulnerably about “coming</p>
<p>down off the mountain,” letting go of marijuana to fully ground, and his vision of a future human born</p>
<p>through collective purification and embodied love.</p>
<hr />
<p><em><em>[applause]</em></em></p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Feel how that shifted the energy? We don’t have time to mess around anymore.</p>
<p>Let’s get to the serious stuff.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Rick asked me to talk about teaching, as if I’d found secret knowledge in</p>
<p>30 years in Ohio. I’ll just share what I have, then you decide. We’ll keep it lively and get to</p>
<p>discussion, because that’s where the juice is.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Robert is here—among his many works he wrote the preface to <em>The Living Classroom</em>,</p>
<p>which was an honor. I’ll hit a few bullets, then give the backstory.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> This book was my second Saturn-return project. I began teaching in 1979; it came</p>
<p>out in 2008. Before sabbatical I asked in session space which book to write—psychedelics or classroom.</p>
<p>The answer was clear: write <em>The Living Classroom</em> first. Grants arrived. Doors opened. The idea’s</p>
<p>time had come.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> When I came to Youngstown, it broke my heart. I hadn’t done seven years of grad</p>
<p>school to teach in a Rust Belt town without grad students. I tried to leave. Meanwhile I discovered</p>
<p>Stan Grof’s work, started my own sessions, and my mind radicalized. The department had hired a</p>
<p>traditional philosopher; suddenly I was writing on perinatal dynamics and transpersonal theory.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After four years there, a job opened and went traditional. I surrendered. I said,</p>
<p>“Okay, life wants this. I’ll become the best teacher I can.” That choice shaped everything.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> One third of <em>The Living Classroom</em> is student essays. Youngstown also gave me</p>
<p>gifts: freedom to innovate, many non-traditional students, and a quiet place for deep practice.</p>
<p>I did four intense years of psychedelic work, paused six, then ten more.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Teaching open enrollment is full-contact. You motivate, you challenge, you make it</p>
<p>a dojo. Thirty percent drop after week one because I’m clear: if you only want an easy humanities</p>
<p>credit, this isn’t it. But if you offer substance, students work and open their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I split my life. Professionally I did the usual professor things. Privately I did</p>
<p>deep Grofian work. In Ohio you don’t announce that your professor drops acid. I kept quiet. Mind,</p>
<p>however, doesn’t split just because I do.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> One day a student asked a question. Instead of answering from habit, I waited.</p>
<p>A “door” opened in the back of my mind and a new answer arrived on a “slip of paper.” I tried it.</p>
<p>The room lit up. I learned to blend prepared content with improvisational intuition.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Then synchronicities escalated. I’d reach for an example and it would match a</p>
<p>student’s life exactly. The deeper my sessions went, the more often this happened. It wasn’t planned.</p>
<p>It was like lightning. I even put a warning on the syllabus: *This course may be dangerous to your</p>
<p>psychological equilibrium.* They thought I was joking.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I realized I was teaching on two levels. For most, it was information exchange.</p>
<p>For a second group—often the ones who took everything I taught—just being in the room became</p>
<p>transformational. Clarified states are contagious; negative states are contagious. Our spiritual</p>
<p>ecology doesn’t allow private realization.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> This forced a paradigm shift. It wasn’t only “my energy” resonating with theirs.</p>
<p>Students started showing up in each other’s dreams. A social organism emerged. Sheldrake’s morphic</p>
<p>fields clicked for me—not only over centuries, but in 15-week classes.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I distinguish the <em>class field</em>—the living, outer ring of this cohort—from the</p>
<p><em>course field</em>—the long arc created by everyone who has ever taken this course with this teacher.</p>
<p>Sometimes the new class starts where the last one stopped. The learning curve shifts. Adapt or the</p>
<p>energy dies.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> You can work with fields before day one. When I get the roster, I do reconciliation</p>
<p>practices—asking forgiveness, offering forgiveness—and cord-cutting to clear old karma. Later I learned</p>
<p>Tibetan <em>chöd</em>—“cutting.” I also tune the syllabus to the field that’s forming.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> During term, I use behind-the-scenes practices and in-class structures—guided</p>
<p>visualization, café conversations—to strengthen healthy coherence. At the end, I <em>close</em> the field:</p>
<p>celebrate, assess, empower students as individuals, and release the bond. Without closure, some stay</p>
<p>psychically attached and drift.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> “Waking up” in the classroom is discovering transparency—shunyata as see-through.</p>
<p>No one holds their own being alone. When the wind of life moves through the leaves, teaching happens</p>
<p>and there’s no “me” doing it. It’s a joy to be used by something larger.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The circle of learning runs both ways. Often I don’t help students because I learned</p>
<p>something last week. I learned it last week because their future need was already pulsing through me.</p>
<p>We don’t own our careers. Our passions interweave with theirs from the start.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My later sessions went into collective reincarnation—we as a species, not only as</p>
<p>souls. Then into diamond luminosity. The intimacy with the Divine became so deep that returning hurt.</p>
<p>I couldn’t share that material with undergrads. I began to lose my voice from holding back.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Life reshuffled—divorce, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> published, a stint at IONS,</p>
<p>then back to Ohio until my kids finished college. I had to come <em>all the way</em> down the mountain.</p>
<p>For me that meant ending an over-attachment to marijuana. It kept me half-hovering. My vow was to</p>
<p>ground fully so I could finish my work and serve clearly.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I still practice—Vajrayana, Zen—but I don’t try to live in diamond luminosity.</p>
<p>Some beings can. I couldn’t without harming my earthly commitments. Sometimes you can have “too much</p>
<p>God” for a time-bound life.</p>
<p><em><em>[applause]</em></em></p>
<p><strong>ROBERT MCDERMOTT:</strong> You can see why writing the preface was easy. Thank you. And yes, we once sat</p>
<p>for each other in holotropic breathwork. Deeply bonding.</p>
<p><strong>RICK TARNAS:</strong> A note on the etheric transparency you chronicled. The 1990s rode the Uranus–Neptune</p>
<p>conjunction—boundary-dissolving, synchrony-rich. The texture shifted later under Uranus–Pluto’s</p>
<p>intensity. Fields breathe with the zeitgeist.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. At my peak the transmission felt like a lightning rod. Later, subtler. Practice</p>
<p>builds circuitry; when the amperage lowers, the circuits remain, but you have to cooperate more.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE:</strong> Teaching sixth- and seventh-grade poetry terrified me. Your book helped me trust the</p>
<p>field. It formed. Do fields scale cosmologically?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Fields are natural phenomena—group minds emerging from a unified mind. Museums have</p>
<p>fields. So do malls, newsrooms, and militias. Nature isn’t moral in that sense; <em>we</em> choose which</p>
<p>fields to amplify and which to leave.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERT MCDERMOTT:</strong> I’d say fields are “negative” relative to love and evolution when they divide</p>
<p>and harm. Our task is to transform them.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Agreed. Youngstown taught me that. Some places are where bad karma comes to work</p>
<p>itself out. Practices can help lift fields—confession, forgiveness, cutting cords, compassion.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE:</strong> Quantum leaps? Tipping points?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Nonlinear systems show sudden re-patterning far from equilibrium. A species-level</p>
<p>near-death could catalyze exponential change. Field dynamics make rapid shift conceivable without</p>
<p>changing seven billion minds one by one.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE:</strong> Coming down the mountain and marijuana?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Neptune gifts openness; its shadow can be addiction. Marijuana is a mild psychedelic</p>
<p>and a euphoric. For me it kept me from full landing. I asked the Divine not to take me back into the</p>
<p>most ineffable states until I could live there without leaving. Then I chose to ground.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE:</strong> The future human?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The archetypal cradle of the human psyche is shifting. After a collective dark night,</p>
<p>a being emerges whose heart is healed, mind radiant, body green to its roots, and whose communion with</p>
<p>cosmic intelligence is embodied—no escapist cosmologies. When it is born, the long pain will feel</p>
<p>worth it. Our work is to hold that vision through the contractions.</p>

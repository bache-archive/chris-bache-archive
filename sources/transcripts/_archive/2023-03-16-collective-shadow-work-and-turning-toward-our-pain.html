<p>In this probing conversation, host James Jesso invites philosopher and LSD explorer Chris Bache to reflect on the</p>
<p>collective turmoil visible in today’s screen-mediated world. Bache draws on forty years of academic work and twenty</p>
<p>years of high-dose LSD journeys to propose that humanity is undergoing a planet-wide psychedelic initiation. The pair</p>
<p>discuss the necessity of radical self-responsibility, the mechanics of shadow projection, and why turning toward pain</p>
<p>is the only route to deep transformation. Bache argues that embracing more than one’s share of suffering—out of</p>
<p>compassion and commitment to the whole—triggers disproportionate blessings and accelerates personal and collective</p>
<p>evolution. The dialogue offers both a sobering diagnosis of our cultural moment and a hopeful roadmap for navigating</p>
<p>it with courage and integrity.</p>

<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> For listeners who don’t know, this conversation sits atop your forty-year career in philosophy and</p>
<p>your twenty-year journey of high-dose LSD sessions chronicled in <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>.</p>
<p>What I’m seeing online is a world I don’t want to inhabit. I feel complicit in something distorted and ugly: toxic</p>
<p>behavior wrapped in self-righteous moralism—<em>I’m good, you’re evil, be gone</em>. It makes me want to hide.</p>
<p>If we frame this as a collective psychedelic process, the ugliness outside looks like the stuff that surfaces inside</p>
<p>a hard session. You write about not turning away from that pain. Could you speak to that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The starting point of serious psychedelic work is total ownership of your shadow. You shut the door,</p>
<p>sit with your mind, and enter the most daunting, ugly parts you’d rather ignore.</p>
<p>When people project that unowned shadow, the world grows toxic. The breakdown we’re entering will dissolve the story</p>
<p>of <em>good us, bad them</em>. Eventually we must accept responsibility for the pain our lives and lifestyles create.</p>
<p>Some in the psychedelic community get this, because progress demands shadow work. Once you learn that deeper</p>
<p>purification brings deeper ecstasy, you begin to embrace the shadow. Not because you like suffering, but because you</p>
<p>know the reward on the other side—and because compassion moves you to carry pain that isn’t strictly yours.</p>
<p>If you take on more than your share of suffering, the universe responds with more than your share of blessing. Our</p>
<p>generation—and the next—will suffer more than previous ones. When we stop resisting and simply do the work, profound</p>
<p>gifts emerge from that generosity.</p>
<p>Complete surrender accelerates the transformation. On the far side of the ordeal you’re almost back where you</p>
<p>started, but the psychic debris is gone. You’re still you, yet living from a purified ground.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> That’s powerful—thank you. <em>italic brackets</em> <em>[Music fades]</em> <em>italic brackets</em></p>

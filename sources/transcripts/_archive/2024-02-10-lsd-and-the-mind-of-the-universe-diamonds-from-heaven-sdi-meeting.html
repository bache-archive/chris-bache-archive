<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>San Diego Integral hosts CHRIS BACHE for a preview of themes later presented at the Future Human conference. Bache outlines his 20-year regimen of 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted in a tightly standardized setting. Framing psychedelics not only as therapy or individual awakening but as tools for cosmological exploration, he maps a spiral of repeated deaths and rebirths across levels of consciousness—personal, collective, archetypal, causal oneness, and diamond luminosity. He describes the “ocean of suffering” as collective healing work, initiations into archetypal and cosmic orders, the birth of the “diamond soul,” and visions of a species-level transition toward the “future human.” A substantial Q&amp;A explores creativity, transmission, integration, humility, and practicalities of method. Bache emphasizes rigorous practice, ethical grounding, and long-arc integration—“20 years in, 20 years out”—and cautions against inflation while affirming the universe as a profoundly intelligent and loving reality.</p>
<h1>Part 1</h1>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> Welcome to San Diego Integral for February 10, 2024. Our topic is “LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven,” presented by Chris Bache.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> I’m on the leadership team. We’re recording this meeting. If you prefer not to be seen, please turn off your camera, though we love to see your reactions. The link will be posted on Meetup and our YouTube channel. You can also find future events on our website, our Facebook page, or Meetup. Joining those groups ensures you’ll be notified of new presentations.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> Next month we meet March 9; the speaker is to be determined. Chris kindly agreed to preview what he’ll share at the Future Human conference in May, and SDI gets an exclusive. We invite small donations to help cover meeting and equipment costs.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> Let me introduce Chris. He’ll be a keynote presenter for the Future Human conference. Chris is Professor Emeritus in Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He has also been adjunct faculty at CIIS and IONS and served on the advisory council for Stanislav Grof’s training.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> One might ask how a boy raised Roman Catholic in Vicksburg, Mississippi, who entered seminary, came to write about a 20-year journey with LSD. Early on, he left Catholicism and shifted directions in graduate school at Brown. Over decades he refashioned himself as a philosopher of religion. He ended his psychedelic explorations in 1999; years later he published <em>The Living Classroom</em> and then <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven</em>. Please give a warm San Diego Integral welcome to Chris Bache.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be with you. Since psychedelics may not be a frequent topic in your community, we thought we’d start with a short breakout before I say anything—just a quick inventory of your background with psychedelics and the beliefs you’ve formed from experience or study. Very short. We’ll do a brief “before,” and after my talk we’ll do an “after.”</p>
<p><em>[Breakout sessions occur; not recorded.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I wanted you to have complete freedom in the groups, though I wish I’d been a fly on the wall. Later in the dialogue I hope to hear some of your answers. For now I’ll jump in and give an overview of the work I report in <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’ve been a university professor my whole life and, in the background, I carried out one of the longest regimens of high-dose LSD work I’m aware of. I couldn’t speak about it publicly until after I retired; the good citizens of Ohio don’t love their professors doing massive doses of LSD on weekends.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> A difficulty in introducing my work is its duration and the many layers of consciousness accessed over 20 years. Our expectations for psychedelics are often based on small data sets. Aldous Huxley wrote <em>Doors of Perception</em> after one mescaline session and reportedly took psychedelics about ten times. Houston Smith took LSD six times and later echoed Alan Watts: “When you get the message, hang up the phone.” Michael Pollan’s influential book was written after about a half-dozen experiences.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Today’s renaissance focuses on therapeutic outcomes—PTSD, depression, addiction—powerful work largely oriented to the personal psyche. Another stream is spiritual awakening—individual enlightenment. My project is different. I’m a philosopher of religion, not a therapist. My interest has been the philosophical and cosmological potential of these states.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My work descends from Stan Grof. His <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em> and <em>LSD Psychotherapy</em> distinguished psycholytic (lower dose, many sessions) from psychedelic (high dose, few sessions) therapy. I asked: if three high-dose sessions can be done safely, why not more? Between 1979 and 1999 I conducted 73 high-dose LSD sessions—mostly 500–600 micrograms—using a rigorous, standardized protocol: same setting, substance, dose range, sitter, recording process, and location.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The agenda wasn’t clinical healing, though much healing occurred, and not primarily individual awakening. I call it “psychedelic exploration”—cosmological exploration using therapeutic technique. The book focuses on what happened during the peak hours of sessions across the arc of the journey.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> A key pattern was a spiral of death and rebirth. Below the line is space-time and egoic identity; above the line are transpersonal domains. Ego death is only the first of many deaths. At successive thresholds—what some maps call psychic, subtle, and causal—one undergoes further dissolutions appropriate to each level. Standardizing practice seemed to return me to the same interface with larger mind, enabling a progressive deepening.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Looking back, my sessions clustered into five levels: personal mind, collective or species mind, archetypal mind, causal oneness, and diamond luminosity. I’ll sketch each.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> At the level of personal mind, I crossed the perinatal boundary—confrontations with death, fetal sensations, reliving birth, existential alienation. After about ten sessions over two and a half years, the universe snapped me like a twig, turning me inside out. I had identified as a white male professor concerned with meaning; I was opened into hundreds of women of all kinds. The message was: where you’re going, gender doesn’t exist—let go. Held by the Great Mother, I was ushered onward.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Then came the collective mind. Typically a session began with cleansing, then opened into instruction. For many months I was immersed in what I called the ocean of suffering—collective anguish beyond any frame I had known—hours each session. Initially I thought it was simply deeper ego death, but as it continued and expanded across history, I concluded something else was happening: the sessions were being used to process the trauma stored in the collective psyche. As individuals internalize unresolved pain, so too does the species. In amplified states we can sometimes lift fragments of that burden.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After each immersion in the ocean came what I called deep time in the soul. For seven sessions—about a year—I experienced my entire life, beginning to end, as a simultaneous whole. Not eternity, but time operating in different modalities.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After four years and roughly seventeen sessions, I paused the work for six years. When I resumed, the ocean of suffering picked up with uncanny precision where it had left off, which reinforced for me the magnitude and precision of the guiding intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> With that cycle completed, I entered a series of initiations into the universe—carefully orchestrated teachings in cosmic order, far beyond personal reference points.</p>
<h1>Part 2</h1>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Then I was taken into archetypal reality for roughly a year and a half. Each time, it was more real than space-time and ancient beyond imagination. Transitioning required a deeper death: surrendering the identity we carry simply by virtue of being human—species-level ego death. The energies were immense—white-hot, molten, purifying—necessary to sustain clear cognition at those levels.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I encountered two aspects. One was like a platonic order: vast organizing principles responsible for space-time, so immense my mind could only render them as galaxy-scale movements. The other was a living tissue of our species—a single being whose mind and body include us as cells. Nothing is entirely private; there is continual osmosis between individual and species, psychologically and physiologically.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> In the book you mention gentle guidance—intuition, creativity. Are we being influenced by cosmic principles, elders, something akin to a council?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> We are not alone. The universe is hyper-intelligent, conscious, compassionate. It infuses us whether or not we attend to it. As we open through subtler strata, help arrives—healing, guidance—which can come from multiple levels. I like Dwayne Elgin’s image of a mother universe and a daughter universe. It’s kinship, not control—older sister and younger sister. We are of the same stuff.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I also witnessed reincarnation as a collective process—our species pulsing through history in an articulate collective karma, while our individual soul projects nest inside it. After a powerful archetypal opening, I underwent months of intense cleansing to stabilize a higher clarity. Then came what I call the benediction of blessings during the next year.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> “The Forest” was an immersion in oneness and no-self—one power coursing through all things, with emptiness and unity as two faces of a single truth. “Singing the Universe Away” was a deep entry into the primordial void. “Jesus’s Blood” was cosmic love so overwhelming it dissolved me. “The Birth of the Diamond Soul” came as many former lives spiraled back and fused; a diamond light burst from my chest and catapulted awareness into a refined individuality beyond previous frames. My sense is that over millennia the soul begins to awaken inside time—identity shifting from personality to soul, with expanded mind and heart.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Fifteen years in, another transition came: the domain of diamond luminosity, a crystalline, breath-stealing clarity akin to dharmakaya. Over four years I entered it four times, with long intervals of purification and teaching between. The first two entries deepened immersion; then there was a pivot and the diamond light began compressing into mind and biology, re-patterning from within.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In my fiftieth session, at maximum depth in that light, my visual field pivoted and I glimpsed a reality far beyond diamond luminosity. A ray from that domain struck me and shattered everything. I understood then it is an infinite progression. Homecomings occur, but there is no final end point. Even oneness does not exhaust the learnings available.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I gathered another set of experiences into a chapter on the birth of the future human. From 1991 to 1994 I received visions of awakening: a guiding intelligence intent on awakening the species as a single being, a collective dark night, and a tectonic shift in the collective psyche.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In 1995, instead of re-entering diamond luminosity, I was dissolved into the species and taken deep into future time to undergo the death and rebirth of humanity. It was an ordeal—an unraveling triggered by cascading ecological crises. At points it looked like extinction, yet we passed through. Afterward, values and relationships transformed; permeability of heart and higher awareness became ordinary. I wasn’t given dates or mechanics—only the species-level experience that a metamorphosis was underway.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> We have been gestating this for a very long time. Now comes labor—shorter, intense, dangerous, and, if all goes well, birthing a new human.</p>
<h1>Part 3</h1>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In my final year I received a last, far-reaching vision of the future human, then two goodbye sessions. I didn’t decide to stop; the universe closed the arc. I ended in 1999, then spent two decades integrating before publishing.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I thought coming off the mountain would be straightforward. It wasn’t. There is the dying of seeing—what opens during the ascent—and the dying of keeping—what integration demands afterward. Integrating an entire 20-year arc is different from integrating single sessions.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> People reasonably ask about epistemic warrant: can we trust these depths? I’ve addressed that with Ken Ring and elsewhere, drawing on multiple lines of convergence. All my work—on reincarnation, psychedelic theory, the living classroom—flows from this arc. <em>The Living Classroom</em> is being reissued with the fuller story woven in; my students knew nothing of the sessions, yet their learning was measurably affected, which led me toward a “quantum pedagogy.”</p>
<p><strong>TOM MCDOUGALL:</strong> I’ve been studying Nora Bateson and Jeremy Johnson on Gebser. Your sense of a civilizational shift resonates. Can you relate your work to Gebser’s intensification?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Gebser is a thinker I’ve long meant to read, so any correlations will have to be made by others. Not everyone experiences perpetual deepening. Two factors likely shaped mine: very powerful doses and a highly standardized, isolated practice. That stabilized the interface, and the mind being explored took me on as a student.</p>
<p><strong>REGIS:</strong> Gratitude for doing the work and translating it back. It’s inspiring and congruent with my own path.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you. Translation is its own discipline.</p>
<p><strong>SANDY:</strong> Gebser contrasts stage ladders with intensification and inclusion. Do you see resonance?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> When I wrote <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> I used my academic voice. For <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em> I chose a visionary voice—speaking as a witness to what unfolded rather than offering a grand theory. In my experience, when you die as a private self you don’t jump straight to eternity. Often you pass through the human field and can be dissolved into its development. The closest image for the emergent being is the diamond soul—bringing everything forward into a higher synthesis. It is not just an enlightened last-generation human but a new structure of consciousness, glimpsed in our great saints yet now appearing at species scale.</p>
<p><strong>SANDY:</strong> Thank you. Your language of unfolding and intensification already hints at Gebser.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>SANDY:</strong> I loved this, though with my attention bouncing I missed bits. Do you offer counseling? I’d gladly pay for an hour, especially around Jesus and my own path.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you for the trust. Years ago I chose not to do one-on-one work. I’m a teacher more than a clinician, and time is finite. I focus on writing and groups.</p>
<p><strong>TRUDY:</strong> Practical questions. Why did you decide to do this? Did you have a sitter taking notes? Were they influenced by your trips?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Stan Grof’s work spoke directly to my soul’s code. As a philosopher I couldn’t pass up a disciplined way to explore reality’s depths. I broke the law and went for it, carefully. My sitter was my first wife, Carol, a clinical psychologist and serious Vipassana practitioner. She didn’t take psychedelics, but supported my safety. We tried a video once—mostly boring to watch; it’s all internal. We spoke minimally. She followed her path; I followed mine. We learned from each other side by side.</p>
<p><strong>LARRY:</strong> Thank you for the courage and for integrating it back into life. Why “diamond”?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Having known many lights, the quality here was crystalline—diamond was the most natural image. The term appears in Tibetan sources as well. On integration: we can blow through levels with increasing predictability, but embodying what’s seen is the long work. After I finished, I heard “20 years in, 20 years out.” I thought that sounded right if I was lucky; in truth I underestimated. How does a finite being embody infinity, a time-bound being embody deep time, or love with the love the universe has shown you? You can’t cram the infinite into the finite. You integrate the finite into the infinite. That brings you back to basic practice—your cushion.</p>
<h1>Part 4</h1>
<p><strong>EATON:</strong> Thank you for pioneering and bringing it back to us.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>LYNN:</strong> Every time I hear you it’s phenomenal. I find this book paradigm-shifting—clear and dense in the best way. I hope everyone reads it.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I tried to make it transparent and widely accessible, including to those who don’t use psychedelics. Many letters I receive are from dedicated practitioners who recognize the territory.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> You often say “work.” What distinguishes a “session” from a “trip,” and why call it work?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I think of it like a sesshin—an intentional container for deep practice. I isolated from the world, entered in a meditative way, and faced what arose as far as it would go. Breakthroughs require acclimatization; returning repeatedly lets you stabilize cognition at that level and fill in the story being taught. On ineffability: I think it’s overrated as a criterion. It’s hard to speak, yes, but if you can’t say where you’ve been, perhaps you simply got lost—and there’s nothing wrong with being lost. Zen masters speak plainly to those who know. I kept extensive notes—hundreds of pages—of which only a fraction appear in the book.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> You wrote about preparing ourselves to receive transmissions. How do we do that in ordinary life?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In Tibetan contexts, beyond technique and meaning there is lung—transmission of the seed-essence of practice. In my arc, purification was repeatedly demanded to receive higher teachings with clarity. I sense a broader rise in divine influx—more information becoming available not only via the internet but from the depths of being. To catch it we empty what is small so that what is large can land.</p>
<p><strong>SANDY:</strong> Thoughts on “the simulation” idea?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Quantum theory keeps telling us the visible rides on an invisible order. To me, space-time is the skin of an apple; the apple keeps growing, and toward the core it is all light. How we render the deeper orders—threatening or loving—often reflects our psychology. My experience is of a mothering universe—exacting, yes, but wise, creative, and compassionate.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> Some experiences left me sobbing in bliss—language failed. Did you have that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> When the universe’s heart touches yours, it explodes into radiance and the only honest response is a good cry of joy. It becomes a love affair. I called that presence “my Beloved.” After such touch, a sacred hunger abides to live that love here and now.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> I notice sadness woven into the joy.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. In deep intimacy we touch the ache of long absence. Humility is the safeguard. The greatest risk in psychedelic work is inflation—imagining that remarkable experiences make us remarkable persons. Family, students, and daily commitments kept me grounded. Let the inner transformation work quietly. Stay put. Practice.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> Thank you, Chris. Where can people find you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My website is chrisbache.com. I look forward to seeing some of you at the conference. Please introduce yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>TOM KHABIB:</strong> Thanks, everyone. Please RSVP for March 9. Donations help us keep doing this. We’ll now shift to informal dialogue.</p>

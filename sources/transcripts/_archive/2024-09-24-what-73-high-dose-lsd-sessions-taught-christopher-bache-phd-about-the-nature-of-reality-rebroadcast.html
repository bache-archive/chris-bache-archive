<p><em>Part 1</em></p>
<p>Chris Bache joins hosts Steve Theer and Reed Robinson on <em>Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers</em> to discuss</p>
<p>insights from 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over two decades. He outlines his rigorous</p>
<p>Grof-informed protocol—eye shades, curated music, trusted sitter—and explains why very high doses</p>
<p>(500–600 µg) shift the focus from personal therapy to cosmological exploration and collective</p>
<p>processes. Bache describes cycles of death and rebirth beyond ego death, deep integration practices,</p>
<p>and how standardized set and setting allowed a progressive deepening of contact with transpersonal</p>
<p>realms. He reflects on reincarnation, karma as cause-and-effect across lifetimes, and the synergy</p>
<p>between individual and collective healing. Looking ahead, he shares visionary material about a global</p>
<p>crisis catalyzing the “birth of the future human,” culminating in what he calls the Diamond Soul—an</p>
<p>awakening of the reincarnating self within embodied life. He also touches on psychedelics’ role in</p>
<p>cultural transformation and the urgency of ecological challenges.</p>
<p><em>[Music]</em></p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> Welcome back to <em>Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers</em>, the podcast devoted to exploring the</p>
<p>frontiers of psychedelic medicine and what it takes to cultivate a healthy mind, body, and spirit. As</p>
<p>always, the show is brought to you by Numinus. I’m Dr. Steve Theer, and my co-host Dr. Reed Robinson</p>
<p>and I are joined today by Dr. Christopher Bache, PhD.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> Chris is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at</p>
<p>Youngstown State University, adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an</p>
<p>emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy</p>
<p>Training. He’s authored several books, most notably <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, which</p>
<p>recounts what he experienced and learned from 73 high-dose LSD journeys over twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> In today’s conversation we explore Chris’s session protocol; the difference between</p>
<p>using psychedelics for cosmological exploration versus spiritual enlightenment or psychological</p>
<p>healing; how he processed and integrated intense experiences; what he learned about reincarnation and</p>
<p>evolution at individual and collective levels; existential threats facing humanity; what he means by</p>
<p>Diamond Luminosity and the Diamond Soul; and much more.</p>

<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> Chris, thank you so much for joining us.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s a pleasure to be here with you today.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> To start, would you introduce yourself and share the path that brought you to this</p>
<p>work?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’m a retired professor of religious studies. I taught in the Department of</p>
<p>Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, a state university in northeast</p>
<p>Ohio. Early in my academic career—around 1978—I encountered Stan Grof’s work and recognized its</p>
<p>extraordinary importance, not only for clinical psychology but for philosophy, which was my main</p>
<p>interest.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Though illegal at the time, I began a quiet, private psychedelic practice. I worked</p>
<p>intensively for four years, paused for six, then continued for another ten, totaling twenty years of</p>
<p>sessions from ages thirty to fifty. After that I spent two decades digesting and clarifying the</p>
<p>cosmological implications, which became <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> Reading your book, I thought, “What a heroic undertaking.” You’ve said you don’t</p>
<p>recommend your protocol to others. Why?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> First, the protocol: everything I did followed a strict therapeutic frame aligned</p>
<p>with Grof’s <em>LSD Psychotherapy</em>—lying down, eyeshades, carefully curated music, and always a trusted</p>
<p>sitter. My sitter was my then-wife, a clinical psychologist. The container was sacred and stable.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After a few sessions at 250 micrograms, I chose to work at 500–600 micrograms—the</p>
<p>upper, body-saturation range. I initially assumed the work was about personal transformation and</p>
<p>purifying karma. I thought higher doses would process more material faster.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That assumption proved wrong. At very high doses, consciousness is amplified so</p>
<p>deeply that what may begin as personal healing is drawn into collective processes—the species mind,</p>
<p>archetypal and causal levels. Ego death is only the first of many deaths. This path is extremely</p>
<p>demanding and becomes a central focus of one’s life. It’s not about reaching a final destination; the</p>
<p>journey is effectively endless. If I began again, I’d work more gently, balancing low and high doses,</p>
<p>and organic and synthetic medicines. The goal is to open to love, intelligence, and wisdom, to let it</p>
<p>reshape your life—not to “arrive.”</p>
<p><strong>REED ROBINSON:</strong> What are the risks of going straight to those deep states at high doses? Do you risk</p>
<p>bypassing important healing that lower-dose work might address?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Any higher-dose therapeutic work requires careful screening. Some people shouldn’t use</p>
<p>psychedelics; others should proceed very gently. My constitution allowed me to expand and re-cohere</p>
<p>smoothly, but not everyone is wired that way.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In my case I didn’t bypass. The first ten sessions—about two and a half years—were</p>
<p>grueling perinatal work: reliving birth, existential crises, deep clearing. Personal healings happened</p>
<p>throughout, often at the beginning and end of sessions as I left and re-entered time-space. Later,</p>
<p>some healings occurred rapidly. If I had stayed lower dose, those might have surfaced earlier.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> A key insight: my personal wounds anchored one end of a bridge to the collective</p>
<p>psyche. That anchoring allowed my sessions to become a conduit for transmuting some portion of the</p>
<p>collective pain. Had my wounds resolved too quickly, that conduit might have closed. I came to feel</p>
<p>this bridging was part of my soul’s work in this life.</p>
<p><strong>REED ROBINSON:</strong> How much of the ability to enter and hold these states is temperament versus training?</p>
<p>Can people cultivate it?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Both. We can learn to enter non-ordinary states more skillfully if we prepare, proceed</p>
<p>carefully, and integrate thoroughly. Integration—detailed debriefing, journaling, and living the</p>
<p>teachings—sets the baseline for the next session.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I minimized variables across twenty years: same substance, dose, setting, sitter,</p>
<p>recording process—even the same region. Standardizing the contact zone let the conversation with the</p>
<p>universe deepen progressively. Different medicines have different headroom; LSD has broad</p>
<p>cosmological reach. With psilocybin I’d expect overlap but perhaps less “ceiling.”</p>
<p><strong>REED ROBINSON:</strong> How did your wife feel about long-term trip-sitting?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> She did it out of love. Psychedelics weren’t her path—they felt too much, too fast. She</p>
<p>was and is a deeply spiritual person. After twenty-four years we separated but remain friends and co-</p>
<p>parents. She later completed an intensive multi-year retreat in her tradition. Her wisdom grounded me</p>
<p>while I did this work, though it was never her work.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> I’m struck by your rigor. Controlling variables feels like returning to the same drill</p>
<p>site to core deeper. Many people keep changing set, setting, or medicine and “pock-mark the surface.”</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> There’s no single right way—many good ways exist. My training inclined me toward</p>
<p>precision and analysis. I also wanted breadcrumbs in case I needed to find my way back out.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> You’ve written that you began as an atheist-leaning agnostic. How did these experiences</p>
<p>shift your stance toward the divine?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Graduate study led me out of traditional religion and theism. But repeated, structured</p>
<p>journeys through death-rebirth into transpersonal realities make the existence of realities beyond</p>
<p>time-space undeniable—existentially, not just philosophically.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I never met a deity or personal guide. I felt guided by an intelligence whose scope</p>
<p>deepened as my practice deepened. I avoid the word “God” due to baggage. I speak of the creative</p>
<p>intelligence of the universe: mind within and prior to matter, sustaining the cosmos we know. Our</p>
<p>historical concepts are profoundly incomplete. Psychedelics are helping us rewrite them from lived</p>
<p>contact.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> So who are we in that story? Are we the universe experiencing itself—fractal</p>
<p>expressions of a nearly infinite intelligence?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes, that’s a good frame. Our bodies arise from an evolutionary masterpiece; our minds</p>
<p>arise from the universe as well. As we drop beneath the personal psyche into species, planetary, and</p>
<p>galactic fields, we encounter a breathtaking intelligence saturated with compassion.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Add reincarnation—not as belief but as an empirical hypothesis supported by evidence.</p>
<p>I see reincarnation as a higher octave of evolution, folding learning forward at the level of the</p>
<p>individual soul. Individuality seems to emerge somewhere in the evolutionary arc—certainly by</p>
<p>mammalian life—allowing iterative refinement across lifetimes.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Beneath the soul lies essence: the divine itself. We are sparks teased from unity,</p>
<p>polished over thousands of cycles—spirit into matter and back again—until that deeper identity awakens</p>
<p>within embodied life.</p>
<p><strong>REED ROBINSON:</strong> How do you see karma now?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Karma is simply cause and effect shaped by choice. We make choices and inherit</p>
<p>consequences; then we choose again. My view has shifted toward the synergy of personal and collective</p>
<p>karma. Our species is evolving through reincarnational pulses; the boundary between individual and</p>
<p>collective learning is porous.</p>
<p><strong>REED ROBINSON:</strong> Any thoughts on McKenna’s “stoned ape” hypothesis?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Interesting, but I have no special insight. More broadly, I think we’re at a make-or-break</p>
<p>turning point. Psychedelics can accelerate healing and widen worldview. It’s not incidental that LSD</p>
<p>and the nuclear bomb appeared in the same decade; that synchronicity has always struck me.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> Do you have a view on artificial intelligence?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My sessions ended in 1999; AI never appeared in them. From the sidelines, I’m concerned</p>
<p>but open. What most concerns me is the ecological cliff we’re approaching—cascading imbalances</p>
<p>driving global instability throughout this century.</p>
<p><strong>REED ROBINSON:</strong> How much of that realization came from your sessions versus life experience? And how</p>
<p>might psychedelics help us find a better path?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The ecological urgency I now feel was foreshadowed in sessions from 1991–1995. I was</p>
<p>shown we’re entering an evolutionary pivot: a profound unraveling followed by the birth of the future</p>
<p>human. For years I was shown radiant visions without mechanisms. In December 1995, while immersed in</p>
<p>Diamond Luminosity work, I was dissolved into the species mind and lived the death and rebirth of the</p>
<p>human family.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I experienced a global systems crisis—felt like cascading ecological shocks—driving</p>
<p>humanity to the bare challenge of survival. It looked almost like extinction. At the nadir, something</p>
<p>gave way; we moved through, and a fundamental change in the human heart dawned. It felt like a shift in</p>
<p>the plate tectonics of the collective psyche: new values, new institutions, compassion at scale.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I was “taught” mechanisms for rapid collective change when a unified field—our</p>
<p>collective psyche—is shoved far from equilibrium. As in physical systems, novel structures can emerge</p>
<p>quickly and small inputs can have outsized effects. The crisis accelerates transformation.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Later I encountered the archetypal future human—a magnificently heart-open being whose</p>
<p>mind and senses are refined far beyond ours. As consciousness consolidates in the body, perception</p>
<p>clarifies; in one session my vision was orders of magnitude sharper. This is the pivot I call the</p>
<p>birth of the Diamond Soul.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> Do any religious frameworks map onto this—say, the Kali Yuga cycle into a new golden</p>
<p>age?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Many prophecies point to a dark age giving way to renewal. I see today’s “darkness” as</p>
<p>a forced surfacing of karmic conditioning—hatreds, splits of race, gender, nation, wealth—so the psyche</p>
<p>can be cleared and infused with grace. The image of Kali as fierce liberator fits: destruction and</p>
<p>awakening as one movement.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> Integration can be hard. In therapy we see crisis as a refiner’s fire. How did you</p>
<p>handle the aftershocks of those collective visions?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Integration is everything. It took me a year to recover from that 1995 session. If you</p>
<p>go deep, you must be well-grounded—physically, emotionally, psychologically, socially. My sense is we</p>
<p>choose our lives before birth; many of us chose to incarnate now to participate in this demanding</p>
<p>transition—for our sake, our descendants’ sake, and, in a real sense, for the sake of the divine.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> How do you reconcile that with horrific suffering—infants born into disease or war?</p>
<p>Why would any soul choose that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> On the surface, life can be brutal. From within time-space and an individual vantage,</p>
<p>the question is unanswerable. From a wider view, nothing is wasted; all suffering is conserved and</p>
<p>used. The divine experiences all of it with us. I can’t explain it fully, but direct encounters with</p>
<p>the love and wisdom behind existence taught me to trust beyond what I can understand. The love of the</p>
<p>universe is fierce. The path is demanding—and attended.</p>
<p><strong>REED ROBINSON:</strong> Who have been your teachers? How should people proceed wisely?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I taught comparative mysticism and world religions, so the great masters were my</p>
<p>touchstones. I had no psychedelic mentor; the universe was my teacher—tender and ruthless by turns.</p>
<p>For most people, don’t do this alone. Work in responsible settings, with experienced guides and</p>
<p>communities that can help you prepare, enter, and integrate.</p>
<p><strong>REED ROBINSON:</strong> Could you share more about the “birth of the Diamond Soul” and what a path forward</p>
<p>looks like?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Midway through my journey—in my 38th session after intense purification—I felt all my</p>
<p>former lives pour into me, winding like string onto a kite spool. At a critical mass they fused—an</p>
<p>explosion of diamond light from my chest—and I was catapulted into a mode of individuality beyond any I</p>
<p>had known. Teachings followed for months to anchor it.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Classic “up-and-out” models say we improve lifetime by lifetime until we awaken and</p>
<p>depart. I was shown that’s only half the story. If we keep incarnating long enough, the soul destined</p>
<p>to awaken eventually wakes up <em>inside</em> embodied life. That is the Diamond Soul.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Imagine the whole species undergoing this labor. We’ve gestated the future human for</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of years; gestation is long, labor is short and intense. We cannot run this</p>
<p>planet from egoic consciousness. We must grow up or go extinct. My experiences show we make it</p>
<p>through—barely perhaps—but on the other side we will say it was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> I’m deeply grateful for your work and your willingness to share it.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you. It’s an honor to be in conversation and to share these teachings.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> Where can people find you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My website is chrisbache.com. Many papers are also on academia.edu under my name. I’m</p>
<p>not teaching formally at present. I’m giving talks, and retreats may be emerging.</p>
<p><strong>STEVE THEER:</strong> Thanks again, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you, and thank you both for the healing work you bring into the world.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Host <strong>James W. Jesso</strong> welcomes philosopher and psychedelic researcher <strong>Christopher M. Bache</strong> to discuss Bache’s</p>
<p>twenty-year program of seventy-three high-dose LSD sessions aimed at mapping the furthest reaches of human</p>
<p>consciousness. Bache recounts the disciplined method behind 500–600 µg sessions, his progressive initiations</p>
<p>through personal, collective, archetypal and non-dual domains, and the shattering brilliance of the “diamond</p>
<p>luminosity.” He explains the cycles of purification and ecstasy, the ocean of collective suffering, encounters with</p>
<p>deep-time evolutionary intelligence, and visions of a post-catastrophe “future human.” The conversation explores</p>
<p>differences between LSD, psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT, the burden of secrecy in an anti-psychedelic culture, and the</p>
<p>challenge of integrating infinite realities into finite life. Bache closes with reflections on love, loneliness,</p>
<p>ongoing integration, and his forthcoming book <em>Diamonds From Heaven</em>.</p>

<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> <em>[testing mic]</em> Great, audio’s good. How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’m well—looking forward to our conversation.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> <em>[Music]</em> Hello everyone, welcome back to <strong>Adventures Through the Mind</strong>. Big thanks to the Spirit</p>
<p>Plant Medicine Conference, November 2–4 in Vancouver. Today’s guest, <strong>Chris Bache</strong>, will present there and I’ll be</p>
<p>attending. Follow the link in the description—tickets help cover my travel. Win-win!</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> Chris is professor emeritus of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct</p>
<p>faculty at CIIS, and a Fellow at IONS. His work examines the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states,</p>
<p>especially psychedelics. He’s written <em>Life Cycles</em>, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, and <em>The Living Classroom</em>—with a new</p>
<p>book, <em>Diamonds From Heaven</em>, due in 2019. About forty years ago he decided it was a good idea to take very high doses</p>
<p>of LSD… seventy-six times over twenty years—to map consciousness. Today we’ll explore what drove him, what happened,</p>
<p>and what he learned.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I finished grad school in ’78 as an atheistically inclined agnostic. That year I read Stan Grof’s</p>
<p><em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em> and instantly felt I’d found my life’s work. The Controlled Substances Act had</p>
<p>already shut down research, yet Grof convinced me the work could be done safely. I resolved to split my life in two:</p>
<p>publicly teach philosophy; privately launch a long LSD exploration—eventually seventy-three sessions between 1979 and</p>
<p>1999, each 500–600 µg. High dose let me plunge deep despite limited opportunities—a dual-career marriage, two kids.</p>
<p>What began as personal enlightenment shattered that model and became something far larger.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> Early on you faced multiple deaths and rebirths. Can you outline the phases?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> For two years I relived birth trauma and perinatal death—until my personal self was crushed. Then I</p>
<p>was reborn into the collective psyche, wading through an “ocean of suffering” spanning human history. On the ecstatic</p>
<p>side I witnessed my life as a simultaneous whole, then received vast cosmological teachings. Another death pitched me</p>
<p>beyond species into archetypal reality—immense living forces beyond Plato or Jung. Later I entered causal, non-dual</p>
<p>realms… and finally the “diamond luminosity,” an indescribably clear crystalline light Buddhists call the absolute</p>
<p>clear light. I reached it only four times—about once a year in the last twenty-six sessions.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> People on 5-MeO-DMT claim the “ultimate” non-dual. Your take?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Those flashes are genuine, yet brief. After fifteen years I thought I’d reached the end—until the</p>
<p>50th session pivoted me 90° into a light beyond the diamond. I realized depth is infinite; talk of ultimates is</p>
<p>premature.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> How did purification feel as you left time-space itself?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The deeper the level, the higher the energy. You must surrender every pattern that keeps you small.</p>
<p>It’s terrifying, yet blessings always match the ordeal. Eventually you seek the cleansing because you trust what lies</p>
<p>beyond.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> Differences between LSD and psilocybin?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Psilocybin is body-grounded, sweeping through tissues and emotions. High-dose LSD catapults upward,</p>
<p>sometimes leaving the body behind, driving toward the “cosmological ceiling.” Later I used mushrooms and ayahuasca to</p>
<p>help integrate, grounding that celestial charge.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> Why stop after 1999?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Two reasons: pain and heartache. The energetic load burned my body. More importantly, returning to</p>
<p>separation after union with the divine became unbearable. I vowed not to re-enter that depth until I could stay.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> And integration?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> You can’t pack infinity into the finite; you must integrate the finite into infinity—moment by moment.</p>
<p>Silence imposed by prohibition hindered me. Writing <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> helped, yet real healing began when I</p>
<p>could finally speak openly in <em>Diamonds From Heaven</em>. Now transcendence and immanence weave together; the loneliness</p>
<p>eases.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> Where can listeners find you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My earlier books are on Amazon; <em>Diamonds From Heaven</em> comes from Inner Traditions in 2019. A website</p>
<p>is on the way.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES JESSO:</strong> Wonderful. Thank you, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you, James. Great questions.</p>

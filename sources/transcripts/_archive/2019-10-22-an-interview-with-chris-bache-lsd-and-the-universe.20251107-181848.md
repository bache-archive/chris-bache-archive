**Marc Caron: ** Hello and good afternoon. My name is Mark Kron. I'm here with my co-host for the Spirit Plant Medicine Conference, Steve, Mr. Steven Gray, good friend. Glad to be here. And today we have a very special guest on our little talk about our speakers for the upcoming conference. We have Mr. Chris Bache. Now, Chris is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. He's an award-winning teacher, and Chris's work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. Chris has also written three books. One is called *Lifecycles*, another *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, and *The Living Classroom*. His new book is *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, which is actually the title of his talk as well for the conference coming up in actually a month tomorrow. We start in four weeks. So welcome, Chris. Pleasure to see you again. Have a conversation. It's always great to hear what you have to say, and we look forward to having you at the conference again. But as we get started, maybe you can introduce yourself and let our viewers know a little bit about your story and the work that you've done in terms of, I think we're just talking about, you know, 73 high dosage LSD journeys as a mind in the mind of a psychologist or philosopher, if I remember correctly, from last year.

**Chris Bache: ** Yeah, well, I was actually a professor of religious studies, and I taught in a philosophy of religious studies program at the university, which is part of the Ohio State system, up in the northeast corner of the state. And I'm really excited about the conference. I'm very, very pleased that the book is actually being released for the first time anywhere at the conference, and after all the years of research and all the years of writing, finally, it's coming out and allowing me to have a conversation that I've been waiting to have for a long time. Because basically, in order to do psychedelic work myself, to explore the philosophical potential of psychedelic states, I had to do all this work underground, so it was hidden from my colleagues. I couldn't really talk about it. In my day job, I was a conventional, you know, maybe not so conventional, but I was a religious studies professor. None of my students knew about my work. So this is a conversation that I've been waiting for a long time. I had to wait until after I retired to have it. I had to wait until after I was past the statute of limitations for my psychedelic crimes, and I've been, I'm just delighted to begin this conversation here at the conference and in the workshop we'll do following the weekend after the conference.

**Stephen Gray: ** Great. Wow. Yeah. So, oh gosh, you know, we could all ask all kinds of questions.

**Marc Caron: ** Just that introduction gave me about 10 of them right now.

**Stephen Gray: ** Why don't you fire one out then, Mark?

**Marc Caron: ** I just, you know, might not even be a question now that I think about it. But the big part that struck me there, Chris, was talking about how you had to hide the work from your colleagues, doing it underground, and even the consideration of the statute of limitations running out before you can talk about these things, you know, it's a really profoundly thought-out process in terms of what you had to deal with, even to do your research, so I wanted to acknowledge that. And I guess the question is, what was the biggest challenge in terms of keeping it all kind of contained to yourself?

**Chris Bache: ** Well, I knew that silence was going to be the prerequisite that would allow me to do this work, so I took that responsibility when I did the work, but over the long term, I did not appreciate that. First of all, the loneliness would become the issue that it became, the kind of the inability to share your experiences, the inability to engage in conversations like that. If I lived in San Francisco, where there’s, you know, or in Vancouver, where there’s an active psychedelic community, it would have been different, but I lived in Ohio, and so there really wasn't an active psychedelic community here to share my experiences with and to have the conversation. But I found actually that in the long term, after that, I finished the work. I did this work. I did 73 high-dose sessions between 1979 and 1999, and so I waited 20 years, you know, to write the book, to tell the full story. I've written about, you know, my story in *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, but I really didn't tell the full story until now. What I found was that not being able to talk about your experiences actually inhibits or compromises your ability to fully integrate your experiences into your life. So I was able to integrate them at one level, at a sort of a personal psychological level, but I wasn't able to integrate them into my full person. I'm a teacher. I love to learn knowledge and to share that knowledge with students. I could not teach from these experiences. I could not draw upon the things I had learned, and I found that that cumulatively made me sick. It literally kind of made me psychologically sick, like living in a closet is just sickening for anybody, whether keeping them in the closet. So being in a psychedelic closet was really a burden. And now that the first level of the burden is off by writing the book and going public, and the second level has been lifting, as I have begun to talk about this material, and I hope this will continue to deepen in the years ahead, as I have the give and take of conversation.

**Stephen Gray: ** Well, that's quite understandable. Thank you for sharing that with us. That was a good question, I think, Mark. But now let's talk about the material itself.

**Marc Caron: ** Even, can I make one comment about that? Because I think it's a really important part of what we're seeing in our community here now as well, especially in the past year since the last conference, is integration being the biggest, you know, kind of buzzword now, and you talked about that in terms of your isolation and being alone in that and how important that is, and that's what we're seeing in terms of the community that we're creating, and not even really creating, we're bringing people together because, you know, we're all out there. We're just kind of, you know, pulling it together, like a hub. And so I think it was really important that you talk about that, and that's the big part, so people can talk about their experiences, which is a big part of what our conference is. Because it's not just for, you know, doctors and practitioners, naturopaths and things. It's for people who are looking to, you know, connect with people, so they can actually share, talk about their experiences and go even deeper with their own work. So thank you really for touching on that, and I think it's really important, especially considering, you know, that 20 years of doing it in the closet.

**Chris Bache: ** I think that I'm really, really pleased to see integration being discussed more. There's an anthology that's going to be coming out in London within a year, all about integration. Finding, of course, with the technology that we have with this, with the session material and the sacred medicines we have, we can blow out the system, you know, increasingly easy, but integrating those experiences and integrating, you know, we can't stay in these states, that's clear. But learning how to live with the memories of deep immersion in the universe, using those memories skillfully as part of your daily meditation practice and your social integration, that's really important. And another aspect for me has been I wrote *The Living Classroom* because I found that while my students never learned about, never knew about my psychedelic work, they were actually being activated by my private work. You know, because consciousness is not private, it's an open field. And the deeper I went, the more deeply my students were being drawn implicitly into my work. And that's what really led me to address this in *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, and then to write this small book *The Living Classroom* about fields of consciousness in groups.

**Stephen Gray: ** Well, I was going to try to lead you into some of the content of the material that you learned. But as long as we're on integration, maybe we should follow up a little bit more on that. So with this question, what do you think are the most important aspects of integration for, you know, the typical person who's doing, say, you know, a couple of Ayahuasca, two, three Ayahuasca sessions, or weekends a year, or something like that? Maybe working with Psilocybin mushrooms a bit, and then they're living in, you know, Vancouver, you know, or some urban center, you know, what do you think are the most helpful things that those people can do to make sure that they try to keep those channels open and keep themselves grounded properly?

**Chris Bache: ** Yeah, good question. I mean, I don't think I have a pat answer for that. I'd like more dialogue around it. But basically, the things that spring to mind is, first in your sessions, emphasizing clean contact, controlling the variables, controlling the isolation, so that you have clean contact with these realities, not smudgy contracts, any confusion, clean contact. And then the first step is remembering your session, so writing up a detailed description within 24 hours, because these memories fade over time. And then once, personally, once I write up a session, I never change it. I've learned that trying to edit it, clean it up, you can lose some things. And I actually, when I'm, of course, this is more relevant, perhaps when you're pushing way, way deep beyond conventional reality. Just to write a good session up, I listen to the music that I played during the session while I'm writing up my account, because it allows me to get deeper into my memories and get them down on paper. So I think the other thing I think is important is a daily spiritual practice, whatever form, yoga, meditation, rule of thumb is, the deeper you're going into non-ordinary states, the stronger should be your daily practice. Well, that's a good one. And then just, you know, people use art to bring their sessions, hold on to their sessions. For me, I've been given lots of teachings in my sessions, and I've been given meditation. I've been given practices, so my responsibility is to try to live by that teaching as best I can, and to cultivate those practices, to actually do the assignments that I was given. And then I think sharing with other people is really critical to listen to their experiences and to share your experiences. There's nothing that can replace that.

**Stephen Gray: ** Wonderful. So now, can we get into some...

**Marc Caron: ** Steve, it's your turn.

**Stephen Gray: ** No, it's not that wise. I'm not looking for my turn. I'm looking for the material. You know, it's actually not about, it's not about any of us, really.

**Marc Caron: ** And that's, I just like having fun with you, my friend. That's all indeed, yeah. So it's all good. Well, okay, so from my point of view, you know, I've read this book, and I've also read *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, and what stands out to me, there are so many amazing things that have happened, that happened to you during that 20-year period that people would find stunning, like the whole time when you experienced all your past lives, the time when they grabbed you by the balls, so to speak, and made you become like just about every different kind of woman on the planet. But the ultimate, from my point of view, is what most affects everybody on this planet, which is what you've called the Great Death and the Great Awakening. And I wonder if you could elaborate on that somewhat.

**Chris Bache: ** Well, let me back up just a little bit to give a context, and then you bring me back. If I don't get back to it in time, you bring me back to this, the birth of the future human. Okay? Yes, I found that in when I was working with these very high levels of LSD. And again, this is a protocol that I honestly, sincerely do not recommend that people follow. Doing individual high-dose LSD sessions is fine, but doing such a relentless, long, really, completely rigorous, nothing but high-dose LSD sessions is not something that I would recommend. I would balance high-dose, low-dose. That balance Psilocybin in Ayahuasca with LSD, but I did this work starting 40 years ago, so I didn't understand it as well as I understand now. Basically, when by working with these very high doses, you can blow open consciousness and enter into a deeper level of reality, go through a Death-Rebirth process. And what I found was that by going back again and again and again, not only does your experience stabilize at this deeper level of reality, but if you keep going back and if you keep pushing your own limits, you will go through a Death-Rebirth cycle again and enter a deeper level of reality. And if you keep pushing, you'll go through another Death-Rebirth and go through a deeper level of reality. And it's not ego that is simply dying over and over again, but it does really become a question, what is dying in these advanced deaths and rebirths? And I actually have an appendix, which is in the book, which is asking the question, what dies? What's actually dying? But when I was charting the overall levels of the development in my journey, I identified five core fundamental cycles of death and rebirth, and this is something I'll be talking about at the conference. First was going beyond physical identity, the death of self, ego death. The second was going into collective mind, the ocean of suffering and some of the lower levels of subtle level reality. The third level going into archetypal mind, really moving deep into archetypal reality, both in terms of this collective unconscious, the species mind, and also into cosmic, logical archetype of reality. Fourth Level was going into oneness, the fundamental condition of oneness. And the fifth level is what I call diamond luminosity. Going into the diamond luminosity, what Buddhism calls Dharmakāya, or the clear light of absolute reality. So all of my sessions kind of can fall into these categories. And but then, while there's this deepening process and going into collective dimensions, archetypal dimensions, causal oneness, and going into diamond luminosity, I began to have rhythmic, systematic initiations into a series of ideas that had to do with the entire human species. In fact, the entire trajectory of my experiences was not personal. It really wasn't primarily about my personal healing or my personal development or my personal enlightenment. Everything seemed to be converging around the theme of humanity's collective transformation, that seemed to be the work of the hour. That's what we're here for. That's what we're about. We're at a life and death moment for the species. And my work and all of our work seem to be part of this convergence that’s taking place in history, taking us through this transition that we're going through. And this is what I came to call the birth of the future human, leaving it open-ended what the form of this future human will take. I have my own experience of it and my own theory of it, in a way. And I think it is a combination of the reincarnation project process that will take us into a different level of our species' evolution. It's a shift that takes place, I think, at the fundamental archetype level of the core blueprint of the human species. We're really doing some work that's going to influence and trigger a pivot in the blueprint of the human psyche. And I don't think we're going to make this jump into this new psychological awareness of the heart and mind without going through a tremendously painful transformation process, the dark night of our collective soul, which is essentially a time of purification, a time of letting go of the past, a time of basically coming to terms with the choices we've been making historically in the past, making new choices, choices that do not reinforce the stories of hate or stories of class division, racial division, religious division, the nationalisms which tear our planet apart, the economic divisions which have done, which cause so much damage. Literally, I think we have to consume the karma that those choices have brought us, and we've been making those choices. I mean, you know, we reincarnate generation by generation, so we're carrying the entire history of the human planet in our history, in our souls, in our stories. And as we change those stories, we contribute to a change in the playing field of humanity. And so in my work, I've been taken into that process, gone through tremendous exercises of purification and healing of the collective psyche, of the wars that we've fought and all the terrible things we've done to each other and have been taken into what I call deep time, into dimensions of time where the future becomes available, becomes as available as the present, and been given glimpses into the culmination of this death and rebirth process experienced at a collective level and then the transformation of our species into this higher order of humanity that's coming forward. That, to me, is the most important theme of the work, because, yeah, all of us are involved, all of our children, all of our grandchildren. I think where we're going with this is that it's, you know, it's, I don't know what the timeline is, but you know, in some relatively near future, it is going to be clear to the whole planet that this is job number one, as Ford used to call it. So how about this question related to that then, you know, you listed off the kind of ways in which the human enterprises, you know, off track. Work like nationalism, racism, religion, divisions, and perhaps, you know, right up there at the top, you know, materialist illusion that promotes 50 families having half the wealth on the planet, or whatever that is. So given that it appears that we are as a species so far away, you know, I mean, lots of people are making inroads into the transformation, of course, but it's, you know, in total numbers, out of 8 billion people, it's a minuscule number of people. So that, given that, you know, 98 or 99% of the planet is not getting, not even aware of this possibility, let alone doing anything to move in that direction, what's it going to take? It seems to me, it's going to take terrible disasters of some kind to open up a crack. What do you think?

**Chris Bache: ** How can we get as far as we need to get in as little time as we have, as the global crisis triggers a cascade of a series of economic, political, social crises that we're seeing?

**Marc Caron: ** Not even mentioned environmental.

**Chris Bache: ** Oh, yeah, yes, yeah. I sort of, I don't have any secret, any inside information of the how, when and why of what's happening. You know, just that we're going into a global systems crisis, which is being driven by global ecological crisis and other imbalances in the world. But then, after years of being shown this very, very positive, optimistic fulfilling our evolutionary destiny, it didn't, it had never shown me how, how could we possibly make this transition? And you're asking that question, Steven, exactly. And then one particular session, what I call the Great Awakening session, session 55 took me into that process and into this trauma, and it also gave me a set of teachings around how we could actually make this transition. And it has to do with understanding the dynamics of the collective psyche that all of our individual psyches feed into and are part of. We are fractal embodiments of our collective psyche and all of our experience, as Rupert Sheldrake talks about in morphic field theory, all of our experience is being processed, collected and processed at a collective level. And we know something well. The basic formula is this, our collective psyche is a field. Fields have behaved in certain predictable ways. There's a correlation between the way the collective psychic field of humanity will behave as it enters into extreme crisis, and the way other physical systems behave when they go into what are called non-linear systems or far from equilibrium states. The basic vision is this, when we go deeper into this century, we are going to go into a period of tremendous pain. I mean, just, I don't see any way around it. We're going to suffer terribly. And in contrast to anything that's happened before, this pain will not be restricted to one continent or one part. It's going to be global. It's going to be massive, and all of this pain that we are going to experience individually is going to be feeding into the collective psyche, so that the collective psyche itself will be moving into increasingly non-linear conditions. When a field, when the psychic field of humanity moves into these non-linear conditions, several, if we can extrapolate lessons from physical fields, we can hypothesize that several things will begin to happen. First, small perturbations can produce very large effects. So the impact, or the effects of individuals on the outcome of history will increase. Good one individual can have a larger trigger on the future.

**Stephen Gray: ** Yeah, could I interrupt for a sec? I think I understand what you mean by non-linear conditions, but perhaps it needs a little more clear clarification. Can you go into that a wee bit more?

**Chris Bache: ** Basically? And here, I'm not a scientist, so my apologies to those who really could answer this question much better. But basically, when you have a system, it develops a balance between energy in and energy out. And if you keep pouring more and more energy into that system, it becomes increasingly unstable. And when it becomes unstable, it shows characteristics which are not like it was when it was a stable system. When it becomes so unstable, we find that in nature, it can respond to this instability to draw out new levels of creativity out of nature itself. So non-linear systems are highly creative systems. They produce things which we wouldn't have predicted pre-obviously, and it's fast. Things changes can take place very fast when they're in non-linear conditions. So it's just individual can have disproportionate effects on the outcome in non-linear conditions. So technically, the term would be in systems that are in the far from equilibrium state. Yeah. So creativity, spontaneity, fast changes, and individuals having larger influence, right?

**Stephen Gray: ** So obviously, that's a pretty scary, you know, prognostication for the decades coming. But it also suggests that when you know that, you know, as Leonard Cohen said, there's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in. And so what might that look like? You know? And I think it might be useful for people watching this to imagine what conditions or what the new human might be like, so that we can recognize the inklings of that awakening in ourselves. Can you elaborate on that?

**Chris Bache: ** Yeah, let's remind ourselves that the human beings that this will be happening to are thousands and tens of thousands of years old because we're, it will be happening to souls in human bodies, not simply 200-year beings, but 100,000-year-old beings who have this very complex psychic history of their former lives, all kind of flowing within them as they enter into time. So my understanding of what has come through my sessions repeatedly is that, as without, so within, so what is happening on the planet at the geopolitical level, at the geophysical level, as we are trying to become an integrated planet and get past this stage of evolution where we are so fractured and divided, as we are confronting our history geopolitically, we are also confronting our history inside the history of the soul, and the fragmentations within the soul. And the sessions have shown me, taught me that there seems to be a synergistic relationship between engaging a changing world outside of us as we work to create a future that is fundamentally different than the past and a maturation which is taking place where we kind of integrate our former lives in a way that leads to an arising of an awareness that is an intuitive and immediately experienced awareness that my mind and my heart are not the age of my body. My mind and my heart are much older than my body and my relationships are much older than my present body's relationships. I am living in time as time as a manifestation of creative energy. Everyone around me is doing this. We've been doing it for generations. I think that what we're witnessing, the only way to put it a different way, the ego created this global crisis. The ego cannot solve it. Soul is the only thing that can solve it. I think we're making a transition from ego consciousness, individual body-mind consciousness, to soul consciousness. And by soul consciousness, I don't mean simply a disembodied ego. I mean what I call the diamond soul, all of our history integrated in a way that generates a higher level of functioning, so that we begin to live out of a larger platform. And I think we can see this happening around us when people take up projects that they know they won't finish in their lifetime, when they are willing to die so that others can live, when their commitments are not to their own individual private enhancement, but to the enhancement of larger numbers of people. I think what we're seeing is the soul. Those are the symptoms of the soul emerging in our psychological awareness. We just don't know what to call it. We just think, oh, this is a great being. This is a Gandhi. This is a Martin Luther King. But really, what we're seeing is the maturation of the soul within our individual lives.

**Stephen Gray: ** And do you see a lot of that happening?

**Chris Bache: ** Well, just look around us, because there are a lot of people doing a lot of injurious things, but there are a lot of people doing some magnificent things. You know, they are committing themselves to projects that they'll never see realized in their lifetime. And I think we're going to see more and more of that as we really come to terms with the fact that the way we're living just isn't working. You know, the way we've organized our culture isn't working. We need to be experimenting with new and different ways of creating an economy, creating social, family, so on, so forth. I think now, here's the thing. There are no guarantees in evolution, right? There's no guarantee that we're going to come through this. There's no guarantee that the next form of the human being will be born successfully. But the more we experience the intelligence of the universe when we work in our sessions, the more we experience the profound wisdom that's behind the formation of galaxies and the formation of solar systems and the emergence of light, that intelligence seems to think that humanity is ready for this transition. Gestation is a long process, right? But birth is very short, very fast, and convulsive. I think we have been maturing through thousands and thousands of years. The soul has been—now Nature says it's time to give birth to the soul inside history, not just when we die inside history. This is hard work. This is what we're coming into, I think.

**Stephen Gray: ** What a beautiful vision. It's, you know, you know, it's this idea of having a vision and having hope that's going to kind of keep people going. I think, as things collapse that way, I'm just curious. It may not even be all that relevant to the discussion at hand, but I want to ask you anyway, I, you know, I gather from reading, you know, the books that the teachings you are receiving are about humanity and about our journey. But you know, just what you can see with the naked eye, there are many, many thousands of bodies that are much like our Sun, producing heat and light. Did you ever get a sense that there are other planets, other species that are going through similar things, or have been through them and have successfully come through them, or any of that sort of thing?

**Chris Bache: ** You know, I've never explored that particular aspect of things, or it was never put in front of me. I mean, I never directed my sessions. I've tried to set intentions, but a deeper intelligence did all the groundwork for what happened. And essentially, it never took me there, but it was just the very nature of the experiences that it took me into. It was just assumed that we are one speck in a much larger, cosmological process with life emerging, life and life and life and galaxies all over the place, that we are incubating something taking place on this planet, but it parallels things which are taking place elsewhere, because nature is just vast, and it works. It works in groups. You know, it's evolved. You know, these are the dynamics of evolution. So to me, I just assume when I look up in the night sky and I see all those stars, I just assume that somewhere there, there is life percolating and struggling at all sorts of different levels around the universe.

**Stephen Gray: ** Switching tax a little. There's a segment of the psychedelic community that's very devoted to natural plants. You know, the core of your work was with a semi-synthetic substance, LSD. What’s your take on that? What do you say to those people that say, you know, nature knows best?

**Chris Bache: ** Somehow, I think nature does know best in many ways. I mean, I think natural plants are very good plants to work with, good ways to work. Most of human history has been in dialog with natural, sacred medicines. I don't think to me to make too much of the difference between a synthetic, meaning a man-made human medicine and an organic medicine. I don't know that I would put quite the emphasis on that that some people do. I do think that around any work with a medicine with any regularly induced state of consciousness, fields develop, so that there are fields around Psilocybin mushrooms, you know, psychic fields that reflect humanity's history with them. There are fields around Ayahuasca. I think maybe that's why people who have never lived in the Amazon and are doing Ayahuasca in Texas, they encounter these giant snakes in their first session. Somehow, there's a field around these medicines. And so when we open our mind, we don't simply open our mind. We open up through these fields, into these fields, and they speak to us. Now, LSD has a—it doesn't have a historical field associated with it. You know, a few years in the 60s, it's nothing compared to the fields associated with Ayahuasca or Mescaline or Peyote, so it's relatively feel free. And I think it has, of course, it also tends to be a high altitude psychedelic. So many of the organic psychedelics are much more sensitively tuned to the nearby psychedelic world, which... it's a very helpful and relevant psychedelic world, the world of spirit guides, the world of animal collective psyches, of angelic figures, so on and so forth. LSD tends to be somewhat neutral. It doesn't have a lot of history, and it tends to drive into the high—at high levels, it tends to drive into high cosmic, logical territory. So I think it's good for giving—at least for me, I think I drilled a deep borehole in the universe, and it gave me a lot of overview, but it didn't give me a lot of experience up close with the nearby territory that is explored, and I've experienced in Ayahuasca sessions or in Psilocybin sessions that I did after I completed my LSD work.

**Stephen Gray: ** So you found those to be a good adjunct. For you?

**Chris Bache: ** They have been a good adjunct. And I wish that I hadn't been smart enough to be using those adjuncts all the way along during those 20 years. 

**Marc Caron: ** That was my question for you, Chris, is, what was it that made you choose LSD in 1979 when you did, versus, say, the magic mushroom back then?

**Chris Bache: ** Yeah, well, I read Stan Grof's work. You know, Stan Grof published "Realms of the Human Unconscious" in 1976. I came out of graduate school in 78. I read that book and very quickly, "LSD Psychotherapy," which came out in 1980, and this is what Stan had done his early research work on—this was the material. In my case, I was able to find a way to get high quality, you know, laboratory grade LSD. And so it was a combination of I trusted Stan Grof's work; his methodology was really around LSD in the early years, and it was only because of his research that I trusted my own mind into going through this process, and it was the substance that was available to me.

**Stephen Gray: ** What about—what's your take on five MeO DMT? It's becoming more and more popular, and I think it needs to be discussed more. Let me just put it this way. I was on a panel discussion on psychedelics and their role in the future last weekend at a small conference here, and we broke up into groups, and the panelists were asked to sit in with some of these groups. And one of the people in the little group I was in said, you know, her view of psychedelics—she'd, I think she'd had a couple of experiences with them—was she thought they were a door that shouldn't be opened. So I say that in the context of five MeO DMT, because I've had one full-on experience with it, and I mean, it was absolutely stunning at the moment, where I just went, oh my god, this is what I've been waiting to realize at the gut level my whole life. But since then, that's like three months ago, I really have no idea how that it's informing my ongoing spiritual awakening journey. So I don't know where that fits into the pantheon, as it were. Do you have any feelings/thoughts about that?

**Chris Bache: ** First of all, I don't have a lot of experience with five MeO DMT. I've only done a couple of sessions. They were ecstatically wonderful sessions. They were luminous sessions. I did this years after doing the LSD work. So the mind I brought to the five MeO DMT experience—it’s not the mind that I had in the beginning of my LSD work. It was the mind that had been polished and curated over all the years of that work. So I yield, really, to people who have more experience with this substance in the discussion. It is striking how fast it can drop you deep, deep into the universe, but the speed within it—drop within the speed with which it drops you deep into the universe—and your time there is so short, and then you're back, it makes integration or healing... it’s better for opening doors than it is for really deeply internalizing the experiences that you've opened into. Which doesn't mean it's a bad thing. I mean, opening doors and letting in the brush of fresh air can be very helpful. But there's something—one thing I have learned about LSD, of course, it's a long day, it's a big commitment. It commits you to a day before, at least all day session, and a day after. And on the day of a session, it's an eight-hour commitment. And you know, usually about five or six or seven hours you'd like, oh, come on, now, let’s get this over. I'm ready to come back. But one of the things that it does is, by keeping you in these states for long periods of time, it allows the mind—the mind that you are exploring—to polish the mind that is doing the exploring. Because in this work, you’re always using the mind to explore mind. So the length of time that you expend gives the universe more time to heal you. It gives the universe more time to show you things, to teach you things, and it teaches me things over and over and over again. It really repeatedly will teach me something until it's sure that I've got it, and it'll keep this up for several sessions in a row. So I think there is a certain polishing that takes place in long sacred medicines that doesn't take place in short-acting sacred medicines. Again, that doesn't mean the short-acting sacred medicines are not useful and they're not good. It's just that it's different. The Native American traditions, the Brazilian traditions, they have preferred, in many cases, the longer-acting sessions. Peyote is longer acting. Ayahuasca is longer acting. The Psilocybin mushroom is not as long as LSD, but it's a longer-acting substance. They consider the length of time that we spend in these conditions to be special and sacred, you know. And also, Rick Strassman, when he was doing his work on DMT— not five MeO DMT, but on DMT—he was surprised to find that while people had very deep experiences in their DMT session, he found that it didn't really produce long-lasting results for the majority of them. So it's something about quick in, quick out—hard to really convert that into a transformational experience.

**Marc Caron: ** I can certainly, you know, agree with that statement. And kind of what you're talking about, Steven, and the five MeO with just the DMT. I was like, it was, it was an experience, all right. But I was like, okay, so how does that—what's—I couldn't nail any kind of like spiritual experience or mysticism. Well, there's certainly mysticism. I guess that's not the word, but it was, you know, it left me with more questions, because what I saw was just really, what was that? What does it—all these hieroglyphics and things that I was seeing and what is work—I trusted my DNA, and you know, my soul and spirit were getting it all. But I was like, I still look back at it...

**Stephen Gray: ** …and go, what was that? You know? 

**Chris Bache: ** So, yeah, that brings up another related question. I think this, like—I don't know if this is quite an exact, accurate assessment or, you know, description of the journeys that you went on. But the way I remember it, correct me if I'm not quite getting the exact nuance here, was that you— you said there were two parts to every journey. First two hours or so was a lot of letting go. Sometimes, I think I remember you use the term exquisitely painful, before you broke out into the living intelligence of the universe. If I may say so, I think you're perhaps unusual in that sense, in that you were suited, perhaps from your past, you know, lives or whatever—your destiny, so to speak, karma in this lifetime—to go to these places. But I—and correct me if I'm wrong—but I think the majority of the, you know, psychonauts, as it were, you know, the people that we're going to be talking to at the conference and so on, are not likely to go there. And it's more about having to get ourselves out of our own way, the healing that we need to do. So, you know, do you have some thoughts on that? You know, where that’s at for most people?

**Chris Bache: ** Yeah, well, I think basically what I understand now at the end is different than what I understood at the beginning, and it leads me to approach working with non-ordinary states differently. Now, I'm kind of much more patient with the slow, gradual developmental process, rather than trying to accelerate the process so far, because I thought in my early in my work, I thought, ah, the goal was to get someplace. I’d get to an end destination. I’d get to home. I'd go home, or become one with God, or I dissolve into the primordial void. And I had all of those experiences, but what I found was they didn't have as long-lasting a penetrating transformation on my person as I thought they might in the beginning. And I also found when I went as deep as I ever went into the diamond luminosity, I found that what I initially had felt like after absolute homecoming, the sweetest, most totally soul-satisfying homecoming. In that moment, I was shown—given a series of experiences that showed me that there is an infinite territory beyond where I was, so that the idea of getting to the end of a journey was just—I let it go. It didn't work anymore. So now, instead of trying to reach some spiritually defined definition or end state of enlightenment or nirvana or oneness with God, now I feel much more patient with opening up, taking what's given to you, healing, receiving the teaching, but keeping it within a measure that’s kind of more practical. So that there may come a time when you want to go up periscope, you know, take a deep look around. But a lot of the really productive work, I think, is done at a lower level. We don't have to tear apart our psyche as deeply as I did or other people do sometimes in order to really remember who we are, remember what's happening in history. So I guess I would counsel a gentler approach into these things.

**Stephen Gray: ** Good one. Yeah.

**Chris Bache: ** Now, as a philosopher who had a deep passion to understand how the world was put together, you know that part of me, I wouldn't trade this 73 days for anything on earth. I mean, they just gave me an understanding of how the world works, which has changed my heart, changed my life, yeah, and...

**Stephen Gray: ** But—and your work for this lifetime too—to share that, right? So on this notion of going gentler, maybe you could share with people a little bit about what you hope to accomplish, or what you hope people might walk away with at the end of the workshop you're going to do on the following weekend after the conference.

**Chris Bache: ** You know, I really don't know yet. I know what I've experienced. I know what's living inside me as living memories. I'm trying to figure out how I can make these useful to other people. I know that they're things that I know, and they're things that I understand. I know that when I begin to get into the memory of these events, when I begin to describe them or that they get activated within me, I know that my consciousness changes just in the talking about them. I'm still trying to figure out how I can make this living experience, which is only mine in a certain way. I didn't give myself these experiences. The Universe poured these experiences in me. How can I make these available to people? Or whatever—maybe it's not making them available. How can I be of use to people in their own spiritual practice? Given the history that I've gone through, I'm now that I'm getting to do the workshops—that's what I want to explore. I want to explore, for example, when we're—can we go into guided visualization exercises? When people go kind of into deep relaxation or kind of a semi-hypnotic state. Can I work with them in a way which will allow them to enter more deeply into their own inner being? Because I've explored some of these dimensions of my own inner being, and therefore I have a certain sense of some of the ways maps can be drawn. Can I convert that into something that will be useful to people as they explore their own inner being?

**Stephen Gray: ** So just so that people understand who might be interested in coming to this, it's not going to be Chris Bache yacking at you for two days, right? You're going to do a lot of exercises with people. 

**Marc Caron: ** One thing, Steven, we're not doing LSD.

**Stephen Gray: ** Yeah, no, of course not. No, no, no, no.

**Marc Caron: ** Not doing anything, any short-acting, nothing there, yeah.

**Stephen Gray: ** But what I hear you saying—and I accept it 100% because I know that you're saying it from a point, a place of humility—is that your energetic field, from what you've accumulated in your learning, could have an influence energetically on the room while they're doing that. Is that a correct way of putting it?

**Chris Bache: ** I think so. I mean, basically, this is what happened with my students. What I wrote about in "The Living Classroom," my so-called individual experiencing my deeper consciousness with the larger consciousness, the mind of the universe, had an effect on my students, which was a combination of healing and liberating and kind of causing them to face things in their life that they may not were initially wanting to face. But when they did, it had a very beneficial outcome. So I know that my being and their beings are interconnected in these very, very subtle ways. So I would think that something similar happens whenever people gather in groups with a shared intention, and they're engaged in meaningful exercises which everyone kind of chooses to participate in—that our energies interact. Their energy comes into me, my energy flows into them, and the question then becomes, well, what can we do with our shared intention? How deeply can we take this? What insights can we trigger, and what healing—I find that when I teach in workshops, people—the healings take place without me intentionally doing it or doing anything. It's just when we get together, we open our hearts and minds, things happen.

**Stephen Gray: ** Beautiful. You know, just from the Department of wild ideas, so to speak, have you ever considered doing something like this with, say, a very light dose of a psychedelic to amplify or potentially deepen that collective possibility there?

**Chris Bache: ** Well, that, of course, is the way shamans typically work. Often, their client or subject will be using a sacred medicine, and they will use the same sacred medicine, perhaps a lighter dose, to go into these states together. That’s, of course, there’s so much history behind it; we know that that works. Well, I’ve never done that. First, I don’t—I have chosen not to be a therapist, not to sort of work with people going into psychedelic states. That was a conscious choice on my part. That’s a different skill set. You know, I’m comfortable there, but I’ve chosen to push my own limits rather than help people push their limits. But as a teacher now, this is something different. Because just opening our minds and our hearts to these horizons has a very powerful impact. I find now, there may come a time when I would do what you’re suggesting, but that time is not now. Now my time is to sort of get the ideas out, to engage in the psychedelic circle and see where our discussion and exercises can take us. And also, I, at the end of this work—I don’t want to go too deeply into this, but basically at the end of my work, there were energies that were moving deeper and deeper into my physical body, into my psychological body, and then deeper internalization process. And I realized at the end of my work that in order to let this process mature and complete itself, I had to not alter my consciousness. I had to not amplify it. I had to sit still and let these energies come into me rather than go out to meet them.

**Stephen Gray: ** You talked about even having to stop using cannabis for that reason, didn't you?

**Chris Bache: ** Well, a little bit different with the cannabis. But when I—let me back up and tell a different story around that. When I stopped my sessions in '99, I had been given so many gifts, and there were so many treasures that I had been given. I thought that stopping my sessions would be a pretty straightforward process. I could just stop, and I would be able to remember and be nurtured by these many wonderful experiences. But what I found was that it was more complicated than that. What I found is that I had entered so deeply and so intimately into dimensions of the Universe and dimensions of the Divine. You know, that when I stepped back into time, space, consciousness, and I knew that I was—my journey, my psychedelic journey was heads over—at least this part of my journey was over. Over the years, I entered into a very kind of deep existential sadness. I was literally suffering from withdrawal of the Divine, from the Divine. I just— I knew I would never have the type of ecstatic joy that I had had in my deepest sessions, where coming light transformed there, and I got developed an over-attachment to marijuana during this period because I was kind of self-medicating, and the marijuana allowed me to kind of stay a little bit above the earth and not come completely off the mountain. Eventually, I had to address that and to give that up in order to come completely off the ground, off the mountain, to get completely grounded in time, space, in order to continue the integration process that had been taking place inside the sessions themselves. So my work—a lot of my work—and it's not that I never touch it or I don't do psychedelics at all, but my work is primarily a contemplative work now. And one of the things I'm experimenting with is how to build, how to take classical spiritual practice, which for me come out of the Vajrayāna tradition, some of these classic, you know, deity exercises, Guru Yoga exercises, meditation, contemplation exercises—how to empower those by drawing upon my memories of these specific states of consciousness which are relevant to these outcomes. So it's trying to develop forms of spiritual practice that consciously integrate psychedelic experience without trying to replicate them.

**Stephen Gray: ** Sounds like a good sort of long-term plan for people heading toward eldership.

**Marc Caron: ** Hey, Mark, it's been an hour or more. What do you think? Should we…

**Marc Caron: ** We're pretty much ready to wrap it up. It's almost an hour. Because I feel like we can dig in and go deep every time we speak with you, Chris. And of course, we want to leave something for the guys who and gals who come to the conference, of course, and for the two-day workshop, which is the place to really go into the deep dive. But I just love so much of what you shared today. There's some things that really stuck with me, and one was just about gestation, birth and convulsions. It really, really kind of struck a chord with what's kind of happening in the future, as well as just some of your other, you know, brilliant insights in terms of your work. So I personally thank you for that, and I look forward to meeting you again this year at the conference. I don't know, Steven, you got something else you want to, you know, rabbit hole you want to go down?

**Stephen Gray: ** No, absolutely not. No. I mean, that's a long discussion, and a lot of great stuff came out. I hope for people—I just hope a lot of people see this and then come to the conference if they're not already, you know, signed up to do that. And are you gonna do your little FBl, 33 thing today, Mark?

**Marc Caron: ** You just did it, Steve.

**Stephen Gray: ** Better explain what it is, then.

**Marc Caron: ** It's, no, it's not like some five MeO or anything. FBL, 33 for anybody watching this, or, you know, wanting to come to the conference, since the prices are up at regular price, it's just a discount that we're offering you for watching the video and being part of our community, being curious, looking for answers, being on the path. And yeah, so FBL, 33 is something there for you there. And we're just always happy to connect with you, Chris. I look forward to another great weekend, another great VIP party. We look forward to that one too. We had a good time.

**Chris Bache: ** We had a good time. And I just, I'm really honored, and looking forward to coming back to Vancouver, coming into the conference. When I was there last time, I had just finished writing the book "End Stages," and that was all about the book that’s going to come. And now the book is out. The book will be available in Vancouver for the first time, and I'm just so pleased to be able to bring it to this particular audience, because I was so moved by all the participants in last year's conference and the excellent speakers that you had gathered. It's a real, living vitality, vital community that you've created there. It’s just a pleasure and an honor to be back.

**Stephen Gray: ** Wonderful. Hey, Mark, before we go, though, maybe you should just say a wee bit more about this workshop that Chris is going to be doing, because it sounds like it's going to be amazing to me. I actually can't go myself, or I would definitely go.

**Marc Caron: ** I’m going to post it in the comments of this interview, this conversation, but it's really a talk on this book, and Chris can tell us more about the event, but it's going to be on the—hang on. Let me just pull up the date—Chicago.

**Stephen Gray: ** I think he already explained it. I'm thinking more they can get tickets and whatnot.

**Marc Caron: ** Put that link out here, because it's right here. I just didn't have it at my ready.

**Stephen Gray: ** Sure.

**Chris Bache: ** It's going to be the Friday and Saturday, the weekend after the conference, and it's going to be two full days with a meal provided, I think, right? Yep, lunches, yeah. So it's going to be lunches. It's going to be an opportunity to really settle down and sink deep into the mystery, into this material. But it's also—it's a dialog. It's about sharing our experiences and processing them together. And it's exploring different exercises so that we can not just absorb these ideas intellectually, but absorb them in our hearts and psychologically into our souls. Wonderful. I'm really looking forward to it. It's a new adventure for me, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

**Marc Caron: ** I've just shared it in the comment section on the Facebook feed. So for anybody interested, they can find it there. It's on the Spirit Plant Medicine website, Conscious Living Network website—it is all out there. And it's in some promotional materials and emails going out with our pre- and post-conference events as we get geared up for a month leading up to the conference. It’s going to be go time. It’s kind of what makes me thrive and go a little crazy. And I enjoy the pressure because it seems to be what it takes to get things done for me. Thank God for a deadline.

**Stephen Gray: ** Yeah, you know, and Mark deserves an immense amount of credit, because you're working really hard at this, Mark.

**Marc Caron: ** Yeah, there’s a conference like this.

**Stephen Gray: ** Just enjoying the process, learning new things every time, because there's a lot of, you know, moving parts. And also, it's like Steve says to me today, you got that on your list, Mark, and I go, list? I'm supposed to have a list? Oh, no. So, yeah, it's go time. We're four weeks away—four weeks away tomorrow. So anybody out there who wants to come, happy to have you there. And we’re looking to be a sold-out crowd. There might be one-day tickets available, but yeah, happy to see it all happen for the ninth year. Thank you, Chris, again for being part of it, a second year in a row.

**Chris Bache: ** My pleasure.

**Stephen Gray: ** Awesome, Steven. It's never a day without my fix of Stephen Gray, so that's it today. And thank you, everyone for watching. Any questions, you can always comment, message us, and connect through our many different social media feeds. So thank you very much, and take care of yourselves out there. Happy journey.

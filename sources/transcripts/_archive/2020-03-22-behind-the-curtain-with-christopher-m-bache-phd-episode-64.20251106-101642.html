<p>Like a smile, another side I truly live. All right, are you doing good? Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>"Frank, likewise. All right. Well done on the book."</p>
<p>"Thank you. Thank you, pleasure."</p>
<p>"Not only because obviously writing a book in and of itself is an achievement, but the nature of this particular book—I’m almost exhausted reading some of it. I’ve read a good bit, and I’m exhausted because of the journeys."</p>
<p>"Yeah, it was quite a journey. It's always hard to summarize in any meaningful way in a one-hour podcast or whatever, but certainly a message that I'm looking forward to bringing into the world."</p>
<p>"Yeah, where do you begin? You can always start at the beginning, which is the easiest way. But, actually, you know what? I might just ask: how are you now? How is life treating you?"</p>
<p>"Life is very good now, especially now that I've finally written the book. Going public with this has been a very healing and deepening experience to claim my memories and begin to speak about them without inhibition. It has deepened my integration of those experiences in my life. I don’t know where it’s going; I suspect in three years I may be in a very different place than I am now, but I’m in a good place now."</p>
<p>"What we're talking about is your book, 'LSD and the Mind of the Universe.' It documents 73 high-dose LSD sessions, trips, and all the insights that come with that. For anyone who's taken a psychedelic, especially if you've gone on one big trip, you know: 73 journeys is like giving birth 73 times. Maybe let's start at the start. You didn’t know in the beginning what was going to happen. You took a trip, documented it, but you didn’t know you were going to keep going over such a long period of time."</p>
<p>"What happened was, fresh out of graduate school at 29 years old, I was just starting out as a professor of religious studies at Youngstown State University. Having finished my dissertation, I was looking for where to take my research. I read Stanislav Grof's 'Realms of the Human Unconscious' which had just been published, and I thought, I’ve got to get in on this. This is just fantastic—not only extraordinary for psychology, but it will have enormous implications for the philosophy of religion as well. I felt a draw; it was as if I found my life’s work. I started with three low-dose sessions, about 200 micrograms. I got my bearings, and then shifted to high-dose sessions, consistently at 500 to 600 micrograms. That's not a protocol I recommend; I strongly advise against it for reasons I explain in the book. I documented everything as carefully as I could, keeping all the variables consistent as I worked through these sessions. I think what makes this story unusual is not just the depth of where it went, but the stabilization of the variables over 20 years—always the same sitter, same setting, same physical location, same medicine, same dose. I established a remarkably stable listening post as I entered into this dialogue with the universe."</p>
<p>"I always admire works of patience, and 20 years is certainly a testament to that. Right now, it seems like psychedelics are receiving a great deal of attention in mainstream media, especially over the last six to seven years. But the darker sides or risks associated with psychedelics aren’t often discussed. I feel you’ve really captured that effectively, particularly because this is not just someone getting high with friends. As you noted, you went through a rigorous process, delving into the depths of suffering. How do you prepare for that every time, knowing it feels like gearing up for war?"</p>
<p>"In a way, you have to go through the same mental preparation that a soldier does before battle or a mother before labor. You need to be focused, internalized, and ready for whatever the day may bring. At the end of the first chapter, I expressed my concern about sharing this journey due to the amount of suffering it contains. I take time to prepare the reader for the suffering represented, especially the suffering of death and rebirth. To move into a deeper state of consciousness, you must surrender your attachment to your physical consciousness and identity, which is essentially a death-rebirth process. This process is often discussed in therapeutic contexts but it's less understood that you must go through radical surrender of everything you’ve known to experience deeper states of consciousness. If you're going to press the journey hard or long as I did, you’ll undergo a lot of purification and detoxification. Each deeper level of the universe operates at a higher level of energy; thus, you must undergo purification to stabilize your consciousness at that deeper level, ensuring your awareness remains coherent. If you don’t, your awareness will fragment."</p>
<p>"And what do you think death is?"</p>
<p>"Eventually, you reach a point where, having gone through many cycles of death and rebirth, the concept of death loses its meaning. You've learned that you can experience the loss of all your reference points—everything you know yourself to be can be shattered and destroyed—but the Phoenix always rises. You wake up to a changed self at a deeper level of reality. From this perspective, there’s no such thing as death. It’s merely shedding one particular set of parameters within which awareness operates, allowing consciousness to expand into deeper experiences of reality. The death of the physical body resembles what you go through in a deep LSD session; you lose your physical reference points, and consciousness expands into a deeper universe. Eventually, the concept of death loses its meaning."</p>
<p>"That’s interesting. I spoke to someone who described the psychedelic experience as existentially violent at times. It’s not always a walk in the park."</p>
<p>"Yes, I think 'existentially violent' is a fair description. You might assume after doing 50 sessions that you’ll get comfortable, but that's not what's true. The universe is infinitely deep, with an infinite number of levels. As long as you’re willing to push the experience’s edges, the universe will continue to take you deeper, and you’ll have to endure more death and rebirth processes."</p>
<p>"When you refer to the universe, what do you mean?"</p>
<p>"My experience, of course, involves letting go of consciousness at the physical level to enter deeper dimensions of consciousness, which are all fundamentally unified. I’ve never perceived this universe as having a face or identity; it’s always been open-ended. Some might call it the infinite or the absolute. I refer to it as the creative intelligence of the universe. It feels like a creative intelligence behind and within the universe, manifesting different aspects at different times. Ultimately, I call it my beloved because once you enter into it, you recover your true identity within its essence, opening up dimensions of love within you that it pours into you."</p>
<p>"That resonates—there's a sense of love beyond us, a love that embraces everything."</p>
<p>"Yes, it’s a deeper love than human love—something alive within us when we experience love. It’s the radical love that the Dao has for the 10,000 things. It's the love being has for itself because, from its perspective, all of us and all creation are manifestations of its being. How could it not love us?"</p>
<p>"When you refer to 'my beloved,' what does that signify? Some argue that it can only see itself through reflections, that it can only appear as part of our experience."</p>
<p>"Exactly. It’s challenging to objectify the beloved in that way. It exists already and is complete. While we talk about the experiences I’ve documented, it offers the impression of being once removed, but it’s part of it already."</p>
<p>"We have many cultural narratives about this totality of consciousness, haven't we? Cultural scripting represents our best guesses about what it is and isn’t. This intelligence is billions of years in the making, and we’re just scratching the surface of engaging with it."</p>
<p>"Exactly! I’m not sure whether this intelligence is self-aware except through us; that idea seems to place an enormous privilege on our role as the divine mirror. However, when I dissolve my boundaries as Chris Bache and enter into these deeper layers, I find many layers to this phenomenon. Some initial layers pertain to my species consciousness and the mind of the collective unconscious. Other layers delve into planetary consciousness—Gaia consciousness—and even beyond that, addressing the root causes within time and space. Each level of entry allows for clearer states of being and awareness."</p>
<p>"And do you still feel that, despite having spent so much time exploring this, you're still only scraping the surface of this vastness?"</p>
<p>"Yes, this was a major realization I had during my 50th session. After 14 years of work, I entered what I call the Diamond Luminosity work. During those sessions, especially the second of the four, I experienced ecstatic diamond consciousness so profound. Toward the end of the session, my visual field flipped, opening up to another reality—worlds upon worlds beyond me. The light that accompanied this realization shattered my previous notions, indicating that the idea of reaching an end point in this work was inaccurate. You do have moments of profound homecoming, but the diamond Luminosity became my practical destination. It satisfied me completely, but I recognized that it was an infinite ocean, leading me to give up the idea of ever reaching an endpoint."</p>
<p>"Unfathomable everything."</p>
<p>"Yes, on one level, the mystical experience is often termed ineffable, but I think making ineffability a primary characteristic can be limiting. We should relentlessly explore what lies at the edges of awareness rather than surrender to silence. Although it can seem unfathomable, I believe we can understand these experiences with commitment and discipline. Language may falter, but it’s important to push the boundaries of our understanding instead of retreating into the silence."</p>
<p>"In your book, there’s a sense of us—creating everything through a communal experience. Can you elaborate on that?"</p>
<p>"This book isn’t primarily about personal healing or my personal journey. While I did receive insights for my life, I focus on what took place during the peak hours of these intensely high sessions. It’s a cosmic, logical story about the universe and its generalizable aspects. When entering profoundly expansive states of consciousness, there’s a sense of an 'I' present, not necessarily functioning individually but as part of a larger experience. While I am an individual, what’s crucial is the accessibility of these dimensions to all of us, regardless of the methods we use—be it psychedelics, meditation, or contemplation."</p>
<p>"It’s fascinating how, even though you didn’t emphasize the personal aspect, consciousness is still integrated throughout."</p>
<p>"Absolutely, my journey is personal, but the most significant aspects transcended me. The filter of Chris Bache was, in many ways, shattered during the most important parts of the experience."</p>
<p>"What about the immense suffering you faced? Do you think you were in that suffering, or was it the suffering itself?"</p>
<p>"That's an intriguing question. Sometimes it felt like I had to go through that ocean of suffering, almost like the symbolism of dying on the cross. It felt essential for shedding the resistance, allowing expansiveness to emerge."</p>
<h3>Behind the Curtain with Christopher M. Bache, Ph.D. (Episode 64)</h3>
<p>"Well, my understanding of the ocean of suffering deepened and changed over the years. After about two years, two and a half years of work, I went through what Stan Grof describes as the perinatal level of consciousness. I felt like a poster child for the perennial severe seizures, existential crisis, confronting the meaninglessness of life, reliving aspects of my birth, and eventually experienced a deep and shattering ego death. Everything I knew myself to be was turned inside out. I was forced to become the opposite of what I knew myself to be. </p>
<p>I was a male, highly educated, white academic obsessed with the meaning of life. I became women—lots of women, women of color, women who had no philosophical interest whatsoever. It just shattered my identity and took me into a deeper spiritual dimension. After one transition experience, I went from that condition into the ocean of suffering. It was an expanding landscape that systematically deepened year by year for over two years of active session work. </p>
<p>I encountered horrendous planes of human suffering, opening to thousands of beings across thousands of years—just unimaginable brutalities. Initially, I thought this was a deepening of my ego death, but over time, my perspective shifted. I began to understand that there are different levels of the universe, and what’s occurring depends on which level you're operating on. At that subtle level of reality, I was engaging with the collective psyche, and the tremendous purification processes I underwent were not aimed at my personal transformation but at transforming some aspect of the collective psyche. </p>
<p>I realized the healing generated in these sessions was aimed at my species, not just me. This build-up lasted for two years. Actually, during one year, I stopped and then resumed six years later, and the ocean of suffering began exactly where I had paused. It continued to deepen and culminated in an intense experience that spun me into archetypal reality, and after that, the ocean of suffering never returned.</p>
<p>We undergo a process of cleaning out the personal unconscious, leading to an ego death, while simultaneously healing aspects of the collective unconscious. What prevents this suffering from being internalized as trauma is the willingness to surrender completely and let the session guide you, even when it doesn’t make sense at the time. This process leads you to a breaking point and then to reconciliation and ecstatic embrace, so what you internalize is a whole cycle: the trauma, the breakthrough, and the reconciliation. I was willing to return to pain for two reasons—a calling to it and the understanding that I sought insights and ecstasy on the other side of it.</p>
<p>In the second year of my journey through the ocean of suffering, I broke through into experiences I summarized in my chapter, <em>Initiation of the Universe</em>. One of the first things I was shown was what felt like the font of creation. I experienced the beginnings of creation, akin to a Big Bang experience, and it felt like we all voluntarily chose to participate in creation. The suffering we encounter is not inflicted upon us; it is part of our chosen right of passage in the adventure of creating and manifesting the universe.</p>
<p>During the book, there’s a part where you mention a sense of no beginning." </p>
<p>"That doesn't ring a bell. I would have to think about that," Chris replied.</p>
<p>"Well, say this experience seems to explode the sense of duration," Frank noted.</p>
<p>"There are different modalities in which time exists that you experience in psychedelic states," Chris explained. "I’ve had experiences of timelessness, moving beyond time and space. There's another subtler dimension I call deep time, where different spans can be experienced as simultaneously present. In early sessions, I stabilized my life from beginning to end, realizing all my experiences were happening at once. Later, I was taken into larger segments of deep time, what I refer to as collective deep time, revealing aspects of human evolution across time spans of 100,000 years, or even more. </p>
<p>By the end of my journey, I encountered a temporal landscape of perhaps a million years. My conviction now is that there are different modalities of time operating within the universe, and I don't fully understand how this is possible. I’ve discussed this with some physicists exploring different temporal dimensions. I’ve experienced time in various ways, beyond mere negation of time itself. </p>
<p>"If I told you there is no time?" Frank asked.</p>
<p>"I would say there are dimensions of existence in which that's true," Chris replied. "Time comes into existence with space, so as you move to the edges of space, you enter domains where time behaves differently. Within space-time, the arrow of time is generally true, but that doesn’t encompass the entirety of the universe. We know 96% of it is dark matter and dark energy—elements we struggle to comprehend. </p>
<p>In regards to your sense of the ego, it’s when there's a central point in the universe that being location-based causes time perception to collapse. When that is gone, there’s just timelessness, and whatever appears in that vastness is everything. You describe this nicely."</p>
<p>Chris nodded. "Your description of individual awareness as our anchor to time is insightful. When awareness shatters, experiences of time can change. I think, for most people, when individual awareness becomes transparent or is blown out, not everyone necessarily flips into pure timelessness. There are different modalities of time we can access, and when we're less grounded in physical identity, time indeed becomes porous.</p>
<p>"We can gain insights about future events or acknowledge what’s happening outside our physical senses or even something occurring far away in time. Time becomes permeable." </p>
<p>Frank continued, "You mentioned experiencing futures that collapses many perceptions of time. You described a sense of loss when returning here from the ecstatic states, akin to missing a beloved."</p>
<p>"When one allows their egoic reality to dissolve, that encounter with deeper aspects of existence is incredibly exciting and empowering," Chris said. "In my deep exploration, I pressed so hard into this creative intelligence, but it was only after I stopped my sessions that I began to feel a true sense of loss, having experienced such intimacy. </p>
<p>I realized I lacked the capacity to stabilize those extreme states without a long-term commitment of spiritual practice. That’s when the depth of the sadness hit me deeply; it felt as if I was just waiting to die to return to that light. Over time, I came to understand that this was not a healthy mindset. I had allowed an imbalance to develop between transcendence and immanence. I had plunged so deeply into the transcendent that I lost my footing in the imminent divine, and I had to recommit myself to my physical existence while embracing it, incomplete as I am."</p>
<p>Frank asked about what that place of arrival would look like in daily life. </p>
<p>"Well, there are many levels,” Chris began. “I think the first point of entry into this spiritually transformed existence is transparency. When we let go of ego identification, we become transparent to the larger flow of life. From there, it deepens in layers. Some masters exist in such deep intersections of multiple realities that they quite literally leave their fingerprints in stone, surrounded by what we’d call miracles, though they wouldn’t term them that. </p>
<p>There are varying levels and gradients of mastery within traditions, which articulate this beautifully. My psychedelic journey began as a quest for spiritual awakening, but it evolved into a cosmic exploration of the universe's deep fabric, something beyond just personal spiritual awakening. </p>
<p>Right now, with the psychedelic renaissance, the initial goals are modest—getting psychedelics legalized and understanding their biological workings for healing. Healing the personal psyche is crucial, but it’s just the beginning of a far longer exploration." </p>
<p>"Yes, definitely," Frank replied. </p>
<p>"The idea of not hanging up the phone is significant," Chris continued. "When you go in and out of these non-ordinary states repeatedly, it's essential to confront the realization that all you've experienced is continuously ongoing; you're simply not tuned into it. The joy and clarity of oneness doesn't cease when you're not paying attention. </p>
<p>The innate oneness of the universe can spring into full bloom if we choose to pay attention. Otherwise, we drift into the hell of Samsara, where we feel like mere fragments in a meaningless universe. If you pay attention, though, you realize you're living in heaven."</p>
<p>Frank reflected, "The shimmering line between the present and the narratives of past and future often reinforces separation."</p>
<p>"Exactly," Chris said. "In these sessions, you don't study the universe through a microscope. Rather, you open to that part of your being where you are inherently part of the universe. It’s about dissolving boundaries in your awareness to truly experience what is happening right now."</p>
<p>Chris Bache: If I don't know what I am right now, it's not because the universe hasn't beaten it into my head repeatedly or mercilessly shown me the truth of my being and the truth of all our being. So I'd say, yeah, I know what I am. That doesn't mean I can always hold that in my awareness 24/7, but I've had ample experiences of what I am, and that my identity is essentially the identity of the totality. With that experience comes tremendous relief and release. All judgments, good or bad, are dissolved. There is just the infinite joy of one's true nature and true reality, and then the joy of living consciously in that reality, rather than living unconsciously. If we live consciously, our lives get better and better. If we live unconsciously, we become subject to the fluctuations of karmic conditioning and get caught in all sorts of scenarios. The trick is to stay mindful and aware that we are always, in subtle ways, creating our reality. We can always create a better reality if we are more transparent to our nature, which turns out to be the same nature bubbling up inside every living thing around us—every person, every object—it's all one nature, and in that, there is tremendous relaxation.</p>
<p>Frank McCaughey: I think that's a nice way to finish. I could keep talking to you, but I want to mention your book. Is it available online now? You can send me a link.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, I can send you a link. Amazon.com in the United States has it available. They'll be releasing it on November 26. I've been told that Amazon in England won’t release theirs until January 2. I would assume that Ireland is probably more linked to Amazon.com, so you can find it either on November 26 in America or January 2 in the UK.</p>
<p>Frank McCaughey: Okay, very good. Is it available on Kindle as well?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, it's available both in print and on Kindle, and there will be an audiobook that I just finished recording for Inner Traditions.</p>
<p>Frank McCaughey: It’s an epic journey—epic is the only way to put it. I like how you haven’t glamorized it; this isn’t a prescription but a description of what you’ve gone through and experienced. It's like when I was a kid—I used to go into dreams and try to take sweets out of them to bring home, but I’d wake up disappointed. In this book, however, I think you've managed to bring a few diamonds from heaven. So, well done, fair play. I’ll put up the links, and I’ll do a short version of this and then a longer one.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, Frank. I really appreciate your help in bringing the book forward. Excellent questions—I enjoyed our conversation a lot.</p>
<p>Frank McCaughey: Likewise. Thanks for the chat, and good luck with this. I hope it does well.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you very much. Bye-bye. </p>

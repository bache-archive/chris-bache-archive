      <p><strong>Abstract (≈130 words)</strong></p>
<p>Philosopher of religion <strong>Chris Bache</strong> joins <strong>Manda Scott</strong> on <em>Accidental Gods</em> to explore how decades of</p>
<p>high-dose LSD sessions revealed a looming evolutionary pivot for humanity. Bache frames today’s political</p>
<p>polarisation and ecological breakdown as a “collective dark night of the soul” that will culminate in the</p>
<p><em>birth of the future human</em>—a soul-centred species arising from near-extinction pressures. He maps five</p>
<p>progressive visionary terrains (personal, collective, archetypal, causal, diamond luminosity), explains the</p>
<p>“diamond soul” archetype in which many reincarnational threads fuse, and argues for psychedelics as a new</p>
<p>methodology for philosophy. The conversation stresses disciplined containers, long-term integration, and</p>
<p>embodiment, warning that psychedelics amplify whatever is present. Bache concludes that losing fear of</p>
<p>death liberates the courage required to navigate humanity’s unprecedented transition.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Chris, welcome to the <em>Accidental Gods</em> podcast. How are you, and where are you on this</p>
<p>slightly grey December day over here?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Hi, Manda. It’s a pleasure to be with you. I’m in Weaverville, North Carolina, just outside</p>
<p>Asheville. It’s sunny—going to be a lovely afternoon in the mid-40s °F.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Weather envy! But you’re in a swing state—must have been entertaining?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> <em>laughs</em> Let’s not go there. Too painful.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> You’ve written inspiring books. People assume you hold “the answers to everything.” You don’t</p>
<p>see it that way, right?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Correct. I’m still learning.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> From where you stand, what feels most alive at this civilisational inflection point?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Recent elections were disheartening for liberals like me. Worldwide conservatism worries me,</p>
<p>especially when it denies climate change. In <strong><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em></strong> I describe a</p>
<p><em>collective dark night</em> preceding the birth of the future human. Today’s chaos dismantles obsolete</p>
<p>assumptions so deeper spirit can emerge.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> 2025 feels pivotal. No ideology overrides biophysical reality. Inner—and collective-inner—</p>
<p>shifts seem essential. Could you give the elevator-pitch of your journey?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Sure. Hired as a professor in 1978, I was an agnostic. Grof’s book changed my life. Between</p>
<p>1979-1999 I conducted 79 high-dose LSD sessions underground—an aggressive protocol I don’t recommend. I</p>
<p>then spent two decades integrating and wrote <strong><em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em></strong> and <strong><em>LSD and the Mind</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> You couldn’t speak openly for fear of losing your job.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Exactly. I loved teaching but disclosure in the ’80s-’90s risked termination. I retired early</p>
<p>so the work could finally surface. Psychedelics aren’t merely therapeutic; they’re a revolutionary</p>
<p>research method for philosophy—<em>psychedelic philosophy</em>.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Many try to shortcut enlightenment with ayahuasca weekends. Your path shows the steps matter.</p>
<p>How did you structure the work?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Integration is everything. Each session required a week: meticulous prep, skilled sitter,</p>
<p>eyeshades, curated music, then detailed journaling and reflection. Over time I saw a layered progression</p>
<p>through five landscapes: personal unconscious, collective psyche, archetypal mind, causal oneness, and</p>
<p>diamond luminosity. Breakthroughs are endless—there’s always light beyond the light.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> You reached a point of <em>waiting to die</em> to return to unity.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Yes. My transcendence overpowered embodiment. Publishing and speaking healed that split.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Physically you endured brutal purges—burst eye vessels from vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Repeated death–rebirth cycles purify. Eventually you realise the self cannot die; only forms</p>
<p>dissolve, and death itself becomes grace.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Why choose LSD over mushrooms?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> In 1979 ayahuasca was rare. LSD, Grof’s main tool, offered a high cosmological ceiling;</p>
<p>psilocybin feels earthier.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> How did academia react?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Consciousness researchers welcomed it; mainstream journals ignored it. I chose to let history</p>
<p>decide.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Your students had psychic spill-over without knowing your practice.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Classrooms became living laboratories of shared mind—documented in <em>The Living Classroom</em>. The</p>
<p>2025 edition finally admits psychedelics drove those effects.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Summarise the “future human” vision.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> My work shifted from personal to species-level healing. In a 1995 session the <em>species mind</em></p>
<p>showed a near-extinction unraveling followed by a re-constellation—humanity reborn with a “diamond soul”</p>
<p>identity integrating many lifetimes.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Practical guidance for listeners in 2025?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Recognise your soul chose this incarnation; do what’s within reach; embody what Earth needs;</p>
<p>heal trauma in all directions.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Should everyone use psychedelics?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> No. They amplify what’s present. Some need gentler paths. For those called: pure substance,</p>
<p>rigorous setting, group support, long-term integration. The biggest hazard is psychic inflation.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Why did you stop after 20 years?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Energy overload and heart-ache returning from divine light. Restarting would require years of</p>
<p>momentum, so I devoted myself to integration instead.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Final thought?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Lose fear of death—it’s graduation. Fearless living is essential for the turbulent passage</p>
<p>ahead.</p>
<p><strong>MANDA:</strong> Chris, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Thank <em>you</em>, Manda. <em>The work continues.</em></p>

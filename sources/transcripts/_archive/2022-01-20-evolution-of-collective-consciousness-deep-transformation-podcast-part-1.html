      <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Roger Walsh and co-host John Dupuis welcome philosopher of religion and psychedelic pioneer <strong>Chris Bache</strong> for a</p>
<p>wide-ranging discussion on collective awakening. Walsh sketches the West’s transition from a “monophasic” culture</p>
<p>rooted in ordinary waking consciousness to a “polyphasic” civilization that values multiple altered states. Bache</p>
<p>recounts his 20-year program of 73 high-dose LSD sessions—an inquiry that shifted from personal transformation to</p>
<p>species-level healing and a vision of humanity’s imminent evolutionary leap. The trio explore the purifying power of</p>
<p>death-rebirth cycles, the pitfalls of ego inflation, and the promise of a future “diamond soul” humanity forged through</p>
<p>crisis. Throughout, Bache emphasizes trust in the process, humility before the “Mother,” and the necessity of grounding</p>
<p>mystical insight in compassionate action. The conversation closes with a call for courage and service as humanity</p>
<p>navigates its collective dark night toward a luminous future.</p>

<p><strong>ROGER WALSH</strong>: <em>[Music fades]</em> Welcome to Deep Transformation—self, society, spirit. I’m Roger Walsh.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN DUPUIS</strong>: And I’m John Dupuis. Today’s guest is the remarkable Chris Bache—philosopher, award-winning teacher,</p>
<p>and explorer of psychedelic consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>ROGER WALSH</strong>: Before diving in, I’d like to set context. Western culture has long been “monophasic,” privileging the</p>
<p>waking state. Over 90 percent of the world’s cultures are “polyphasic,” institutionalizing altered states for</p>
<p>knowledge. That is changing here through psychedelics and contemplative practices. Research now shows these substances</p>
<p>offer profound therapeutic and spiritual value. Chris has devoted decades to systematically exploring them.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN DUPUIS</strong>: Chris, your book <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> changed my life—it stabilized my sense of non-duality. This</p>
<p>new book, <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, feels even bigger. Either you’re completely sane or utterly insane—and my</p>
<p>experience says it’s deeply true.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Thank you, John. All my life I’ve wanted to understand reality. Seminary, theology at Notre Dame,</p>
<p>philosophy at Cambridge and Brown—yet I left an agnostic. Then I read Stan Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>. He</p>
<p>showed LSD could safely probe consciousness. I realized future contributions to philosophy of religion would be</p>
<p>experiential, not merely intellectual. So, in 1979, I began a 20-year journey: 73 sessions at 500–600 µg, eyeshades,</p>
<p>music, and a clinical-psychologist sitter—my then-wife, Carol. My intent was personal purification, but high doses blew</p>
<p>me beyond the individual into collective realms. I came to see the work aimed at healing humanity itself.</p>
<p><strong>ROGER WALSH</strong>: You faced hell realms—collective suffering—again and again. What kept you going?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Trust in the process. Surrender leads through death to ecstatic teaching. The universe meets you,</p>
<p>educates you, then breaks you down further. Initially I thought I was clearing personal karma. Later I realized I was</p>
<p>processing unhealed wounds of the species. High doses activate wider fields; you become a bit-player in a vaster drama.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN DUPUIS</strong>: Did you feel guided?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Absolutely. An intelligence titrated experiences so I could acclimate. Each ceiling demanded another</p>
<p>death—first ego, then a “shamanic persona,” then deeper structures. Eventually dying became purification.</p>
<p><strong>ROGER WALSH</strong>: You describe the “diamond luminosity” as beyond the bardo—contact with clear light.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Yes. I touched it four times. Each immersion compressed that light into my cells, opening “diamond</p>
<p>vision.” I saw as the future human will see—senses amplified, heart cracked open. The message: humanity is gestating a</p>
<p>collective birth. We will face a crushing ordeal, think ourselves extinct, yet emerge transformed.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN DUPUIS</strong>: That adds nobility—moving from personal quest to service.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Service is inevitable when you know all beings are yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ROGER WALSH</strong>: After stopping sessions, you entered a “deep sadness,” waiting to die.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: I had overdosed on transcendence. Integration required grounding—family, teaching, Vajrayāna</p>
<p>practice—so the light could incarnate. Too much of a good thing can unbalance you.</p>
<p><strong>ROGER WALSH</strong>: What map of reality emerges?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: A universe of unspeakable genius and love, endlessly birthing individuality for ever-deepening</p>
<p>communion. Death is liberation, not loss. Existence is self-healing, self-transcending.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN DUPUIS</strong>: Any closing words?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Lose the fear of death. Live courageously. The Mother is bringing us home.</p>

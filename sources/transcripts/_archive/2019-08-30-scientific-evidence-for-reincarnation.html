<p>This talk surveys empirical research on reincarnation and why it matters for how we live.</p>
<p>CHRIS BACHE frames the core philosophical questions—do we survive death, and do we live more</p>
<p>than once—arguing that “time as a teacher” changes the very purpose we ascribe to existence.</p>
<p>He then “goes large” across the literature: Ian Stevenson’s child cases and birthmark studies,</p>
<p>editorial recognitions in mainstream medical journals, and criticisms by philosopher Paul</p>
<p>Edwards with a counter-analysis by Robert Almeder. BACHE highlights contemporary continuations</p>
<p>(Tom Shroder, Jim Tucker) and contrasts spontaneous recall in children with evoked memories in</p>
<p>therapeutic settings (Roger Woolger, Winifred Lucas, Carol Bowman). He gives special attention</p>
<p>to Michael Newton’s work on life-between-lives decision-making and two accessible modern cases:</p>
<p>detective Robert Snow and the Leininger family’s “Soul Survivor.” He closes by clarifying what</p>
<p>we still don’t understand—the “physics” of rebirth—and a paradox: strong evidence liberates</p>
<p>our thinking while also narrowing it if we mistake atypical cases for the norm.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The good news—do I have a mic?—is that after me it’s lunch, so I’m the end of the unit.</p>
<p>I’m a professor and I’ve been at this game a long time, so I know a tired audience when I see one.</p>
<p>It’s been a long morning full of wonderful ideas. Let’s do something quick—everybody stand up and</p>
<p>stretch your arms. Bring in some good energy. Okay… now please sit.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The most important philosophical question one can ask is: Do we survive the death of the body?</p>
<p>A close second is: Do we live once or many times? Both hinge on time—time as a teacher. If I give a quiz,</p>
<p>I expect one kind of performance. If I give an hour exam, I expect more. A take-home paper? More still.</p>
<p>More time changes what can be learned and demonstrated.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> If this magnificent universe has a purpose, we must measure that purpose against the time we have</p>
<p>to fulfill it. If we live once, we infer one meaning. If we live a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand lives—if</p>
<p>our participation is open-ended—our relationship to the universe changes, and so does the framework for purpose.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Many religions of the last four millennia have undervalued physical existence: achieve realization,</p>
<p>enlightenment, salvation—and then leave. Nirvana, escape samsara, attain moksha, exit. That leaves the question</p>
<p>of the universe’s purpose unanswered. But if we return—if we come back many times—a different story unfolds.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Our understanding of reincarnation is still incomplete. As our sense of the cosmos expands, so does our</p>
<p>sense of how long and how deeply we “dance” with it. Then we can ask what the universe may be accomplishing in us,</p>
<p>and what gift our compounded learning offers back to the universe.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Today I want to review evidence for reincarnation. I’ve been at this a long time. My first academic book,</p>
<p><em>Life Cycles</em>, signals how important I think this topic is. What matters is that there is critical empirical</p>
<p>evidence. Fifty years ago this wasn’t true. Theologians debated endlessly. Today the evidence has moved the</p>
<p>discussion to psychologists, philosophers, and psychiatrists.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> When weighing evidence, you can go small or go large. The beauty—the joy—is in detailed cases, but in forty-five</p>
<p>minutes I’ll go large. My goal is simple: inspire you to read one book on reincarnation you haven’t read.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Ian Stevenson’s <em>Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation</em> changed my life. Finishing graduate school in 1978,</p>
<p>I was an atheistically inclined agnostic. Stevenson convinced me there is evidence we live more than once. He was</p>
<p>the Carlson Professor at the University of Virginia and wrote extensively: multi-volume case series, studies of</p>
<p>xenoglossy, <em>Children Who Remember Previous Lives</em>, and his monumental two-volume work on birthmarks and birth defects</p>
<p>corresponding to the death wounds of previous personalities.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> What are we looking at? Children around the world with detailed recall of a most recent life. They can navigate</p>
<p>towns they’ve never visited. When brought to the previous personality’s home, they recognize people, recall shared</p>
<p>histories, and display appropriate emotions—husbands to wives, parents to children. There are cases where a five-year-old</p>
<p>boy carries the affect of a 35-year-old husband.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> One boy, reunited with the previous family, was shy around the former wife. After she left the room, he identified</p>
<p>her and later said, “I’ve come, but you haven’t fixed the bindi,” and he criticized her white sari—widow’s attire—implying</p>
<p>she should dress as a married woman again. In another case a child was asked, “If you’re my husband, where did you put the</p>
<p>will?” He walked to the kitchen, lifted a floorboard, and produced it. Cases like these drive my philosophical colleagues</p>
<p>up a wall. They don’t know what to do with them.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Patterns emerge. Average time between death of the first personality and the birth of the second is about two and a</p>
<p>half years. Average distance between life places is around fifty miles. Children tend to lose these memories by about eight</p>
<p>years old, with most of the rest fading at puberty.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Why do these children remember what most of us forget? We don’t know. Stevenson hypothesized that roughly sixty percent</p>
<p>who died violently, and many who died suddenly or with acute unfinished business, may be drawn back faster and closer, with</p>
<p>memories encoded more strongly.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Mainstream journals took note. <em>JAMA</em> wrote that Stevenson had painstakingly collected cases in which the evidence for</p>
<p>reincarnation is difficult to explain otherwise. The <em>Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease</em> devoted an issue to his work and,</p>
<p>in an editorial, affirmed the legitimacy of his methods and reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Of course there are critics. Philosopher Paul Edwards—editor-in-chief of the <em>Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>—launched the</p>
<p>harshest critique, accusing Stevenson of poor rigor and implying fraud. But deeper in his logic he says reincarnation would be</p>
<p>a “crucifixion” of our secular understanding. He claims you must accept “collateral assumptions”: materialism is false, mind is</p>
<p>not reducible to brain, identity exceeds personality, there’s a domain beyond spacetime, death is not final, and life may have</p>
<p>a deeper logic. He deems these “fantastic,” and concludes a rational person must reject Stevenson’s facts or explain them away.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Robert Almeder analyzed this debate and shows Edwards doesn’t refute Stevenson; he refuses to consider the evidence on its</p>
<p>own terms, begging the question. If you can’t refute a commanding argument, refusing it is irrational.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Tom Shroder, a Pulitzer-winning reporter and <em>Washington Post</em> editor, traveled with Stevenson. His <em>Old Souls</em> applies a</p>
<p>reporter’s eye and finds the methods solid and the cases compelling. At UVA, Jim Tucker carries the work forward with accessible</p>
<p>overviews and careful rebuttals of weaker hypotheses.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> So far, those are spontaneous memories. There’s also evoked memory—recall arising through methods like hypnotherapy, sometimes</p>
<p>even bodywork. Representative works include Roger Woolger’s <em>Other Lives, Other Selves</em>—intellectually robust, case-rich—and</p>
<p>Winifred Lucas’s two-volume <em>Regression Therapy: A Handbook for Professionals</em>, an early attempt to set standards in a rapidly</p>
<p>growing field.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Carol Bowman entered the field as a parent when her child’s nightmares pointed to unresolved trauma from a previous life.</p>
<p>Her books guide families through such cases, including within-family reincarnation—messier for research but common in lived</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I have a special partiality for Michael Newton’s work, <em>Journey of Souls</em> and <em>Destiny of Souls</em>. As a therapist he discovered</p>
<p>that, in deep hypnosis, clients not only recall past lives but also describe the after-death state with striking consistency across</p>
<p>worldviews—from fundamentalist to Marxist to reductionist. They describe an ordered, pedagogical spirit world where older learners</p>
<p>teach younger, and where reincarnation is a deliberate choice made with guides and in coordination with future life partners.</p>
<p>Before we were born—when we knew more than we now remember—we chose the lives we are living.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Two accessible modern cases: Robert Snow, commander of homicide in Indianapolis, had an unexpected regression, then used</p>
<p>detective skills to verify <em>Looking for Carroll Beckwith</em>. And the Leininger family’s <em>Soul Survivor</em>: a young boy’s spontaneous</p>
<p>recall of a WWII pilot’s death led to verifications and, ultimately, the father’s reversal from adamant disbelief to acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Let me close with two points. First, what we don’t know is substantial. Even if the evidence is compelling, we don’t yet</p>
<p>understand the “physics” of rebirth. What is the soul? How does it interface with biology and genetics? How is learning encoded</p>
<p>and later carried forward? Progress here requires moving beyond reducing mind to brain and adopting a multi-dimensional cosmology.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Second, a paradox. Stevenson’s evidence liberates our thinking at one level, but can constrict it at another. His strongest</p>
<p>cases are atypical—fast returns, close to home. Most souls, so to speak, spend far more “time” in the timeless, with broader</p>
<p>experience. To fill in the larger canvas of dying, rebirth, and the cycles of contraction and expansion, we need multiple bodies</p>
<p>of data—Newton’s work, and this afternoon I’ll add perspectives from psychedelic research.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> Chris, thank you so much. This is the kind of knowledge that changes how we live and how we meet each moment.</p>
<p>It’s at the core of our institute’s mission—real existential questions with a scientific basis. We need to bring</p>
<p>this to society to help shift consciousness. I’m very much looking forward to your next talk.</p>

      <p>In the third installment of their dialogue, Chris Bache and Richard Rudd move beyond evidence for</p>
<p>reincarnation into its evolutionary implications. They explore how personal revelation and collective</p>
<p>experience converge in a planetary “birth canal,” where intensified crises catalyze a species-level</p>
<p>transformation. Bache frames this transition through field dynamics and death–rebirth cycles in</p>
<p>non-ordinary states, suggesting a coming shift from egoic identity to soul awareness, with humanity</p>
<p>approaching a fusion point that alters the archetypal architecture of the collective unconscious. Rudd</p>
<p>speaks to cellular knowing, endurance through shadow work, and an emergent epoch where fear dissolves</p>
<p>as the veil of death thins. Both envision the “future human”: heart-healed, mind-open, sensorially</p>
<p>refined, living from bliss and stewardship of Gaia. They urge full presence, compassionate action, and</p>
<p>trust in an intelligence driving us through metamorphosis toward a new civilizational platform.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Well, here we are again for our third discussion. We tentatively called this one “limitless</p>
<p>time” because we want to bridge into the deeper questions around reincarnation. Where is this constant</p>
<p>learning and recycling taking humanity? Where is it going? What might the deep future look like? And,</p>
<p>most importantly, how might that understanding shift how we engage our life right now? Where should we</p>
<p>begin? I think we should acknowledge that each of us brings a deep experiential basis. We’re not simply</p>
<p>speculating. We carry convictions born of unusual experiences. Why don’t you speak first?</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> It’s true—that’s what brought us together for these dialogues. I was just explaining the</p>
<p>difference between knowledge and wisdom. Wisdom comes by revelation, by listening, by receiving; knowledge</p>
<p>is chased and hunted. Revelation gives cellular knowing. My path has been guided by a cellular sense of</p>
<p>what’s coming for humanity. It’s not always easy to hold, because not everyone feels it. Yet it leaves me</p>
<p>more relaxed at a fundamental level; I simply know everything is going to be fine. I can’t explain why I</p>
<p>was given that knowing, though many listening will recognize it from their own breakthroughs and visions.</p>
<p>We should acknowledge this other dimension we carry. You, through your work—tell us a little about that.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I completely share what you’re saying. At the beginning of our series, I spoke in a professorial</p>
<p>mode about evidence for reincarnation. Our second conversation blended that with the wisdom arising from my</p>
<p>psychedelic work. Today I stand in that visionary side. I’m a psychedelic visionary. My understanding comes</p>
<p>from carefully distilled, conscientiously engaged non-ordinary states, returning again and again, purifying,</p>
<p>and allowing the universe to take me deeper—into itself and its intention—into time, into deep time. These</p>
<p>experiences were never intended just for me; they’re planted to be held and passed on. So I carry a feeling</p>
<p>for where history is going, and that gives me calm even as we enter difficult times.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> I think both of us share the knowing that a birth is underway. We’re already in the canal and</p>
<p>the contractions have begun. Individual awakening often arrives through contractions—shudders, intensifications</p>
<p>of shadow, openings and closings—until an epiphany fires the DNA and changes you forever. I think that is</p>
<p>happening collectively. Your book, <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, beautifully describes coming down the</p>
<p>birth canal. We can’t fill in the details—time will—yet we can empathize with the suffering that is here and</p>
<p>likely to ramp up, while offering more than hope: a sense of purpose to present events.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> You described how revelation in-breaks: deep insights can’t fit in small containers, so we are</p>
<p>purified—everything that keeps us small is burned up to allow the shattering, the death-rebirth cycle. We die to</p>
<p>what holds us and are reborn into a larger world. There are no shortcuts; the road is exacting. Yet its fruit is</p>
<p>both personal and collective. My work began as personal healing, but that was shattered early. I was drawn into</p>
<p>collective vistas—collective purifications and insights into our developmental process. Reincarnation is not only</p>
<p>an individual soul-journey; it is a species-journey. Generation after generation we evolve, and now the process is</p>
<p>coming to a crescendo—a profound breakthrough—a birth. We’re moving from egoic identity to soul awareness, where</p>
<p>former lives integrate into a fusion point—traumas healed, virtues gathered—culminating in an explosion of light,</p>
<p>a higher order of individuality, with a different communion with the intelligence of the universe. This will change</p>
<p>the archetypal architecture of the collective unconscious as profoundly as the brain expansion 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Many watching this have likely said yes to transmuting more shadow than one lifetime holds. I</p>
<p>remember dark days when the weight in my body felt insurmountable—endless heaviness. Over the years it lightened,</p>
<p>and I saw the tunnel’s end. If you feel that weight, it’s because you have the capacity and the love to burn</p>
<p>through it. Don’t lose hope. Also, when birth comes there is a break in continuity. History looks continuous, but</p>
<p>you can’t see beyond the break. Something completely new emerges, assembled out of all that came before but unlike</p>
<p>what preceded it. We are the technology—our DNA carries undreamed-of capacities. What’s coming bears little</p>
<p>resemblance to what has been.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I agree. Many serious practitioners are processing past-life karma and collective karma. Hidden</p>
<p>saints are working on behalf of humanity. We must move through this quickly—no one wants the fetus stuck in the</p>
<p>birth canal. Many souls chose to incarnate now to do the work of birthing a new humanity. In sessions, the pattern</p>
<p>is the same: deep descent into pain that seems endless, then a breaking point and surrender, followed by waking in</p>
<p>a new reality—not an extension of the old but a different genre of experience and capacity. My visions since 1991</p>
<p>show a turning point where the pace of the past can’t measure the future. After the transition we operate with a</p>
<p>different psycho-spiritual structure and generate a different civilization because we are different beings. The</p>
<p>egoic level, brilliant but fragmented, created our fractured relationship with nature. A soul-centered species with</p>
<p>a healed heart and open mind lives differently: it cares for the world it will return to and for relationships it</p>
<p>will meet again. Life gives us no option but transition—there’s no going back. The damage returns to us, demanding</p>
<p>something radically new. Some work outside; we work inside. All are needed.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Shakespeare’s comedies show everything snarled by Act IV before a strange attractor resolves the</p>
<p>plot at the end. We’ve had a long build-up to this mess, and then a catalytic energy arrives, resolving things in</p>
<p>unexpected ways. Boiling water is the simplest metaphor: nothing seems to happen, then the first bubbles, then an</p>
<p>eruption at a tipping point. Systems thinkers and mystics anticipate rapid change that can be destabilizing. We</p>
<p>don’t say this to alarm but to prepare. As inner birth unfolds, outer structures must decline to make way for the</p>
<p>new. That doesn’t mean we stop repairing what we can. Compassion involves passion—standing for what’s right while</p>
<p>serving as structures collapse. Safety means alignment with the soul’s destiny.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In my sessions, field dynamics were central. When energy pours into a system it moves far from</p>
<p>equilibrium. At bifurcation, it flips into a higher order. Humanity is a unified field of consciousness; each of us</p>
<p>is a fractal node. A global ecological crisis energizes the collective psyche like a pot coming to boil. Beneath our</p>
<p>individual 100-year cycles, the soul learns across lifetimes. Collectively, the species learns beneath generations</p>
<p>through archetypal structures. That deeper layer is reaching high energy. The sheer intensity of suffering and</p>
<p>anxiety pushes us to a breaking point, flooding us with a different common sense—new priorities, values, and</p>
<p>experience of each other. To go as far and as fast as needed we must grasp field dynamics in non-equilibrium. Crisis</p>
<p>builds until all seems lost; then it passes and we rise changed, with a fundamentally new organization of</p>
<p>consciousness. Things once hard become easy; possibilities multiply. I call this the birth of the future human—a</p>
<p>demarcation of a different kind of human being, seeded by reincarnation reaching fruition. The great beings of</p>
<p>history are prototypes—Christs, Buddhas, prophets—hinting at our collective becoming. The ecological crisis will</p>
<p>deepen for generations, but we will come through. In non-equilibrium, individual influence scales exponentially—the</p>
<p>butterfly effect. Whole individuals catalyze wholeness in others.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> If one thing could change everything overnight, it would be seeing through the veil of death. When</p>
<p>that happens, fear is no more. As the collective “boils,” more people will retain memory across life, death, and</p>
<p>birth. That awakening is contagious—wisdom and love crackle in the air around such beings. As fear leaves person by</p>
<p>person, children can be born without the wound—born awake—through clear conduits of awakened parents. Awakened</p>
<p>consciousness will “colonize” the gene pool like a virus of love, non-denominational and everywhere. I’ve always</p>
<p>loved Jesus’ line: “I will return like a thief in the night.” The new human arrives quietly, unstoppably. One of my</p>
<p>favorite images from your book is the future human standing among seated Buddhas—no longer practicing to awaken,</p>
<p>but living awakened. The age of suffering gives way to learning through bliss—the white hole beyond the black hole.</p>
<p>Bliss has layers as deep as suffering. Keep that in heart and mind through difficult decades; we’ll be back to</p>
<p>enjoy the fruit. Don’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Let’s look far into the future human. Our transformation is a new platform, not an endpoint. We’re</p>
<p>growing beyond learning through suffering and beyond fear of death. If I could give people one thing from my</p>
<p>sessions, it would be to lose that fear—death is graduation and respite. The divine project has brought us to this</p>
<p>crisis and will take us through. Nature has decided we’re ready. We’re here for a very long arc—millions of years.</p>
<p>At the end of my work I was given “diamond vision”—ten minutes of seeing a thousand times more clearly, with perfect</p>
<p>discrimination. It wasn’t a hallucination; it was seeing as the future human will see. Transformation will refine</p>
<p>heart, mind, and senses; touch, taste, vision, and hearing will grow exquisite. Consciousness will heal and uplift</p>
<p>the body into ecstatic creativity. We’re just beginning to activate higher potentials. The stakes are immense: we’re</p>
<p>not merely fixing humanity; we’re birthing a new order that becomes the platform for higher orders still. If our</p>
<p>nature is truly infinite, reincarnation gives infinite time to unfold it. Carefully qualified, we are learning to</p>
<p>create as gods—on scales we’ve only imagined in myth.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> I’ve seen that too through another mythology: successive races or epochs evolving on Earth. We may</p>
<p>have forgotten earlier epochs because the breaks were so vast. Each portal includes and transcends what came before</p>
<p>and remembers more. This next phase culminates in our collective harmony with Gaia—taking our highest seat as her</p>
<p>consciousness and stewards, inseparable from the tiniest ant. We have not yet seen Gaia fully flowering. Each of us</p>
<p>has a unique weaving role—following our creativity to stitch specific pathways of Gaia’s tapestry. As we approach</p>
<p>perfection, time spirals tighter; at the final crystallization, time dissolves. My joke is: when you finally get to</p>
<p>heaven, everything stops—and yet it’s infinite time. Humanity then transcends humanity and moves spheres. Gaia rises</p>
<p>too; everything ratchets up because consciousness is embedded in all. Far ahead, the tapestries are vast and fractal</p>
<p>from galaxy to grain of sand. Through crisis, never leave the present or forget where we’re going. Grace is embedded</p>
<p>even in the bitter pill.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I love hearing you go. This solar system is part of a galaxy, of a super-cluster, of a universe</p>
<p>nested in meta-universes. Humanity’s transformation unfolds amid many species’ transformations around the galaxy.</p>
<p>We can affirm that while paying close attention to how we take full advantage of this growth opportunity. We choose</p>
<p>our incarnations. Everyone listening chose to be here now, planted exactly where they can have the greatest positive</p>
<p>impact. Look under your feet—your talents and relationships are already in place. Be fully here. Distractions will</p>
<p>multiply, but complete commitment to present circumstances is the fastest way through the hard part and into joy and</p>
<p>collaboration. We meet heaven only in the present. We may have wandered far from evidence for reincarnation, but</p>
<p>communion with the universe drives us both. Let go of what gets in the way and share the divine breath and joy as</p>
<p>deeply as possible in the years remaining—and in the next life, and the next.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Beautiful, Chris. I don’t think anything more needs to be said.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Maybe not here and now, but in another time and place we’ll wind it up again. I love our</p>
<p>discussions—what happens when we get together.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Me too. May our communities come together to explore and create proactive routes forward. Great</p>
<p>genius is being drawn to these conversations. When hearts join in service, much is possible.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Likewise. Much love and blessings in your work. It’s a joy to spend time with you; I receive much</p>
<p>from our conversations.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Likewise. Absolutely.</p>

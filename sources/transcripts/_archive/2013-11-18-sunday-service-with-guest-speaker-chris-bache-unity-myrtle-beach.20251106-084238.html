<h2>---</h2>
<p>You as I am. I can see that I forgot to be me. Life is meant for living free.</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: Welcome, everyone! It's wonderful to see so many familiar faces and some new ones. I’m thrilled to announce that Jennifer is moving back to the area—welcome back! Today, we're going to begin our service with a song. So, let's all stand and sing together, "Rise Up." </p>
<p>Before we do that, I have a quick reminder: please turn off your cell phones to help maintain a peaceful atmosphere. Let’s take a deep breath together and, if comfortable for you, close your eyes. </p>
<p>This space has been dedicated for a long time to opening hearts and awakening minds. Here, we access our joy, peace, wisdom, creativity, and commitment to continue growing. We give thanks for this place and for all who came before us, for those who envisioned this movement called Unity. </p>
<p>As we gather today, let’s unite in the Lord’s Prayer, translated from the Aramaic language of Jesus. Together, we say: </p>
<p>“Father, Mother, Birther of all, create a space within us and fill it with your presence. Let oneness now prevail. Your one desire flows through ours as energy fills all forms. Give us this day our physical and spiritual nourishment and untangle the knots of error behind us. As we release others, do not let appearances make us forgetful of the source, but free us to act appropriately. From age to age, through you flow the glorious harmonies of life. May these words be verbal statements through which our future grows.”</p>
<p>I hope you can feel the incredible presence of spirit that surrounds us each Sunday when we say these words consciously. </p>
<p>For those who don’t know me yet, I’m Margaret Hiller, the spiritual leader here at Unity. Our team today includes ushers Carl O’Brien and Terry De Mario, our readers from video, and our music team featuring Ryan on saxophone and Bill on the piano, among many others who contribute to our vibrant community experience.</p>
<p>Now, I’d like to introduce Lilly Russ, our musician. She’s originally from Georgetown, South Carolina, and just like many of us, she’s experienced the West Coast way of living. She’s returning home and performs at various events, including at the Agape International Spiritual Center.</p>
<p>Lilly, we invite you to help us with our next song, which will also accompany our collection for the duo Kansas—a special offering to support those in our community who need a bit of extra help. </p>
<p>Now, let’s stand and sing a song we used to sing in the Pentecostal church, “Peace Like a River.” </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: This morning, I’d like to invite all the children, tall and small, to join me up front. And Chris, could you hold my mic? Hello, everybody! I want to know your names. I see Elijah and Caleb and Tristan. Is that right? Wonderful to meet you! Joining us today are our teachers, Miss Pam and Miss Rachel.</p>
<p>There’s a special holiday coming up—does anyone know what it is? Yes, Thanksgiving! What do we think about on Thanksgiving? It’s all about love, right? Even if we didn’t have a guest speaker today, Thanksgiving reminds us to be grateful. What are we thankful for? </p>
<p>Is it about family? Or school? We have so much to be grateful for, including living near the beach! I personally give thanks for my fig trees and the birds that visit. </p>
<p>I also want to express my gratitude to all of you for being here today, reminding us that each of us has a part in weaving the story of our human family. Together, we learn how to spread love and kindness in the world and create a life that works for everyone.</p>
<p>Let’s give thanks for all of you with a blessing that you can see on the screen. Please turn towards everyone here and put your hands out. Remember, love and blessings flow through our hands, words, and presence. Together, we say: </p>
<p>“We love you, we bless you, we appreciate you, we behold Christ in you, and we love you just the way you are.”</p>
<p>Thank you all! Now, I have a few announcements to share. Our meditation class continues through December 10, and our contemplative service on Wednesday nights is at 5: 30. </p>
<p>Tonight, my sister Pam and I will be participating in a Day of Remembrance for victims of hate crimes, happening at Dance Plaza at 7 pm. </p>
<p>Additionally, it’s time to decorate our sanctuary for the holidays! Sue is coordinating this beautiful project, and we will have a Christmas tree for our Hope House giving tree and another tree for Regency Hospice. Please see Sue if you’d like to help with the decorations after service today.</p>
<p>Also, our Wednesday Book Group will be starting a new book, “Daring Greatly” by Brené Brown, in a couple of weeks, so keep an eye out for that!</p>
<p>As we prepare for our Unity statement of purpose, remember: we are human beings, not human doings. In our busy culture, we often equate busyness with importance. </p>
<p>Let’s take a moment to remember the significance of simply being, as we incorporate practices like meditation and connecting with nature into our routines to rejuvenate our spirits.</p>
<p>Now, to wrap up our opening, let's read together our unity statement of purpose: "I am the consciousness of Unity, a unified board and congregation nurturing spiritual growth, inspiring creativity, sharing time, talents, treasures, and expanding awareness of the Divine."</p>
<p>And now, Lilly, we invite you back to share another song with us.</p>
<p>Lilly Russ: Good morning, everyone! I want to briefly share the inspiration behind my next song. I had a dream where Beyoncé was singing this song to a distraught man who had moved into a water tower after experiencing a tragic event in his life. She reached out to him, inviting him into her home, singing comforting words to him. </p>
<p>As I sing, I encourage you to look into someone’s eyes and share the love with them. </p>
<p>This is a song about comfort in our hardest times, recognizing our pain, and connecting with one another.</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: Thank you, Lilly, that was beautiful! </p>
<p>Now, I'd like to extend a special welcome to first-time visitors. If it’s your first time with us today, please stand and share your name. </p>
<p>Pat Chene from Washington, D.C., welcome! And we have visitors from Georgetown, California, and others from all around. </p>
<p>We are so glad you’re here with us. Now, let's read the Daily Word. This morning's affirmation is “God is my comfort and my refuge.” Let’s say that together: “God is my comfort and my refuge.” </p>
<p>As the Daily Word shares, life is full of joy and sorrow, but no condition is beyond the comfort of spirit. Whatever you experience, trust that the comfort you seek is already available to you.</p>
<p>Now, before we welcome our guest speaker, I want to express gratitude for Chris Bache, our speaker today, who has been a part of our community. Chris, with over 30 years as a professor and experience with the Institute of Noetic Sciences, brings rich insights into our understanding of life and death. </p>
<p>He'll be speaking on “No Fear of Death.” After his talk, there will be a brief Q&amp;A session for anyone interested. </p>
<p>Let’s take a moment to settle into the space as we enter a time of meditation, preparing our hearts and minds for Chris's message. </p>
<p>Chris Bache: Good morning, everyone! I’m pleased to be here with you today. The last time I was here was on Labor Day weekend. Today, I'd like to talk about the topic of death—not just the fear that often surrounds it, but the reality and understanding of life beyond death.</p>
<p>Now, let’s begin with a meditation. Close your eyes and feel the ground beneath you—solid and supportive. Picture us all in a large circle, with each person placing their hand on the shoulder of the next as we share in this energy together.</p>
<p>Now, bring to mind someone you’ve lost and imagine them standing behind you, placing their hand on your shoulder. As we expand this circle throughout history, we connect to a larger community of life, both past and future. This cycle of birth and life naturally includes death, and it is part of our experience together.</p>
<p>As we gather today, let’s embrace the simplicity of life’s cycle and the shared experiences that connect us. </p>
<p>Now, I want to share some insights into the transformative research happening around death and to dispel some of the fears that come with it.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The first two books I want to discuss were written by David Ring, a professor at the University of Connecticut. He was a founder of the near-death experience movement and established the Journal of Thanatology. His first book documented the phenomena of near-death experiences, while his second, <em>Heading Toward Omega</em>, delves into what we are meant to learn from these experiences. </p>
<p>David focused on individuals who had profound near-death experiences—those who didn’t just leave their bodies, go through a tunnel, or see a light, but who actually entered the light. He calls these accounts "core envy ears" and collects personal stories that are incredibly moving. In Chapter Three of <em>Heading Toward Omega</em>, he presents the experiences of thirteen individuals with very deep near-death experiences. Their narratives touch the heart and soul as these people describe having encountered the divine. Their lives change dramatically afterward; they undergo transformations in their mind, emotions, values, religions, priorities, and even their physiology. </p>
<p>His latest book, <em>Lessons from the Light</em>, sums up his extensive research career, examining cases of blind individuals who, during their near-death experiences, were able to see. He includes a chapter called "Returning to the Source," which highlights some of the deepest near-death experiences—extraordinary spiritual journeys.</p>
<p>Now, some may wonder if these experiences are simply an endorphin rush or a fantasy. To address this skepticism, I recommend the work of Pim van Lommel, a Norwegian psychiatrist. His comprehensive analysis of near-death experiences stands out, as he argues that every attempt to explain these experiences away fails to appreciate their reality. His findings endure scrutiny and provide solid evidence, which I often share with my academic colleagues who dismiss these phenomena.</p>
<p>Another remarkable account comes from Dr. Eben Alexander, a neurosurgeon who detailed his personal near-death experience in his book <em>Proof of Heaven</em>. His bravery in publishing this work is noteworthy, considering how he openly challenges the materialist views in his field.</p>
<p>I must also mention the concept of life-between-lives therapy, which Michael Newton pioneered. His books, <em>Journey of Souls</em> and <em>Destiny of Souls</em>, are essential reads for anyone interested in what happens after death. Newton discovered that he could guide his patients not only through their past lives but also through the time in between those incarnations. He notes that people go home to a spiritual community where they continue to evolve together, even if their individual journeys unfold at different paces. </p>
<p>Newton’s work helps people understand the choices they make prior to incarnating and how these choices connect to the soul's greater purpose. The soul’s agenda is far more comprehensive than our personal desires, often leading us to choose lives filled with challenges that foster growth.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to touch on modern psychedelic research and its connection to spiritual transformation. Many indigenous cultures refer to these substances as "sacred medicines" rather than hallucinogens, emphasizing their role in helping people remember their true nature and the game of life. Stanislav Grof, a key figure in the transpersonal psychology movement, has contributed significantly to psychedelic therapy, particularly for the terminally ill. His works offer insights into death from both a historical and cross-cultural perspective.</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: What I hear you saying is that there's so much more to our experience than just living and dying. There’s a whole spectrum of life experiences, both in and out of the body, and we’re surrounded by a heavenly community. I appreciate your research and your mentorship from such influential thinkers. Thank you for sharing these ideas with us.</p>
<p>Let’s take a moment for our sacred opportunity to give tithes and donations, ensuring the ongoing health and well-being of our community. Who here feels part of this incredible spiritual community? We blend many paths here, often coming together at Unity. </p>
<p>I have my tithe check today, a privilege I hold dear. Let’s bless our gifts with a hand mudra. I am light flowing through me, and may these gifts radiate peace. </p>
<p>As we transition, I want to remind everyone of Lily's CDs available for purchase after the service and our ongoing workshops, including tomorrow’s “Closer Walk with God.” If you're interested in helping with decorating for Christmas, please connect with Sue.</p>
<p>Now, let’s gather in a circle and reflect on a prayer for protection: The light of God surrounds us, the love of God unfolds us, the power of God protects us, the presence of God watches over us. Wherever we are, God is, and all is well. </p>
<p>As we move forward, let’s sing our peace song, like a prayer.</p>

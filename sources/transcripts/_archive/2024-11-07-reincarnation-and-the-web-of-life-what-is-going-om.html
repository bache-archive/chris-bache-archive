<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In this conversation, Sandie Sedgbeer and Chris Bache explore reincarnation through research, therapy, and</p>
<p>first-person inquiry. Bache outlines how past-life therapy and Ian Stevenson’s work with children’s verified</p>
<p>memories grounded his book <em>Life Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life</em>. He distinguishes the soul of a</p>
<p>single lifetime from the capital-S Soul or “oversoul” that holds all incarnations, reframing identity beyond the</p>
<p>current personality. Topics include why recall often centers on the most recent life, how traits and traumas can</p>
<p>bridge lives, and the purpose of repeated incarnations as evolutionary learning that ultimately serves creation</p>
<p>itself. They discuss the bardo, mediums and “front images,” heaven and hell as educative feedback rather than</p>
<p>eternal fates, collective trauma, Christianity’s ambivalence toward reincarnation, interlife planning described by</p>
<p>Michael Newton, and reports of non-Earth lives. Bache closes by affirming reincarnation as a richer frame that</p>
<p>deepens responsibility, compassion, and meaning.</p>
<p><em>[Music]</em></p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Welcome to <em>What Is Going OM</em>, where we explore new thought from the edge of mind and</p>
<p>consciousness. I’m Sandie Sedgbeer.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Today we’re talking about life after death, heaven and hell, and reincarnation. My guest is</p>
<p>CHRIS BACHE, professor emeritus of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct</p>
<p>faculty at CIIS, emeritus fellow at IONS, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. He is the author of</p>
<p>four books, including a personal favorite, <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe (Diamonds from Heaven)</em>, and *Life</p>
<p>Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life*, which synthesizes testimonies, consciousness research, and</p>
<p>near-death studies.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Chris, welcome back to the show.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Hi, Sandie. It’s a pleasure to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> <em>Life Cycles</em> has been called the first book to both describe rebirth dynamics and explore</p>
<p>the ramifications of a reincarnational worldview. It was published about thirty-five years ago. Where were you in</p>
<p>your LSD work then, and how did that journey inform the book?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I began psychedelic work after my first year as an academic. I worked four years, then stopped</p>
<p>for six. During that interval I did three years of past-life therapy, uncovering former lives, and I wrote *Life</p>
<p>Cycles*. By then my sessions had given me personal insight into karma, but not past-life recall in a psychedelic</p>
<p>context—those came via hypnotherapy. The real foundation was studying Ian Stevenson and other pioneers who</p>
<p>documented validated memories in children and adults.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> You share powerful cases. One that struck me, from Helen Wambach, involved a five-year-old</p>
<p>girl diagnosed with childhood autism who showed reading and math skills she’d never been taught. She wouldn’t</p>
<p>communicate but “force-fed” her therapist with a baby bottle to convey how she felt. When understood, she came</p>
<p>into herself—but lost the reading and math. How do you read that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Our lives are longer and more continuous than we assume. We don’t start as a blank slate. We</p>
<p>begin each life with history—knowledge, attitudes, traumas, virtues—blending into the new start. I’m simplifying,</p>
<p>but there’s real carryover we can see when we look at children with fresh eyes.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Why do accounts so often focus on the last life?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Stevenson’s sample is unusual: children with spontaneous recall of the immediately prior life.</p>
<p>They tend to reincarnate quickly—on average two and a half years—and nearby. Population studies of adults show</p>
<p>longer intervals and wider geography. In therapy, pain may originate in the most recent life—or several lives back.</p>
<p>I think of former lives as a deck of cards. We may have fifty-two lives, but only a handful are “active” in this one,</p>
<p>drawn from different centuries to form the present composite.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> In the book you distinguish “soul” and “oversoul.”</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> For Western readers used to “soul” meaning the essence of this lifetime, we need a larger term</p>
<p>to include all lives. I borrow “oversoul.” In practice I collapse the distinction and use capital-S Soul for the whole,</p>
<p>and small-s soul for the consciousness integrating one incarnation. Many call the oversoul the higher self.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> I found an article by Alex Lickerman arguing that the real question isn’t evidence but</p>
<p>identity. Does reincarnation change what “I” am?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. Identity expands. I accept this body-mind as my current identity, and in mystical openings I</p>
<p>accept a universal identity. The Soul is intermediate—still individuated because histories differ, yet its essence is</p>
<p>the same divine ground. The Soul is the metaconsciousness holding, say, a hundred thousand years of experience.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> It’s hard to imagine that an infinite oversoul is “me.”</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s hard at first. It gets easier with practice—especially experiential access. When you open to</p>
<p>awareness predating this body and meet other lives with the uncanny quality of being you while other than you,</p>
<p>and you work with several such lives, your mind and heart dilate. Eventually it’s hard to think smaller again.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Why do we reincarnate?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> To learn, to grow, to become more. It reframes the purpose of existence. If we live one life,</p>
<p>meaning must fit within decades. If we live many, development is open-ended. Imagine God saying, “Help me grow</p>
<p>this universe.” Incarnation becomes direct participation in creation, moving toward heaven on earth—embodied,</p>
<p>luminous awareness. Enlightenment is a stage within a much longer arc.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> But if we’re sparks of God and know everything when we die, why return and “forget”?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> We don’t forget everything. Conscious recall narrows, but what we’ve known is built into our</p>
<p>unconscious and capacities—like gifted children who can’t explain where skills came from. We re-express that</p>
<p>knowledge and expand it. By life’s end, we’ve incarnated more of what we carry.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> How can mediums bring through loved ones if those souls are in the bardo—or already</p>
<p>reincarnated?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> A simple model: after death we return to the Soul, review, assimilate, and exchange the small</p>
<p>identity for the large. If I die and want to see my father, his Soul can meet me, presenting the “front image” I</p>
<p>knew as my dad, then deepening into soul-to-soul exchange. Mediums may contact that persona for compassionate</p>
<p>communication, but we shouldn’t assume that persona is the soul’s post-death state.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Another common question: with more people alive now, where do the extra souls come</p>
<p>from?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Think of a campus that grows though the town is much larger. We’ve no reason to think the</p>
<p>number of souls is small or fixed. Perhaps billions wait to incarnate as openings arise. The spiritual universe dwarfs</p>
<p>the physical. Robert Monroe emphasized that the physical is a slice; most reality is nonphysical.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Monroe also suggested some humans evolved from higher animals.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Many reincarnation traditions hold that the process correlates with the birth of individualized</p>
<p>consciousness in the animal kingdom and extends before the human.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Regressionist Linda Backman, trained by Michael Newton, says more people now access</p>
<p>non-Earth lives.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Theoretically, why not? If life is abundant and reincarnation trans-local, crossover is conceivable.</p>
<p>I’ve no personal experience of that, but I respect those reports.</p>
<p><em>[Mid-show break and sponsor messages]</em></p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> I’m attached to this personality. I don’t like the idea that she disappears, like an actor</p>
<p>shedding a role. Could I reconnect or even bring “her” back?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Nothing essential is lost. We take not only memory but a vivid, living version of our earthly</p>
<p>experience—“in technicolor and stereo,” as NDErs say. The Soul can crystallize any of its lives’ forms, or integrate</p>
<p>them. To me it isn’t sacrifice; it’s trading up from a bicycle to a starship.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Sometimes I feel spiritually unimpressive for someone who’s lived millennia. Could I ever</p>
<p>become like a guide or angel?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Your essential nature already is that. Also, don’t judge a soul by appearances. Like a student</p>
<p>switching majors, a seasoned soul can look like a beginner in a new curriculum. And look at your work—amplifying</p>
<p>spiritual dialogue at a time the world needs it. I think there are more bodhisattvas than we recognize.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Some teachers warn not to go to the white light or you’ll be trapped in cycles. Your view?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The light is a homing beacon. Follow it as far as you can. People naturally stop where they’re</p>
<p>comfortable—one of many bardo levels—and later choose to reincarnate. Training increases comfort so you can go</p>
<p>“all the way,” into what Buddhists call extra-samsaric reality. I’ve touched that, and it changed my life.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Why was reincarnation removed from Christianity? In the first centuries it appears; then</p>
<p>under Justinian it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s complex. Did Jesus teach reincarnation? Some Gnostic texts say so; whether they reflect the</p>
<p>historical Jesus is debated. Early Christianity had multiple streams; some affirmed reincarnation and women’s</p>
<p>clerical leadership—both later filtered out. Geddes MacGregor argued reincarnation isn’t inherently at odds with</p>
<p>core Christian teaching. Historically, the Church centralized authority amid imperial collapse. Mediation by clergy</p>
<p>became the model of salvation. From a reincarnational view, that constrained individual spiritual autonomy.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> You devote a chapter to the “hidden phase” between lives.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That’s why I named the book <em>Life Cycles</em>. If you only study birth-to-death, you miss half the</p>
<p>cycle. There’s a fairly patterned process after death. Michael Newton’s work maps it well: life review,</p>
<p>assimilation, re-immersion in the community of souls, rest, then focusing on the next curriculum with guidance.</p>
<p>We’re shown options and choose challenges suited to growth and service. Then—hello, newborn.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Rough stats say about 57% believe in life after death; 12–44% (varies by country) believe in</p>
<p>reincarnation; about 75% believe in heaven—and hell. How do you see heaven and hell?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The Buddhist framing helps. After death, what we are is mirrored back. Generosity returns as</p>
<p>heavenly experience; harm returns as hellish experience—not punishment, but education. It’s a stage in debriefing.</p>
<p>Beyond it there’s a “heaven of heavens”—infinite love, knowledge, and bliss—within which the human drama is a</p>
<p>small part. I do not accept an eternal hell. There is accountability, but no cosmic parent condemns a child</p>
<p>forever.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I have spent long stretches in hell realms in my work—torturous, collective suffering. My take is</p>
<p>that the human species retains its unprocessed trauma in the collective unconscious. Those clusters can feel like</p>
<p>hell, but like personal trauma they can be metabolized. Some in the early Church may have misread encounters</p>
<p>with collective shadow as a metaphysical doctrine of eternal damnation.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> Is there room for reincarnation in Christian thought?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> If reincarnation is established as fact—and I think the case is strong—Christianity can integrate</p>
<p>it by expanding the age of the soul. One can retain Jesus’s unique salvific role if desired, or situate him within a</p>
<p>communion of awakened beings aiding humanity. Most importantly, maturation unfolds over many lives, not one.</p>
<p>That dissolves cruel implications of a single lifetime determining eternity. Jesus speaks to souls, not just</p>
<p>personalities.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> You end with the “web of life,” an ongoing dialogue across lives and between lives.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After living and teaching in this frame, the old siloed view feels unnatural and spiritually thin.</p>
<p>Reincarnation doesn’t answer everything, but it opens deeper questions—and richer answers.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGBEER:</strong> We’re out of time. Chris, thank you for a fascinating conversation.</p>

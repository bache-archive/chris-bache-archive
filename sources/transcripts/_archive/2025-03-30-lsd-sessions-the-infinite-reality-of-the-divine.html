<p>In this brief exchange, CHRIS BACHE addresses whether his high-dose LSD practice revealed identifiable divine beings.</p>
<p>He explains that, across years of disciplined sessions, he did not meet a personified “God.” Instead, repeated</p>
<p>descents into subtler strata of consciousness opened communion with a vast, knowing intelligence that guided,</p>
<p>tested, and reconstituted him for deeper engagement. He could enter into dialogue with this presence and at times</p>
<p>be dissolved into it, yet it never crystallized as a discrete personality. Rather, it expanded in scope and depth,</p>
<p>exceeding any fixed form. Bache suggests that many theological images of God arise from early-stage encounters</p>
<p>with this infinite intelligence, which is too immense to be fully concretized within historical religious lineages.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> Did you connect with a being or angels or other divine entities? If so, what was that realm like?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In all the years I did this work, I never encountered a divine being who said, “I’m God.” It wasn’t like that. I would go deeper into levels of consciousness and enter communion with a knowing presence. It knew me, taught me, showed me things, shattered me, and then brought me forward into still deeper levels. I would internalize the energy of each level and continue, always in relationship with this consciousness.</p>
<p>It guided my sessions. I could enter into dialogue with it and be dissolved into it, but it never crystallized into what you might call a personality of God or a person of God. It just kept becoming larger, deeper, and more vast. I think many of our theologies of God, or our ways of thinking about God, are based on early encounters with an infinite intelligence—one far too immense to be concretized within the historical lineages of the world’s traditions.</p>

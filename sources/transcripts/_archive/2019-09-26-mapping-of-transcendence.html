<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In this lecture, philosopher <strong>Chris Bache</strong> recounts his 40-year exploration of psychedelic</p>
<p>consciousness and the cosmological insights that arose from 73 high-dose LSD sessions carried</p>
<p>out between 1979 and 1999. Building on Stanislav Grof’s frameworks, Bache distinguishes</p>
<p>between therapeutic “psycholytic” work and his own “psychedelic exploration,” describing five</p>
<p>major death-rebirth thresholds: ego death, collective suffering, archetypal reality, causal</p>
<p>oneness, and the domain of diamond luminosity. He outlines a future-oriented vision in which</p>
<p>humanity faces an intense global crisis that ultimately catalyzes a leap into a “future human”</p>
<p>state. Emphasising disciplined set and setting, rigorous journaling, and long integration</p>
<p>periods, Bache argues that psychedelics can grant direct communion with a super-coherent cosmic</p>
<p>intelligence and accelerate both personal and collective evolution. The talk closes with a call</p>
<p>to steward these states responsibly and to ground their revelations in compassionate action.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: <em>[music, applause]</em> Thank you, Swamiji, for guiding us into such a spacious inner</p>
<p>place. I went so deep that I suddenly remembered—I still have a talk to give!</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: The cosmology that surfaces in psychedelic research is not new. It mirrors the</p>
<p>visions found in the world’s deepest mystical traditions. What is new is the technology—modern</p>
<p>psychedelics—giving fresh access to those timeless states.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: It is a pleasure to be with the TimeWaver community again. Last year I spoke</p>
<p>about a manuscript titled <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>. The book is finished and will be released in</p>
<p>November under the publisher’s title <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. For me it will always</p>
<p>remain <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: A revolution begins by asking, *What is it possible for human beings to</p>
<p>experience?* The Global Consciousness Project, parapsychology, and psychedelic research all</p>
<p>stretch that question. Ervin Laszlo, who wrote the foreword to my book, demonstrates across</p>
<p>disciplines that a super-coherent cosmic intelligence informs space-time. I contend that, in a</p>
<p>disciplined setting, psychedelics allow progressively deeper communion with that intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Today’s renaissance in psychedelic science has two main fronts: mapping neural</p>
<p>biochemistry and healing personal trauma—PTSD, depression, and more. Important first steps, yet</p>
<p>only beginnings. Historically, shamanic and mystical lineages teach that personal healing is</p>
<p>merely the launchpad for a far longer journey.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: These medicines can shatter the shell of the earth-bound mind so reliably that</p>
<p>the ensuing depths of cosmic communion defy description. By repeatedly dissolving ourselves, we</p>
<p>enter flows of life that transcend all measure, becoming beings who know and do what ordinary</p>
<p>selves cannot.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: My own path began in 1979 when I discovered Stan Grof’s *Realms of the Human</p>
<p>Unconscious<em> and </em>LSD Psychotherapy*. Grof distinguishes low-dose psycholytic therapy, which</p>
<p>peels the psyche layer by layer, from high-dose psychedelic therapy, which launches one through</p>
<p>all layers at once—often into near-death experience. Spring Grove Hospital limited this to three</p>
<p>sessions. I wondered: if three are safe, could more reveal a larger map?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Quietly, covertly—I had no legal avenue—I embarked on a 20-year project:</p>
<p>seventy-three sessions of 500–600 µg LSD, always with the same clinically trained sitter (my</p>
<p>then-wife), identical setting, eyeshades, curated music, meticulous notes. Four years on, six</p>
<p>years off, then ten more years, all between ages thirty and fifty.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: I now call this protocol <em>psychedelic exploration</em>. The method is Grofian</p>
<p>therapy; the difference is sheer repetition. I do <strong>not</strong> recommend others follow my exact path.</p>
<p>Today I would interleave high and low doses and balance LSD with more body-anchored medicines</p>
<p>like psilocybin or ayahuasca.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Across twenty years the sessions formed a single conversation. Personal themes</p>
<p>arose mainly at entry and exit; the peaks moved far beyond personal reality. Five core</p>
<p>death-rebirth passages emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Death of self—complete ego dissolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descent into collective suffering—an ocean of humanity’s pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entry into archetypal mind—encountering vast Platonic intelligences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causal oneness—totality without outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diamond luminosity—a clear light matching Buddhism’s dharmakaya.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: The first phase, crossing birth and death, echoed Grof’s perinatal matrices. Ten</p>
<p>sessions over two years culminated in radical ego death. Expecting relief, I instead plunged</p>
<p>into collective agony—wars, slavery, every wound our species carries. For another two years that</p>
<p>suffering deepened until, in session 24, it climaxed and never returned.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: On the far side lay <em>deep time in the soul</em>: experiencing my entire life—and,</p>
<p>later, humanity’s hundred-thousand-year arc—as simultaneous wholeness. Such states must be</p>
<p>learned; recall improves with practice.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: After a six-year hiatus the work resumed exactly where it had stopped, revealing</p>
<p>an intentional guidance. New sessions delivered systematic instruction on cosmic structure—the</p>
<p>“master plan.” I saw humanity as a single organism, our minds fractal facets of one greater</p>
<p>mind, our bodies cells within one body.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Descent into archetypal reality required surrendering even human identity.</p>
<p>Terrifying fiery deaths stabilized consciousness at higher energy densities. There I beheld</p>
<p>galactic-scale beings who shape time-space and evolve life.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: In causal oneness came a year of blessings: emptiness, universal song, oceans of</p>
<p>love, and “diamond soul” fusion—past-life filaments coalescing into a radiant individuality far</p>
<p>beyond ordinary ego.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Yet the journey’s purpose was not escape. Over five years diamond luminosity</p>
<p>pressed itself into my biology, demonstrating that transcendence must incarnate, transforming</p>
<p>body, mind, and society.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Throughout, visions of a <em>future human</em> recurred: a planetary crisis, rapid</p>
<p>non-linear reorganization, and an accelerated evolutionary leap. Labor pains of a species in</p>
<p>birth, not terminal decline.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: <em>[applause]</em> In closing, these realms belong to everyone, whether reached by</p>
<p>psychedelics or other disciplines. Approach them gently, with rigorous preparation, and let</p>
<p>their light soak into your bones. Thank you. <em>[music, applause]</em></p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Host Andrew speaks with philosopher and psychedelic pioneer <strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong> about his</p>
<p>twenty-year series of 73 high-dose LSD sessions, recounted in *LSD and the Mind of the</p>
<p>Universe*. They discuss why he considers psychedelics a rigorous contemplative method,</p>
<p>how carefully selected music shapes the inner journey, and why deep states amplify both</p>
<p>consciousness and subtle-body energy. Bache distinguishes therapeutic healing, spiritual</p>
<p>awakening, and cosmological exploration, arguing that psychedelics can open a third</p>
<p>path that maps the architecture of mind and the universe. The dialogue explores</p>
<p>monism versus functional dualism, Buddhist emptiness and “the Beloved,” individuation,</p>
<p>and the ethical pivot from personal enlightenment to collective service. Andrew shares</p>
<p>resonances from retreat practice, and Bache reflects on integration, the discipline of</p>
<p>recording sessions, and the long arc of bringing transcendence back into immanence.</p>
<p>Throughout, both return to humility, safety, and the responsibility of sharing powerful</p>
<p>experiences without glamorizing risk.</p>
<h1>Part 1</h1>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> <em>[Music]</em> Everybody, Andrew here, and I simply cannot contain my excitement about</p>
<p>my guest today, Dr. Chris Bache. With a brief introduction, we’ll launch into what I hope</p>
<p>will be a revelatory and provocative conversation.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Chris, PhD, is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious</p>
<p>Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct</p>
<p>faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an emeritus fellow at the Institute</p>
<p>of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory board of Grof Legacy Training.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Chris’s passion is the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of</p>
<p>consciousness, especially psychedelic states. An award-winning teacher and international</p>
<p>speaker, he’s written four books: <em>Life Cycles</em>; <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>; *The Living</p>
<p>Classroom<em>; and </em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, the story of his 20-year journey with</p>
<p>LSD. Chris is a father of three, a Vajrayana practitioner, and lives in Weaverville, North</p>
<p>Carolina, with his wife, Christina Hardy. Oh my gosh, Chris—where do we start? Thank you,</p>
<p>my dear friend, for taking time to talk with us.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s a pleasure. I’ve been looking forward to this.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> A quick preface before we dive in. I’ve read a lot over the years, but I’ve never</p>
<p>read anything like <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. Of your books, that’s the one I want</p>
<p>to focus on. It stretched my mind open, challenged me, resonated deeply, and sometimes</p>
<p>created dissonance—modern music needs both. To give listeners a frame, could you offer a</p>
<p>long elevator pitch? Let’s say we have a thousand floors.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I know it’s a radical book. I think we’re at a pivot point in history, and</p>
<p>psychedelics mark a true before-and-after in philosophy, not just psychology. They offer not</p>
<p>only new therapeutic protocols for healing the personal psyche, but a disciplined way of</p>
<p>doing philosophy experientially—something with roots in the Eleusinian mysteries and the</p>
<p>ayahuasca traditions.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I finished my PhD at Brown, took a position in Ohio, and was a convinced</p>
<p>agnostic. Then I encountered Stan Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>, followed by</p>
<p><em>LSD Psychotherapy</em>. This was 1978. I saw the implications for philosophy of religion and</p>
<p>realized that the most substantive future contributions would come from people writing out</p>
<p>of lived experience, not just intellect.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> So I split my life in two. By day I was a conventional academic. Privately,</p>
<p>I began a 20-year journey, following Grof’s protocol with high doses of LSD. It’s an</p>
<p>aggressive method I would not recommend in the same way today, but I completed 73 high-dose</p>
<p>sessions.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Each session was completely isolated—what I call a psychedelic kiva. I’d lie</p>
<p>down in a protected space with a sitter—my wife, a clinical psychologist—wear eye shades,</p>
<p>and listen to carefully curated music through headphones. I worked for four years, paused</p>
<p>six, then continued ten more. The method, as a philosophical practice, systematically</p>
<p>expands consciousness. LSD is an amplifier; it doesn’t give you specific content. It makes</p>
<p>you hypersensitive for hours. How you use that sensitivity shapes what emerges over time.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> If you treat the session as contemplative—turn inward, isolate from the</p>
<p>world—a journey unfolds. It begins by confronting fear, shame, and pain—the early</p>
<p>purifications. If you persist, it opens deeper and deeper. I always recorded every session</p>
<p>within 24 hours. Careful documentation and reflection make subsequent sessions clearer.</p>
<p>Over 20 years I kept that discipline, then stopped in 1999. I didn’t publish until 2019. I</p>
<p>needed time to analyze, ponder, and integrate before going public. I kept a firewall</p>
<p>between my public and private life; only after retiring did I share this side of my work.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Amazing. Before we go further, one brief musician’s question. My first degree is</p>
<p>in classical piano. Why music? What role did it play, and how did you choose it?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Early research shows music’s influence on psychedelic sessions. It creates an</p>
<p>ambience that supports letting go of ordinary reality and yielding to the uprush of</p>
<p>unconscious material. A session has phases—build, peak, descent—over about eight hours. The</p>
<p>music should support each phase: powerful crescendos early, expansive passages in the</p>
<p>middle, gentler tones at the end.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After a year or so, I moved away from classical to more indigenous music. I</p>
<p>found it more evocative; it helped me release conventional reality and enter unusual</p>
<p>realities more readily.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> That resonates with Vajrayana inner yogas. The subtle body is tuned to frequency,</p>
<p>so sound touches that level directly. When you work with music, it’s like an external</p>
<p>tuning fork that evokes correlative inner harmonics, helping bring unconscious processes</p>
<p>into awareness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I think that’s fair. The subtle body is very engaged in psychedelic work.</p>
<p>Deeper consciousness equals higher energy. It places demands on the physical and subtle</p>
<p>bodies. You enter highly stimulated states—psychologically, energetically, physically.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> You also reframe Chögyam Trungpa’s “super-samsara.” I first heard it as a</p>
<p>critique, but you treat it alchemically: super-samsara can become the fuel for awakening if</p>
<p>met properly. Could you unpack that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It depends on how you meet it. Samsara is alluring and distracting; amplifying</p>
<p>it can just lead to more samsara. But if you meet the amplified material contemplatively,</p>
<p>you take tendencies to their roots. They uproot. Then you move into deeper layers and,</p>
<p>eventually, beyond samsara into bardic and extrasamsaric realities.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> People use psychedelics for many purposes. Three primary ones are:</p>
<p>therapeutic healing of personal wounds; spiritual realization—accelerating awakening; and,</p>
<p>third, cosmological exploration. I started with awakening, like many in the ’70s, but that</p>
<p>agenda fell away. Collective work—bodhisattva-style—rose in importance. Eventually my work</p>
<p>settled into cosmological exploration: a long journey into the consciousness of the</p>
<p>universe, the creative intelligence within and behind it.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> You don’t have to plumb archetypal realities or the birth of the universe to</p>
<p>awaken spiritually. So I distinguish cosmological exploration from awakening. If we judge</p>
<p>the former by the success criteria of the latter, we’ll miss what’s actually taking place.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Beautiful—and deep water. Let’s touch the relation between individual and cosmic,</p>
<p>mind and world. Is it the mind in the universe, or the universe in the mind? I noticed you</p>
<p>tag yourself philosophically as a monist if cornered, yet your language can imply a subtle</p>
<p>dualism between the personal and cosmic. How do you reconcile that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The dualism is functional, not ultimate. At core, I’m a monist by experience,</p>
<p>not by theory. Contemporary thought often treats the physical as all there is, consciousness</p>
<p>emerging late. I align with panpsychists: a primordial consciousness is present from the</p>
<p>start. Experientially, when the personal mind shatters—after excavating the personal and</p>
<p>collective unconscious—you drop into larger and larger fields until the mystic’s territory:</p>
<p>God-consciousness, all-as-one.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The universe—its physical manifestation and its underlying mind—is a single</p>
<p>organism. Early encounters with this “mother” reality were so intoxicating that many came to</p>
<p>see the purpose of life as dissolving the individual drop back into the ocean. I think that</p>
<p>cosmology is flawed. Given the age, scale, and genius of evolution, it makes little sense</p>
<p>that on the cusp of self-recognition we should simply disappear.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> What I learned is that the universe supports individuality—not the prison of</p>
<p>egoic isolation, but a robust, porous soulhood in exchange with larger life. Brahman delights</p>
<p>in manifesting and growing Atman—an ever more conscious synthesis of individuality and</p>
<p>totality.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> That touches my own retreat experience. I felt held by something vast—what I</p>
<p>called an external agency. As a Buddhist, I wrestled with emptiness and non-theism. How do</p>
<p>you reconcile emptiness with your language of the Beloved?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Buddhism’s radical agnosticism is invaluable. Its critique is not of reality</p>
<p>but of inadequate theisms. It proposes a process view: everything is dynamic, interdependent.</p>
<p>When I was guided and “held,” the intelligence never revealed itself as a person. In</p>
<p>psychedelic states you learn by becoming. Each time I asked, “Who are you?” I died and</p>
<p>awoke into a deeper layer—eventually realizing an open-ended, infinite progression.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That coheres with the Buddhist refusal to reify “God.” As you move beyond the</p>
<p>collective psyche—beyond the stories of religions—you encounter realities far outside those</p>
<p>frames. We can experience this; our concepts will always be partial.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Another big theme in your book is pedagogy—learning by becoming. It resonates</p>
<p>with gnostic learning: hear, contemplate, meditate; ingest, digest, metabolize until the</p>
<p>teaching embodies. I also want to name a painful arc you share: leaning so far into</p>
<p>transcendence that coming back was hard. Could you speak to integration?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Coming off the mountain, I realized I’d created an unwitting imbalance. I had</p>
<p>integrated each session conscientiously, yet I’d leaned so heavily into transcendence that</p>
<p>I’d lost some foothold in immanence. The sessions themselves ended me; they let me know it</p>
<p>was time to stop. I had to learn the “dying of keeping,” not just the “dying of discovering”:</p>
<p>to alter nothing and let vast states awaken within historical life.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Let’s talk about fear and sanity. Did you ever worry about snapping rather than</p>
<p>stretching?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Death-rebirth is always an ordeal. At advanced points I feared for my sanity</p>
<p>as I went over the waterfall. But if you surrender fully, the cycle completes. It gets bad,</p>
<p>worse, very bad—and then completes into ecstasy. The gift was learning the rhythm of the</p>
<p>spiral: crisis, surrender, blessing. I carry no trauma from the work; the music I used brings</p>
<p>love, not fear. The bigger challenge is living with memories so beautiful they haunt you in a</p>
<p>good way.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> You spent a harrowing stretch in the “ocean of suffering.” Is that a training in</p>
<p>great equanimity—no preference for heaven or hell?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I understand that teaching, but I read my passage differently. I don’t think</p>
<p>everyone must do what I did. I believe my soul chose that work before birth, and many souls</p>
<p>have made similar vows now. We’re in a critical time; the unhealed residues of history are</p>
<p>pouring out. Deep practitioners are often invited to lift some of that suffering from the</p>
<p>collective psyche.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> How do we know any of this is true? What about proof, replication, coherence?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I unpack this in <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> and in a dialogue with Ken Ring.</p>
<p>Grof’s decades of collated data provide a broad phenomenology; my experiences fit within it.</p>
<p>As with near-death research, veridical “local” perceptions increase the credibility of</p>
<p>transcendent ones. Cross-validation matters: after perinatal death-rebirth, people report</p>
<p>convergent spiritual realities. Comparing psychedelic, NDE, and out-of-body literatures,</p>
<p>their cosmologies converge more than diverge. Also, my sessions repeatedly shattered my</p>
<p>expectations; I learned things I wasn’t primed to see. Ultimately, we need standardized,</p>
<p>rigorous protocols across diverse cohorts and then compare the overlaps.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Where is this headed culturally? Do you imagine a church of LSD—kidding but not</p>
<p>kidding—or a tradition of disciplined psychonauts?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’m a symptom of a social pivot. The renaissance rightly begins with careful</p>
<p>therapeutic research. In time, we’ll remember what early researchers learned: psychedelics</p>
<p>also have philosophical value. As psychotherapists develop clinical protocols, philosophers</p>
<p>and scientists will develop rigorous exploratory protocols, record carefully, and test</p>
<p>experiences against other knowledge domains. I don’t have an agenda; I shared because the</p>
<p>Mother said, “Let them see me through your eyes.” Not for my sake, but to support others in</p>
<p>a difficult time.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW:</strong> Thank you for that courage. Tradition warns against indiscriminate sharing, yet</p>
<p>these times may require it. You also say that speaking is practice for you.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It is. Speaking rekindles memory; memory re-actualizes being; being shifts</p>
<p>mind and body. Silence made me sick. Sharing has been part of my healing. And I’m not trying</p>
<p>to persuade anyone—only to be useful.</p>

<p><strong>Interview with Christopher M. Bache, Ph.D.</strong></p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** What do you think death is?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Well, as I say in the book, eventually you reach a point where death loses its meaning after experiencing many cycles of death and rebirth. You learn that you can lose all your reality reference points—everything you know, everything you believe about yourself can be shattered and destroyed. Yet, the Phoenix always rises; you wake up changed, awakening to a deeper level of reality. So, eventually, you realize there is no such thing as death. There is only the shedding of one particular set of parameters within which awareness operates—shedding those parameters allows consciousness to expand into a deeper experience of reality. </p>
<p>What we typically refer to as the death of the physical body mirrors what you experience during a deep LSD session. When the body dies, you lose your physical reference points, and consciousness expands into a broader universe. Over time, the concept of death itself becomes less significant.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** You mentioned that the psychedelic experience can be existentially violent. Is it true that you never really get comfortable, no matter how many sessions you undergo? </p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, that’s fair to say. I once thought I'd go through a period of death and rebirth, purging, and eventually reach a stable place where future experiences would be clearer and easier. That’s not true. The universe is infinitely deep, with an infinite number of levels. As long as you're willing to explore the edges of your experience, the universe will take you deeper, which will always require some form of surrender—a death and rebirth process—to move further into it.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** When you say "universe," what does that mean to you?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** My experience shows that when you let go of physical-level consciousness, you enter into deeper dimensions of consciousness. There are layers upon layers, all coherent and fundamentally unified. It never presents a distinct face or identity; it remains open-ended and perpetually fluid yet profoundly felt. Some might call this consciousness the infinite or the absolute. I refer to it as both but also as the creative intelligence of the universe. It seems to embody the creative intelligence operating both within and beyond the universe, revealing different aspects at different times. Ultimately, in my heart, I call it my beloved because entering into it opens dimensions of love within me that are incomparable.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** I find it interesting that you refer to it as the beloved, much like an Indian guru. Some use it to describe unconditional love beyond what we typically know. </p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, it's a deeper love than human love, but I think it exists within the best of our human experiences. It's a radical love, the love that the Dao has for the ten thousand things—the love that being has for its own existence. From that perspective, all of us and all of creation manifest from its being, so how could it not love itself and, therefore, love us?</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** When you describe this beloved, do you think it can see itself only in reflections because it is what’s already happening?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, that's a profound perspective. It’s very difficult to objectify; objectification almost feels like part of the beloved. It's an ongoing process, already complete in itself.</p>
<p>We create many stories about what this totality of consciousness is, and much of that is just cultural scripting—our best guesses. Our cultural guesses are relatively new. While we've been making metaphysical intuitions for around five thousand years, this intelligence has been evolving for 13.7 billion years. We're just now reaching a point in our evolution where we can truly engage with it. </p>
<p>I think it's mistaken to assume this intelligence is not self-aware except through us. That places undue privilege on us if we assume we're the only mirror for the divine eye. Considering how this intelligence unfolds with an apparent precision through time and space, when I lose my boundaries as Chris Bache and dissolve into deeper layers, I encounter various layers of this phenomenon, including species consciousness, the mind of the collective unconscious, and even planetary consciousness like that of Gaia. </p>
<p>At each layer, I access clearer states of awareness, so it's hard for me to imagine that the dimension of being I embody during these experiences is not also self-aware. It appears that this creative intelligence has, at times, met me in my sessions. It has even taken me on a cosmic tour, seemingly pleased to share its work with evolved consciousness. </p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** Given your extensive experiences, do you still feel you are only scratching the surface of this vastness?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Absolutely! This realization came to me during my 50th session. My background includes four years of work, a six-year break, and then ten more years dedicated to this practice, totaling fourteen years over two decades. During the last five years, I focused on what I call the diamond luminosity work—26 sessions of which four led me into this unbelievably beautiful, ecstatic consciousness that felt extraordinarily clear. </p>
<p>One of the critical insights occurred during a session with the diamond luminosity. Toward the end, my visual field shifted 90 degrees, revealing another reality—worlds beyond where I was, illuminated by a light that shattered me. I called this light the absolute light to differentiate it from the diamond luminosity light. What it showed me was that there are worlds beyond my current experience, just as the diamond luminosity transcends time and space. </p>
<p>This realization compelled me to dismiss the belief that the purpose of this work is to reach a final destination. While you do experience moments of homecoming and deep fulfillment, the diamond luminosity satisfied me completely. Henceforth, my sessions didn’t aim at going deeper into that state but rather internalizing it more profoundly into my physical and psychological being. It's an infinite ocean, and I’ve completely relinquished the expectation of arriving at an endpoint.</p>

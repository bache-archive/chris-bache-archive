      <p>In this profound conversation hosted by Emmy Vadnais on <em>New Thinking Allowed</em>, philosopher and transpersonal explorer Chris Bache shares insights from his 20-year journey of 73 high-dose LSD sessions. Bache frames his work not as therapy or mystical awakening alone, but as a disciplined act of cosmological exploration. He maps five levels of consciousness—personal, collective, archetypal, causal, and diamond luminosity—and describes repeated cycles of death, rebirth, and purification required to access each. The dialogue explores divine intelligence, the future evolution of humanity, the nature of love and suffering, and the role of psychedelics in revealing the deeper structure of reality. Bache calls for rigorous preparation, ethical discernment, and collective frameworks for verifying such experiences, positioning psychedelic inquiry as a key to future philosophy and spiritual science.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong></p>
<p>Welcome, Chris. It’s a great joy to have you with me on <em>New Thinking Allowed</em> today.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Emmy. It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Today, we’ll explore your spiritual journey into the cosmic mind, especially through your 73 LSD sessions from 1979 to 1999, which you describe in <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. But first, what changes have you seen in recent years regarding psychedelics?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>There’s a worldwide renaissance in psychedelic research, with a primary focus on therapeutic healing—treating trauma, PTSD, depression. These substances amplify consciousness, surfacing personal material for healing.</p>
<p>A second use is spiritual awakening—uncovering our deeper nature, our connection with the wisdom and intelligence of the universe. That’s what initially drew me in.</p>
<p>But soon, my protocol took me into something deeper. I came to see my work as cosmological exploration—a systematic attempt to explore the deep structure of spiritual reality and the consciousness of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Can you name some of the psychedelics out there? We'll mostly focus on LSD.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>LSD, psilocybin, 5-MeO-DMT, salvia divinorum, San Pedro—these are fairly well-known. MDMA too, though it's technically an empathogen. Each has its nuances.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>And to be clear, you’re not advocating others follow your exact path?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely not. These substances are powerful amplifiers. Not everyone should take them. And no one should venture into these depths without proper guidance and safety. I worked with 500–600 micrograms of LSD per session—far more than I’d recommend now. It was a demanding path.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>What motivated you to begin this deep work?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>I’d finished my graduate studies and started teaching. At the time, I was an agnostic. Then I encountered Ian Stevenson’s work on reincarnation and Stanislav Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>. Grof’s work convinced me that psychedelics had deep implications for the philosophy of religion.</p>
<p>To contribute meaningfully, I knew I had to undergo my own inner exploration. So, with great care and restraint, I broke the law and began a 20-year journey. I worked for four years, paused for six, then resumed for another ten, finishing in 1999.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Can you describe the set and setting for your sessions?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>I followed Grof’s model. I was in a quiet, protected space with a sitter—my wife, a clinical psychologist. I wore eyeshades and headphones, with carefully chosen music. The structure created conditions for deep inner engagement.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>These were full-day commitments?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Yes—8 to 10 hours, usually on weekends. But integration required days before and after. High-dose work stirs deep energies that take time to settle.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>You also took detailed notes afterward?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Always. Phenomenological accuracy was key. Integration is essential. It builds the foundation for the next session. Each session opened more deeply when the previous one was thoroughly integrated.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Why psychedelics over other spiritual paths?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>I practiced meditation and yoga. I taught world religions. But psychedelics offered access to states of consciousness that lifetimes of meditation might only approach. I never stopped my spiritual practice, but the psychedelics deepened it immensely.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>What happened in your first session?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>I forgot who I was—couldn’t recall my name, gender, or life. It was terrifying, but taught me the necessity of surrender. I couldn’t control even my sense of self. That lesson served me throughout the journey.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Do you understand what LSD is doing physiologically?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Not in detail. I leave that to neuroscientists. I focus on the psychological and experiential dimensions. Often, the physiological framing is reductive, trying to fit expansive realities into materialist assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go deeper into your sessions. How would you describe them?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>The work unfolded across five major domains:</p>
<p>1. Personal mind—individual biography and unconscious.</p>
<p>2. Collective mind—shared human suffering and evolution.</p>
<p>3. Archetypal mind—not just Jungian motifs, but Platonic forms outside time and space.</p>
<p>4. Causal level—where oneness predominates and duality dissolves.</p>
<p>5. Diamond luminosity—a realm of absolute, crystalline light encountered late in my work.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Was there suffering?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, especially early on. The purification process involved reliving personal trauma, birth, and existential fear. Later, I confronted massive collective pain—wars, genocide, anguish spanning centuries.</p>
<p>It became clear this wasn’t personal—it was transpersonal. My sessions were being used to heal aspects of the collective psyche.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>You mention death and rebirth as recurring experiences?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Constantly. It’s the rhythm of this work. You surrender, die, are reborn at a deeper level. That cycle repeats as you move into new domains.</p>
<p>Eventually, I saw death not as ending, but as purification—a necessary dissolution before emergence.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>What exactly dies?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Four things:</p>
<p>1. The personal ego.</p>
<p>2. Parts of the collective ego.</p>
<p>3. The shamanic persona—your accumulated psychedelic identity, which must die to move deeper.</p>
<p>4. Sometimes, even aspects of divine consciousness itself.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Did you meet God?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>No personal deity. I encountered a vast, loving, teaching presence. It knew me, dissolved me, reshaped me—but never took a form. It never said, “I am God.” I call it <em>the Beloved</em>, experienced more often as feminine.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Can you describe “diamond luminosity”?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>It’s the purest light I’ve ever known. Beyond space, time, even the causal level. Once I touched it, I longed to return. I only accessed it four times in five years. It corresponds to <em>Dharmakāya</em> in Buddhism—the clear light of absolute reality.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>And love?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Love is the essence of this reality. Not sentimental love—cosmic love. Creation itself is born of love. Oneness and love are inseparable. Love is how oneness expresses itself in duality.</p>
<p>Though I identified more with jñāna and rāja yoga, I was drawn into bhakti through overwhelming experiences of divine love.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>What did you see of the future?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>I was shown the <em>birth of the future human</em>. A global crisis—likely ecological and geopolitical—forces humanity to its knees. But on the other side is a rebirth.</p>
<p>Oneness is born in the collective psyche. A new humanity emerges, post-egoic, spiritually awake. Children born after this will live in a higher psychic field.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Why did you stop the sessions?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Pain and heartache. The subtle energy became overwhelming. And returning from communion with the divine into time-space reality became too painful. Eventually, I agreed with the Beloved: I would not return until I could stay forever.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Did you share your work with Grof and Metzner?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Stan quoted my sessions in his books and wrote the foreword to <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>. Ralph gave feedback on <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. We were in dialogue, though on different missions—Stan focused on therapy; I focused on cosmology.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Can these experiences be trusted?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>That’s a vital question. Kenneth Ring and I explored it in our essay, <em>Are Deep Psychedelic Experiences Trustable?</em> We argue that collective corroboration is needed—multiple explorers comparing notes.</p>
<p>A shared metaphysical framework is emerging. But we’re only at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY:</strong></p>
<p>Final thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong></p>
<p>Approach this work with reverence and rigor. If done responsibly, psychedelics can open a new chapter in philosophy and human understanding.</p>
<p>This is not about isolated ecstasy—it’s about communion, transformation, and evolving into conscious co-creators of a greater reality.</p>

Marc Caron: Hello and good afternoon. My name is Mark Kron, and I'm here with my co-host Steve Gray. We're glad to be here, and today we have a very special guest, Mr. Chris Bache. Chris is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. His work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, particularly psychedelic states. Chris has written three books, including *Lifestyles*, *Life Cycles*, *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, and his new book, *LSD in the Mind of the Universe*, which is also the title of his talk at the upcoming conference. We're excited to have you here, Chris. Could you tell our viewers a bit about your story and the work you've done, especially regarding your high-dose LSD journeys?

Chris Bache: I'm actually a professor of religious studies, and I taught in a philosophy of religious studies program at the University, which is part of the Ohio State system in the northeast corner of the state. I'm really excited about the upcoming conference, especially since my book will be released there for the first time. After all the years of research and writing, I'm finally ready to have a conversation I've been waiting for a long time. To explore the philosophical potential of psychedelic states, I had to do much of this work underground, hidden from my colleagues. I couldn't share this aspect of my life during my time as a religious studies professor, and none of my students knew about my research. I had to wait until after I retired and passed the statute of limitations for my psychedelic explorations to openly discuss this. I'm delighted to start this conversation at the conference and in the workshop that will follow.

Stephen Gray: That’s quite an introduction!

Marc Caron: I feel like I already have ten questions from that introduction!

Stephen Gray: Why don't you start us off, then?

Marc Caron: It's not even a question, but I want to acknowledge the point you made about having to hide your work from colleagues and the loneliness that can come with it. That thought process was profound, considering the isolation you dealt with while carrying out your research. What was the biggest challenge for you in keeping all of that contained?

Chris Bache: I knew that silence was going to be essential for allowing me to do this work, and I accepted that responsibility. Over the long term, the loneliness became a significant issue. The inability to share my experiences or engage in conversations with others was difficult. If I had lived in a city with a vibrant psychedelic community, like San Francisco or Vancouver, it might have been different, but I was in Ohio, where there wasn't much of a community to connect with. After I completed my work—73 high-dose sessions between 1979 and 1999—I found that not being able to talk about these experiences significantly inhibited my ability to integrate them into my life. While I could manage some personal integration, I couldn't incorporate it into my identity as a teacher. Living in a sort of closet was psychologically burdensome. Now that I've published the book and started discussing this material publicly, I'm finding relief from that burden, and I hope this conversation will continue to deepen in the future.

Stephen Gray: That’s very understandable, thank you for sharing. 

Marc Caron: I think your point about integration is crucial. In our community, especially in the past year since the last conference, integration has become a significant buzzword. You mentioned your isolation, which is reflective of the importance of community, and that's why our conference aims to facilitate sharing and connection. It's vital for individuals looking to explore their experiences further.

Chris Bache: I'm pleased to see integration being discussed more widely now. There's an anthology coming out in London within a year that focuses on this concept. We live in an age where, through the use of sacred medicines, we can expand our consciousness dramatically. The challenge is learning to live with, and to integrate, the memories of those deep experiences. We can’t remain in those states indefinitely, but the memories can enrich our daily practices and interactions. I even found that my teaching drew deeply from my private work, even if my students never knew it.

Stephen Gray: That's fascinating. Could you elaborate on aspects of integration for someone who might only participate in a few ayahuasca sessions or use psilocybin mushrooms occasionally?

Chris Bache: Good question! I don’t have a simple answer, but there are a few things that come to mind. Firstly, it's essential to emphasize clear contact during sessions, controlling variables to avoid confusion and ensure you have a strong connection with the experience. You should also write a detailed account of your session within 24 hours while the memories are still fresh. I find that listening to the music I played during the session helps me dive deeper into those memories when I write. 

Additionally, maintaining a daily spiritual practice—be it yoga, meditation, or something else—is crucial. As a rule of thumb, the deeper the journey into non-ordinary states, the stronger the daily practice should be. Expressing oneself through art can also help solidify and relate to those experiences. Lastly, sharing with others—listening to and discussing experiences—can be incredibly beneficial.

Stephen Gray: Those are valuable insights. 

Marc Caron: So, Stephen, what's on your mind?

Stephen Gray: I'd love to dive deeper into the material itself. I've read your books and what stands out is the concept of the Great Death and the Great Awakening. Could you elaborate on that?

Chris Bache: Let me provide some context. When working with high levels of LSD, I found that entering deeper levels of reality facilitated a consistent death-rebirth process. Each time I returned to these deeper levels, not only did my experience stabilize, but I also encountered a cycle of death and rebirth leading me to explore deeper layers of consciousness. It wasn’t just about my personal evolution; it became clear that these experiences were interconnected with humanity's collective transformation. I came to define what I call the "birth of the future human," though I leave what forms this future human will take open to interpretation.

The process seems crucial for our species evolution—a pivot in the human psyche’s foundational blueprint driven through a painful transformation process. We need to confront our historical choices, especially those that reinforce division and conflict, to make new, life-affirming choices. This transition requires a collective effort to purify our historical legacy and change our stories, setting the foundation for what we hope will be a new awakening for humanity.

Stephen Gray: It's daunting to think about the scale of what's needed.

Chris Bache: Indeed. The upcoming crises we face—environmental, social, and political—will test us. We’re at a life-and-death moment for our species. This work is about our collective trajectory, and while we face severe pain ahead, these challenges can bring profound insights and spur creativity within our collective psyche.

Marc Caron: How do you see that playing out in the coming years?

Chris Bache: The transition we need will be challenging. Suffering will not be limited to specific regions—it will be global. This collective experience of pain will feed into the psychic field, allowing for small perturbations to create significant effects. In such non-linear conditions, creativity and individual agency may lead to transformative actions that wouldn't otherwise be possible in a stable system.

Stephen Gray: It’s a sobering but necessary realization.

Chris Bache: Yes, and through these shared experiences, we can catalyze what I call a "Great Awakening." As we enter this new phase of human development, we must work collectively and strive for awareness beyond the ego—a soulful integration of our diverse histories and experiences. We will either allow the old stories to die and emerge as a new human consciousness, or we will struggle through the pain of remaining stuck in divisive narratives.

Stephen Gray: That's a beautiful vision of potential. 

Chris Bache: Indeed, we are seeing this maturation of the soul, exemplified when individuals commit to causes beyond themselves. This signals an awakening of the larger soul within our societies, making it clear that we’re on the cusp of something significant. 

Stephen Gray: I find it inspiring amidst the challenges. Do you think this awakening is already noticeable? 

Chris Bache: Absolutely! Despite the dire circumstances, there are countless individuals working selflessly for the greater good. This growing commitment to collective change showcases the emergence of the soul in our collective consciousness.

Marc Caron: It seems we’re seeing a movement toward creating new systems and social structures. 

Chris Bache: Exactly! We need to experiment with new economic and social frameworks as we confront the failures of our current systems. However, there's no guarantee in evolution. The path ahead is uncharted and fraught with uncertainty, but the intelligence of the universe suggests we're prepared for this transition. 

Stephen Gray: It’s encouraging to feel that potential, even amid such uncertainty. 

Chris Bache: It truly is, and I believe deeply in this possibility for transformation. As we birth a new framework for humanity, we must remember that we are not alone in this journey—there’s a vast, interconnected web of existence guiding us forward.

### An Interview with Chris Bache — LSD and the Universe

**Stephen Gray: ** There's a segment of the psychedelic community that's very devoted to natural plants. The core of your work was with a semi-synthetic substance, LSD. What's your take on that? What do you say to those who claim that nature knows best?

**Chris Bache: ** I think nature does know best in many ways. Natural plants are effective and have historical significance in human history. However, I don’t think we should overly emphasize the difference between synthetic and organic medicines. Both can be valuable. Each medicine develops its own field through the history of human interaction with it. For example, there are significant fields around Psilocybin mushrooms and Ayahuasca, which might explain why people encounter familiar symbols or experiences with them, even without prior exposure to their cultural origins. In contrast, LSD doesn’t carry the same historical field. Its relationships are more abstract and cosmic, which can provide a broader view of existence but might lack the immediacy or intimacy of other psychedelics.

**Stephen Gray: ** So you found those to be a good adjunct for you?

**Chris Bache: ** Yes, they have been. I wish I had incorporated them sooner during my years of work. 

**Marc Caron: ** What made you choose LSD in 1979 as opposed to something like magic mushrooms?

**Chris Bache: ** I read Stan Grof’s work, specifically *Realms of the Human Unconscious*, published in 1976. After graduating in 1978, I came across his *LSD Psychotherapy*, which detailed his early research. I had access to high-quality laboratory-grade LSD, and his methodology gave me the confidence to use it on my journey.

**Stephen Gray: ** What's your take on 5-MeO-DMT? It's gaining popularity, and I think it warrants more discussion. Recently on a panel, one participant expressed that psychedelics could be doors that shouldn't be opened. I mention this in the context of my own experience with 5-MeO-DMT. It was stunning, but I find it hard to assess its influence on my ongoing spiritual journey.

**Chris Bache: ** I don’t have extensive experience with 5-MeO-DMT; I’ve only done a couple of sessions, which were indeed beautiful and luminous. My experiences were after my work with LSD, so my mindset had been polished by that long journey. 5-MeO-DMT can drop you deeply into universal experiences very quickly, but its short duration poses challenges for integration. Unlike LSD, which allows more time for healing and understanding, 5-MeO-DMT might be less effective for long-lasting transformation.

**Marc Caron: ** I can relate to that. I had an experience with DMT and came away with more questions than answers. 

**Stephen Gray: ** You’ve mentioned that most journeys have two parts: the first being painful letting go, followed by a breakthrough into living intelligence. Do you think this suits everyone, or are some people more suited to deep exploration than others?

**Chris Bache: ** My understanding has evolved. Initially, I aimed for a particular end state, assuming that achieving these deep experiences would have lasting effects. I have learned that deep experiences do not always lead to impactful transformation. Now, I’m more patient with the process, understanding that much productive work can happen at a gentler pace. It’s not always necessary to dive into profound pain to uncover who we are. Often, healing comes through smaller, more manageable methods.

**Stephen Gray: ** That makes sense. 

**Chris Bache: ** As a philosopher, my journey has enriched my understanding of how interconnected we are. I wouldn't trade my experiences for anything; they’ve fundamentally changed my life and perspective.

**Stephen Gray: ** Looking ahead to your upcoming workshop, what do you hope participants will take away from it?

**Chris Bache: ** I’m still figuring that out. I want to share my experiences and explore how they can be useful to others. I hope to guide participants into deeper, meaningful inner exploration through exercises that encourage both intellectual and emotional integration. 

**Stephen Gray: ** It sounds like it's going to be very interactive, not just lectures.

**Chris Bache: ** Exactly. My goal is to offer experiences that connect participants deeply with their own inner being.

**Marc Caron: ** So just to clarify for everyone, this workshop won’t involve any psychedelic substances?

**Chris Bache: ** No, we won’t be using psychedelics. The discussion and exercises will focus on opening minds and hearts without altering consciousness with substances.

**Stephen Gray: ** It sounds wonderful. 

**Marc Caron: ** Yes, I can’t wait. Chris, it's an honor to have you here again. 

**Chris Bache: ** I'm looking forward to returning to Vancouver. At the last conference, I had just completed my book, which will now be available at this event. I found last year’s participants and speakers incredibly inspiring, and I’m eager to share this journey with everyone.

**Stephen Gray: ** Mark, maybe you can share more about the details of the workshop and how people can attend?

**Marc Caron: ** I’ll include that information in the comments. The workshop will take place the weekend following the conference, and participants can expect meals and plenty of opportunities for deep engagement with the material.

**Chris Bache: ** We're aiming for a thoughtful and engaging experience, and I sincerely hope attendees leave with new insights and a deeper connection to their inner selves.

**Stephen Gray: ** I'm excited for what’s to come! Thank you again, Chris.

**Chris Bache: ** Thank you for having me. I look forward to connecting with everyone.

**Marc Caron: ** It's time to wrap up, but we’ll be seeing everyone soon at the conference! Thank you all for participating in this conversation. 

**Stephen Gray: ** Take care, everyone! Happy journeys!

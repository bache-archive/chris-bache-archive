<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Psychiatrist Bernard Biteman hosts a wide-ranging dialogue on the climate crisis as a portal for human</p>
<p>transformation. Dan Siegel outlines interpersonal neurobiology’s view of mind as an emergent, self-organizing</p>
<p>process of energy and information flow within bodies and relationships. Integration—differentiation plus linkage—</p>
<p>yields well-being; its breakdown drives chaos and rigidity across personal and societal “pandemics,” including mass</p>
<p>extinction. Siegel contrasts Newtonian time-bound reality with a timeless quantum realm, sharing how his Wheel of</p>
<p>Awareness practice reliably evokes experiences of unity and love, and argues for shifting from the “solo self” to an</p>
<p>“intra-connected” identity (mWe). Chris Bache affirms these insights from his decades of deep psychedelic practice,</p>
<p>describing field-consciousness, classroom field effects, and time-transcending glimpses that humanity survives our</p>
<p>present ordeal. Together they explore coincidence, collective fields, bifurcation dynamics, and the role of love,</p>
<p>leadership, and culture in catalyzing the great turning now required.</p>

<p><strong>ANNOUNCER:</strong> Welcome to Connecting with Coincidence with psychiatrist Bernard David Biteman, MD. Dr. Biteman founded</p>
<p>The Coincidence Project, encouraging people to share coincidence stories. To learn more, search “Connecting with</p>
<p>Coincidence” to find his book, Psychology Today blog, and podcast interviews. And now, your host, Bernard Biteman, MD.</p>
<p><strong>BERNARD BITEMAN:</strong> Welcome to Connecting with Coincidence. I’m Bernard Biteman, a psychiatrist who studies meaningful</p>
<p>coincidences. My book, <em>Meaningful Coincidences: How Synchronicity and Serendipity Happen</em>, is linked below on YouTube.</p>
<p>Today, we face a planetary problem many avoid—the sixth mass extinction, driven this time by us. Unsustainable land,</p>
<p>water, and energy use, and the resulting climate change, are central drivers.</p>
<p>We’re joined by two smart, big-hearted guests meeting here for the first time. First, <strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>, professor</p>
<p>emeritus of religious studies at Youngstown State University and author of <em>The Living Classroom</em> and *LSD and the Mind</p>
<p>of the Universe*. Chris undertook 73 high-dose, carefully structured LSD sessions exploring consciousness. Also with</p>
<p>us is <strong>DAN SIEGEL</strong>, clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA, co-founder of the Mindful Awareness Research Center,</p>
<p>and executive director of the Mindsight Institute. His new book, <em>IntraConnected</em>, explores how our identities and</p>
<p>belonging interpenetrate. I’ve asked each to share how they understand what’s coming for humanity and what we can do.</p>
<p>Chris wanted Dan to go first—so, Dan, you’re on.</p>
<p><strong>DAN SIEGEL:</strong> Thanks, Bernie. By training I’m a scientist, physician, and psychiatrist who researches relationships</p>
<p>and the developing self. About 30 years ago I began weaving sciences together in a consilient framework—what E. O.</p>
<p>Wilson called “consilience.” Our field, interpersonal neurobiology, invites all ways of knowing—sciences, contemplative</p>
<p>and indigenous wisdom, arts—into one conversation. We’ve published over 80 books in the Norton Series.</p>
<p>We view the mind as broader than the brain—an emergent process of energy and information flow that is both embodied and</p>
<p>relational. Complex systems science shows such systems self-organize. Optimal self-organization arises through</p>
<p>integration—differentiating parts and linking them. When integration is strong, life exhibits the FACES flow:</p>
<p>flexibility, adaptability, coherence, energized vitality, and stability. When integration is impaired, systems</p>
<p>devolve into chaos or rigidity.</p>
<p>Attachment research, trauma studies, and contemplative science all converge here. Integrated relationships promote</p>
<p>integrated neural connectivity; mind training like mindfulness and compassion increases integration; psychiatric</p>
<p>disorders show impaired integration. So integration is the basis of well-being.</p>
<p>Now, consider our many pandemics: biodiversity loss and species extinction, racism and social injustice, COVID-19,</p>
<p>polarization and misinformation, loneliness, screen addiction, and the climate disaster. These show chaos and rigidity</p>
<p>at scale. I propose a root cause: how modern culture constructs the self. Driven by a need for certainty, we form a</p>
<p>“solo self”—identity confined to the individual body, or to individuals like “us.”</p>
<p><em>IntraConnected</em> offers mWe—me plus we—as an integrated identity of self and belonging. Indigenous teachings and</p>
<p>contemplative traditions have long invited fluid, verb-like being within the whole. Science can join them. If we build</p>
<p>an intra-connected identity, we act for the larger body because it is who we are—like caring for a stubbed toe because</p>
<p>it’s part of you. This is realistic idealism: a path by which humanity can choose actions for the greater good.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Beautifully put, Dan. Though I lack your scientific background, my experiential path aligns with what</p>
<p>you describe. In my psychedelic work, the ego ruptured and reconstituted into progressively larger fields of</p>
<p>consciousness—psychic, subtle, causal—each dissolving into the next. I often wished for PhDs in physics and astronomy</p>
<p>to assimilate what opened, but I was simply taken into field-consciousness, taught how these fields self-organize.</p>
<p><em>The Living Classroom</em> came through in one ten-minute download during a session and then took years to unpack and</p>
<p>research. Practically, those insights reshaped my teaching. From these experiences I also carry a conviction—not</p>
<p>scientific, but experiential—that we make it through this historical crisis. In deep states, time becomes permeable.</p>
<p>One can encounter humanity’s death-rebirth from the future as “already happened.” That makes no sense in linear time,</p>
<p>but trans-temporal states allow it. Precognition hints at the same permeability.</p>
<p><strong>BERNARD BITEMAN:</strong> Time’s fluidity has become a public conversation. Dan?</p>
<p><strong>DAN SIEGEL:</strong> Consilience helps here too. Independent indigenous traditions and contemplative lineages—some using</p>
<p>plant medicines—arrived at the same systems conclusions. Science asks us to doubt and test assumptions. In clinical and</p>
<p>educational settings I developed the Wheel of Awareness: we distinguish the hub (pure knowing) from the rim (known</p>
<p>sensations, feelings, thoughts). With over 50,000 people worldwide, when attention rests in the hub, common reports</p>
<p>include dissolving of separate self and time, profound connection, love, and a sense of infinity.</p>
<p>Physics offers a helpful map. In the Newtonian macro world, the second law of thermodynamics yields an arrow of time.</p>
<p>In the quantum micro realm, equations need no “t”—it’s timeless. The hub experience seems to align with this timeless</p>
<p>domain. The 2022 Nobel Prize recognized quantum entanglement’s non-locality; spatial separation doesn’t impede</p>
<p>relations there. This frames why contemplatives, psychedelics, and wheel practice can yield unitary, timeless love.</p>
<p>One story: a parliamentarian did the wheel, then told me, “I’ve never felt so much love.” He hadn’t shared in the group</p>
<p>because, he said, “If I said ‘love,’ they’d think I was weak.” I asked whether he leaves love out when crafting laws.</p>
<p>He ran to his colleagues. If leaders dismiss love as weakness, we’re in trouble. Joanna Macy calls for a “great turning”</p>
<p>from business-as-usual—the solo self chasing material acquisition—toward a quantum change in consciousness. mWe doesn’t</p>
<p>erase the individual; it integrates me with we.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That coheres with my classroom experience of mind’s porosity and collective fields. Individual minds</p>
<p>cohere into fields; courses generate fields over years—what we might call morphogenetic fields. Without planning it,</p>
<p>I began filling lectures with spontaneous examples that matched students’ current struggles. As my practice deepened,</p>
<p>access to the class field deepened—zeroing in on wounds and blocks. I started teaching “quantumly,” taking</p>
<p>responsibility for mind-to-mind influence even before class convened and learning to catalyze and harvest collective</p>
<p>intelligence—drawing on World Café methods and inviting written reflection. <em>The Living Classroom</em> includes student</p>
<p>essays; psychedelics stay offstage there because the core is consciousness itself.</p>
<p><strong>BERNARD BITEMAN:</strong> In therapy and in dance I also sense relational fields—little units of togetherness. There’s a</p>
<p>responsibility in what we think and feel inside those fields. Dan?</p>
<p><strong>DAN SIEGEL:</strong> Exactly. With colleagues at MIT like Peter Senge and Otto Scharmer, we study generative social fields.</p>
<p>We identify teachers who reliably evoke them; they can’t articulate “how,” so we film and analyze. Michael Faraday was</p>
<p>mocked for invisible electromagnetic fields; now our world runs on them. As my friend the poet John O’Donohue said,</p>
<p>a mystic believes in the reality of the invisible. Science should too.</p>
<p>Entanglement may explain specific relational sensing—“I knew at the moment my loved one, 10,000 miles away, was ill.”</p>
<p>It isn’t spooky “faster-than-light” travel; in the quantum domain, separation doesn’t function the same way. Karen</p>
<p>O’Brien’s <em>You Matter More Than You Think</em> carefully applies quantum insights to social change. We can honor linear</p>
<p>macro realities—stop at red lights—and also live from universal, timeless awareness.</p>
<p>Business-as-usual arises from the solo self: “I’m just a body; meaning comes from things.” It fuels acquisition, factory</p>
<p>pollution, ads that tell you to buy more, and planetary damage. A quantum shift in identity liberates us from that</p>
<p>lethal lie. mWe integrates me and we, allowing actions that serve the living whole.</p>
<p><strong>BERNARD BITEMAN:</strong> Coincidences are daily reminders that mind and environment interweave. A song I sang matched a</p>
<p>truck’s tone across the river—a playful joining of “inside” and “outside.” Dan, please clarify interconnected versus</p>
<p>intra-connected.</p>
<p><strong>DAN SIEGEL:</strong> On a systems retreat with John P. Milton’s Way of Nature, after a three-day solo in the forest, my own</p>
<p>experience wasn’t “between me and the forest” (inter). It was “within the whole”—I was creek, tree, sky, and this body.</p>
<p>I tried to type “intraconnected”; the word processor kept “correcting” it. We lacked a term for subjective experience,</p>
<p>agency, and perspective of the whole. So I wrote <em>IntraConnected</em>. Practically, across the lifespan, modern culture</p>
<p>overbuilds a noun-like separate self. The invitation is to integrate inner (me), inter (we), into intra (mWe)—identity</p>
<p>as the integrated whole.</p>
<p><strong>BERNARD BITEMAN:</strong> I like moving from intra to inter—being the whole and also the part in relationship.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The ancient spiritual message now meets scientific voice. The finite ego is a functional, limited self,</p>
<p>not ultimate. As the Buddha saw, no fixed self exists anywhere. In deep transparency, life’s wholeness dissolves our</p>
<p>beginnings and endings into communion. If we stabilize and culture this experience, we gain a foundation for a new</p>
<p>planetary culture.</p>
<p>I suspect the intensifying global crisis compresses our collective psyche. Extinction pressure drives evolution. We</p>
<p>must birth a more inclusive identity—what I’ve called the diamond soul: a refined individuality, transparent to the</p>
<p>field, in continuous feedback with it. The faster we move, the fewer children suffer. Environmental science suggests</p>
<p>decades of difficulty, but this ordeal releases something splendid in the human heart. Same divine nature, higher</p>
<p>expression.</p>
<p><strong>BERNARD BITEMAN:</strong> As we close, I see our shared mission: help people oscillate from “just me” to me-with-others and</p>
<p>me-as-Gaia—so they can feel the love already here. Final words?</p>
<p><strong>DAN SIEGEL:</strong> Cultural evolution is real, and everyone can lead pervasively—one person, relationship, and</p>
<p>conversation at a time. As Margaret Mead said, never doubt a small group can change the world; it’s the only thing that</p>
<p>ever has. Grounded in indigenous wisdom, contemplative practice, and science, we can shift identity from solo self to</p>
<p>mWe. The question isn’t can we—we can. The question is will we. We will, because we must.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I agree. The crisis will hyper-stimulate humanity’s collective field, pushing it far from equilibrium</p>
<p>into nonlinear dynamics. Chaos theory suggests bifurcations where small perturbations can shift outcomes. New forms can</p>
<p>emerge—latent capacities crystallizing from depth. That magnifies each person’s influence as crisis intensifies. Our</p>
<p>choices matter more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>BERNARD BITEMAN:</strong> May those listening join us in facilitating intra-connection that is also inter-connection and a</p>
<p>healthy me. Dan, Chris—thank you. We can do this.</p>

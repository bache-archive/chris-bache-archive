<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In this Vancouver IONS Community Group session, CHRIS BACHE presents a concise tour of empirical</p>
<p>evidence for reincarnation, beginning with Ian Stevenson’s fieldwork on children who remember prior</p>
<p>lives, characteristic patterns in those cases, and mainstream medical journal responses. He reviews key</p>
<p>critiques, notably Paul Edwards’ objections, and Robert Almeder’s philosophical rebuttals. Bache then</p>
<p>surveys additional literatures: journalistic audits (Tom Shroder), contemporary research continuations</p>
<p>(Jim Tucker), regression therapy (Roger Woolger, Winafred Lucas, Carol Bowman), and between-lives</p>
<p>case studies (Michael Newton). He closes the talk by noting what remains unknown—the “physics” of</p>
<p>rebirth and mind–brain relations—and cautions against overgeneralizing from atypical child cases.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A explores species-level reincarnation and purification, karma versus growth, aging and the</p>
<p>fear of death, and whether incarnation extends beyond Earth. Bache frames humanity’s emergence of a</p>
<p>“diamond soul” consciousness as a long, collective birth process already well underway.</p>
<h1>Part 1</h1>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> Welcome, everyone. This is the Vancouver IONS Community Group, and I’m delighted to welcome</p>
<p>back Chris Bache, PhD, to explore another area of his work, which he wrote about in *Life Cycles: A Study</p>
<p>of Reincarnation*. Reincarnation evokes all kinds of responses—belief, disbelief, and curiosity. Based on</p>
<p>my own experience, I’m in the believer camp. Many of you have read Chris’s books and appreciated the</p>
<p>depth of his work.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> Chris is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown</p>
<p>State University, adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an Emeritus Fellow at the</p>
<p>Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the board of Grof® Legacy Training. He’s the author of four books:</p>
<p><em>Life Cycles</em> on reincarnation; <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> on psychedelic philosophy and collective</p>
<p>consciousness; <em>The Living Classroom</em> on collective fields of consciousness in teaching; and *LSD and the</p>
<p>Mind of the Universe*, the story of his 20-year journey with high-dose LSD. He lives in Weaverville, North</p>
<p>Carolina, with his wife, Christina Hardy, an astrologer and past-life therapist. Chris, thank you for being here.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Hi, everybody. It’s great to see you, and thank you for your warm greetings. I hope we</p>
<p>have some fun today.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> A quick update you might enjoy. In 2008 I published <em>The Living Classroom</em> without</p>
<p>mentioning psychedelics. SUNY Press is bringing out a new edition—ebook now, hardback coming, and</p>
<p>paperback later. This time they let me tell the full story: I was a university professor taking large</p>
<p>therapeutic doses of LSD, and here is what unfolded with my students, and the field theory of classrooms</p>
<p>that emerged. It’s a joy to stitch together the two halves of my life that had to be separated.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Before publishing on psychedelics, I tackled a more fundamental question that divides</p>
<p>world philosophies: reincarnation. If this is our only life, one worldview follows; if we live many lives, a</p>
<p>different worldview opens. After graduate school I discovered an astonishing empirical literature that takes</p>
<p>reincarnation seriously—none of which had been covered in my courses. Ian Stevenson at the University of</p>
<p>Virginia persuaded me we were looking at a fact of nature. I had to erase my intellectual blackboard and</p>
<p>start over. If reincarnation is real, we inhabit a very different universe than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Evolution moves group learning forward across generations. At some stage individuality</p>
<p>matures and nature finds a way to carry <em>personal</em> learning forward—cascading accumulations of knowledge,</p>
<p>wisdom, and skill. On my first sabbatical I wrote <em>Life Cycles</em>. It opens with a chapter on the evidence and</p>
<p>then explores implications for family, relationships, and larger patterns.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I once gave a compact, 35-minute lecture assembling the scientific evidence. I can’t do it</p>
<p>better extemporaneously, so I’ll walk you through that material now, then we’ll have plenty of time for Q&amp;A.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The most important philosophical question is whether we survive bodily death. The next is</p>
<p>whether we live once or many times. It hinges on time. As a teacher, if I give a quiz, I expect one level of</p>
<p>performance; an hour exam, more; a take-home paper, more still. If the universe has a purpose, we must</p>
<p>measure it against the time available to fulfill it. If we live once, the scope is limited. If we live a hundred,</p>
<p>a thousand, or ten thousand lives—if our involvement is open-ended—our relationship with existence and</p>
<p>our sense of purpose change fundamentally.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> For the last 4,000 years many religions have tended to devalue physical existence: achieve</p>
<p>enlightenment or salvation and <em>leave</em>—escape samsara. That leaves the purpose of the universe strangely</p>
<p>unanswered. But if we return many times, a different story unfolds—one we’re only beginning to glimpse,</p>
<p>just as we’ve only recently grasped the true breadth and age of the cosmos.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Evidence. The book that changed my life was Ian Stevenson’s *Twenty Cases Suggestive</p>
<p>of Reincarnation*. Stevenson—Carlson Professor at UVA—ultimately wrote eleven books, including the</p>
<p>multi-volume <em>Cases of the Reincarnation Type</em>, <em>Unlearned Language</em> (children speaking languages not</p>
<p>heard in their environment), and his magnum opus, <em>Reincarnation and Biology</em> (two volumes, ~2,000 pages)</p>
<p>documenting 187 cases where children’s birthmarks and defects correlate with the previous person’s</p>
<p>fatal wounds.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> What do these cases look like? Children—often between ages three and eight—recount</p>
<p>detailed memories of a recent life. They recognize people they’ve never met, navigate towns they’ve never</p>
<p>visited, display appropriate emotional responses to former spouses, children, or rivals, and recall the inner</p>
<p>architecture of homes. In one case a child led family members to a hidden will beneath a kitchen floorboard.</p>
<p>Patterns emerge: average intermission about 2.5 years; average geographical separation about 50 miles;</p>
<p>memories fade as schooling and puberty advance.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Why do some children remember what most of us forget? Stevenson hypothesized—cautiously—</p>
<p>that traumatic, sudden, or unfinished deaths may compress the interval and increase proximity, “pulling” a</p>
<p>return and preserving memory traces. About 60% of cases involve violent death; the rest involve abrupt</p>
<p>endings or strong unfinished business.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> How did mainstream medicine respond? <em>JAMA</em> wrote that Stevenson had “painstakingly</p>
<p>and unemotionally collected” detailed cases whose evidence is hard to explain otherwise. The *Journal of</p>
<p>Nervous and Mental Disease* devoted an entire issue to his work and editorialized that his methods and</p>
<p>reasoning conformed to the canons of rational inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The pushback came, too. Philosopher Paul Edwards’ <em>Reincarnation: A Critical Examination</em></p>
<p>accused Stevenson of methodological laxity and implied fraud. More fundamentally, Edwards argued that</p>
<p>accepting reincarnation would “crucify” secular understanding, since it seems to entail collateral assumptions:</p>
<p>that materialism is false, mind isn’t reducible to brain, identity exceeds personality, there is a non-spacetime</p>
<p>domain, death is illusory, and life may have a deeper logic. He deemed these “surely fantastic.”</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Philosopher Robert Almeder analyzed the exchange and showed that Edwards largely begged</p>
<p>the question—assuming precisely what’s in dispute, namely that consciousness cannot exist independent of</p>
<p>the brain. If an argument’s premises are met by recalcitrant data and you can’t refute it, refusing assent is</p>
<p>irrational. In short: Edwards didn’t defeat Stevenson; he refused to engage the data on their own terms.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Journalistic audit: Tom Shroder’s <em>Old Souls</em>—Shroder, a Pulitzer-level reporter and editor</p>
<p>at <em>The Washington Post</em>, shadowed Stevenson in the field and concluded the cases and methods were</p>
<p>compelling.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Continuation at UVA: Jim Tucker’s <em>Life Before Life</em> and <em>Return to Life</em> present accessible</p>
<p>analyses that address alternative hypotheses (e.g., fraud, suggestion, cryptomnesia, ESP) and show why</p>
<p>they don’t fit the data as well as reincarnation.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Beyond spontaneous recall is evoked memory: regression therapy and related techniques.</p>
<p>Roger Woolger’s <em>Other Lives, Other Selves</em> is a thoughtful, clinically grounded treatment; Winafred</p>
<p>Lucas’s two-volume <em>Regression Therapy: A Handbook for Professionals</em> collected pioneering clinical work.</p>
<p>Carol Bowman’s <em>Children’s Past Lives</em> and <em>Return from Heaven</em> arose from helping her own child and then</p>
<p>many families navigate spontaneous traumatic recall and intra-family return claims.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Michael Newton’s between-lives work—<em>Journey of Souls</em> and <em>Destiny of Souls</em>—found</p>
<p>that in deep hypnosis many clients remember not only prior incarnations but the structured inter-life: mentors,</p>
<p>learning groups, councils, life reviews, and carefully chosen incarnational plans made with collaborators.</p>
<p>Across backgrounds—fundamentalist, atheist, secular—reports converged on a coherent, educative order.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Two further public cases: Robert Snow, commander of homicide in Indianapolis, reluctantly</p>
<p>followed the evidence from an unexpected regression and tracked down <em>Carroll Beckwith</em>—documenting</p>
<p>striking correspondences in <em>Looking for Carroll Beckwith</em>. Bruce and Andrea Leininger’s <em>Soul Survivor</em></p>
<p>traces their son James’s WWII pilot memories from nightmares to meeting squadron members who validated</p>
<p>specifics, moving a skeptical father to conclude reincarnation best fit the facts.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> What we don’t know: the “physics” of rebirth—what the soul is, how it interfaces with</p>
<p>genetics and neurobiology, how learning encodes and is carried forward. We won’t get far while reducing</p>
<p>mind to brain. A post-materialist, multi-dimensional cosmology is needed.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> A paradox: Stevenson’s strongest cases show the <em>tightest</em> continuity—short intervals,</p>
<p>close geography, vivid memory—liberating our thinking and, ironically, constricting it if we assume they’re</p>
<p>typical. Most intermissions are probably longer and more varied. To fill in the canvas we need additional</p>
<p>bodies of data—between-lives reports, contemplative and psychedelic research—alongside child cases.</p>
<p>That’s where a larger vision of our life cycle comes into view.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> Wonderful—thank you, Chris. Let’s open it up for questions. Please use the “raise hand” and</p>
<p>we’ll call on you.</p>
<p><strong>VICTORIA:</strong> That was lovely. You answered one of my questions about how your view has evolved, but</p>
<p>two remain. First, you speak of species-level reincarnation—given our current situation, could you say</p>
<p>more? Second, what do you mean by “purification” and “detoxification” in *LSD and the Mind of the</p>
<p>Universe*—individually and collectively?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I began my psychedelic work expecting personal transformation, maybe personal</p>
<p>enlightenment. The method dissolved me so deeply into collective consciousness that species-level dynamics</p>
<p>activated. In one late experience, in deep space, I felt Earth’s pulse as a cadence of reincarnation—roughly</p>
<p>centennial. Humanity appeared as cells in a superorganism evolving through individual life-tasks. It was</p>
<p>magnificent—and it underscored that what we think is private is always networked.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Purification shows up personally and collectively. Mystical opening churns the psyche,</p>
<p>bringing distortions to the surface to be seen, felt, and released; then deeper communion becomes possible.</p>
<p>Species-history stores unprocessed wounds—war, plague, childbirth deaths, ungrieved losses—in collective</p>
<p>memory. As we grow into wider identity, this material surfaces for metabolizing. Exponential growth</p>
<p>requires exponential purification. It’s challenging, but it’s how complex systems evolve.</p>
<p><strong>VICTORIA:</strong> It brings up so much emotion. It feels like patriarchy needs to be released—huge! And what</p>
<p>does that mean in day-to-day terms?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’ll risk a political toe-stub. We recently faced a choice between very different leadership</p>
<p>archetypes. Collectively we chose nostalgia and retrenchment. That will hurt. Whether faster worsening is</p>
<p>ultimately clarifying, I don’t know. Reincarnation helps me drop judgment: everyone is at their developmental</p>
<p>level, on their assignment. My focus is to do the best I can, with those who see what I see. In nonlinear,</p>
<p>energized systems, small inputs leverage big shifts—the butterfly effect. As the field heats up, individual</p>
<p>impact increases.</p>
<p><strong>JAN:</strong> I loved the talk. I’m writing a memoir in three parts and trying to do it without blame. I want to</p>
<p>make a difference with my writing, but the world feels chaotic. How do I hold my focus? I’m 83 and</p>
<p>conscious of time.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The writer’s life is a mountain: close the door, open the windows, hold the line. *LSD and</p>
<p>the Mind of the Universe* took me five years at the keyboard and twenty to live. Trust your calling. Go deep.</p>
<p>Offer your best, then let it go without attachment to outcomes. High intention; no clinging to results. Legacy</p>
<p>work matters—especially now.</p>
<p><strong>JAN:</strong> Thank you. Reading <em>Life Cycles</em> earlier might have changed my life, but perhaps I did what I needed</p>
<p>to do to move on.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The pressure cooker is on—and it can catalyze remarkable work.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER:</strong> Thank you for the presentation. As a child I was taught sin and debt; later, karma and</p>
<p>debt. Is reincarnation bound to karma? And I’ve heard karma is lessening—are we paying it off?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Cause and effect pervades physical and spiritual life, but our framing has been too narrow.</p>
<p>If you read only regression therapy, you might conclude life is mostly about fixing what’s broken. But most</p>
<p>souls <em>pass</em> their karmic tests. We carry forward not just liabilities but assets—skills, relationships,</p>
<p>virtues. People don’t visit therapists to celebrate victories, so the literature can skew negative.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Religions of the axial age discovered depth states and naturally longed to <em>stay there</em>—</p>
<p>to leave here. But as we grasp the immensity of “here,” it makes sense that the task is to <em>incarnate</em> spirit,</p>
<p>to bring heaven into body and culture. I see the ego—guardian of a single lifetime—giving birth to the soul</p>
<p>that integrates <em>all</em> lifetimes into a fused singularity: the “diamond soul.” That is a different magnitude of</p>
<p>mind—a 100,000-year consciousness. To arrive, we must sweat out divisions—race, nation, class, creed.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In crisis our hearts are broken open. This is a multigenerational task. And when grace</p>
<p>touches us, the Infinite can dissolve karmic knots swiftly. Learn what needs learning; release the rest. As</p>
<p>Robert Monroe glimpsed in a far future, the “bardo” thins as embodiment becomes translucent to diamond</p>
<p>light. As we process our backlog—individually and collectively—transparency increases. With clear access,</p>
<p>no technical or social problem is beyond solution.</p>
<p><strong>JANINE:</strong> Thank you so much. One person’s experience is another’s “woo-woo.” I’ve had a soul retrieval</p>
<p>that shifted me in two days from overwhelmed to expansive joy—things can happen fast. Also, have you</p>
<p>looked at unified-field work like Nassim Haramein’s?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Your soul-retrieval example maps beautifully: retrieving alienated parts and welcoming</p>
<p>them home mirrors our historical process of retrieving our collective soul. As for physics, I’m happily retired</p>
<p>from keeping up with every thread, but yes—Akashic-field models, field theories, and complexity science</p>
<p>offer fertile ground for bridges.</p>
<p><strong>NORMA:</strong> I’m studying getting old. I’m losing identity. Each decade I’m a different person. Now I feel like</p>
<p>I’m becoming “people-less.” Dust to dust. This actually excites me.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I resonate. At 75 my skin and bones feel looser; memories loosen too, and egoless spaces</p>
<p>are easier to enter. At the end there’s a great release—light to light. I’ve told my children since they were</p>
<p>small: it’s a great life, and at the end you get to die. Death is graduation, coming home. If I could give one</p>
<p>gift, it would be freedom from the fear of death. Birth is when the hard work begins; death is fulfillment.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> A question I often hear: is reincarnation strictly human on Earth, or broader in the cosmos?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My work focused on human consciousness because we’re the greatest current threat to</p>
<p>Earth’s life. Cultures that accept rebirth generally place its beginnings before the human stage—somewhere</p>
<p>as individuality emerges from collective fields in higher animals. Once you reach a threshold, there’s little</p>
<p>point “going back,” except perhaps by special arrangement—the calculus/algebra analogy. As for other</p>
<p>worlds: why not? If evolution operates elsewhere, incarnation likely does too. There are therapists who help</p>
<p>clients integrate memories of non-terrestrial lifetimes.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> Beautiful. Any final thoughts before we close?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Reincarnation doesn’t end questions; it begins richer ones. It frees us from the tyranny of</p>
<p>short time. Think in 10,000-year increments. Develop every latent talent. What’s emerging is a luminous,</p>
<p>embodied consciousness—green world merging with light world—an awakened humanity born into history.</p>
<p>When the child arrives, we’ll say it was worth it. And women must lead more fully now; when half of us</p>
<p>shows up wholly, all of us are stronger. Most of the long labor is done. We’re in the last stretch of waking.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> Thank you, Chris. And thanks to everyone for being here. <em>[laughter, goodbyes]</em></p></body></html>

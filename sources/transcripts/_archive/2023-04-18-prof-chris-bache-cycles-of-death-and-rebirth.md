In this short clip from the Scientific & Medical Network, Chris Bache distills a core lesson from his

high-dose LSD research: spiritual awakening unfolds through repeated cycles of death and rebirth.

Using a simple diagram, he contrasts egoic, time-space consciousness (beneath the line) with

transpersonal reality (above it). The first crossing—commonly called “ego death”—shatters personal

identity and initiates entry into spiritual domains. Pressing further, he says, requires passing through

additional gates at the psychic, subtle, and causal levels (in Stanislav Grof’s terms). At each threshold

one must relinquish everything previously attained to stabilize in a wider field of awareness. Bache

stresses he is not promoting a fixed cosmological map; rather, he emphasizes the recurring demand

for radical surrender as deeper strata of consciousness open.

**CHRIS BACHE:** When one works with very high doses of LSD, one goes through a series of

death–rebirth experiences. In this image, the drop at the center beneath the line represents our egoic

consciousness—our private consciousness. Everything above the line represents spiritual reality,

transpersonal consciousness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The first death–rebirth experience takes place at the interface of our time–space

consciousness and the beginnings of spiritual consciousness, and it is usually referred to as ego death.

It is the complete destruction of our personal time–space identity and the beginning of an opening

into spiritual reality.

**CHRIS BACHE:** If we continue this process—if we press deeper and deeper into spiritual reality—we

go through more deaths, more cycles of death and rebirth, at the psychic, subtle, and causal levels of

consciousness, to use terms that Stan uses. I have no vested interest in a particular cosmological map

that delineates the various strata of transpersonal consciousness. I am simply making the point that as

you go into deeper levels of consciousness you reach certain gateways, and at these gateways you must

give up everything—everything you have known up to this point in your journey—in order to enter

the new fields of consciousness that are beginning to open to you.

# Key themes

- Repeated death–rebirth cycles beyond initial ego death

- Diagrammatic contrast of egoic vs. transpersonal consciousness

- Ego death as the first gateway into spiritual reality

- Deeper initiations at psychic, subtle, and causal levels (Grof’s terms)

- Radical surrender required at successive thresholds

- Caution against rigid cosmological mapping

- Progressive stabilization in wider fields of awareness

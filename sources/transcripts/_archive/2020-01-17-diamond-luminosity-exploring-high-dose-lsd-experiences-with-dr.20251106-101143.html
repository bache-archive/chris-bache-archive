<h1>Diamond Luminosity — Exploring High-Dose LSD Experiences with Dr. Chris Bache</h1>
<p><em><em>Joe Moore: ** Hello, everybody. Welcome back to Psychedelics Today. Today on the show, we have Chris Bache, a retired professor and Professor Emeritus at Youngstown State University and author of the recent book </em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. We're also going to be doing a giveaway, so stay tuned for that. Chris, thanks for joining us.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Glad to be here, guys.</p>
<p>**Joe Moore: ** I had been talking about you a couple of years ago when I found out about your long-term project, well before the book was even with a publisher. I was really excited by the idea, but then I totally forgot about it until we got connected again through the publisher. Now, I'm very excited to record with you because this is quite the project you've undertaken, and you have some very unique insights to share. How do you like to start this story? How did psychedelics first come onto your radar?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I had just finished graduate school. I was publishing a few articles from my dissertation and looking for where to take my research. I was a brand-new university professor when I encountered the work of Stan Grof, and that really snapped my head to attention. I didn’t have a psychedelic history. Finishing graduate school in religious studies, I was a deeply convinced atheistically inclined agnostic. But when I read Stan's work, a light bulb went off inside me, and I said, "This is important—not just to psychology but also to philosophy and religion, which was my training." I wanted to get involved, but psychedelics had been made illegal. So, I split my life. In my ordinary day job, I continued to function as a professor of Religious Studies, teaching conventional courses while beginning a 20-year journey with LSD, following Stan Grof's paradigm and eventually pushing its limits much farther than I appreciated at the time. </p>
<p>I kept careful records and notes, trying to make the engagement as clean and productive as possible, knowing that I would eventually share my experiences and insights with a broader audience. After I retired, that time finally came.</p>
<p>**Joe Moore: ** Perfect. Did you have any previous spontaneous mystical experiences before that that clued you into how important these practices could be?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I've always been envious of people who have had those experiences. At 12 years old, I had my first spontaneous mystical experience, but that’s not how it was for me. I was always deeply locked into my body and physical experience. I was educated in Western religious thought and later in Eastern thought, but I had no background in psychedelics. In many ways, I’m the last person you would expect to write a book on deep psychedelic states of consciousness. I grew up in Mississippi and got a degree in theology from the University of Notre Dame before going on to graduate school. This wasn’t part of my background at all.</p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** I’m curious, how did you stumble across Stan's work without any prior exposure to psychedelics?</p>
<p><em><em>Chris Bache: ** I was reading widely in different areas, especially in emerging transpersonal psychology. One individual whose work I encountered my first year out was Ian Stevenson, whose research at the University of Virginia convinced me that reincarnation is a simple fact of life. That was a jolt because it hadn’t been part of my education. Then I encountered Stan's work; he had just published </em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em> two years prior, and that was the book that really shifted my perspective. Ian provided empirical evidence suggesting there must be dimensions of reality beyond the physical. Stan, on the other hand, gave me the methodology to explore that reality, so I just decided to go for it.</p>
<p>**Joe Moore: ** What did the protocol look like for you? It seems to echo the work being done at Hopkins and by MAPS now. Was it any different in your perspective?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** No, I think it's pretty much conventional in that respect. You always work in complete isolation and have a sitter, along with a carefully curated playlist of music. The difference for me was that after three medium-dose LSD sessions, I shifted to very high doses—500 to 600 micrograms. Initially, I did it for efficiency; it was hard to carve out time in a dual-career marriage for a session day. I wanted to make the most out of each experience. I also thought that higher doses would get me to my early goal of enlightenment faster since I could tackle my karma in bigger bites. Ultimately, that project dissolved along the way. The whole notion of a personal spiritual journey fell away. </p>
<p>The difference is in the amount of the psychedelic used, which is very different from psilocybin or MDMA. Working with high doses changed the trajectory of the experience. I also began to curate a much more aggressive playlist with music, opting for indigenous music over classical Western music, which allowed for a different experience. Otherwise, the methodology was quite similar to current therapeutic approaches to psychedelics.</p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** That’s interesting. I’m curious why the music changed over time.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I discovered some indigenous chanting music and incorporated it into my next session. It had such a profound impact on the intensity of the experience. It rattled my cage much more aggressively than even the classical music I had used. I liked the effect because it was more disorienting and provided stronger support for going deeper into consciousness. So, I began to cultivate that type of music.</p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** From your perspective, how important is music during high-dose psychedelic experiences or therapy?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I think it’s very important. I’ve done sessions without music after many years, and I’ve had psilocybin sessions both with and without music. However, when working with a strong psychedelic like LSD at such high doses—which I don’t recommend, by the way—I found that music has a tremendously powerful effect, perhaps amplifying the experience by five to ten times compared to doing it without music. For example, I started using music only in my fourth session, and the jump in that session was enormous. So, I believe it’s very important.</p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** It’s a topic that keeps coming up within the psychedelic community, especially when discussing playlists for therapy. I recently recorded an episode with someone who composes music based on their experiences. The music piece is just really fascinating and plays a huge role, you know, in breathwork as well.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, and Helen Bonny’s early work plotting the various stages of an LSD journey and the characteristics of music that support each of those stages is also significant. </p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** Where did this idea of engaging in high-dose sessions come from? Did you start with a certain number of sessions in mind, or did you just dive in and see where it led?</p>
<p><em><em>Chris Bache: ** I did not have any specific trajectory or goal. I was aware of the range of experiences Stan described in </em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>. With my grounding in Western philosophical and theological thought, I recognized the significance of these states of consciousness he was describing. I believed that the most important contributions in my discipline would arise from personal experience rather than purely theoretical bases. So, I knew that to achieve that depth of understanding, I simply had to engage in my work, without any idea of how long it would take.</p>
<p>In the early years, I thought that going through ego death would grant me unrestricted access to the deep consciousness of existence. What I found, however, is that it isn’t merely a matter of shattering the ego; the universe has many layers. While it's all holographically integrated, engaging with the universe systematically and with a carefully defined methodology allows it to take you in gradually—layer by layer. As you move into each new layer, stabilizing your consciousness within it, if you continue to push, you will encounter additional death and rebirth processes distinct from mere ego death. This results in a series of explorations through progressively deeper levels of consciousness, which is how it unfolded for me. </p>
<p>I can’t speak for others or other substances, but that’s what happened for me. I laid out the details in the book, where I started at the beginning and sought to describe and recognize the levels of consciousness I encountered, consolidating the story to convey it as efficiently as possible. Each chapter delves into different levels of consciousness or levels of engagement with the universe.</p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** How would you define that layer of consciousness? What do you mean by that? Sometimes, you hear in New Age circles about "ascending to 5D." How would you describe moving through those layers?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I adopted Stan’s working vocabulary from his books, differentiating between psychic levels, subtle levels, and causal levels. Consciousness differentiates into low and high within psychic, subtle, and causal realms. These classifications resonate with me. Of course, the universe has many layers beyond these approximations, and I don't have a vested interest in a specific model regarding the number of levels of consciousness. </p>
<p>Reflecting on my journey from 1979 to 1999, I identified four fundamental death and rebirth cycles, leading to different levels of consciousness. I discovered five levels: </p>
<ol>
<li>The personal mind, culminating in ego death, where you lose your time-space identity.</li>
<li>The collective mind, engaging with the species’ collective consciousness.</li>
<li>The archetypal mind, moving into higher subtle levels beyond collective consciousness.</li>
<li>The causal mind—a state of profound non-dual reality.</li>
<li>What I call diamond luminosity, marked by an ultra-clear dimension of light—a reality I found closest to the Buddhist concept of Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality that pre-exists the Big Bang.</li>
</ol>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** Stan even talks about that with his first LSD experience, right? The idea of a progression through levels?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Exactly. </p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** Considering the new psychedelic renaissance and therapy, how important do you think it is for therapists to understand these levels of consciousness when working with clients?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** For psychedelic therapists, it’s critical to understand that there are many levels of consciousness. As a therapist, you work at different levels. You don’t need to have deep familiarity with all levels to support clients in early stages, but it’s conventional wisdom that if you're guiding clients through non-ordinary states of consciousness, you should be personally familiar with those states. Otherwise, how can you stabilize the environment when someone is terrified of losing everything they know to be real? If you haven’t faced that yourself, how can you help someone else let go at those deep levels?</p>
<p>This presents challenges in training psychedelic therapists, particularly as we transition to a new legal landscape around these substances. The work you and others are doing is crucial in creating new possibilities. Personal experience in this area is vital.</p>
<p>**Joe Moore: ** It’s an interesting topic. There’s a debate about whether therapists truly need a personal experience with psychedelics or if theoretical knowledge is sufficient. </p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I think it is important to have a solid theoretical grounding. Reading deeply in transpersonal psychology and works like Stan Grof's provides an experiential database. However, without some personal exposure to these realities, therapists may operate at a disadvantage. Verbal understanding of what it means to navigate certain territories isn’t enough. Someone lacking firsthand experiences may make mistakes or draw misleading inferences from their intellectual understanding.</p>
<p>These experiences are complex. My journey spanned from 1979 to 1999, and I didn’t publish the book for another 20 years, partly due to legal complications—I had to retire from the university before I could do so. It took me years during and after my sessions to work out the complex phenomenology of these states of consciousness.</p>
<p>If a therapist serves as a guide, that implies an active role in directing the process, which isn’t the case for much of this work. Rather, they should be there as a stabilizing presence, helping someone navigate the edge of their understanding and letting go of everything they believe to be real and true. I don’t know how someone could do that without firsthand experience in those domains. The effectiveness of therapists or sitters will invariably be limited to their depth of experience.</p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** That’s fascinating to think about. It raises practical questions about seeing different therapists for different sessions. You never really know what will come up, right?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes. I think it’s good we’re proceeding slowly and methodically. Currently, we are using gentler psychedelics, and there’s no federal protocol advocating for the high levels of LSD that I used. It’s crucial to be methodical and judicious as we expand our understanding. In earlier years of psychedelic work, it became clear that healing personal unconsciousness is only the first step in a longer journey into the universe and deeper dimensions of consciousness. </p>
<p>These explorations can take you into realms that are difficult to describe. When you dissolve deeply, you can encounter realities beyond what you even dreamed possible. If you return repeatedly, what happens is that you acclimate and learn to stay conscious at levels you previously couldn’t. This pattern of development continues as you go deeper and deeper into consciousness. </p>
<p>**Joe Moore: ** I find that to be true. Are you familiar with Ken Wilber from Detroit?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** No, I’m not.</p>
<p>**Joe Moore: ** He's a strong proponent of high doses, but I sometimes struggle with his arguments. Your perspective seems quite sensible. How do we approach this?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I’m not a proponent of high doses. I completed this work, but my early high-dose work was limited to three sessions only, with terminally ill patients. I thought if it was safe three times, it could be done more often. However, what I found was that working systematically pushed me beyond challenges not discussed in earlier phases. I uncovered insights and faced obstacles arising from the intensity of those levels of consciousness. </p>
<p>In my experience, as I engaged with these deeper realities, I found that my students were being activated by my work, almost contagiously. Their consciousness would resonate with my own influence, leading to a natural ripple effect. I had to navigate and take care of the activations my students experienced, which inspired my later book, <em>Living Classroom</em>. It took years to understand the dynamic between my mind and theirs in the context of wider consciousness.</p>
<p>Thus, it’s not just about taking care of your body and emotions; it also involves understanding the larger collective impacts of your work on the people around you.</p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** It's super fascinating. I often ponder these ripples. In my own experiences and even in breathwork sessions, it seems that tapping into this interconnectedness happens frequently. Do you believe your presence and how you show up influences students, or is it more about some subtle realm connection when you enter these states?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I think it’s both. As my work changed me, my presence in the classroom evolved. The more compelling aspect is probably working at the subtle level. I noticed that when I lectured, I would sometimes draw a blank when searching for an example to illustrate a point. A seemingly random idea would come to me, and afterward, students would quietly approach me, mentioning how my chosen example mirrored their personal experiences that week. </p>
<p>This occurred frequently enough that I knew it had significance. The deeper I delved into my own work, the more my students were touched in significant areas of their lives where they needed healing. My personal confrontations with my blocks often seemed to resonate with their struggles. We were conscious that something unusual was unfolding; students enrolled not only for the knowledge but to experience the energy within the room.</p>
<p>I observed this resonance between our energies, combined with the emergence of group fields. As more students attended my courses over the years, a psychic field developed—one that wasn’t solely generated by their learning. The learning accelerated for subsequent students due to this collective immersive experience.</p>
<p>**Kyle Buller: ** That’s interesting, and the implications are profound. </p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Indeed. Once you release the atomistic view of psychology and embrace a quantum perspective, the interconnectedness becomes clearer. It's a deeper, more participatory cosmos, flowing and moving in ways that are coherent and comprehensible once you shift your metaphysical basis.</p>
<p>I'm curious about your thoughts on the integration of mushrooms with Ayahuasca. You mentioned that it appears to be more of a body medicine. Can you elaborate on the differences in your experiences between LSD and more plant-based psychedelics? It’s a topic we often discuss, particularly regarding LSD’s nature being more psychological compared to the spiritual essence found in substances like psilocybin. </p>
<p>Well, my perspective is inevitably shaped by my personal experiences, and I’m cautious about generalizing too much, given that psychedelics have a long history tied to human experience. Mushrooms, for example, have been utilized for thousands of years, and that historical context provides a certain field of human engagement. When you consume a substance like psilocybin, it's not just a chemical interaction; it’s also about how this substance affects you based, in part, on humanity's extensive history with it. The same applies to Ayahuasca. In contrast, with LSD, we don't have that depth of field. It's a relatively new substance, and I don’t think the distinction between organic and synthetic is particularly productive. </p>
<p>In the 60s and 70s, we had limited experience with LSD. From my perspective, LSD feels cleaner; it doesn't have that programmed quality. I'm not sure how it would differ if I had worked with lower doses. However, my journey with high doses has led me to operate beyond my personal psyche during the peak experiences. I've shared this in my book, noting that my personal story only appeared at the start and end of sessions while the essence of my experiences often transcended personal narrative. </p>
<p>With psilocybin, I don’t have the same detachment from my personal reality. I have limited experience with Ayahuasca, but it’s a powerful medicine providing extraordinary clarity at times. Overall, I perceive psilocybin as being less disruptive and less evocative than Ayahuasca, which can open depths that LSD journeys have not touched in my personal experience. Although psilocybin has been deeply meaningful, my LSD sessions have often reached cosmic levels of experience that I haven’t seen replicated in most literature surrounding psilocybin or Ayahuasca.</p>
<p>What were some of your experiences like in the last decade of your work? Can you share some significant themes that emerged?</p>
<p>That's a challenging inquiry due to the multitude of layers and stages involved. One consistent theme was the experience of time while delving into subtle levels of reality. For a year, I consistently perceived my entire life as simultaneously present in the immediate now. It was an overwhelming realization that provided insights into my old age—not in a theoretical sense, but as the distilled essence of my life manifesting at that moment. </p>
<p>This realization proved so profound that it was difficult to retain; it took multiple attempts to hold onto these experiences, which I describe in my chapter on deep time. Beyond that, I ventured into archetypal dimensions, experiencing vast, colossal beings that exceeded the scope of comprehension. These entities seemed responsible for the orchestration of reality, a dynamic I refer to as deep time—different magnitudes of time experienced within a broader framework.</p>
<p>Many overarching themes emerged in my explorations concerning the trajectory of humanity, particularly in the context of the global sustainability crisis. I wrote about the emerging birth of a future human, diving deeply into what is aspiring to manifest historically. </p>
<p>Eventually, I reached experiences of causal oneness and emptiness—the primal void behind existence. Experiencing the inherent oneness of life often felt like an embodiment of love, the emotional counterpart to this oneness. After years, I encountered a state of consciousness I call diamond luminosity. Once I touched this state, I was less inclined to explore other dimensions, as returning to that clarity became my primary focus. It occupied the last five years of my journey, where even amidst the challenges of detoxification, that singular experience remained my goal.</p>
<p>It sounds like this process has so many layers. </p>
<p>Indeed, it’s quite intricate. Now that the book is out, readers can explore these themes in detail rather than rely solely on my oral account, and I aimed to convey the narrative clearly without excessive philosophical baggage. </p>
<p>Is there a particular story from your research that stands out as a favorite?</p>
<p>Every phase of my journey was captivating, making it tough to pick a favorite. However, the diamond luminosity holds the deepest connection for me. One pivotal moment occurred during my 38th session when I felt all my past lives integrating into me. I experienced them as if they were wrapping around a spool, culminating in an explosion of diamond light from my chest—this ignited a significant shift in consciousness. </p>
<p>In my session, I gleaned insights into reincarnation's trajectory, realizing that it doesn't simply lead to gradual improvement in individual lives. Instead, there’s a deeper evolutionary purpose where we can awaken the totality of our consciousness within our current physical existence. I believe this is part of humanity’s broader intent—collectively evolving beyond egoic consciousness.</p>
<p>That resonates deeply. I’ve personally grappled with a fear of death, but your perspective—how do you view death in light of your experiences?</p>
<p>Letting go of the fear of death is vital. Most misconceptions about what happens post-death are misconceptions born from Hollywood narratives. In reality, we tend to return home, entering a deeper reality comprised of many layers. Personally, I don’t fear death; the experience of dying can be challenging, but the idea of being dead holds no fear for me. In fact, I look forward to it.</p>
<p>How do you connect with that notion?</p>
<p>That idea resonates deeply. At 16, I had a near-death experience, where I felt a blissful return home—an overwhelming sense of love and beauty. When faced with life-threatening injuries, instead of fear, there was acceptance and a desire to return to that oneness. Exploring psychedelics arose from this longing to replicate such profound experiences. </p>
<p>Yet, I found substance use often presents the opportunity to revisit that space. The deep integration has been where the true magic unfolds—how do we embody that here? </p>
<p>Time and space can be demanding, and the profound work lies within this realm. I sense that the collective consciousness is rapidly evolving, especially as we face significant challenges. History suggests that our world is fundamentally built on ego consciousness, leading to imbalance. </p>
<p>The current global crises appear to be the universe’s way of pushing us toward transformation. When engaging in this work, it often transcends individual experiences, becoming a cosmic exploration impacting our collective trajectory. Meanwhile, time seems to accelerate as if consciousness itself is pushing forward.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: So many of our technologies and social customs are dissolving right out from underneath us. The standards of truth are changing, and it's a confusing, dangerous, and hard time, but it’s also extraordinarily exciting. </p>
<p>Kyle Buller: Do you see psychedelics aiding in this?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely. The way psychedelics have re-emerged in our culture, particularly influenced by Central and South American traditions, is significant. LSD, often compared to the atom bomb since they were discovered at the same time, offers an exponential opportunity to explore dimensions of consciousness that previous generations typically had to spend lifetimes meditating to access. Now, people with even modest spiritual capacities can have temporary experiences of these realities. This demands a profound redrafting of our existential assumptions about how life works. We can engage with these dimensions of consciousness not just for recreational or healing purposes but systematically for education and deep transformation. We can work not only on our personal transformation but on behalf of the collective states of consciousness. </p>
<p>When I first read Stan Grof's work, I realized this would change everything. It’s a true before-and-after development—like the invention of the microscope for biology and the telescope for astronomy. Psychedelics increase the quantity of data we have access to, forcing a radical revision of our theoretical understanding. I believe they’ve come just in time, as we have very little left.</p>
<p>Joe Moore: I hate to end the podcast, but we're over an hour. I want to be respectful of your time and truly appreciate this enlightening episode. Can you tell us a little about where people can find your book and any upcoming audiobook?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: They can find the book on Amazon. I’m just finalizing the edits on the audiobook, which I’m hoping will be released through Inner Traditions. I will have a website up, hopefully by the beginning of the year. I’m overdue in revising it, but people will eventually be able to find me at chrisbache.com. Right now, you can access most of my written work and some recordings through academia.edu under my name. I’m not as active on social media as I should be; it’s hard to keep up.</p>
<p>Joe Moore: You only need to focus on one platform; being everywhere isn’t worth it.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Exactly. But what’s really exciting is that the book is finally out. It’s the clearest presentation of this material that I’ve been able to create. It took me five years to put it together. </p>
<p>Joe Moore: Thank you for all your work, and I really appreciate you joining us on the show today.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, guys. It’s been a real honor. I appreciate the work you’re doing. Keep it up—you’re social catalysts, and we need all the social catalysts we can get these days.</p>
<p>Kyle Buller: Thank you! We’ll keep plugging along.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In this powerful conversation hosted by Dr. Steve Thayer for Numinus Network’s <em>Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers</em> podcast, religious studies scholar Dr. Christopher Bache reflects on the profound insights gained through 73 high-dose LSD sessions undertaken over two decades. Initially intending to pursue personal transformation, Bache instead found himself plunged into realms of transpersonal consciousness, where he encountered the collective psyche, cosmic intelligence, and visions of humanity’s evolutionary future. He shares the disciplined protocol he followed, the risks of deep work, and how his own suffering enabled him to participate in the healing of the collective. Bache introduces the concept of the Diamond Soul — an emergent form of the future human being — and describes a coming global crisis as labor preceding the birth of a new species. This conversation is a wide-ranging exploration of psychedelic cosmology, reincarnation, karma, and service in an age of planetary transformation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>DR. STEVE THAYER</strong>:</p>
<p>Chris, thank you so much for joining us. It’s a pleasure to be here with you today.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>:</p>
<p>Thank you, Steve. It’s good to be here.</p>
<p>I’m a retired professor of religious studies. I taught at Youngstown State University for over 30 years and began a deep private practice of psychedelic work after encountering Stanislav Grof's research in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>I conducted 73 high-dose LSD sessions across 20 years, followed by 20 years of integration and reflection. This work wasn’t about healing or personal transformation — it became an extended dialogue with the universe and the deep psyche.</p>
<p><strong>DR. STEVE THAYER</strong>:</p>
<p>That’s extraordinary. Your book <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em> reads like a hero’s journey. But I’ve heard you say you don’t necessarily recommend others follow your protocol. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>:</p>
<p>Because it was an extremely demanding path. I followed Grof’s therapeutic protocol — eyeshades, music, a trusted sitter (my wife at the time, a clinical psychologist). I worked in private, with the same setting and dose each time — eventually reaching 500–600 micrograms, which is LSD’s body saturation point.</p>
<p>At first, I believed this was about clearing personal karma. I thought that with high doses, I could accelerate that purification. But that was naïve. Working at this depth, the personal quickly gives way to the collective, and then to something even vaster.</p>
<p>The work became about engaging the <strong>species mind</strong>, the collective unconscious, and eventually <strong>cosmic intelligence</strong>. Ego death was just the first of many deaths. These experiences shattered all my assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>DR. STEVE THAYER</strong>:</p>
<p>So it became cosmological, not just psychological or spiritual.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>:</p>
<p>Exactly. And I discovered there was no final destination. No “arrival.” I reached states of union with Divinity, experienced the fertile void, and communion with levels of reality I call <strong>Diamond Luminosity</strong> — but the universe kept unfolding. It’s an infinite journey.</p>
<p>If I were to do it again, I’d be gentler. Mix organic and synthetic psychedelics. Alternate low and high doses. Because the goal isn’t to get somewhere — it’s to let in as much of the universe’s love and intelligence as you can hold, then bring it back to life.</p>
<p><strong>DR. STEVE THAYER</strong>:</p>
<p>What about the risks of going straight into deep waters? Couldn’t someone bypass important foundational healing?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>:</p>
<p>Yes. Not everyone is wired for it. You need careful screening. I had a constitution that could expand and re-cohere easily. But others shouldn’t dive in so fast.</p>
<p>I spent my first 10 sessions — over two and a half years — in intense personal and perinatal work. Reliving birth, existential terror, ego dissolution. Healing continued throughout the journey — but curiously, some of my own deepest healing didn’t occur until much later.</p>
<p>I came to see that those wounds <strong>anchored</strong> me in the collective field. They allowed me to become a <strong>bridge</strong> through which species-level pain could pass and be transmuted.</p>
<p><strong>DR. STEVE THAYER</strong>:</p>
<p>That’s powerful — using your personal wounds in service of the collective. It seems like your work evolved from self to service.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>:</p>
<p>Yes. And that service was part of my soul’s contract, I believe. Many others are doing similar work now, whether they realize it or not.</p>
<p><strong>DR. STEVE THAYER</strong>:</p>
<p>Did your worldview change during this process? You’ve said you began as an agnostic.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>:</p>
<p>I had studied my way out of religion. The gods of the Axial Age seemed too small for the universe science was revealing.</p>
<p>But once you repeatedly experience realities beyond space-time — once you undergo <strong>death and rebirth again and again</strong> — you realize we are immersed in a <strong>field of intelligence</strong> that is guiding the process. I never met a personal deity or shamanic guide, but I encountered what I call the <strong>Mind of the Universe</strong> — vast, participatory, responsive.</p>
<p>It wasn’t theistic, but it was deeply <strong>spiritual</strong>. I avoid the word “God,” but the creative intelligence I experienced is unquestionably <strong>real</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>DR. STEVE THAYER</strong>:</p>
<p>So who are we in all this?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>:</p>
<p>We are not separate from the universe. We are its <strong>expression</strong>. Our bodies and minds arise from it. We’re <strong>fractal instantiations</strong> of its intelligence.</p>
<p>And when you go deep enough, you encounter the <strong>species mind</strong>, the <strong>planetary field</strong>, and beyond that, <strong>galactic awareness</strong>. Consciousness becomes a nested continuum.</p>
<p>We’re part of a learning system — and reincarnation is how that learning is folded forward.</p>
<p><strong>DR. STEVE THAYER</strong>:</p>
<p>Let’s talk about that. Do you believe we’ve existed across lifetimes?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>:</p>
<p>Yes. Reincarnation isn’t a belief — it’s a conclusion drawn from deep empirical experience.</p>
<p>Eventually, over many lives, something extraordinary happens. One day, your previous lives <strong>converge</strong>, and you awaken as something new. I call it the <strong>Diamond Soul</strong> — an integrated self, no longer fragmented across time.</p>
<p>In one session, I experienced all my lives fusing. There was a burst of Diamond Light from my chest. It changed everything. I realized we’re not here to escape incarnation — we’re here to <strong>complete</strong> it.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>This interview from <em>Inbodied Life</em>, hosted by psychotherapist Lauren Taus, features Chris Bache discussing
his two-decade journey of seventy-three high-dose LSD sessions and the insights presented in <em>LSD and the
Mind of the Universe</em>. Bache reflects on his transition from ego identity to soul identity, exploring levels
of consciousness ranging from the personal and collective to archetypal, causal, and diamond luminosity.
He describes the rigorous protocols he followed, his wife’s role as sitter, and the purgative and ecstatic
cycles of death and rebirth. Themes include reincarnation, the collective dark night, integration challenges,
and humanity’s awakening into a new form of being—the “diamond soul.” Bache also shares lessons of courage,
grounding, and purification, emphasizing compassion, service, and the importance of weaving these experiences
into daily life. The conversation blends therapeutic, philosophical, and visionary perspectives on psychedelics,
death, and human evolution.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> We can’t solve today’s problems at the level of ego. We either grow up or go extinct. Growing up means
maturing the soul, moving from ego identity to soul identity. The soul remembers its history—it’s been all races,
religions, rich and poor—and so its maturation brings compassion and generative freedom. That’s what we need to go forward.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> Welcome to <em>Inbodied Life</em>, the podcast. My name is Lauren Taus, and this show is a space for you to move
past the traffic of the mind and into the stillness of your heart. We meet pioneers, healers, and change-makers who offer
guides and maps for the inner journey. Today’s guest is Chris Bache, professor emeritus at Youngstown State, adjunct at
CIIS, emeritus fellow at IONS, and a council member of Grof Legacy Training. He’s the author of four books, including <em>LSD
and the Mind of the Universe</em>, based on his twenty-year, seventy-three session journey with LSD. Chris, thank you for
sharing your extraordinary experiences and wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’m happy to share. I know your work is therapeutic, and mine is different, but I’ll support your
conversation with what I have.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> Perfect. Can you tell me how you began exploring psychedelics?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In 1978, early in my university career, I encountered Ian Stevenson’s reincarnation research, which turned
my worldview upside down, and then Stanislav Grof, who gave me a method for exploring deep states. I wasn’t a clinician—I
was trained in philosophy of religion—but I wanted to explore the deep structure of consciousness and the mind of the
universe. Because psychedelics were illegal, I lived two lives: a public academic life and a private psychedelic life.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> You took seventy-three high-dose LSD journeys over twenty years. Why so high?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After three medium sessions, I worked at 500–600 micrograms. I don’t recommend it now; I’d be gentler and
more balanced. But I was managing intensity, pressed for time, and I found aptitude at that level. It took me very deep,
and I stayed there.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> What’s the difference between psycholytic and psychedelic therapy?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Psycholytic therapy is lower dose, 50–150 micrograms, working layer by layer through the unconscious.
Psychedelic therapy is high dose, originally used with cancer patients to induce a near-death experience and help them face
dying. I thought if three high-dose sessions could be done safely, more could too—and my work unfolded from there.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> Did you expect it to last twenty years?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Not at all. I worked four years, paused six, then did ten years intensely. About five sessions per year.
I followed where it led until it became clear it was time to stop.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> What questions guided you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Classical philosophical questions: What’s the structure of reality? Why is life as it is? What are the
rules? I approached the universe conscientiously, documenting and integrating sessions. It felt like an intelligence was
teaching me systematically.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> What levels of consciousness did you map?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Five levels: personal mind (ego death), collective species mind, archetypal mind, causal one-mind reality,
and, in my last years, diamond luminosity—the clear light of absolute reality.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> That sounds profoundly therapeutic.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Healing, yes, but at the soul level more than the personal. Mystical experiences of reincarnation and the
universe’s evolutionary dynamics quieted my existential hunger. It was deeply satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> You always had a sitter?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Always, for the high-dose series. My wife, a psychologist, sat for me, though she never took psychedelics
herself. It wasn’t her path; she was drawn to Vajrayana practice. But she supported me, and I joined her community for
meditative training.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> You mention violence in psychedelics.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The kriyas can be violent—purging stress physically and emotionally. But I learned that deepest deaths led
to deepest ecstasies. Death became my ally. Psychedelic death is purification, letting go at one level to enter deeper
reality.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> So you don’t fear death?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Not at all. I look forward to it. I’ve died many times in session and seen where I’m going. Dying is
graduation; birth is the hard work.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> What’s the point of all this?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Reincarnation is the fact of life. Through hundreds of lifetimes we learn and grow, and eventually all
our lives integrate into one consciousness—the diamond soul. At our core, Atman is Brahman. We are activating divine
capacities, learning literally how to create. In that sense, we are learning to be gods—modestly, but literally.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> Can you speak about transcending time and space?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It brings extraordinary freedom, Homecoming, remembering, peace beyond understanding. To dissolve into
light, to become light—it’s clarity, simultaneity, and infinite extension.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> How do you relate to historic suffering and oppression within this?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Reincarnation is collective as well as personal. The species is reincarnating and evolving. Much of my
work involved collective trauma, clearing the pain of history. Starting in session twenty-three, I was repeatedly shown
that humanity is entering a great awakening—a fundamental shift in the architecture of the collective psyche. Like mystics
face a dark night before union, humanity must face its divisions and purify. We are in labor: short, painful, intense,
leading to a new human—awakened, compassionate, expanded. Ego built this world; soul must build the next.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> Yes, it feels like a great purge, a collective birth.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Exactly. Which is why daily disciplines—yoga, meditation, therapeutic awareness—are vital. Poisonous
energies are moving through us; we must release them. Courage and grounding are essential: courage to face difficulty,
grounding to integrate insights into life.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> Integration is a challenge. Any strategies?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Use all your talents: write, speak, draw, make music, practice the teachings you’re given. Pace yourself.
Know when to digest rather than take more. Different people integrate differently—art, activism, reflection. The key is
turning insights into the living tissue of your life.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> You’ve said it took ten years to digest your twenty-year journey.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. I thought I could simply live off the gifts, but I felt a great loss of communion. It took a decade
to accept my ordinary life again. Silence also hampered integration. Writing <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em> and coming
out of the psychedelic closet was liberating. It allowed me to teach from these experiences.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> How do your children see this?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Reactions vary. Some embrace it, some stand aside, some are skeptical. It’s a range.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> What was the gift of such high doses?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s like compressing a month-long meditation retreat into five hours. You dissolve completely, become
other realities, then re-congeal. I seemed to have a makeup that could dissolve and return smoothly. But again, I’d advise
a more balanced regimen—mixing high and low doses, and balancing LSD with psilocybin or ayahuasca. Each breakthrough is a
step into higher energy, requiring transformation and acclimation to stabilize awareness at that level.</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> What story do you tell in your book?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Simply what happened. One person’s deep drill with one substance in one method. Toward the end the
universe asked me, “Let them see me as you have seen me.” So I told the truth of what I saw: a love affair with the
universe. Temporary, like an affair, but filled with intimacy. My name for that intelligence is “the Beloved.”</p>
<p><strong>LAUREN TAUS:</strong> Chris, my heart is exploding hearing this. Thank you for your love, your wisdom, and for sharing your
story with my community.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you. My hope is that my story supports others in theirs. We’re all in this together. Everything we
do reaches into the larger collective. It’s a joy to contribute.</p>

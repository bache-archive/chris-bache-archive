      <p>In this conversation, Chris Bache outlines the method and meaning of his</p>
<p>two-decade, high-dose LSD practice that informed *LSD and the Mind of the</p>
<p>Universe<em>—a journey he preferred to title </em>Diamonds From Heaven*. Beginning</p>
<p>with animistic assumptions about an ensouled cosmos and inspired by</p>
<p>Stanislav Grof’s framework, Bache describes carefully sitted, music-assisted</p>
<p>sessions that progressively dissolved personal identity and opened into</p>
<p>deeper, interactive layers of universal mind. He argues that psychedelics</p>
<p>amplify consciousness rather than supply content, leading from personal</p>
<p>healing to shared transpersonal territory. Key revelations include the</p>
<p>coherence of spiritual realities across traditions, reincarnation as an</p>
<p>evolutionary engine, and the emergence of the “Diamond Soul,” a fused</p>
<p>wholeness of many lifetimes. With Colin’s questions on time, Bache explores</p>
<p>nonlinear modalities and “multi-incarnation.” He frames our civilizational</p>
<p>crisis as a collective dark night birthing a more compassionate, embodied,</p>
<p>and perceptive human species.</p>
<p><em>[music]</em></p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> “Diamonds from Heaven”—your book was published as *LSD and the Mind</p>
<p>of the Universe*. Was that title the publisher’s?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. The publisher chose that title, but while writing I always</p>
<p>called it <em>Diamonds From Heaven</em>.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> Beautiful. I’ve been a fan of your books for years. Colin and I talk</p>
<p>about your work often—<em>Reincarnation</em> was wonderful, and then the next book,</p>
<p>and then the LSD book. Many here don’t know your research method. I’d describe</p>
<p>you as an explorer of the outer reaches of the cosmos, seeking the truth of</p>
<p>reality and what it means to be human. Could you start by describing your</p>
<p>method and what your work has been?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In the animistic community we share the sense that nature is</p>
<p>infused with consciousness—with mind and soul. We now know how vast the</p>
<p>physical universe is; the question becomes, how large and deep is the universe’s</p>
<p>mind?</p>
<p>Fresh out of graduate school in philosophy of religion in 1978, I encountered</p>
<p>Stanislav Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>. That book pivoted my life.</p>
<p>I saw his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but to</p>
<p>philosophy. He offered a way to safely and systematically explore the deepest</p>
<p>levels of consciousness, where answers to my philosophical questions lay.</p>
<p>In 1979 I began what became a 20-year journey with LSD—the substance Grof used.</p>
<p>If I were doing it today, I might use a more diversified medicine palette, but</p>
<p>I worked with LSD and chose very high doses for reasons too involved to detail</p>
<p>here. That choice profoundly affected depth and breadth. The field of</p>
<p>consciousness expanded with the state itself.</p>
<p>I followed a Grof-informed protocol: total isolation, a trained clinical</p>
<p>psychologist as sitter, controlled home environment, inward focus, and carefully</p>
<p>selected music to amplify states. At these levels, you essentially shatter the</p>
<p>mind; it dissolves into subtler aspects of reality. It became a systematic</p>
<p>exploration of what I call the mind of the universe. I sometimes say “the</p>
<p>Divine,” but that term carries cultural overlays I prefer to avoid.</p>
<p>I worked for 20 years, keeping careful records, then spent another 20 digesting.</p>
<p>These experiences are complex and interwoven, orchestrating many levels in tidal</p>
<p>surges. Sessions picked up where the last left off, progressively deepening. It</p>
<p>took years to understand what the universe was showing me. I felt a systematic</p>
<p>encounter with an intelligence that orchestrated my experience in dialogue with</p>
<p>me—not personified, never deity-form, and, when pressed, dissolving into deeper</p>
<p>layers of infinity. That cumulative story is what I tell in *LSD and the Mind</p>
<p>of the Universe*.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> Would you say this is an objective reality—that anyone using a</p>
<p>similar method could reach the unfolding you did? Or is that impossible to say?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s possible to say yes—and to qualify that yes. Grof’s work</p>
<p>integrates thousands of cases; my experiences fit comfortably within that larger</p>
<p>matrix.</p>
<p>Psychedelics amplify consciousness; they don’t give you an experience. Because</p>
<p>each mind has a different history, what is amplified at first is individual,</p>
<p>which is why these tools are powerful for healing. But if you continue—press</p>
<p>to the limits of your time-space identity and move through ego death—you open</p>
<p>into spiritual reality less tethered to your personal story. There, experiences</p>
<p>begin to overlap and converge.</p>
<p>These realities are interactive. The mind we bring acts as a seed catalyst,</p>
<p>crystallizing a certain set of experiences from the universe’s infinite</p>
<p>potential. As we integrate and are purified, the seed-mind changes, catalyzing</p>
<p>deeper disclosures. Once you understand this participatory cycle, the universe</p>
<p>discovered is coherent and consistent across contemplative, mystical, and</p>
<p>near-death traditions—though depth matters. What seems ultimate at one level</p>
<p>opens into a deeper level where things change.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> What excites me is practice. Many paths require long repetition to</p>
<p>find the cracks in ourselves. You used a different, faster route—not easy, and</p>
<p>not one you’d recommend broadly—but it seems you reached edges of the map</p>
<p>similar to, and perhaps beyond, contemplative practice. Is that fair?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It is a fast track, but one that permits no bypass. A</p>
<p>compressed labor is not easier—just more intense. The purifications and</p>
<p>detoxifications required to acclimate to subtler, clearer realities can be</p>
<p>extreme—convulsions, vomiting, profound somatic releases—and they demand</p>
<p>systematic lifestyle purification, just like traditional paths.</p>
<p>Also, I emphasize this is not abiding realization but temporary immersion.</p>
<p>Great contemplatives abide; these sessions offer temporary access and seed</p>
<p>experiences. You must nurture those seeds in daily embodied practice.</p>
<p>Historically, such practices sometimes fed an up-and-out cosmology—escape</p>
<p>into transcendence. What emerged in my work was different: transcendence in</p>
<p>service of incarnation—opening to as much of the universe as possible and</p>
<p>undergoing the transformations that let that energy live in history. I began</p>
<p>with a personal model; it shattered. I was drawn into a collective</p>
<p>transformation, and insights arose into our evolutionary trajectory as a</p>
<p>species.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> Let’s talk about aliveness and intelligence. Is everything animate?</p>
<p>How layered and deep is that intelligence?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The universe is alive and intelligent at every scale and in</p>
<p>interwoven layers—biospheric intelligence, planetary rhythms, incarnational</p>
<p>processes. At one point I entered radically dilated time—not timelessness, but</p>
<p>vast dilation—and dissolved into my human family, experiencing reincarnation as</p>
<p>a collective pulse: generations incarnating, living, dying, returning. What I</p>
<p>once thought of as individual karma revealed itself as exquisitely tuned</p>
<p>collective karma, history expressing collective transformation through our</p>
<p>individual lives.</p>
<p>Deeper still, I experienced the universe breathing as a single organism. When</p>
<p>the world is One, the private self pops—life runs through you and you through</p>
<p>life. Late in the journey, I was taken into “deep time” and shown stars of</p>
<p>light shooting out of time-space—“Diamond Souls,” the fruition of</p>
<p>reincarnation: diamond-pure capacities exploring spiritual dimensions newly</p>
<p>available through evolution.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> Before the evolutionary story, a word on reincarnation. You wrote</p>
<p>earlier on it. Why do you believe it’s real?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I see overwhelming empirical evidence. Ian Stevenson at the</p>
<p>University of Virginia documented hundreds of young children worldwide with</p>
<p>spontaneous memories of recent past lives. His work has been challenged, but it</p>
<p>holds up. Add past-life therapy that heals present trauma through past-life</p>
<p>access—this looks like an empirical fact of life.</p>
<p>Living in a reincarnation universe changes how you see. Children can be old in</p>
<p>soul, elders young. Early on, psychedelics taught me karma’s nuts and bolts.</p>
<p>Later, that became ground for experiencing the human family evolving through</p>
<p>reincarnation. It’s the higher octave of evolution—evolving individuals within</p>
<p>species. And not only humans; somewhere down the chain, reincarnation likely</p>
<p>engages.</p>
<p>Where does it take us? Each soul’s purpose is specific, and humanity’s learning</p>
<p>is vast. One grows into strength; another grows out of defense. Eastern</p>
<p>traditions often teach awakening to Divine essence and exiting—moksha. In my</p>
<p>sessions, something else occurred: former lives streamed into me, wrapping like</p>
<p>filaments on a spool until they fused. A diamond luminosity exploded from my</p>
<p>chest. I was shown that incremental progress across lives culminates in fusion:</p>
<p>a being on Earth awake to hundreds of thousands of years of lived history. That</p>
<p>being’s heart, mind, relationships, and bond with nature are vastly expanded.</p>
<p>This is not merely individual. The species is birthing the Diamond Soul. We can</p>
<p>no longer afford a world built by fragmented egos. We are entering a profound,</p>
<p>tumultuous birth that will feel like death—the old egoic culture dissolving so</p>
<p>something more whole can emerge. This is plate-tectonic change in the collective</p>
<p>psyche. Those born after will live within a different collective matrix. Part of</p>
<p>the work is reawakening to the divine presence we stripped from nature.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> For first-time listeners, it’s a lot. I’d like to bring Colin in,</p>
<p>because he often says we need a new cognitive framework to reanimate ourselves.</p>
<p>Colin?</p>
<p><strong>COLIN:</strong> Chris, it’s an honor. Your books—especially *Dark Night, Early</p>
<p>Dawn*—were tectonic for me. I grew up within a traditional indigenous culture</p>
<p>in southern Africa, with a cosmology shaped by wilderness. Now I also live in a</p>
<p>post-industrial frame. It feels like two cognitive systems inside me that I</p>
<p>must reconcile.</p>
<p>I’m full of questions, especially around time. Reincarnation here isn’t named</p>
<p>explicitly, yet it’s implicit. Our usual frame presumes sequence—past to</p>
<p>future. What happens if we remove that arrow? How would we understand</p>
<p>reincarnation without linear time?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> If you eliminate the arrow, reincarnation looks like</p>
<p>multi-incarnation—many lives active simultaneously, interacting in ways that</p>
<p>confound linear logic. I’ve tried to live in that model and find it unworkable</p>
<p>for ordinary life.</p>
<p>Robert Monroe suggested an evolved soul can incarnate in any period—soul</p>
<p>forward is not time forward. My experiences included many modalities of time:</p>
<p>my whole lifespan present at once; a hundred thousand years lived in a minute.</p>
<p>The universe seems to host multiple temporal modalities. From its perspective,</p>
<p>the “future” can be shown as already happened and yet to happen.</p>
<p>Still, within space-time there’s an approximate linear arrow that serves the</p>
<p>soul’s learning. Life chops learning into pieces; we can’t do it all at once.</p>
<p>The Diamond Soul on Earth holds many time-moments in present consciousness, but</p>
<p>development continues. In a million years we’ll be farther; the universe is</p>
<p>only warming up. Individuality and time are great gifts of the physical</p>
<p>universe, nested within more fluid metaphysics of time.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> When we reach the Diamond Soul—beyond remembering and wholeness—what</p>
<p>else does it bring?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Soul consciousness is what we return to when we die—the</p>
<p>accordion of large and small. Over millennia, the large wakes up within the</p>
<p>small. Temporarily, I was given Diamond Soul states and saw its archetypal</p>
<p>imprint: a human completely healed of history’s wounds, with profound communion</p>
<p>with nature and with others, and an open mind able to enter deeper communion</p>
<p>with universal intelligence. The genius of the universe holds answers to our</p>
<p>limited questions; the Diamond Soul can download more.</p>
<p>It’s not only heart and mind. The senses are amplified. In my final, 73rd</p>
<p>session, I was granted “Diamond Vision.” For about ten minutes, sight became</p>
<p>thousands of times sharper—gradients of color and precision I’d never imagined.</p>
<p>Then it receded. I realized sensation is a conscious process. The more</p>
<p>consciousness infuses the body, the more its innate capacities bloom—touch,</p>
<p>hearing, seeing—all by orders of magnitude. It is heaven on Earth in the body,</p>
<p>without leaving embodiment. This isn’t up-and-out; it’s bringing it in, changing</p>
<p>the body to sustain ecstasy as normal.</p>
<p>The labor is severe. Our past will be stripped away; what we think essential</p>
<p>will be lost. Mystical and psychedelic traditions agree: the small must be</p>
<p>ground to dust so the new can awaken. Historically we’re entering a collective</p>
<p>dark night—not merely a “hard time,” but an intense purification preceding</p>
<p>illumination. In this ordeal, the old will not survive, but something more</p>
<p>beautiful, ecstatic, competent, and connected will be born. We are becoming a</p>
<p>species of Buddhas and Christs—not exceptional outliers, but a baseline of</p>
<p>transparency to the essential condition that has always been here. The universe</p>
<p>has always been one and intelligent, and we have always been empty of a</p>
<p>separate self; we simply distracted ourselves. We are waking to the paradise</p>
<p>already present.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> I find your vision profoundly hopeful as we face ecological and</p>
<p>social crisis. It was one of the most inspiring books I’ve read—certainly of</p>
<p>last year, perhaps of my life. I know Colin agrees. It’s wonderful to hear—</p>

      <p><em>Abstract — 141 words</em></p>
<p>In this <strong>Portals of Perception</strong> conversation, host <strong>Aviv Shahar</strong> interviews transpersonal philosopher</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache</strong> about the revelations of his 73 high-dose LSD sessions, chronicled in *LSD and the Mind of the</p>
<p>Universe<em> (aka </em>Diamonds from Heaven*). Bache recounts dissolving into the “mind of the universe,” meeting an</p>
<p>immeasurable, compassionate intelligence, and witnessing humanity’s impending dark-night-and-rebirth process that</p>
<p>will birth a “diamond soul” future human. The dialogue ranges from cosmological purpose, collective karma, and the</p>
<p>fusion of transcendence and immanence to practical integration and embodied spirituality. Shahar probes how memory</p>
<p>functions as a living intelligence, why suffering is built into evolution, and how each person can become a conscious</p>
<p>partner in cosmic creativity. Bache closes with grounded counsel: purify mind and body, act for the greatest good,</p>
<p>and recognize today’s crises as the labor pains of planetary awakening.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>AVIV SHAHAR</strong>: Welcome, Chris. <em>Portals</em> explores the future human and the changes already under way.</p>
<p>We decode what is emerging at the edge of experience.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV SHAHAR</strong>: You taught philosophy and religion for 33 years and wrote <em>The Living Classroom</em>, *Dark Night,</p>
<p>Early Dawn<em>, and </em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe*—your “Diamonds from Heaven.”</p>
<p>I have never taken psychedelics; my work uses naturally arising states.</p>
<p>I invited you because of the rigor and depth of your inquiry. Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>: Thank you, Aviv. It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: After an academic career, books, family, and twenty years of radical research, what portal are you in now?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: Publishing <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em> felt like finishing my life’s work.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve followed the conversations it sparks, tended my North Carolina garden,</p>
<p>and practiced systematically remembering each of the 73 sessions to embody their realities.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Ervin Laszlo’s foreword names three premises:</p>
<p>a) intelligence pervades the universe,</p>
<p>b) that intelligence has purpose,</p>
<p>c) humans can access it.</p>
<p>How do these live in you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: They’re foundational. My early scientific worldview saw a purposeless machine cosmos.</p>
<p>The sessions shattered that: I communed with an intelligence vast and compassionate,</p>
<p>guiding evolution across lifetimes, planets, and galaxies.</p>
<p>I avoid the word “God” and speak of creative intelligence saturating existence.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: You say the universe enjoys our conscious participation—why?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: At depth there’s no true duality; Atman is Brahman.</p>
<p>The totality delights when its fractals awaken and converse.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Session 6 showed you a “community of explorers.” Lesson?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: History’s great thinkers form a fellowship.</p>
<p>Systematically expanding consciousness, documenting it, and integrating across disciplines</p>
<p>lets ordinary people enter terrains once reserved for elite mystics.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Conditioning shapes experience or only interpretation?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: Both. Early filters color content, but sustained practice dissolves them.</p>
<p>Consciousness is a seed crystal dropped into an infinite lake; purification changes what precipitates.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Session 19 felt like coming home beyond space-time. Insights?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: I learned reincarnation patterns, galaxy formation, and an indescribable peace.</p>
<p>The intelligence said: “Space-time was never meant to entrap so many.”</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Why is suffering woven into evolution?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: It’s a voluntary burden—labor pain for creation.</p>
<p>When the full arc is visible, the cost is judged worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: You describe a transcendence–immanence split: “he” and “she” seeking reunion.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: Part of intelligence stays outside time; part dives in.</p>
<p>Humanity now midwifes an alchemical marriage—divine light embodied in matter.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Your sessions moved from personal to collective trauma and future vision.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: After two years my work processed oceans of collective suffering,</p>
<p>then revealed a planetary dark night birthing the diamond-soul human.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Diamond luminosity—dharmakaya—followed.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: Four encounters with hyper-clear light, each after severe purification.</p>
<p>The light implanted in my body, hinting at future human physiology.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Today’s meta-crisis is an initiatory crucible?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: Yes. We face a bifurcation: extinction or evolutionary leap.</p>
<p>No victims—only volunteers incarnated to assist the birth.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Stabilizing that vision must be hard.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: A year of recovery. I now carry deep respect for every soul alive.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Practical bridges?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: Embrace embodied spirituality: purify mind, heart, body;</p>
<p>serve the greatest good; treat social transformation as sacred practice.</p>
<p><strong>AVIV</strong>: Viktor Frankl showed meaning transforms suffering; your work scales that to the cosmic.</p>
<p>Thank you for your generosity.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS</strong>: And thank you, Aviv, for your noble inquiry.</p>

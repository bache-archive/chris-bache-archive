      <p>In this short monologue, Chris Bache sketches the cosmology and evolutionary arc revealed in his</p>
<p>two-decade, high-dose LSD practice. He distinguishes rigorous, therapeutic use—rooted in Stanislav</p>
<p>Grof’s framework—from casual associations with “the 60s,” emphasizing cycles of purification and</p>
<p>death–rebirth that open progressively into deeper, more intelligent, and more luminous dimensions of</p>
<p>reality. Bache describes a hierarchy of levels in which higher strata source the lower, culminating</p>
<p>beyond time–space in “pure light.” He recounts repeated openings into species consciousness and a</p>
<p>vision of humanity entering a pivotal dark night followed by a great awakening—the birth of a “future</p>
<p>human” whose soul-awareness flowers within history. Reincarnational learning integrates across lives</p>
<p>to a fusion point symbolized as diamond light. Evolution, he argues, is guided by self-arising</p>
<p>intelligence rather than mere chance. Holding this vision, he urges trust through the purification now</p>
<p>unfolding, insisting that the creative universe is “very happy with us.”</p>
<p><em>[Music]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’m always hesitant to jump into this, because my experiences come from shamanic,</p>
<p>rigorous use of LSD. When people hear “LSD,” they think of the 60s or hallucinations, but this work</p>
<p>sits inside a therapeutic tradition—Stan Grof’s tradition—systematically engaging hyper-intense</p>
<p>states of awareness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Entering these states brings tremendous purification—death and rebirth, again and</p>
<p>again. If you go deep and often, there is a progressive initiation into deeper levels of reality, and</p>
<p>you come out with a sense of the large structure of things. I try to summarize that progression in</p>
<p>Diamonds from Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The cosmos has many levels. The physical is the dense level, with layers even inside</p>
<p>it down to the quantum. As you move into non-physical dimensions, each higher layer is more</p>
<p>intelligent, more energetic, more conscious, and it sources the levels below. Eventually you leave</p>
<p>time–space and pass through bardic echoes of it, and beyond that into extra-samsaric reality—domains</p>
<p>of pure light.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> You cannot take your ego there. To enter, you surrender what you were in the lower</p>
<p>realms. The lower aren’t bad; they are specific, individualized expressions of the larger reality. To</p>
<p>be a citizen of those higher domains for hours, you stop being Chris, stop being human, stop being a</p>
<p>time–space being. The experience is one of profound homecoming—a return to primal wholeness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Our evolutionary theories are partly right but deeply incomplete. Chance plays a</p>
<p>role, but what presents itself is a self-arising intelligence manifesting through time and space. It is</p>
<p>not a god outside tinkering, nor top-down design. It is creativity emerging from within reality itself.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In deep states you move beyond linear time into deep time, sometimes beyond any time</p>
<p>at all. Coming in and out of those states gives a perspective on where this world is going. There is a</p>
<p>direction. The end result is a cultivated trust—trust that where you are and what you are doing fits a</p>
<p>wiser pattern.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> When the bubble of the ego pops, you don’t just drop into unitive awareness; at the</p>
<p>subtle level you can open into collective consciousness. Many times I opened into our species mind.</p>
<p>Jung was right—the species psyche is coherent. Touching it, it is natural to be shown something of our</p>
<p>evolutionary trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Over years, I was taught that humanity is approaching a great fruition—a pivotal</p>
<p>awakening into a new platform of consciousness. But as with mystics who pass through a dark night,</p>
<p>our species must pass through a collective dark night to purge the karmic residues of egoic violence</p>
<p>and competition. A crisis is unfolding—a loss of control and structural breakdown—but on the other</p>
<p>side we are not merely making a better society. We are giving birth to a new form of the human</p>
<p>species.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Reincarnation appears as a given: birth and death across lifetimes, collecting</p>
<p>experience. In my sessions, many lives reintegrated like winding kite string on a spool, reaching a</p>
<p>critical mass and exploding into brilliant diamond light in the heart. That showed me where</p>
<p>reincarnation is taking us—not just incremental grades but a fusion point where the soul awakens</p>
<p>inside time and space. That is the future human we are birthing.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Humanity is built for speed in the long view. Though we live in hundred-year cycles,</p>
<p>the universe thinks in billions. Under intensified awareness—especially amid trial—we can shed the</p>
<p>past quickly, enact the soul in history, and move into clearer communion with the creative depth of</p>
<p>reality. The saints’ translucence foreshadows what is opening for the species.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Near the end of my journey, I was stripped down and thrown far into the future,</p>
<p>allowed to “try on” that form—an extraordinarily beautiful being. It is crucial to know we are</p>
<p>birthing something magnificent; otherwise the pain of purification can swallow us. Like a mother in</p>
<p>labor, we must not yield to despair. We must understand the birth.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Lastly, what keeps coming through is that the Divine—the creative consciousness of</p>
<p>the universe—is very happy with us. We make mistakes, yes, but in the long view we’re working hard</p>
<p>and right on time. There is more hard work ahead, but the trajectory is good.</p>

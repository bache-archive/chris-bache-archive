<p>Connecting Minds is a space dedicated to honoring the amazing authors, researchers, clinicians, artists, and entrepreneurs who are contributing to our collective evolution or simply making the world a better place. These thought-provoking conversations are intended to expand our horizons, so come with an open mind, and let us grow together. Here is your host, Christian Yordanov.</p>
<hr />
<p>**Christian Yordanov: ** Welcome to the Connecting Minds podcast. My name is Christian Yordanov, and thank you so much for joining me today on this 11th episode. I have Christopher M. Bache with me today. We had an almost two-hour conversation, and it was wonderful. I relished every minute of re-listening to it while typing up the show notes. There’s so much depth to the discussion, and you’re in for a treat. </p>
<p>The focal point of our conversation will be Chris’s latest book, <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven</em>, which accounts for his 20-year journey of high-dose LSD sessions between 1979 and 1999. He undertook a deep exploration of consciousness and the mind of the universe, as the title suggests. We also briefly discuss his first book, <em>Life Cycles</em>, which focuses on reincarnation. </p>
<p>You’re about to hear some amazing insights from Chris, a truly remarkable person. I was thrilled he agreed to come on the podcast. He was the first guest I approached back in September, so I was quite nervous for our interview. I did a ton of preparation, immersing myself in his work—his books and videos—and it was an enlightening experience. He opened my eyes to many concepts, authors, and thought leaders in various fields, leaving me with a reading list that seems endless.</p>
<p>Without offering too many spoilers, I think it’s best for you to hear directly from Chris about his experiences. We’ll only be scratching the surface in this interview, of course. He has a substantial body of work that I highly recommend checking out. Links to his books, website, and some YouTube videos will be in the show notes.</p>
<p>So, please feel free to get in touch and let me know how you enjoyed the episode. Thank you again for joining me today; I really appreciate you investing your time in this podcast. So, without further ado, I present Christopher M. Bache.</p>
<p>Today on the Connecting Minds podcast, we have Christopher M. Bache, Ph.D. Chris is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences and is currently faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies. He’s also on the advisory board for Grof Transpersonal Training and the Grof Foundation. An award-winning teacher and an international speaker, he’s the author of four books and now lives in North Carolina. Today, one of the main topics of our discussion will be his latest book, <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven</em>. Chris, thank you so much for taking the time to join us today.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** It’s a pleasure to be with you, Christian.</p>
<p>**Christian Yordanov: ** All right, we have a lot of ground to cover in a relatively short amount of time. I’d like to start by asking you to tell us what you were up to between 1979 and 1999 and to introduce us to your journey exploring consciousness, as well as how your career progressed during this time. It sounds like you lived almost two lives; if you could share that with us.</p>
<p><em><em>Chris Bache: ** Absolutely. I came out of graduate school in 1978, trained as a philosopher of religion. I grew up in the Deep South and earned my Ph.D. from Brown University. After finishing my dissertation and publishing part of it, I was looking for direction for my research. At that time, I was 30 years old and had no experience with psychedelics. However, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof and read his book, </em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>, published in 1976. From that moment, I recognized this as an important development, not just for psychology but also for philosophy—Grof’s methodology offered experiential access to dimensions of mind and existence that many have theorized about but few have experienced directly.</p>
<p>I made a challenging choice; since LSD was illegal, my life became divided. In my daytime job, I worked as a philosophy professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies. I taught courses on world religions, psychology of religion, Buddhism, comparative mysticism, and transpersonal studies. Simultaneously, in my personal life, I embarked on a 20-year journey systematically exploring LSD, using Stan Grof’s protocols.</p>
<p>Over those two decades, I conducted 73 high-dose LSD sessions, each safeguarded by a sitter to ensure I was protected and secure during the process. This journey engaged me deeply in exploring my own consciousness and eventually connecting to what I often refer to as the mind of the universe or the divine consciousness. While I loved teaching and connecting with my students, I developed this second life. It wasn’t until after I retired from the university and surpassed the statute of limitations for my work with these so-called illegal substances that I felt free to share the breadth of my experiences and their philosophical implications.</p>
<p>**Christian Yordanov: ** That was a 20-year journey that concluded in 1999. How did your academic career progress during those years?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** It progressed in a very traditional manner. I received promotions, published works, and won teaching awards at the university. I loved teaching and connecting with students. Like any ordinary professor, I served on committees and engaged in departmental activities. My department was complex, filled with philosophically minded colleagues with whom I developed close friendships over time. Overall, it was a conventional academic career.</p>
<p><em><em>Christian Yordanov: ** And during that journey, you also had three kids. It sounds like you led a productive life, contributing to society—something that’s often overlooked. There’s still this stigma surrounding psychedelics, with many people believing that someone involved in using them cannot be a productive member of society. Your journey illustrates the contrary. Around 1990, you published your first book, </em>Life Cycles</em>. Could you tell us what that book is about?</p>
<p><em><em>Chris Bache: ** </em>Life Cycles</em> is about reincarnation. While on my first sabbatical, I researched reincarnation, and through my exploration, I encountered the work of Ian Stevenson, a professor at the University of Virginia. His empirical evidence regarding reincarnation convinced me that it was a fundamental aspect of life—a reality of nature. This revelation was jarring, as reincarnation hadn’t been part of my academic training in Western religions or philosophy. But Stevenson had collected significant evidence from children around the world who had spontaneous recall of past lives. About 90% of his cases were unpublished due to stringent scientific standards, but around 10% are substantial, indicating accurate recall.</p>
<p>So, I wrote <em>Life Cycles</em>, which begins with an overview of Stevenson’s evidence and further explores the implications of living in a universe where reincarnation is a simple fact of life. The book ruffled some feathers in my department, as they weren’t expecting such a work from me, but it went on to be published in six languages and became a staple in my courses, presenting an accessible yet academically sound investigation of reincarnation.</p>
<p><em><em>Christian Yordanov: ** I’ve been trying to get a copy from Amazon for a while; it seems to sell out quickly! Following that, you published </em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>. I picked up that book a few weeks ago and have been slowly going through it. It’s definitely not light reading. In chapter two, you summarize some of the material from <em>Life Cycles</em>, which I appreciate, as it makes the information more digestible for readers. You noted in your research about children recalling past lives that the average period between lives is around two and a half years, yet through past life regression therapists, it seems to be around 40 to 50 years. That contrast is fascinating. It really raises questions about the learning and development your soul experiences between lifetimes. </p>
<p>For anyone interested, Chris has a very informative YouTube video that I’ll link in the episode description, where he summarizes Ian Stevenson’s work and discusses some past life therapists' accounts that complement it.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Thank you. An important philosophical aspect of reincarnation research is that it challenges our dominant paradigm concerning consciousness. In our culture, particularly in academia, the prevailing belief is that our minds are produced by our brains—that the brain is the core reality, giving off the glow that is our mind. However, if there exists a time gap between the death of one personality and the birth of another, and an organized transfer of memories between lifetimes, then there must be dimensions of reality where consciousness exists independently from a physical brain. This suggests that the universe is far more intricate than our traditional models have accounted for up to this century. </p>
<p>**Christian Yordanov: ** That’s beautifully said. This brings us back to psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin. They seem to open doors to these dimensions, allowing us to tap into broader realms of consciousness. Can you give us an overview of Stan Grof’s contributions to the transpersonal field? He is regarded as one of its founders. What occurs when an individual takes a regular dose of LSD versus high doses consistently? Could you discuss the phenomenology from a psychodynamic, transpersonal, and perinatal perspective as Grof outlined, as well as your own experiences?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Stan differentiated between low-dose and high-dose psychedelic therapy. In psychedelic therapy, individuals are not taking a substance and engaging with the world; they must enter a protected environment, completely focused internally, often with eye shades and carefully selected music. The aim is to confront what’s emerging in the mind.</p>
<p>LSD and other psychedelics act as amplifiers of consciousness—they don’t guide us in a specific direction but rather heighten awareness, making deeper dimensions of mind accessible. As consciousness amplifies, it often leads to a cleansing process where individuals confront their shadows—the fears, anxieties, and traumatic experiences held within. </p>
<p>Low-dose therapy, usually between 50 and 200 micrograms, allows one to confront personal issues shaped by past experiences. Continuing this work can lead to deeper introspection and confrontation of universal fears and the anxiety surrounding death, ultimately leading to profound transformation. This culminates in a cycle of death and rebirth experiences that bind our consciousness to the overarching spiritual reality.</p>
<p>Conversely, high-dose therapy was developed for terminally ill cancer patients, aiming not to address personal trauma but to provide transcendent experiences that reduce death anxiety. My approach diverged from Grof’s emphases; I was interested primarily in investigating consciousness's deeper dimensions, not clinical aspects.</p>
<p>While conventional high-dose therapy was limited to three sessions, I hypothesized that if individuals could safely conduct three, they might manage more. I decided to explore high doses for efficiency amid my dual career. Initially, I approached this to rapidly clear my personal karma and moved deeper into collective realms of consciousness.</p>
<p>Across 20 years, I engaged in 73 high-dose sessions, cycling through death and rebirth experiences. Each journey revealed deeper levels of spiritual reality, demanding a surrender of identity at every stage. Through repeated cycles, I learned that higher levels of consciousness possess distinct energetic frequencies. Undertaking this journey became a profound philosophical adventure, revealing a deep interconnectedness between my consciousness and the universe at large.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I discovered that consciousness is not an isolated phenomenon; it exists as a wave arising from an ocean of consciousness. By exploring these depths, I learned that diving deeper into how our minds operate unveils boundless possibilities.</p>
<p>**Christian Yordanov: ** That's incredible. To return to the earlier parts of your journey, Grof often discusses the initial stages of working with LSD, where people confront and explore perinatal levels, including birth trauma. In your work, you effectively explain the COEX systems, likening them to a protagonist’s emotions in a novel. Can you provide us with an overview of the perinatal level? What are COEX systems and the four phases Grof describes? What therapeutic potential lies in engaging with these emotions and experiences?</p>
<p>Then you open up into a process of remembering who you are, really, who you are underneath your physical incarnation and your physical experiences. There is a process of engaging what you might think of as the deep structure of the universe. To understand what happens in these sessions, you have to grasp what usually occurs in life naturally, which, for me, is that reincarnation is a simple fact of life. Reincarnation shows us that when we die, we expand into another universe, and when we're born, we contract into our egoic identity. This process goes on over and over again, century after century, millennia after millennia. </p>
<p>When you work with an amplifying substance like LSD, that process is accelerated and deepened. When you go through ego death, it can be truly terrifying. It feels like you are physically dying and losing control of your life. In a fundamental sense, you do die psychologically, but when you die, you don’t simply cease to exist; you are reborn into a deeper landscape of consciousness. This experience parallels that of people who face near-death episodes, where their consciousness expands into a deeper dimension for minutes before they return, having encountered another world. With LSD, you slowly shed your physical identity and open to this deeper spiritual universe.</p>
<p>If you do this repeatedly, working with very high doses—such as the 500 to 600 micrograms I used—you begin to replicate the experiences of those who have near-death episodes. You gain insight into your life from a spiritual perspective and learn about the organization of the spiritual world. There is a structure to it, a relationship between the way the spiritual and physical worlds are organized. The physical universe originated from a reality that is not physical, and deep states of consciousness allow you to access the reality that birthed the physical universe. </p>
<p>I see this process as a communion. You don’t take your ego into this reality; you dissolve into it. For the hours your session lasts, you are integrated into this larger reality. After the drug wears off, your consciousness gradually shrinks back to its ordinary state. If you've established the right conditions for this engagement, you return with accurate memories. It's vital to write down your session notes within 24 hours. I followed a strict procedure: I documented everything that happened right after each session. If you wait too long to record your experiences, the memories fade, and detail can be lost. When you write promptly, you get a coherent travelogue of your experiences and a deep understanding of the mind of the universe.</p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: It's clear that drugs like LSD can accelerate one's spiritual practice, but as you've pointed out, it’s easy to overestimate what you’ve accomplished in a single session. What would you say are some other important practices beyond keeping meticulous notes that helped you to contain and embody these experiences in your everyday life?</p>
<p>It’s a significant question, because stabilizing these states of consciousness and integrating your experiences into your earthly life is challenging. It’s not that difficult to break through into these dimensions, but holding onto what you find and incorporating those teachings into your life is essential. Much of this work involves remembering what you experienced and integrating it. During those years, I was consistently practicing meditation and various spiritual practices. Eventually, I centered my practice in the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition. I’ve experienced various traditions, including Transcendental Meditation and Vipassana, and I was raised in a Christian context which taught me values of compassion and self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Having a strong spiritual practice is crucial for integrating and stabilizing experiences from high-intensity psychedelic sessions. These sessions open you to immense fields of awareness and energy; a daily practice helps you assimilate these tidal waves of energy and insights. Grounding, in various forms, is very important. I didn’t fully appreciate how grounding my career stability, my responsibilities as a father, and my marriage contributed to my balance until later. Each week I was teaching, spending time with my children, and engaging in my relationship with my wife. These stable activities provided a foundation that allowed me to explore transcendental states without becoming fragmented or inflated.</p>
<p>One of the significant dangers of working with psychedelics is the risk of psychic inflation. You might think that after experiencing something profound, you must be a deep person, but that’s an illusion. What's important is not what you experience during the session, but what you can embody in the days and weeks afterward. Responsibilities like raising children and maintaining a marriage keep you grounded, reminding you that in the end, you're just another human being getting by, trying to do the best you can.</p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: I appreciate that you seem to have little ego inflation despite the profound experiences you’ve had. If you had fewer responsibilities, how often do you think you would have engaged in these sessions?</p>
<p>That's an interesting question; I’ve never thought about that. I might have been tempted to go more often, but I’m glad I didn’t. Opening your mind and diving deeply into the knowing of the universe is psychologically and physically demanding. It puts tremendous pressure on your body and energy system. LSD tends to push the cosmological ceiling, and if I could start over, I would work with lower doses and balance them with other psychedelics like psilocybin or ayahuasca, which offer more grounded, body-centered experiences.</p>
<p>When I was doing this work, it was all gas, going as far as I could. Reflecting on it, I realize I probably took on more than was healthy, even though I paid attention to my physical well-being. It took years to fully internalize those experiences, and I suspect I will continue to absorb their lessons throughout my life. They have impacted not just this incarnation but also the trajectory of my soul’s future lifetimes.</p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: Reading about a session day illustrates the toll it takes. Skipping breakfast to avoid nausea and staying up all night to document the experience sounds more demanding than a weekend out partying! </p>
<p>It is very demanding. When you engage these deeper levels, you begin where you left off, not at the beginning. Climbing a mountain, you start at higher base camps after each session. Over time, I had to take more precautions and carefully watch my diet and overall health. I would ensure my body was well-aligned through chiropractic work or massage therapy to avoid physical discomfort during these intense experiences. </p>
<p>This deep work requires preparation, not just on session days but in the days leading up to it and afterward. The window of experience begins to close within 24 hours but continues to close more deeply over several days and weeks. It’s crucial to care for your life at all levels, as the impact extends beyond just yourself. When you dive deep into consciousness, you affect not only your life but also those around you. I found that even my students, unaware of my work, began to be activated in ways related to my sessions. </p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: That’s a profound perspective. To quote Marie Louise von Frantz, a collaborator of Carl Jung: "Whenever an individual works on his own unconscious, he invisibly affects first the group, and if he goes even deeper, he affects larger national units, or even all of humanity." This notion ties in beautifully with your description of consciousness. Could you take us through the mid and later stages of your journey? What experiences emerged as you continued your work?</p>
<p>It took about two and a half years and ten sessions to navigate the psychodynamic and perinatal levels and go through my first deep ego death experience. Afterward, surprisingly, I entered a two-year period of what I came to call the ocean of suffering. I began to experience the vast collective suffering of humanity across thousands of years. Initially, I thought these experiences represented a deepening personal ego death, but as time went on and the suffering persisted, I understood that I was engaging with the collective psyche.</p>
<p>The collective unconscious collects traumatic experiences, not just personally but also as a species. Through deep work, we’re not merely transforming ourselves; we’re engaging in a healing process for the collective psyche. I was experiencing the draining of collective pain through my consciousness. This period lasted for two years, during which I also had ecstatically beautiful experiences. I explored my life from beginning to end as a completed whole, giving me insight into my life’s purpose. </p>
<p>I was then taken back to what seemed like the universe's beginning, where I gained knowledge about humanity's evolutionary trajectory. Eventually, this ocean of suffering came to an end, and I experienced another profound death experience, which led me to what I recognized as archetypal reality. There, I discovered a level of existence that transcends time and space, a generative matrix producing our reality. </p>
<p>After exploring this archetypal reality, I experienced what you might call causal oneness, where all divisions became permeable. I began to see the universe as a singular, living entity. In this state, boundaries seemed to dissolve, and I would perceive everything as interwoven with the fundamental reality of life. This exploration continued for over a year, leading to yet another death and rebirth process where I entered a domain of light, described in Buddhism as Dharmakaya. </p>
<p>Throughout this journey, I encountered a hyper-clear reality I called the diamond luminosity—an astonishingly transcendent experience. In my 26 sessions over five years, I reached this state four times. In between, I underwent profound purifications in preparation for each session, continually striving to enter deeper states of awareness. I can differentiate five levels of reality from my journey: the personal level culminating in ego death, the collective level for humanity, the archetypal level, the level of causal oneness, and finally, the level of diamond luminosity. It has indeed been a long journey. </p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: That’s absolutely fascinating. I encourage people to explore your book and videos for a deeper understanding. The parallels between your experiences and those of near-death experiences are intriguing. Do you believe what Buddha experienced under the Bodhi tree reflects this light? Can people achieve this state through meditation without substances like LSD?</p>
<p>It may sound arrogant to suggest touching on what the Buddha experienced, but I believe the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic states is fundamentally aligned with the great mystical traditions of the world. This includes understandings of the Bardo, the post-death domain, and the fundamental union and oneness that underlies all existence. We're tapping into the same reality. It’s crucial to recognize that when engaging with psychedelics, you're accessing this reality temporarily. In contrast, meditation and contemplative practices allow for a more enduring connection to these truths over time.</p>
<p>I don't want to imply that my experiences are on par with the significance of those of great spiritual masters. However, even temporary access to these realities can change your life forever. These experiences can banish your fear of death and fundamentally alter your understanding of the world and how it operates. They can also enhance your daily meditation practice. Having temporary access to these dimensions of reality can deepen and accelerate one's contemplative journey. </p>
<p>I would place the diamond luminosity experience within what the Buddhists refer to as extra-Samsara reality. Samsara represents the individual, cyclic existence of the physical universe—where everything arises and falls. The spiritual reality continues post-death in various Bardos, but it remains temporary. However, it is possible to transcend the entire system of death and rebirth. That is what I believe I accessed during the diamond luminosity work, a possibility held within the deepest spiritual traditions. Dharmakaya, the highest level of reality in the Varana Buddha's tradition, is where such truths reside. Again, I don’t consider myself a mystic or an enlightened being; temporary access is quite different from permanent access. I honor those great masters who embody abiding access to these realities; nonetheless, even a brief encounter can be profoundly transformative.</p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: I appreciate your humility. It resonates with the notion that we all possess Buddha nature, that essential core of mind which, as the Tibetans call it, is Rigpa. If we are all part of this universe—divine in nature—we must hold a spark of the divine within us. Accessing it, whether momentarily or for a lifetime, is significant, particularly in our current state of complexity and ego-driven existence. There’s ongoing research indicating that psilocybin can induce mystical experiences, reflecting the importance of these explorations today.</p>
<p>Let me riff off what you just said. After my contact with the diamond luminosity domain and extra-Samsara reality, my experiences shifted. They led to a deeper internalization of that reality, ultimately guiding me back to the present moment and uncovering this Buddha nature, our essential nature that lies at the core of every individual. It's a hyper-clear, transparent reality from which all emotions, sensations, and thoughts arise. It neither begins nor ends—it is universal, waiting for our attention to turn inward.</p>
<p>Tapping into this essence feels like discovering diamonds in your pocket—the most precious resource, always present yet often overlooked because we remain focused on the external world. When we dive deep enough within ourselves, we find extraordinary truths waiting there. Importantly, you don't need to undergo all the experiences I've had to access this fundamental nature. </p>
<p>I distinguish between using psychedelics for spiritual awakening and for cosmic exploration. You don’t need to delve into archetypal reality or explore the birth of the universe to attain that immediate access to your essential nature. That journey can be core to a targeted spiritual practice.</p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: Many humans might not be able to follow your path, even if they wanted to. Your work has significantly contributed to the Transpersonal field, especially regarding near-death literature and reincarnation studies, and I respect that contribution. </p>
<p>Before we delve deeper into diamond luminosity, let’s revisit your earlier journey. In your book, there’s a chapter titled "The Birth of the Future Human." Can you share what visions you had about the trajectory of our human evolution?</p>
<p>What follows may sound fantastic or even arrogant, but it's essential to convey what occurred. That chapter is perhaps the most significant in my book—a surprise to me, really. Initially, I thought I was undergoing personal transformation. However, as my work progressed—after around 23 sessions—I began to witness things consistently, session after session. I entered what I term “deep time,” where time behaves differently than in our ordinary experience. I was shown insights about humanity's past and future, especially that our entire evolutionary journey is rooted in profound cosmic love. Everything unfolding within time and space is part of a creation process suffused with love.</p>
<p>I learned that humanity is approaching a significant transition, a catharsis point reflecting a collective awakening. Nature isn't merely focused on individual awakenings; it’s awakening the entire species, indicating something very central to our collective psyche. </p>
<p>We are inherently reincarnating beings, evolving not just on an individual level but collectively. A pivotal point is imminent—a profound spiritual awakening that taps into the oneness that underlies all existence. The ego is a beautiful aspect of individual awareness but operates within divided realities. However, our common core is oneness, and I witnessed this explosion of oneness within the human heart.</p>
<p>Then, during a session in 1995, I experienced what I describe as our species' death and rebirth. It wasn't an ego death but rather a confrontation with a global crisis driven by the ecological disaster and climate change. I sensed immense global suffering as families were torn apart and humanity faced overwhelming challenges. This suffering resonated not only in individual lives but also in the collective psyche, energizing it and propelling us into a state physicists would call non-linear conditions.</p>
<p>This crisis drove home the interconnectedness of our species, unlike any other historical moment where only localized events impacted individual regions. As pain escalated, it brought us to an alleged breaking point—an extinction-level event for humanity. Yet, just as we reached this brink, we began to rise again from the ashes, changed by our suffering. We opened up to an enhanced depth of heart and mind, fostering a deep coexistence among human beings that typically emerges during crises. This transformational process revealed a potential future where human nature itself evolves and integrates these insights.</p>
<p>The birth of the future human represents a gestation of thousands of years, marked by countless lives lived and lessons learned—yet dominated previously by ego. However, something shattered in the crisis, allowing our deep consciousness to surge forward. We began to live out of a new psychological foundation, creating a society rooted in oneness rather than ego-driven division.</p>
<p>This process is rooted within humanity, as we navigate this birthing phase. There’s an endeavor to transform our worldview—an energetic shift that integrates the understanding of oneness, prompting changes not just in our socio-political systems but at the very core of who we are.</p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: You’ve expressed that every one of us chose to be here at this time. </p>
<p>Indeed. Each human on this planet made a conscious decision before incarnating, fully aware of the challenges ahead. Thus, there are no victims—only individuals participating in a grand cosmic play. After we die, we don’t simply cease to exist. Although physical death is real, the essence of the soul continues. We reincarnate to further engage with the conscious creation of our species and the universe.</p>
<p>This cycle underscores the importance of overcoming the anxiety of our existence. We should instead roll up our sleeves and get to work, fulfilling the purposes we chose prior to our incarnation.</p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: It’s vital to contemplate death, understand it, and move beyond that fear to embrace our life’s mission. How do you personally perceive your death as Chris Bache?</p>
<p>Having engaged deeply with this work, I harbor no fear of death. In fact, I welcome it. While I’m not seeking an early exit, my experiences have shown me the beauty of the dimension awaiting us after death. To fear death is to be ensnared in the physical world and the illusion that it’s the only reality—something many researchers have debunked.</p>
<p>Physicists reveal that 96% of the universe comprises dark matter and energy, indicating there’s so much more beyond the visible. Near-death research continuously affirms that what awaits is an extraordinary realm of bliss—a ‘homecoming,’ if you will. We reincarnate not from punishment but as conscious participants within this ever-evolving universe. Personally, I anticipate graduation into deeper spiritual awareness. </p>
<p>Life's challenges prepare us for that state of bliss. It is entirely possible to experience profound transformation within life itself, allowing the spiritual realm to permeate our existence without the need for physical death. True spiritual liberation is being transparent to those energies while fully alive. </p>
<p>Through repeated experiences of psychological death and rebirth, we learn that our true essence cannot die; while the physical form may decay, our essence endures in a more luminous reality. If I could impart just one thing from my work, it would be the liberation from the fear of death.</p>
<p>Christian Yordanov: That’s profound. When the time comes and you see the light, what do you think you will do upon merging with it? Will you consider returning in human form?</p>
<p>I’ve entrusted that decision to the higher self I’ll embody after death. My explorations of the spiritual universe have instilled a deep desire to explore that realm further, yet I trust that when I’m there, I'll understand what’s best for me and how to support our collective development more than I can grasp now. </p>
<p>As we wrap up, could you share why you chose to stop your sessions in 1999?</p>
<p>Well, as I explained in the book, I stopped for two reasons: pain and heartache. These states of consciousness are so intense and involve such an increase in our energy that my physical system was running very hot. I found I was having more and more difficulty integrating the sheer energy it takes to enter these states in my physical incarnation. I engaged in various spiritual practices that helped, but ultimately, I understood that I needed to calm down and allow my body and subtle energy system to rest. There was no pathology—I wasn’t having flashbacks—but I had to cool down, so to speak. </p>
<p>However, that wasn't the main reason I stopped; the principal reason was heartache. Once you have known the joy of dissolving into light, of becoming light, it’s painfully difficult to return to the limitations of our present incarnation. Coming back into this time-space reality after such exquisite intimacy with Infinite Being becomes too hard. Eventually, I asked the universe—not just in general, but I communicated with my beloved—to never take me back to those depths until I could stay with her forever. That’s when I stopped the sessions.</p>
<p>I was surprised by what happened next. I had thought that I could simply step back from my sessions, having received so many gifts and blessings that I could digest them for the rest of my life. What I found instead was a profound longing to return to those states of diamond luminosity. I realized I couldn’t return to them anymore in this incarnation. If I took a massive dose of LSD today, I wouldn’t go back to those dimensions. It takes years of sustained work to develop the energy and momentum to enter those states again. I knew that I would have to wait until my physical life was over to truly return.</p>
<p>There was a tremendous unfulfilled longing for communion, and as long as I was returning to those states once a year or so, that imbalance hadn’t manifested. But once I stopped completely, I recognized that I had created an imbalance between too much transcendence and not enough imminence. The entire physical universe is the body of the Divine; it’s not like I was entering the divine and coming out of it. I was going into the transcendent divine and returning to the imminent divine. </p>
<p>It took about ten years to make peace with that disconnect and to become comfortable living within the physical universe again. Another aspect of the sadness I experienced in ending my sessions was that my culture didn’t allow me to talk about this. Psychedelics are illegal, so I couldn’t discuss my experiences at the university where I worked. As a philosopher who loves to teach, I felt stifled, unable to incorporate these vital experiences into my philosophical work. When you’re not allowed to express such important truths, it can be deeply unhealthy.</p>
<p>Finally giving myself permission to tell my story and share my journey with others has been a significant part of my healing. I don’t think I’m special; I simply believe these experiences can be useful to others on their spiritual and social journeys. This is how I am putting together the two halves of my life: my academic and my spiritual pursuits. The heartache I felt when I stopped my sessions has begun to heal, and through the process of writing the book and engaging in conversations like this one, an interesting dynamic has begun to unfold. It feels as though the Divine is not just waiting for me to return after I die but is actively reaching out to meet me here. There’s a deepening sense of peace and permeability to the ever-present divine dimension of life, even within the nuts and bolts of our physical existence.</p>
<p>Christian, I want to thank you for your work, too. I was going over "LSD and the Mind of the Universe" over the weekend, and I found nearly every third page dog-eared, with some pages heavily marked for easy reference. Because of your synthesis of different authors and perspectives, I have a list of several dozen writers whose work I need to look into further. Your exploration and delivery of these concepts to the world is deeply appreciated. </p>
<p>As for my future plans, when I wrote "LSD in the Mind of the Universe," which I prefer to title "Diamonds from Heaven," I felt a sense of closure, as if I had completed my life’s work. I love teaching and interacting with people; COVID-19 has disrupted that, but I still hope to hold retreats and engage in conversations about psychedelics. I envision creating spaces where people can share their experiences. </p>
<p>After the pandemic, I hope to conduct shorter and longer retreats, though I'm still uncertain about the specifics. I'm not great at self-promotion—I don't even have a website yet! But if anyone wants to reach me, my email address is included in the back of my book. Soon, my website, chrisbache.com, will be available where people can find updates on my teaching and talks.</p>
<p>There are four books that I have published; I don't anticipate additional titles, but you never know. My first book is "Life Cycles," which discusses reincarnation. The second is "Dark Night, Early Dawn," a blend of my academic work and my psychedelic experiences. I'm integrating research on psychedelic states, near-death experiences, and out-of-body experiences in this exploration. Then there’s "The Living Classroom," focusing on the effects of these experiences within learning environments, which was also published by SUNY Press. Lastly, "LSD in the Mind of the Universe" delves deeper into my psychedelic background and its role as the driving source of inspiration for all my work.</p>
<p>All my books are available on Amazon, and my published articles can be found on academia.edu. Just search for my name, Chris Bache, and you'll access my research.</p>
<p>I truly appreciate this opportunity to share my thoughts with you, Christian. It’s a pleasure and an honor to converse with you and connect with your listeners.</p>

**Abstract**

Host James W. Jesso speaks with CHRIS BACHE about what decades of high-dose LSD practice can teach us about making spiritual sense of global crisis. After framing the conversation as a follow-up to their earlier interview on *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, they explore Bache’s “deep time” visions and his forecast of a long, difficult transition birthing a “future human.” They discuss the COVID-19 pandemic as an overture to broader systemic collapse, collective shadow work, ego dissolution, and how disciplined psychedelic practice cultivates compassion, resilience, and service. Bache emphasizes taking responsibility for suffering, engaging the world from oneness, and maturing beyond polarized, fear-driven discourse. The dialogue weaves spiritual practice, ethics, and activism, touching on Duane Elgin’s *Choosing Earth*, integration, and the role of teachers, communities, and contemplative depth in navigating civilizational stress.

## Part 1

*\[Music\]*

**JAMES W. JESSO:** Welcome to Adventures Through the Mind. I’m your host, James W. Jesso. This podcast explores topics relevant to psychedelic culture, medicine, and research. I want to begin with a question: what might seventy-six high-dose LSD sessions over twenty years teach someone about making spiritual sense of a global crisis, even a civilizational collapse?

**JAMES W. JESSO:** That’s what we’re talking about today with CHRIS BACHE, author of *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. Chris is professor emeritus in philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University, a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, adjunct faculty at CIIS, and on the advisory board for Grof Transpersonal Training and the Grof Foundation. He’s an award-winning teacher, international speaker, and author of several books.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** We’ve had Chris on before, episode eighty-nine, “Mapping Consciousness with High-Dose LSD,” about his seventy-three high-dose journeys and what they revealed about reality. Today is a follow-up. It was intended to range across themes from the book, but it quickly focused on the “birth of the future human” emerging from a long phase of strife, grief, and challenge that catalyzes our next evolutionary step. Chris sees where we are now as the start of that process.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** This interview was recorded in September 2020. It took me a while to release because, in the moment, I was struggling and the interview became less a standard Q&A and more a younger man asking an elder for wisdom to make sense of crisis. Also, a production note: you may hear some knocks in Chris’s audio that I couldn’t fully remove.

One-time donations via PayPal or crypto are in the episode description. Okay, let’s get to it—my second interview with CHRIS BACHE on Adventures Through the Mind. Enjoy.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** Chris, I revisited our first podcast, my notes from your Vancouver workshop, and your book. Last time I could lean on the arc of your lectures; this time I don’t have that scaffold. If you’re open to it, I’d love to read passages that moved me and ask you to speak to them.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That’s great. Since the book came out and the first interviews landed, I’ve been digesting people’s responses. I wrote a postscript essay for an audience in England, reflecting on implications I didn’t fully foreground—nothing new in content, but the audacity of the claims and the intimacy with the mind of the universe have sunk in at a deeper level. I’m glad for a second bite of the apple. Let’s let the conversation bring out what wants to come.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** Perfect. One thread feels present right now. Near the end of the book, you describe history as a rock tumbler and the emergence of the future human through intense strife—analogous to the cleansing phases of psychedelic work. Reading that in lockdown, it felt like, “Are we already there?” Part of me thought, despite how bad things felt, “This is only a virus.” How do you see it?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I think of the pandemic as an overture. It contains motifs we’ll hear in the full symphony, but in abbreviated form. It disoriented us and taught lessons that may help in what comes next. What’s coming is much worse. This is Act One.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** A stress test?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. And it has evolved beyond the virus: narrative warfare, the dissolution of a shared reality, social media dynamics, populism and the backlash against it. Still, it’s not as bad as it will get.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Let me mention Duane Elgin’s *Choosing Earth*. It’s a lifetime of research projecting decade-by-decade tightening collapse over the next several decades. He thinks by 2050 we’ll be more than halfway through the great collapse. It’s a concise synthesis worth reading.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** That cues the urgent question: what are we supposed to learn here? And what are we not learning?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’m not on the front lines; I see what you see. But lessons are visible. We’re learning the fragility of our systems and their interdependence—supply chains, resource flows, and how “modest” jobs are vital to collective wellbeing. We’re learning how quickly life can invert and how little stability we truly have. We’re seeing the limits of patriarchal ego; Trump strikes me as the last gasp of patriarchal monarchy. We’re witnessing how ugly ego can be, how quickly polarization escalates, even over something as small as masks.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In the largest frame, ego built our culture. Ego is a remarkable achievement, but a world organized from egoic identity is divided. It’s a world of haves and have-nots. Duane cites that five people own as much wealth as half the world. Such disparity is unsustainable. The pandemic throws this into our face: who suffers most? The poor and people of color.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I suspect the first tremor was the 2008 credit crisis. It taught us things and drained liquidity. Now debts balloon while resilience thins. Whether this is the first or second round, it’s only beginning.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** I don’t like the world I see through the screen. I don’t like being part of a system that harms, or the toxic behaviors amplified by social media—the moralized certainty and vilification. It makes me want to hide. Yet in psychedelic work, when I meet those parts in myself, it’s equally ugly. Your book teaches not turning away from pain. How do we do that now?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Serious psychedelic work begins with taking full responsibility for one’s shadow. You close the door and face the most daunting, frightening parts of your being. When people haven’t done that, they project shadow outward; evil is “out there.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** The breakdown we’re entering will break down that defense. Eventually there’s nowhere to look but inward—individually and collectively—to own the imbalances we created and from which we benefit. The psychedelic community understands this: to make progress, you confront the shadow.

**CHRIS BACHE:** You also learn that the deeper the purification, the deeper the ecstasy and communion. You don’t embrace suffering because you like pain, but because you’ve tasted what lies beyond it and because compassion compels you. Much of the suffering you’ll process isn’t “yours,” but taking it on helps others you may never meet. If you carry more than your share, the universe responds with more than your share of blessing.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Generationally, we will suffer more than previous generations. Once we stop kicking and surrender to the work, blessings arise from that generosity. Transformation accelerates with wholehearted commitment. We will learn—like any seasoned journeyer—that there are riches on the other side of the ordeal, and that there is no other way to reach them. You end up where you began, but cleaned out; the gunk you didn’t know was compromising you is gone.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** Part of me hears this and asks, “But is turning inward enough?” There’s rhetoric that if more people took psilocybin, we’d stop destroying rainforests or electing authoritarians. That feels naive. Yet I also see that showing up in social movements with hate in my heart isn’t right either. How do you hold this?

**CHRIS BACHE:** If your spirituality leads you away from social engagement, it’s likely immature. Mature spirituality opens the heart of all living things and naturally moves you to serve life. The form varies—medicine, tech, teaching—but we each have a niche. As we engage, we discover we’re not as clean as we thought; then we step back, clean, and re-engage.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’m in my seventies; my frontline is teaching and writing. Others my age are out getting out the vote or doing tangible work. There’s no standardized rulebook. What matters is tuning to the point within that connects to the larger intelligence drawing us into deeper engagement—with humans and with non-human life. A million species are going extinct as we speak. That calls us.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** One of my first tabs in the book was your warning that one of the greatest risks of psychedelic work is ego inflation. I see inflation dynamics in the culture at large. Thoughts?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’m a bit of a hermit, so I only glimpse the psychedelic community from the edges. But culturally we are entering a psychedelic period of history. Low-dose history offers voluntary ego work; high-dose history will put us through the grinder regardless. Choices will be made for us by consequences set in motion for centuries.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The danger is psychic inflation: having a deep experience and imagining oneself a deep person; having a great experience and believing oneself a great being. In disciplined work, that illusion doesn’t last. The medicine knocks you flat. It becomes less about ecstasy and more about taking out the garbage so that forty-eight hours after a session you’re living better. If you do the hard work, the blessings are given intentionally and lay foundations for future work. Over time you feel the maturational rhythm and lose the appetite for inflation. Ego is the obstacle.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** Given where we are, what does it mean to be a good person right now? What does it take?

**CHRIS BACHE:** In some sessions, and in the afterglow, something falls away and the world reveals itself as living and breathing as one. My feet feel rooted in the earth like a tree. There’s continuity of being with grass and sky. The pulse of the universe in its utter simplicity is palpable, beyond our divisions. From there, mind opens, presence sweetens, and the heart opens so fully that harming anyone is unthinkable and helping everyone is natural. It’s not “being good”; it’s being alive in oneness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Goodness is a compass needle pointing toward that truth. Compassion, fairness, and justice are fractal expressions of oneness. In practice, it’s simple at the core and complex in enactment. If an action doesn’t arise from grounded oneness, be cautious.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** I’ve known that oneness, yet most of the time I’m not there. Having a profound experience doesn’t make me a profound person. How do we remember and integrate?

**CHRIS BACHE:** We go up the mountain and come back down to Monday morning. It’s constant practice—checking ourselves, recommitting, doing better next class, next week, next semester. Integration is essential and imperfect. Living our visions is hard because it demands continual awareness of how often we fall short. Being around truly good people helps calibrate us. In Buddhism, sangha—spiritual friends—is a pillar of progress.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** We also need to be in the world. Yet right now most interactions are screen-mediated, charged, and often toxic. How do we walk between isolating into our spiritual friend group and engaging a world that can be hostile and cancel-prone?

**CHRIS BACHE:** It looks different for each of us. For decades my life was “as real as my students.” Whatever I did on weekends, at ten o’clock Monday I was in front of first-generation college students in a burned-out steel town. That was frontline engagement, helping them deepen in my disciplines while confronting assumptions—mine and theirs.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Now retired, I buffer myself from screens. Immersing in toxic confusion doesn’t help me maintain the clarity I’m responsible to offer. But the inner principle is the same whether you’re on a subway or in solitude: integrity. Are we living in a way that puts us in position to be of maximum benefit when called? That alignment is cultivated over time and expressed in the moment.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** What about people who feel equally aligned while doing harmful things—taking guns out for walks, screaming at masked strangers, propagating white supremacy, or canceling anyone who disagrees? They believe they’re doing good. Am I a fool to trust my sense of goodness over theirs? Or is it all “good” in some larger unfolding?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The highest Buddhist teachings radically qualify “good.” From the absolute, it doesn’t matter whether you’re doing good or not; alignment with the absolute supersedes those categories. But until you abide there, it’s best to do good because it’s our closest approximation of that condition.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’m not willing to say everything is good. Injury—physical or psychological—is a marker of “not good.” Lynching was once believed “good” by some; it was not. Genuine awakening produces gentler, more compassionate people. It doesn’t produce homophobia or violence. That doesn’t mean we never confront injustice or use force; it means the core balance is compassion.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The practical question is how to confront “not good” in ways that don’t perpetuate evil or deepen division. That can only be answered locally, in specific circumstances, by specific people.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** Bad-faith argument has become common. Productive discourse feels impossible when conflict is received as abuse. What role does conversation play in our evolution? How do we balance open discourse with refusing platforms for hate?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I come from academia, where we prize engaged disagreement as a vehicle for refining truth. I’ve pivoted my worldview multiple times—Christian to non-Christian, scientific materialism to challenging reductive axioms through psychedelics. I’ve spent my career disagreeing with colleagues while remaining friends, and making space for students to voice abhorrent opinions so there’s a chance of movement.

**CHRIS BACHE:** But the larger world now has different rules. Standards are dissolving; “everyone’s entitled to their truth” can collapse into might-makes-right. We’re living through a paradigm change. Certainties become uncertainties. Science tells us ninety-six percent of reality is dark matter and dark energy. Religions meet in one valley and we’re forced to reassess all truth claims. Many lack the meta-awareness of their own paradigms, so everything acts out more violently.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Constants are falling away—even nature’s rhythms. People are scared, so they clutch at old values. But we’re not going back. We can only go forward into uncertain territory together. We have to grow up. Adults hold longer time horizons, keep tempers, and avoid injury. Truth is expanding; we’re struggling to keep up.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** I realize I’ve asked you to the edge of your thinking on meta-crisis more than psychedelics. Still, this has been nourishing.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The value here isn’t only content. It’s the mode of disciplined, respectful inquiry you model. It invites self-awareness and learning. That’s part of how we move forward.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** I’m removing myself from degenerative online discourse and surrounding myself with conversations that help me stay oriented. Daniel Schmachtenberger speaks about finding the place between seeing what’s wrong and what I can actually do. Right now, this podcast feels like what I can do.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I don’t do Twitter or Instagram. Where I live isn’t where most people live, partly because psychedelics have reoriented my horizons. My deepest understanding isn’t “earthly wisdom.” It arises from intimacy with the generative intelligence of the universe—the mind of the universe.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Once dissolved into the deepest pulse of life, you never see life the same. You become sensitive to how much fear drives behavior, especially fear of dying. If you lose that fear, you meet restructuring differently. My book is a memoir of that journey. After sessions, even a grocery store can feel like Disneyland.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Psychedelic work reenacts reincarnation on a smaller orbit: shattering the earthly identity, entering the larger reality, then returning to live better. After enough cycles, you stop relating to the world as before. In much aberrant social behavior, I see not so much badness as immaturity. These are souls in early stages. Psychedelics, practiced well, accelerate maturation. They don’t make us perfect, but they force us to grow up.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** That feels like a good place to pause. Thank you for going to the edge with me, Chris. I feel nourished, and I trust listeners will too.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I trust our conversations and hope they’re useful to your audience. It’s always a joy to talk with you.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** Here’s Chris’s book, *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. And a plug for Duane Elgin’s *Choosing Earth: Humanity’s Great Transition to a Mature Planetary Civilization*. It’s concise and insightful about where we’re headed and how to navigate.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** Given how damning we’ve been of social media, where should people find you?

**CHRIS BACHE:** In a couple of months, chrisbache.com should be up. For now, people can reach me at my university email: cmbache@ysu.edu.

**JAMES W. JESSO:** Thanks, Chris. Looking forward to next time.

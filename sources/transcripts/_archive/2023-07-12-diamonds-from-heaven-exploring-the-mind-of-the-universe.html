<p>In this conversation from <em>Sounds True: Insights at the Edge Live</em>, Tammy Simon interviews philosopher and 
author <strong>Chris Bache</strong> about his book <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. Bache recounts his extraordinary 
journey through 73 high-dose LSD sessions over two decades, undertaken as a structured experiment in 
spiritual awakening and cosmological exploration. He reflects on the repeated cycles of death and rebirth he 
experienced, describing them not as endings but as deep processes of purification and transformation. 
Bache explains his encounters with what he calls the "mind of the universe"—a vast, intelligent consciousness 
guiding and shaping his experiences. The dialogue explores themes of suffering, surrender, purification, 
and the dissolving of fear around death. Bache emphasizes that pain, when embraced, leads to profound 
growth, and that death itself becomes understood as a passage into greater intimacy with the universe. </p>

<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Eventually I came to understand that the many deaths that one endures in this process are 
actually symptoms of purification. The form that you are can die, the structures of your life can be shattered, 
but the inner essence of your being cannot die. I began to realize that what we experience as death is actually 
a deep form of purification—letting go of the small in order to welcome, and be welcomed by, that which is 
larger.</p>

<p><strong>TAMMY SIMON:</strong> Hello friends, welcome. I’m so happy that you’re here with us for <em>Insights at the Edge Live</em>. 
In this episode, my guest is Christopher M. Bache, PhD. Let me tell you a little bit about Chris. He’s professor 
emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught 
for 33 years. He’s also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, emeritus fellow at the 
Institute of Noetic Sciences, and he’s on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. </p>
<p>He’s written several books including <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, <em>The Living Classroom</em>, and a book that got my 
attention—friends of mine told me, “You’ve got to read this, it’s called <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>.” 
They said it was engrossing, a page-turner, and that it would actually introduce me to the idea of the mind of 
the universe. And if there was ever a moment where I think it’s appropriate to say this conversation will be filled 
with insights at the edge, it’s this one. Chris, welcome.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Hi Tammy, it’s a pleasure to be here with you this evening.</p>
<p><strong>TAMMY SIMON:</strong> Tell us a little bit right at the beginning. What prompted you to engage in—ready for this—
over 20 years of 73 high-dose LSD sessions, structured in a specific way for the purpose of deep spiritual 
awakening and exploring the nature of the cosmos? What inspired you to take on such an arduous undertaking?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Well, I had just finished graduate school. I got my PhD from Brown University in philosophy of 
religion. I had published my dissertation in a series of articles and was looking for where to take my work next. 
At that point in my life I encountered the work of Ian Stevenson on reincarnation research at Virginia, and more 
importantly the work of Stan Grof. As soon as I read <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>, which had just been 
published, I immediately saw the profound implications of Stan’s work for philosophy of religion, not just 
psychology. I knew I wanted to get involved in doing this work. </p>
<p>Even though LSD had been made illegal in 1970, I chose to conscientiously break the law and begin a series of 
rigorously structured LSD sessions, following Stan’s protocol. After three medium-dose sessions, I chose to 
work at high doses. It’s not a protocol I would recommend today—I would be much gentler on myself if I were 
doing it again—but at the time, this is what I was doing to accelerate my own spiritual development. It quickly 
evolved into engaging the deep structures of human evolution, supporting humanity’s spiritual development, 
and exploring this marvelous universe that we are part of.</p>
<p><strong>TAMMY SIMON:</strong> Right at the beginning of your book you write: <em>In the end what’s important is not the method 
of exploration used, but what it shows us about the extraordinary universe we live in.</em> That’s what I want to 
focus on—your discoveries. Let’s start with the title of the book: <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe.</em> The 
universe has a mind? Tell us what you discovered about this.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> As I came to experience it, I experienced consciousness as an infinite ocean. When we open 
ourselves in deep psychedelic states, our mind is like a seed catalyst dropped into this ocean. It crystallizes a set 
of experiences out of infinite potential. By absorbing these experiences, internalizing them, and learning what 
we are being taught, we are changed, purified, transformed inwardly. Then, when we drop that changed mind 
back into the infinite potential, it triggers an even deeper set of experiences. </p>
<p>I always experienced myself as engaging an intelligence, a consciousness that was directing my sessions. I never 
controlled what was unfolding. I always yielded to a lead coming from deeper levels of consciousness. As the 
journey continued, the levels of consciousness I entered deepened multiple times. </p>
<p>So what do we call this infinite consciousness? It’s been called many things in the world’s mystical traditions. I 
hesitate to call it God, though I sometimes use the term Divine, because the word God carries so much historical 
overlay. To approximate the vast scale and scope of this consciousness, I call it the mind of the universe. Just as 
the universe has a body, it has a mind. Our mind, like our body, is a product of the universe. When we sink 
deeply into consciousness, we come out into a vast consciousness you could call Divine, or the mind of the 
universe.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this Psychedelics Today interview, hosts Joe Moore and Kyle speak with philosopher of religion <strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong> about his twenty-year project of 73 high-dose LSD sessions and the book it produced, <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. Bache recounts beginning as an atheistically inclined academic before encountering Stanislav Grof and Ian Stevenson, then committing to a rigorous, carefully recorded protocol at 500–600 µg LSD with curated, often indigenous, music. He outlines a staged progression through personal, collective, archetypal, and causal levels into diamond luminosity, sharing episodes of deep time, species-mind work, and the “birth of the future human” via the ignition of lifetimes into a “diamond soul.” He contrasts LSD with psilocybin and ayahuasca, reflects on classroom morphic fields and integration challenges, cautions against emulating his dosage strategy, and argues that psychedelics can catalyze the collective transformation demanded by our civilizational crisis.</p>
<p><em>[Music]</em></p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> Hello everybody, welcome back to Psychedelics Today. This is Joe Moore coming at you from Breckenridge, Colorado. On this episode, Kyle and I talk to Dr. Chris Bache, who undertook 73 high-dose LSD sessions over many years and brought back extraordinary insights in personal growth and beyond. The book is <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. Enjoy the episode.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> We also have our course, Navigating Psychedelics for Clinicians and Therapists. It’s eight weeks with masterclasses and live discussions. Details are on our site.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> If you want to support us, share the show or visit our Patreon. Thanks for tuning in, and now our conversation with Chris.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> Hello everybody. Today on the show we have Chris Bache, professor emeritus at Youngstown State University and author of <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. We’re also running a giveaway. Chris, thanks for joining us.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thanks for having me. I’m delighted to be here.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> I’d been tracking your long-term project for a while and was excited when the book came through. How do you like to start this story? Maybe with how psychedelics came onto your radar?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I had just finished graduate school in religious studies and was publishing from my dissertation. I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work and it snapped my head around. I didn’t have a psychedelic background and was, frankly, an atheistically inclined agnostic. Grof convinced me that this mattered for philosophy of religion, not just psychology. LSD was illegal, so I split my life: I taught conventional courses by day and began a 20-year LSD journey following Grof’s paradigm and, eventually, pushing its limits. I kept meticulous notes and knew that after I retired I would share what had been learned.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> Did you have any spontaneous mystical experiences before this that paved the way?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> No. In many ways I’m the last person you’d expect to write this book. I grew up in Mississippi, earned a theology degree at Notre Dame, and had no early mystical flashes. What shifted me were Ian Stevenson’s reincarnation research, which argued for post-mortem continuity, and Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>, which provided a method.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> What did your protocol look like?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Conventional set and setting: complete isolation, a trusted sitter, and carefully curated music. The difference was dose. After three medium sessions, I moved to 500–600 micrograms. Partly it was efficiency within a busy life, partly the belief that larger “karma bites” might accelerate awakening. Over time, the project moved beyond personal enlightenment into a collective and cosmological engagement. I also shifted the playlist toward more indigenous chanting and rhythm because it intensified and supported deeper surrender.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> How important is music at high dose?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Very. Music amplifies and concentrates the process—five to ten times, in my experience. I’ve done sessions without music, but for very high doses, music is a powerful ally.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> Your book covers 73 high-dose sessions. How did the journey unfold?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Systematically and in layers. Shattering the ego isn’t the end; it’s an entry visa. The universe took me in by degrees. Each consolidation at a new level was followed by another death-rebirth as the method pushed me to that level’s edge. Looking back, I distinguish five bands: the personal mind culminating in ego death; the collective mind at subtle levels involving species dynamics; archetypal realities beyond the species field; causal mind and nondual oneness; and, finally, a luminosity I call diamond luminosity, akin to dharmakaya in Buddhist terms.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> Do therapists need to understand these levels?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> If you’re accompanying people into deep states, personal familiarity is essential. Theory helps, but when someone is terrified of losing everything they know, you need embodied experience to hold the room. That said, modern clinical work is rightly cautious—using gentler medicines and lower doses within clear protocols. The window closed once; we must steward its reopening.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> How do we talk about integration when clients report radical transpersonal experiences?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Read deeply in transpersonal literature, but know that without lived exposure you’ll misread correlations and miss the phenomenological nuance. My own arc spanned 20 years of sessions and 20 years of digestion. Guiding at depth is less about directing and more about stable presence as someone approaches the edge of reality and lets go.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> You mentioned your students being affected by your private work. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> As I went deeper, strange resonances appeared. While lecturing, examples would just arrive, and after class students would say, “That exact thing happened to me this week.” Over years, I saw two dynamics: spontaneous resonance between my field and theirs, and a cumulative learning field around courses—what I called affective group fields in <em>The Living Classroom</em>. Hundreds of students’ learning co-generated fields that accelerated subsequent learning. Let go of atomistic psychology and it becomes coherent: we’re participating in a quantum-like, relational cosmos.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> How do LSD, psilocybin, and ayahuasca differ for you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My sense—heavily conditioned by how I worked—is that psilocybin tends to stay more embodied and personal than my high-dose LSD work, and ayahuasca opens deeper than psilocybin in disruptive, somatic ways. LSD, at the dosages I used, eventually opened vast cosmological domains. Also, traditional plant medicines carry species history and spiritual agencies; LSD lacks that lineage field and can feel “cleaner.” I don’t recommend replicating my dosage strategy; if I did it again, I’d balance high with lower doses and include more embodied medicines.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> Could you share a late-phase experience?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Time reconfigured. For a year I experienced my entire life simultaneously present—beginning to end—distilled into the now. Later I entered archetypal domains: not static Platonic ideas but living beings of unimaginable magnitude, orchestrating time and space. Deep-time visions of humanity’s future became a major theme: a species-level metamorphosis underway. Causally, there was overwhelming oneness and cosmic love; beyond that, voidness and then diamond luminosity, whose clarity eclipsed all else. Once I touched it, returning to it became my sole aim. Over four years and twenty-six sessions, I reached it only four times, with intense purification in between.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> You write about the “birth of the future human” and the “diamond soul.” What is that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In one session, lifetimes condensed—like string wrapping a spindle—and then fused. The fusion ignited a diamond light from my chest and launched me into a new order of consciousness. Reincarnation often feels incremental: a little more compassion, a little more clarity. But over thousands of cycles of expansion after death and contraction into birth, a threshold is crossed. The full soul wakes up inside incarnation. That is the diamond soul: transparent to the cosmic intelligence, related to other eternal beings with deep compassion, and no longer tempted to identify narrowly with ego. I think this is where humanity is headed, collectively.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> Many listeners fear death. What would you say?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> We’ve got it backwards. Dying can be unpleasant, but being dead holds nothing to fear. Near-death research aligns closely with my deepest sessions. We go home. There are layers and work to do, but fear dissolves in the larger embrace. The work—the heavy lifting—happens here. Time-space is the weight room.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> I had a near-death experience at sixteen and felt that blissful return home. Coming back was hard, and integration was long. Your comment about the weight room resonates.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The hardest chapter for me to write was “Coming Down the Mountain.” I thought I had integrated each session carefully, but integrating an entire journey is different. After stopping, I entered a profound loneliness—waiting to die so I could return to the light. That was a failure of integration rooted in an imbalance: I had pushed transcendence so far I lost footing in immanence. It took a decade of deliberately grounding in the immanent divine—through contemplative practice—to inhabit my time-space suit with ease again.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> That’s a powerful caution.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My story is a cautionary tale as much as a celebration. Even with meticulous method, you can go deeper than you can productively use. These experiences changed not only my remaining years but, I believe, the trajectory of my soul’s evolution across lifetimes. Now, as an elder, I cultivate Vajrayana and classical contemplative practices as primary means of intimacy with the Real. Also, it’s important not to judge psychedelic work solely by the enlightenment yardstick. My personal awakening was eventually eclipsed by collective healing and cosmological exploration. Those are different projects.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> Do you see psychedelics aiding the civilizational transition we’re in?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes, and just in time. Psychedelics are to inner science what the telescope and microscope were to outer science: they expand the data set and force theory change. Temporary openings into deeper orders, even for ordinary people, can re-draft our metaphysics and ethics. Our culture—built by ego—is fragmenting; the species field is hyper-stimulated by global trauma. As systems enter nonlinearity, latent connectivity activates and small inputs can catalyze large shifts. Psychedelics can accelerate maturation so we can meet this pivot more consciously.</p>
<p><strong>KYLE:</strong> Feels like time is speeding up. Everything changes under our feet.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Technology, norms, truth standards—so much is dissolving. It’s confusing and dangerous, but also extraordinarily exciting. I don’t think we’re victims. I think many of us chose to be here for this turn.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> Where can people find your work?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The book is on Amazon. I’ve posted papers at Academia.edu. An audiobook and website are in the works. The book is my clearest telling of the journey.</p>
<p><strong>JOE MOORE:</strong> Thank you, Chris. We appreciate your work and your time.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you both. You’re social catalysts; keep at it.</p>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In this inaugural episode of <em>StephenGray Vision</em>, writer-activist <strong>Steven Gray</strong> speaks with philosopher of religion</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache</strong> about <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven</em>. Bache outlines the disciplined,</p>
<p>20-year program of 73 high-dose LSD sessions that catalyzed his visionary map of humanity’s collective evolution.</p>
<p>He describes successive stages—from perinatal cleansing through archetypal, causal, and “diamond luminosity”</p>
<p>realms—culminating in revelations of a coming species-level death-and-rebirth. The discussion covers session</p>
<p>protocol, sitter responsibilities, music curation, and the need for daily spiritual practice. Bache and Gray reflect</p>
<p>on global crises as collective “labor,” the emergence of the “future human,” and the role psychedelics can play in</p>
<p>building a compassionate planetary culture. The conversation offers both practical guidance for deep psychonauts</p>
<p>and hopeful context for non-users engaged in humanity’s awakening.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> <em>[music]</em> Welcome, everybody, to the very first episode of the <strong>StephenGray Vision</strong> YouTube channel—</p>
<p>also available as an audio podcast on Anchor. The purpose of this series is to explore the possibilities of an</p>
<p>awakening humanity. I’m thrilled to launch with Professor <strong>Chris Bache</strong>. Before Chris speaks, let me read a short bio.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> Christopher M. Bache is Professor Emeritus in Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State</p>
<p>University, adjunct faculty at CIIS, and a Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. An award-winning teacher,</p>
<p>his work probes non-ordinary states, especially psychedelics. His books include <em>Life Cycles</em>, *Dark Night, Early</p>
<p>Dawn<em>, </em>The Living Classroom<em>, and—most recently—</em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe<em>, subtitled </em>Diamonds from Heaven*.</p>
<p>Chris, thank you for inaugurating this series.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s a pleasure and an honor, Steven. I’m delighted to join your maiden voyage.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> Let’s start with a concise “highlight reel.” In maybe five minutes, can you recount why you undertook</p>
<p>your 20-year LSD journey and sketch its arc?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Sure. Trained as a philosopher of religion, I was drawn to psychedelics for their capacity to probe</p>
<p>the mind’s depths. Over 20 years I completed 73 sessions at 500–600 µg—far beyond today’s therapeutic doses. The</p>
<p>protocol followed Stanislav Grof’s high-dose guidelines: eyeshades, headphones, indigenous-leaning music, a trusted</p>
<p>sitter—my then-wife Carol—and complete inward focus.</p>
<p>The journey unfolded in stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perinatal catharsis (≈2 years):</strong> Processing birth, death, and existential terrors; culminating in ego death and</li>
</ul>
<p>entry into early spiritual realities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dark night (≈2 years):</strong> A pivot from personal to collective purification—engaging millennia of species-level</li>
</ul>
<p>trauma.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Archetypal immersion:</strong> Learning how the human family lives as a single being within mythic dimensions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Causal reality:</strong> Boundaries dissolved; the universe pulsed as one life-form. I received a “benediction of</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>blessings.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diamond luminosity (final 5 years):</strong> Four visits to a hyper-clear light—what Buddhists call the <em>dharmakaya</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a culminating vision of humanity’s trajectory, the universe “wrapped up” our work in 1999.</p>
<p>Spirit then told me, “Twenty years in, twenty years out,” meaning it would take two decades to integrate. Indeed,</p>
<p>the book appeared 20 years after my last session.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> The book is stunning. For listeners who want the detailed linear narrative, I recommend your 2018</p>
<p>TimeWaver talk “Diamonds from Heaven.”</p>
<p>On safety: what are the essential elements of your protocol?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Isolation, a qualified sitter, meticulous set and setting, and music that tracks Helen Bonny’s</p>
<p>five-stage arc—ascending activation, crisis, breakthrough, peak, and re-entry. Indigenous chants proved more</p>
<p>powerful than Western classical pieces because unfamiliar languages prevent cognitive anchoring. The sitter’s job is</p>
<p>to protect, manage bodily needs, monitor music, and discourage premature externalization. Experience helps, but above</p>
<p>all the sitter must be steady.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> You’ve said you <em>wouldn’t</em> repeat the journey the same way. Why?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> High-dosing alone is taxing. Today I’d intersperse lower doses, alternate substances like psilocybin</p>
<p>or ayahuasca, and integrate more somatic practice. I also learned the path has no final terminus; the universe is</p>
<p>open-ended. A gentler pace would honor that.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> Many seekers won’t pursue such extremes. What guidance can you offer the broader community?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Whether or not one ingests psychedelics, consciousness does the work. Key principles:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Clarify intention</strong> and create a “clean kiva.”</p>
<p>2. <strong>Retain and integrate</strong>—journaling, art, or music strengthen the learning loop.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Daily spiritual practice</strong> grounds energy and insights.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Long-term engagement</strong> requires life stability; your circle is affected too.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Courage with discernment:</strong> Depth exploration suits certain temperaments; it’s not obligatory for awakening.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> Let’s pivot to your recurring vision of a collective death-and-rebirth. You saw no dates, but sensed a</p>
<p>species-level labor analogous to childbirth.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. From 1985 onward I was shown humanity approaching a decisive “before-and-after.” I experienced</p>
<p>it <em>as</em> the collective psyche—waves of agony followed by an explosive upsurge of compassion and clarity. Out of the</p>
<p>crisis emerges the “future human,” forged by the fusion of all past incarnations into a diamond soul. Ecological</p>
<p>breakdown appears to be the trigger, but the process ultimately births an enlightened planetary culture.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> You view COVID-19 as a rehearsal, not the main event.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Correct—an early contraction teaching cooperation, truth-telling, and resilience we’ll need for</p>
<p>deeper challenges.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> Your perspective is hopeful. You trust the universe wouldn’t bring us to labor if we weren’t ready.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Exactly. When fear rises, I remember the intelligence that carried life this far. The invitation is</p>
<p>to grow up—shifting from egoic adolescence to soul-centric adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> Beautifully said. As we close, where can viewers find you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My papers are on Academia.edu under “Chris M Bache.” Soon my website—<em>chrisbache.com</em>—will host news</p>
<p>and resources. Email remains <em>cmbache@ysu.edu</em>.</p>
<p><strong>STEVEN GRAY:</strong> Thank you, Chris. Your clarity and generosity set the bar for this series.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you, Steven, and blessings on your project.</p>

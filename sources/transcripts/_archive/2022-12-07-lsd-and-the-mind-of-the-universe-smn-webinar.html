<p>Chris Bache joins the Scientific &amp; Medical Network to outline the philosophical and spiritual stakes of his</p>
<p>20-year, 73-session, high-dose LSD exploration. Host David Lorimer frames the conversation around Bache’s</p>
<p>books <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> and the award-winning <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, praising their</p>
<p>relevance to today’s collective crisis. Bache details the demanding protocol he followed, moving from</p>
<p>perinatal cleansing through archetypal realms, causal oneness, and the “diamond luminosity” beyond the</p>
<p>Bardo. He emphasizes the participatory nature of psychedelic cosmology, the looming birth of the “future</p>
<p>human,” and the necessity of collective purification. Audience questions probe terminology, cosmological</p>
<p>scale, and the role of suffering. Bache reflects on post-journey challenges—existential sadness, enforced</p>
<p>silence—and calls for rigorous, collaborative psychedelic science. The session closes with a mutual</p>
<p>invocation of courage, creativity, and love amid apocalyptic change.</p>

<p><strong>DAVID LORIMER:</strong> Welcome, everyone. I’m tuning in from the Cathar region of southwest France.</p>
<p>I’m delighted to host Professor Chris Bache, whose passion is the philosophical</p>
<p>implications of non-ordinary states—particularly psychedelic ones. His books <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em></p>
<p>and <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em> speak directly to our collective moment. Chris, a very warm</p>
<p>welcome.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you, David. It’s an honor to share the experiences chronicled in</p>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. Tonight we’ll ask whether everyone can—though perhaps not</p>
<p>everyone should—access the cosmic mind through psychedelics. My 73 high-dose sessions, conducted</p>
<p>between 1979 and 1999, unfolded five strata of reality: personal, collective, archetypal, causal,</p>
<p>and diamond luminosity. <em>Ego death</em> was only the opening act; deeper deaths followed as species</p>
<p>identity and archetypal frameworks dissolved.</p>
<p>The work revealed three broad uses of psychedelics—therapeutic healing, spiritual awakening,</p>
<p>and cosmological exploration. I pursued the third, adhering to a stable protocol: 500–600 µg,</p>
<p>eyes-shades, curated music, the same sitter, exhaustive notes. That stability clarified the “window”</p>
<p>and allowed a coherent map to emerge.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID LORIMER:</strong> Your lineage rests on Stan Groff’s methods, yet you pushed beyond the original</p>
<p>therapeutic frame.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Right—eventually I called it <em>psychedelic exploration</em> to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>The journey’s heart was a devastating <em>ocean of suffering</em> embracing humanity’s entire history,</p>
<p>followed by ecstatic immersion in <em>deep time</em> and an <em>initiation into the universe</em>.</p>
<p>Archetypal reality then stripped away human identity; causal oneness delivered a</p>
<p><em>benediction of blessings</em>; and finally diamond luminosity revealed an extra-samsaric</p>
<p>radiance—yet even that proved only a waypoint. Session 50 exposed an “absolute light,” showing the</p>
<p>infinite depth of the Divine.</p>
<p><strong>PAUL:</strong> When you say “universe,” I picture galaxies. What do <em>you</em> mean?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I struggle with language. “God” carries baggage; “Divine” feels evasive.</p>
<p>By “universe” I point to the conscious intelligence birthing space-time. The images of nebulae keep</p>
<p>me humble; I know I’m touching only facets of an endless mind.</p>
<p><strong>BERNARD CARR:</strong> Did your encounters transcend the terrestrial? Were they truly cosmic?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Absolutely. After species death, I operated outside the collective psyche.</p>
<p>Diamond luminosity lies beyond archetypes and the Bardo itself—pure, pre-manifest light.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID LORIMER:</strong> Your vision of a collective dark night and the birth of the <em>future human</em></p>
<p>feels timely.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The 21st century will likely be our species’ purifying death: a nonlinear</p>
<p>systems crisis forcing an evolutionary leap. My task is to testify, not to time it.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE MEMBER:</strong> Why must learning come through suffering?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Forgetting and remembering appear woven into evolution. The universe is a</p>
<p>diamond-maker; pain fractures the old lattice so new brilliance can form.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID LORIMER:</strong> Final reflections?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Integration remains an open experiment. Holding memories of infinity inside</p>
<p>a time-bound life is daunting, yet I wouldn’t trade the adventure for anything.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In this two-hour live stream, host <strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE</strong> and co-host <strong>EMMY VADNAIS</strong> welcome philosopher</p>
<p>and psychedelic researcher <strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong> for an in-depth exploration of “diamond luminosity,” the</p>
<p>hyper-clear light state he encountered during 73 high-dose LSD sessions (1979-1999). Bache details</p>
<p>his Grof-inspired protocol, ego-death ordeals, integration practices, parallels with near-death</p>
<p>experiences, and his vision of humanity’s evolutionary “labor.” Audience questions range from safe</p>
<p>psychedelic use and meditation to suffering, reincarnation, and signs of the emerging “future</p>
<p>human.” Throughout, Bache emphasizes disciplined preparation, compassionate service, and the</p>
<p>possibility of birthing a soul-centered civilization despite looming planetary challenges.</p>

<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> <em>[off-air chatter]</em> Okay, we’ll shut that window and I’ll share my screen.</p>
<p>Is it minimizing? There we go. As of this moment announcements are going out to our followers,</p>
<p>and they’ll be logging in. They’ll hear everything we say, and their screens will look something</p>
<p>like this—little thumbnails of us.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> In just a minute I’ll start the countdown timer. For those joining, welcome!</p>
<p>Let us know in the chat where you’re watching from.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> Some viewers of the archive wonder why they must sit through ten minutes of</p>
<p>pre-show talk. Once we start the timer YouTube automatically makes the recording public. We could</p>
<p>download, edit, and re-upload, but then we’d lose this URL that’s already shared everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> And Zoom’s local recording isn’t the highest quality. If we re-edited, I’d want to</p>
<p>drop in book covers whenever a name is mentioned—that would delay release. It’s easier to remind</p>
<p>people they can fast-forward.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> Typically, by the end of the day three or four times as many people watch the</p>
<p>archive as attended live. How many years have I been doing this? I started interviewing in 1972,</p>
<p>but the YouTube channel is now ten years old.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> I first saw Jeff on public television back in 1987 when I was thirteen. Even then</p>
<p>he was interviewing amazing thinkers—Jacques Vallée, John Mack—on UFOs, consciousness, spirituality.</p>
<p>Those programs shaped my career in holistic health and intuition.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> From 1986 to 2002 we were syndicated on public TV. Funny thing: I was guided</p>
<p>into media by a dream at a time I didn’t even own a radio or TV. I was a long-haired Berkeley hippie</p>
<p>who thought broadcast media were phony—until that dream upended my life.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Another example of the deep wisdom of the world communicating through us.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> Emmy and I have streamed live on YouTube for about five years now, every two</p>
<p>or three weeks. Chris, how did you step into public speaking on these topics?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Early on I kept my LSD work under tight wraps. Only after publishing *Dark Night,</p>
<p>Early Dawn* in 2000 did I begin presenting at conferences and teaching at CIIS. I didn’t fully go</p>
<p>public until I retired from Youngstown State in 2013. <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em> came out in</p>
<p>2019; that formally brought me out of the psychedelic closet.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> <em>[timer beeps]</em> We’ve got about a minute before the program officially begins.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> Looking back, that dream urging me to broadcast and my early LSD experiences</p>
<p>primed me to act when opportunity knocked.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> <em>[addresses chat]</em> Welcome, everybody! Jeffrey Mishlove here with my co-host</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais and our honored guest Chris Bache. Chris is professor emeritus of philosophy and</p>
<p>religious studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct faculty at CIIS, emeritus fellow at the</p>
<p>Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. His books</p>
<p>include <em>Life Cycles</em>, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, <em>The Living Classroom</em>, and *LSD and the Mind of</p>
<p>the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*. Chris, we’re delighted you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you. It’s a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> To start, could you share a bit of your background? You’ve mentioned that you were</p>
<p>the last person anyone would expect to write a book about 73 high-dose LSD sessions.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I grew up in Mississippi and initially trained for the Catholic priesthood, earning</p>
<p>degrees in theology and New Testament studies. Ultimately celibacy and I didn’t get along, so I</p>
<p>shifted to philosophy of religion at Brown. The psychedelic sixties passed me by entirely. When I</p>
<p>began teaching in 1978 I discovered Stanislav Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>. If his</p>
<p>claims were true, psychedelics had profound philosophical implications. Despite my discomfort with</p>
<p>breaking the law, I committed to a private, tightly circumscribed research program using Grof’s</p>
<p>protocol—eyes-shades, music, sitter, high dose.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> Your “day job” remained conventional academia while your “night job” explored</p>
<p>deep psyche.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Exactly. I worked intensively for four years, paused six, then resumed for another</p>
<p>ten, completing 73 sessions between age thirty and fifty. Then I spent twenty years digesting and</p>
<p>integrating before publishing the book.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> Readers often feel they’re traveling with you because you included detailed</p>
<p>session notes.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That was deliberate. Before we can debate philosophy we need a thick description of</p>
<p>what actually occurs in deep sessions. I had to lose my academic voice and cultivate a new</p>
<p>narrative style.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> Listeners keep asking about near-death experiences.</p>
<p>How close do your LSD sessions feel to NDEs?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The phenomenology overlaps strongly.</p>
<p>Near-death experiencers get one immersion; I had dozens.</p>
<p>Repeated entry turns a flash revelation into an extended dialogue</p>
<p>with the cosmic mind.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> Some viewers wonder why you didn’t hike in nature on LSD.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Nothing wrong with that,</p>
<p>but my goal was inner cosmology.</p>
<p>Eyeshades, darkness, and music eliminate external input.</p>
<p>All energy flows inward, opening deeper strata of psyche.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> Describe the mechanics—dose, setting, music.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After three medium-dose openers</p>
<p>I settled at 500–600 µg—right at the body’s absorption ceiling.</p>
<p>Morning start, yoga, prayer, then ingestion.</p>
<p>Carol—my wife and sitter—managed a pre-scored playlist.</p>
<p>I lay motionless under eyeshades.</p>
<p>The next morning I replayed each track, writing until every memory</p>
<p>anchored on the page.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> Why such high doses?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I replicated Spring Grove’s late-stage cancer protocol,</p>
<p>but extended beyond their three-session limit.</p>
<p>Back then I assumed “more sessions = deeper data.”</p>
<p>Today I’d choose gentler ranges and mix synthetics with organics.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> Viewers ask legal and safety questions.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I never encourage breaking the law.</p>
<p>Ketamine is currently legal; MDMA and psilocybin will follow.</p>
<p>Always test street substances through anonymous labs.</p>
<p>And remember: meditation, yoga, breathwork can reach similar depths</p>
<p>without legal risk.</p>

<h3>Diamond luminosity</h3>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> The title of this episode comes from your phrase</p>
<p>“diamond luminosity.” What is it?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In my final twenty-six sessions I was catapulted</p>
<p>into a hyper-clear, crystalline light—far beyond earlier light visions.</p>
<p>Buddhists call it <em>Dharmakāya</em>, the clear light of absolute reality—</p>
<p>the womb of the Big Bang.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with physical diamonds,</p>
<p>though <em>Vajra</em> and Diamond Sutra imagery overlap.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> What core lessons did you bring back?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>1. A single intelligent love underlies everything.</p>
<p>2. The universe is that intelligence’s body.</p>
<p>3. Love is the motive force of creation.</p>
<p>4. Reincarnation is fact; evolution spans eons.</p>
<p>5. The aim isn’t escape but birthing a soul-centered Earth.</p>
<p>6. Ego must die, yet individuality refines rather than vanishes.</p>
<p>7. Humanity now enters labor to deliver its collective soul.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Audience Q&amp;A</h3>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> <em>[reading chat]</em></p>
<p>“What population should avoid psychedelics?”</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Anyone with unstable physiology or psychosis risk.</p>
<p>Amplifiers magnify what’s latent.</p>
<p>A strong support network and screening are essential.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE (ROBERT BUSHMAN):</strong> What is consciousness? Infinite fractal?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Consciousness is the knowing field itself—borderless.</p>
<p>Our brains gate a slice of that field.</p>
<p>Depth practice widens the aperture.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE (GREASY SLICK):</strong> Have you tried DMT?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes—N,N-DMT, 5-MeO, San Pedro, MDMA, ketamine.</p>
<p>Powerful, but short windows.</p>
<p>LSD’s long arc allows deeper cleaning and integration.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE (CELIA FUNK):</strong> Does “diamond” mean actual gemstones?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> No—metaphor for ultra-clarity.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE (FIRST DEACON GEMINI):</strong></p>
<p>Difference between ego death and derealization?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Derealization is pathological detachment.</p>
<p>Ego death is sacramental surrender—temporary dissolution</p>
<p>within a safe container, after which ego returns transparent.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE (MEGAN SALAR):</strong> What’s your daily practice?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Morning meditation, Vajrayāna <em>chöd</em> for clearing,</p>
<p>evening soul-integration prayer.</p>
<p>Teaching itself became a spiritual art.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE (PABLO GERALDA):</strong> First-time advice?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Build meditative stability first.</p>
<p>Use legal avenues.</p>
<p>Test substances, secure an experienced sitter, prepare integration.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE (FABIAN FABIUS):</strong></p>
<p>How do we square creating paradise with the need for suffering?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Zoom out to galactic time.</p>
<p>Humanity is an unfinished species—maybe 5 % complete.</p>
<p>Suffering is the crucible forging soul maturity.</p>
<p>As we evolve, collective suffering will decline.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE (XANDER):</strong> Any synesthesia?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Rare for me; I internalize fully under eyeshades.</p>
<p>Others report rich cross-sensory blends, but it’s not my focus.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Birth of the future human</h3>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> You write about a “diamond soul” fusion of lifetimes.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After session 45 all prior incarnations spiraled into me,</p>
<p>igniting a white-light explosion.</p>
<p>I realised the soul eventually incarnates <em>whole</em>,</p>
<p>not as a fragment.</p>
<p>That synthesis marks the future human—compassionate, visionary,</p>
<p>devoted to planetary service.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> Signs we’re approaching that pivot?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> People who live for others—Gandhi, King,</p>
<p>but also anonymous teachers, nurses, volunteers.</p>
<p>Service is the soul’s signature.</p>
<p>We are gestating; labor will be painful,</p>
<p>yet a soul-centered civilization can emerge.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Closing remarks</h3>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> A hopeful vision to end on.</p>
<p>Chris, thank you for sharing your journey.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> Yes—deep gratitude for the wisdom and the hope,</p>
<p>even if the coming labor may hurt.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Pain can be eased if we cooperate with the process.</p>
<p>Many bodhisattvas—like everyone behind this program—</p>
<p>are already midwifing the birth.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:</strong> To our viewers: subscribe to the free newsletter,</p>
<p>download the first eight issues of <em>New Thinking Aloud</em> magazine,</p>
<p>and stay tuned for daily videos.</p>
<p><strong>EMMY VADNAIS:</strong> Thank you all for being here—</p>
<p>you’re the reason we do this.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Blessings on the journey, everyone.</p>

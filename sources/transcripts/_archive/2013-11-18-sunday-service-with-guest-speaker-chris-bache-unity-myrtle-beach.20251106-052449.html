<p>You as I am. I can see that I forgot to be me. I know that life is meant for living free. Look inside and find a place where I am.</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Jennifer, please welcome me and everyone here today. She's moving back to the area. So welcome back to your neighborhood! We want to welcome everybody here today. Let's stand again and sing "Rise Up." </p>
<p>Oh, and before we begin, I have a church announcement: first order of business after rising up is to turn off your cell phones. Please, cell phones interfere with our sound system, and we're already dealing with two poles that cause interference. So let’s be considerate and turn off any devices. </p>
<p>Now, let’s all take a deep breath, and if it feels comfortable for you, close your eyes. Let’s allow ourselves to be fully present in this sacred space, dedicated for a long time to opening hearts and awakening minds. It's a place to access our joy, peace, wisdom, creativity, faith, and strength as we commit to keeping growing, deepening, and awakening. We give thanks for this place and for all those who came before us, who had the vision to establish a movement called Unity.</p>
<p>Today, we open our hearts and minds to feel our unity with all of life, with all of humankind, and with the one presence known by many names. The service is turned over to spirit, and so it is. </p>
<p>Now, let's say together the Lord's Prayer, translated from the Aramaic language of Jesus: </p>
<p>Please, Father-Mother, birther of all, create a space inside of us and fill it with your presence. Let oneness now prevail. Your desire flows through ours as energy fills all forms. Give us this day our physical and spiritual nourishment and untangle the knots of error behind us. As we release others, do not let appearances make us forgetful of the source but free us to act appropriately. Through you flows the glorious harmonies of life. May these words be the verbal statements through which our future grows.</p>
<p>Let’s take a deep breath. Each Sunday when we gather like this, I hope you can feel the incredible presence of spirit that surrounds us when we connect with these words consciously—it's a powerful experience.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know me, my name is Margaret Hiller, and I'm privileged to serve as the spiritual leader here at Unity. I'd also like to introduce our morning team. It takes a village to create a church service! Our ushers this morning are Carl O'Brien and Terry de Mario, who are back there on the bench. Our video readers and ushers include Fania Healy, and our sound engineer is Melody. </p>
<p>Now, for our music team: Ryan is on saxophone, Bill is at the piano, Kevin has his guitar, and Dan and Tom are drumming. A shout out to many volunteers who help make this experience happen! </p>
<p>Okay, we’re going to sing another song, and Lily's going to help us with this one too. Let me tell you a little bit about her. Lilly Russ is originally from Georgetown, South Carolina, and she has been known to perform all over, doing plays and special events. She’s affiliated with the Agape International Spiritual Center, where she’s not in the choir but does share her voice. Many of you might know Agape from the works of Michael Beckwith and Rickie Byars. </p>
<p>Now, as we begin this next song, we will also pass the duos, which is not our regular offering but collects your loose change to help folks in our community who need extra support from time to time. </p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I have peace like a river in my soul. </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
And I'll bring joy like a mountain. Life is like the ocean in my soul. </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
This morning, I’d like to invite all the children—tall and less tall—up here. Chris, would you hold my hand?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I’m ready to take notes! </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Hey, everyone! I want to know your names. There's only one person up here whose name I know right now, and that's Elijah. Is it Caleb and Tristan?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes!</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Wow! Caleb and Tristan and Elijah, that's great! Our teachers this morning are Miss Pam and Miss Rachel. Hey, Rachel!</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
So there is a very special holiday coming up. Does anyone know what it is? </p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
What happens on Thanksgiving? </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
That's right! It’s all about love. I’m so glad we’re talking about love today. What do we give thanks for?</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
What is included? Caleb, what do you think? </p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Everything!</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Exactly! What do we have to be grateful for? Can someone up closer share something into the microphone? </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Do we give thanks for being able to go to school? Is there somewhere in the world that you can’t go to school?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
And we give thanks for our families, for life!</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Yes! One of the things we are very grateful for is that you guys come here to remind us that we are the light of the world, and that you have so much to teach us. We’re thankful you’re here because each one of us has a part in telling the wonderful story of our human family awakening, realizing we can be love and kindness in the world, creating a better world for everyone. </p>
<p>So let’s all stand and give thanks for you with our blessing, which will be on the screen. Please turn towards the congregation and extend your hands: </p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
We love you, we bless you, we appreciate you, we behold Christ in you, and we love you just the way you are.</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Let’s go over a few announcements now. Our meditation class is fabulous! This session will continue through December 10. Our contemplative service is held Wednesday nights at 5: 30, followed by our oneness blessing in the peace chapel. </p>
<p>Tonight, my sister Pam and I will be going to a special event. I’ll be one of the speakers for the Day of Remembrance memorial for victims of hate crimes due to sexual orientation. That’s at 7 PM at Dance Plaza. </p>
<p>And—it’s time to decorate our sanctuary for the holidays! Sue, stand up! She’s the first to sign up for this beautiful project. We’ll have a Christmas tree for Hope House, which supports homeless kids in Myrtle Beach High School, and another tree for Regency Hospice. So, if you’d like to join in decorating for the holidays, please see Sue after service! </p>
<p>There’s more—our new Wednesday Book Group will be starting a new book called <strong>Daring Greatly</strong> by Brené Brown in a couple of weeks. So take a deep breath as we read this morning from <strong>How to Speak Unity</strong>. </p>
<p>For our affirmation today, let’s remember that we are created as human beings—not human doings. In our culture, we often believe that busyness equals importance, pushing ourselves past natural limits. Let’s say it together: </p>
<p>We are created as human beings rather than human doings.</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
It's important we take time to simply be, incorporating practices like meditation or walks in nature. Nature allows us to connect with our inner stillness. </p>
<p>Let’s read our Unity statement of purpose together: </p>
<p>I am the consciousness of Unity, a unified congregation nurturing spiritual growth, inspiring creativity, and expanding awareness of the divine. </p>
<p>And now, Lily, we invite you back to perform for us! </p>
<p>Lilly Russ: 
Good morning, everyone! </p>
<p>Lilly Russ: 
I want to share briefly about this song I’ll be singing. This song was born in a dream I had. I dreamt that Beyonce was singing this song to a man who was distraught and experiencing a difficult time in life. </p>
<p>As I woke up, I kept singing it, and during the performance, I’ll invite you to look into someone's eyes and share these words with them. </p>
<p>(Performance begins) </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
What a beautiful performance! Thank you, Lilly. Now, I’d like to welcome everyone, especially first-time visitors. If you're here for the first time, please stand, tell us your name, and where you’re visiting from. </p>
<p>Yes, ma'am? </p>
<p>Visitor: 
Pat Chene from Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Welcome, Pat! And you're here with Lilly from Georgetown? </p>
<p>Lilly Russ: 
Yes, but I'm back from California and it's my first time here since 1987! </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
How wonderful! Anyone else visiting from far away? </p>
<p>Visitor: 
Cindy Perry, I live in Myrtle's Inlet. </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Welcome to you! And anyone returning from a long time away? </p>
<p>Yes, ma'am? </p>
<p>Visitor: 
I never left in spirit. </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Welcome back! Anyone else? </p>
<p>Visitor: 
I'm Carl, I just moved here from the Washington DC area. </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Great to have you! </p>
<p>Margaret Hiller: 
Alright, we’ll now read the Daily Word. This is one of our oldest publications, with a beautiful affirmation this morning: </p>
<p>God is my comfort and my refuge. </p>
<p>Let’s say that together: </p>
<p>God is my comfort and my refuge. </p>
<p>The Daily Word continues, sharing that life is full of joy and sorrow, but no condition is beyond the comfort of spirit. Even before voicing our prayers, the comfort we seek is already available. </p>
<p>As we affirm our needs are met, we acknowledge our shelter in the loving embrace of the Divine Presence. </p>
<p>Okay, and how many of you were here yesterday for the workshop? A lot of people are involved! I've heard that many reported it was one of the best workshops they’d ever attended. Thank you, Chris!</p>
<p>Chris Bache is part of our community, partly through his connection with Ann Marie, who first introduced us to his work. With over 30 years of teaching and experience, he brings profound wisdom. </p>
<p>Today, Chris will share insights, and there’ll be a brief Q&amp;A after service for those interested. So, Chris, the floor is yours!</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Good morning, everyone. It’s been a while since I was here with you, but I'm glad to be back. </p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about overcoming the fear of death and start with meditation.</p>
<p>(Leads meditation) </p>
<p>Let’s take a moment to reflect on our connections, the cycles of life and death, touching those who came before us and those to come. </p>
<p>(Continues with dialogue about the community and connectedness through time) </p>
<p>Feel the simplicity of the truth that life goes on—a natural, continuous cycle.</p>
<p>When it comes to our understandings about death, there's so much current research that changes our relationships with these concepts. For a long time, fear has tragically dominated society's views on death. </p>
<p>So today, I'll focus on 12 insightful books regarding death, centered in four areas: reincarnation research, near-death experiences, life between life therapy, and psychedelic research. </p>
<p>Now, let’s explore some of the most influential texts in each area to illuminate these important themes.</p>
<p>Chris Bache spoke passionately about the profound insights found in the works of David Ring, a professor and founder of the near-death episode movement. In his second book, <em>Heading Toward Omega</em>, Ring delves into what we can learn from near-death experiences, specifically focusing on the deepest experiences that individuals undergo. These accounts, which Bache described as “wonderful personal accounts,” reveal profound transformations in those who have had such experiences, shifting their perspectives on life, values, and even their physiology.</p>
<p>Bache reflected on the impact of these stories, highlighting how they resonate with all of us. He emphasized that this exploration helps us connect with a larger understanding of existence. However, he acknowledged skepticism; questioning whether near-death experiences might just be fantasy or wish fulfillment. To counter skepticism, he recommended the work of Pim van Lommel, a Norwegian psychiatrist, whose research offers critical and philosophical perspectives on near-death experiences. Bache pointed out that Lommel's conclusion is that attempts to dismiss these experiences fail, as they withstand scrutiny and reveal deeper truths about life and existence.</p>
<p>He also mentioned <em>Proof of Heaven</em> by Eben Alexander, a neurosurgeon who courageously shared his own near-death experience, despite potential backlash from the medical community. Alexander’s account resonates powerfully, especially given that he comes from a highly scientific background where discussing the afterlife is often taboo.</p>
<p>Transitioning to the topic of life between lives, Bache expressed admiration for Michael Newton's work. He described Newton's books, <em>Journey of Souls</em> and <em>Destiny of Souls</em>, as essential readings for anyone interested in the afterlife. Newton’s unique approach involved guiding people through hypnosis to not only remember past lives but also the intervening period between lives, enhancing our understanding of existence beyond physical death. Bache explained that life is a cycle, and to grasp its fullness, one must consider what unfolds beyond death.</p>
<p>In his overview of the spiritual realm, Bache emphasized the community aspect in the afterlife—a soul cluster that consistently accompanies us across incarnations. He elaborated on how this community aids our growth, tailoring their support based on individual needs.</p>
<p>Bache also touched on psychedelic research, sharing insights from Stanislav Grof, a key figure in transpersonal psychology. Grof's exploration of psychedelics, which he referred to as sacred medicines, addresses the transformative potential these substances hold in helping us remember who we truly are beyond our physical existence. He distinguished between recreational use and serious therapeutic application, signifying that when used responsibly, these substances can facilitate deep understanding and healing—essentially aiding in the dissolution of the fear of death.</p>
<p>Margaret Hiller interjected, summarizing Bache’s insights and expressing gratitude for his extensive research and mentorship from thinkers like Newton. She echoed the perspective that there’s much more to life than merely existing and that we are part of a larger spiritual community.</p>
<p>As the session transitioned, Hiller invited community members to participate in the ongoing wellbeing of their congregation through tithes and donations, emphasizing the beauty of their spiritual community. She invited attendees to take a moment to breathe deeply and reflect on their shared experience, acknowledging the presence of loved ones who watch over them, reminiscent of a “great cloud of witnesses.”</p>
<p>The gathering also featured Lilly Russ’s music, where Hiller encouraged everyone to connect with her after the service to bring some of that uplifting energy home.</p>
<p>As Hiller wrapped up the service, she shared upcoming events and opportunities for engagement, highlighting community involvement and personal spiritual growth. A prayer for protection was recited, reinforcing their collective commitment to love and light.</p>
<p>The service concluded with a hopeful message, inviting participants to stay for a question-and-answer session, reinforcing the community's supportive and welcoming spirit.</p>

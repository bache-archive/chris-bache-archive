<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Host Simeon welcomes philosopher of religion <strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong> to discuss the 20-year arc behind <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe (Diamonds from Heaven)</em>. Bache outlines his disciplined, high-dose LSD protocol inspired by Stanislav Grof, the five recurrent “deaths” and levels he traversed, and why—despite deep hazards—he pursued philosophy through expanded states. He argues psychedelics amplify consciousness rather than fabricate it, and he validates insights through personal integration, cross-cultural mysticism, and therapeutic literature. Topics include session method, musical curation, indigenous chant, writing techniques to recover experiences, and the balance of agony and ecstasy. The conversation then moves into reincarnation evidence (Ian Stevenson, Michael Newton), the “diamond soul” synthesis of many lives, reconciling non-self with a porous, evolving soul, collective healing framed by a leaf-and-tree metaphor, and the ethical stance of bodhicitta. Part 1 ends as they explore how individual work radiates through the human field.</p>

<h1>Part 1</h1>
<p><em>[Music]</em></p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> Welcome to the S2S Podcast. I’m Simeon, and it’s an honor to introduce our first guest,</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Bache. Chris is professor emeritus of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown</p>
<p>State University, where he taught for 33 years. His work explores the philosophical implications</p>
<p>of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. He has authored four books,</p>
<p>his latest being <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, which he prefers to call *Diamonds from</p>
<p>Heaven*.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> In this conversation, the first half covers the focus and chronology of Chris’s work.</p>
<p>In the second half, we go deeper into topics he has not often discussed at length, including the</p>
<p>nature of suffering and evil and how reincarnation and the doctrine of non-self can both be true.</p>
<p>Thanks for bearing with my early audio and video quality—fortunately, Chris does most of the</p>
<p>talking.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> To begin, could you give an overview of your work, what the book is about, and what</p>
<p>your experiences were?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The work began after graduate school in 1978, when I joined the faculty at</p>
<p>Youngstown State. I read Stan Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em> and immediately recognized</p>
<p>its importance for philosophy of religion. Stan described a careful method for entering deep states</p>
<p>of consciousness—both for healing and for exploring levels of mind beyond the personal.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I decided to adopt that method. Because LSD was illegal, I split my life in two.</p>
<p>By day I was a professor. In private, I undertook a disciplined journey using LSD, the substance</p>
<p>Grof had studied most extensively. I followed his early <em>LSD Psychotherapy</em> protocols: private</p>
<p>sessions, a trusted sitter, lying down, eyes closed, and music carefully paced for opening, deep</p>
<p>work, and return. After every session, I recorded the experience in detail.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I worked intensively for four years, paused for six, then resumed for another ten.</p>
<p>From 1979 to 1999, I completed 73 high-dose sessions. After three medium-dose starts, most sessions</p>
<p>were at 500–600 micrograms. I don’t recommend that protocol today. If I were doing it now, I’d</p>
<p>alternate high and low doses and balance LSD with more body-grounded medicines like psilocybin or</p>
<p>ayahuasca.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Over time, the universe led me through multiple deaths—each the threshold to a</p>
<p>deeper level of reality. Looking back, I count five major cycles: personal ego death; immersion in</p>
<p>the collective mind of our species; archetypal mind; the causal level of oneness; and, in the final</p>
<p>years, what I call diamond luminosity—the clear light of absolute reality.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> When I finished, a message came in meditation: “Twenty years in, twenty years out.”</p>
<p>It took 20 years to integrate the 20 years of sessions. The book arrived exactly two decades after</p>
<p>the work concluded. I share the story for journeyers and non-journeyers alike, because the emerging</p>
<p>cosmology and processes may help both.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> Skeptics often say, “If a state appears under a drug, why trust its insights?” When you</p>
<p>were in those states, how did you tell what you were studying? Cosmos, psyche, or something else?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Psychedelics don’t give experiences; they amplify consciousness. If you use that</p>
<p>amplification carefully—staying inward, recording faithfully—you trigger purification and encounter</p>
<p>the blockages lodged in your history, sometimes beyond this life. Early on you can verify memories</p>
<p>and measure changes in daily life. That builds confidence.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> As you revisit unfamiliar territories, the foreign becomes legible. The universe</p>
<p>seems to notice your attention and enters into a dialogue. It educates you. You gain personal</p>
<p>clarification, then collective and archetypal clarity, then spiritual insight. My academic grounding</p>
<p>in world mysticism let me compare my sessions with contemplative reports globally. There was a</p>
<p>strong fit—and sometimes a pushing of boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The experiential quality is unmistakable. You pay a real price to enter, but in</p>
<p>clear states the reality is transparent, even if partial or limited. Comparing notes with other</p>
<p>explorers—Grof’s compendium is huge—and with contemplative traditions strengthened my conviction</p>
<p>that these were genuine encounters with the structure of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> You began as a philosopher, not a therapist. Do psychedelics offer new philosophical or</p>
<p>spiritual insights we’ve not yet uncovered? How do they fit into philosophy’s future?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> This is a turning point. Psychedelics open a new method—articulated modernly by</p>
<p>William James—of systematic expansion, return, documentation, comparison, and re-entry. It lets us</p>
<p>probe dimensions usually inaccessible without lifelong practice, then evaluate them against science</p>
<p>and global mysticism.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Imagine a cohort of highly trained minds across disciplines following a disciplined</p>
<p>protocol, documenting, and comparing pattern-level findings. That’s the seed of a new philosophical</p>
<p>method grounded in expanded consciousness, not just sensory reason.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> For listeners new to your work, could you walk through a typical session day and your</p>
<p>protocol?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Sessions were at home or in my wife’s therapy office, starting early. I centered</p>
<p>with meditation or yoga, paying close attention to emotional and physical alignment—the body’s</p>
<p>structure matters when large energies move. My sitter through the 20 years was my first wife, Carol,</p>
<p>a clinical psychologist. After ingestion, she curated the music and safeguarded the container. With</p>
<p>high-dose LSD, verbal interaction was minimal. Sessions ran six to eight hours.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That evening I reflected. The next day I wrote a detailed account. I developed a</p>
<p>technique I call “standing at the edge of the well”: replay the session’s music in the same order,</p>
<p>let one foot slide back into the session while cognition is restored, and write that segment. Lock</p>
<p>the draft; don’t polish away its living texture.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> How did you use music? Some advocate silent darkness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Music doesn’t script the content; it supports surrender. I followed research</p>
<p>lineages (Helen Bonny, then holotropic breathwork) for pacing. Indigenous chant proved especially</p>
<p>potent—unknown languages free the mind from semantic capture. At peak, I used expansive, wordless</p>
<p>music; on the long LSD descent, gentle spaciousness. No lyrics in a language I understand. And I</p>
<p>rarely used a piece more than three times; it “soaks up” prior sessions.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> People may imagine visionary work as exciting, but high-dose work often becomes</p>
<p>difficult. How did that unfold for you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Grof distinguished psycholytic (low-dose, gradual) from psychedelic (high-dose)</p>
<p>work. High-dose work, like at Spring Grove with terminal patients, aims to break through into cosmic</p>
<p>reality—often limited to three sessions. I wondered what would happen if you kept going.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It took about two years to clear perinatal layers and undergo ego death. Then came</p>
<p>a different order of ordeal: vast seas of collective suffering—violence, war, brutality—like</p>
<p>Dante’s inferno multiplied. I would be submerged for hours until it crested and flung me into</p>
<p>ecstatic, visionary states. Pain and joy were proportioned; the ecstasy gave me strength to return.</p>
<p>After years, another death led to archetypal reality; another, to the causal oneness; later, to</p>
<p>diamond luminosity. The challenge deepened, but so did the grace.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> Your arc parallels daily spiritual practice—purification cycles, insight, bliss—even</p>
<p>without psychedelics. How did you weave daily practice with this work?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> There’s profound continuity. Reincarnation, to me, is a fact of existence. Life</p>
<p>oscillates: incarnate and narrow; die and expand; choose lessons; return and work them through.</p>
<p>Practice can accelerate that learning by engaging patterns in their “nuclear” form before they fully</p>
<p>externalize.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The deeper the temporary state, the stronger your daily practice should be. In my</p>
<p>last five years, working in diamond luminosity strained my subtle system. Vajrayana practice helped</p>
<p>my body-mind “breathe” those energies and stabilized dialogue with the universe. And remember: you</p>
<p>can’t take a psychedelic when you die. The mind you take is the mind you’ve made. Psychedelics can</p>
<p>teach you the territory of dying so it’s recognized as homecoming, but daily practice is the spine.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> Let’s move into the cosmic blueprint. Reincarnation became central in your work. What</p>
<p>convinced you—both in reading and in experience?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Two pillars. First, Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia. His lifetime of</p>
<p>fieldwork on young children who spontaneously recall prior lives—with verifiable details and</p>
<p>corresponding birthmarks or wounds in some cases—was decisive. *Twenty Cases Suggestive of</p>
<p>Reincarnation* opened the door; his later work on birthmarks deepened it.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Second, therapeutic literature. Many pains don’t resolve until you trace them into</p>
<p>former lives. Michael Newton’s <em>Journey of Souls</em> and <em>Destiny of Souls</em> mapped the inter-life,</p>
<p>including how souls review, heal, study, and choose their next incarnations. Choice quality likely</p>
<p>varies, but the process is intelligent and developmental.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In my sessions I sometimes revisited shared past-life threads with present-life</p>
<p>people and saw healing. In one session—the “birth of the diamond soul”—filaments of light from many</p>
<p>lives spiraled into a critical mass. They fused, and a blast of diamond light exploded from the</p>
<p>heart. I found myself an individual, but not Chris. I was the larger being that includes Chris and</p>
<p>many lives. I call this the diamond soul.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> How do you reconcile a reincarnating “soul” with non-self and non-duality? Are these in</p>
<p>conflict?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Only if we hold an atomistic soul—static and sealed off. I favor a field model:</p>
<p>porous, evolving, always in exchange, yet capable of coherent individuality. The Dalai Lama has</p>
<p>written that Buddhism rejects a static, independent soul, not the emergence of individuality. With a</p>
<p>field view, non-duality and a developing soul fit together.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> You’ve said private practice radiates into the collective. How does that work?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Think leaf and tree. If you could only see leaves and not the trunk and branches,</p>
<p>each leaf would feel separate—until one leaf traced its inner connection down into the tree. In</p>
<p>deep practice, the leaf dissolves into tree-consciousness and returns changed, knowing that what it</p>
<p>does to other leaves it does to itself.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In psychedelic practice I often found myself engaged in healing beyond the personal,</p>
<p>as if working a whole branch of leaves. Traditions recognize this. In Buddhism you cultivate</p>
<p>bodhicitta at the start, dedicating practice to all beings, and at the end you give away the merit.</p>
<p>It’s not for “me”—it’s for the field, which is what we are.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> I’ve pulled many passages from your book, but one in particular stands out. You write of</p>
<p>an “exquisite tenderness” from the Creator, who experiences every pain with us and wastes no tear.</p>
<p>That vision seemed to reframe suffering as meaningful. It reminded me of Dostoevsky’s *Brothers</p>
<p>Karamazov*, where Ivan rejects a God who allows the suffering of innocent children. You also faced</p>
<p>terrible vistas of suffering—“the killing of the children.” How do you answer Ivan’s challenge?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s the hardest question. Ramakrishna said if you want to understand God, you must</p>
<p>look suffering in the face. I’m sympathetic to atheism’s rejection of small theisms; many images of</p>
<p>God are too tiny. But in deep states I dissolved into a creative intelligence unimaginably vast in</p>
<p>time and space—billions of years, countless galaxies. From that vantage, the human story is early</p>
<p>and incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Suffering comes from multiple sources. Some reflects the inertia of nature; some</p>
<p>reflects the consequences of our choices; some is simply the strain of incompleteness in an</p>
<p>evolving world. If we freeze the process “as is,” the indictment seems justified. But if we can</p>
<p>taste deep time, a longer arc appears. The universe is learning through us, and we are learning into</p>
<p>the universe.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In later sessions I was taken into what I call the Great Awakening. I experienced a</p>
<p>species-scale crisis—ecological and systemic—that felt like a psychospiritual death. It looked like</p>
<p>extinction, then the storm’s eye opened. Survivors arose with new capacities: direct experience of</p>
<p>oneness, compassion extended to all life, and a clearer channel to cosmic intelligence. From that</p>
<p>download, solutions came more easily. This was the birth of the “future human,” the diamond soul</p>
<p>incarnate.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> Hearing that dissolves much of the anxiety around death and our future. It brings to</p>
<p>mind Jung’s line: life is a short interval between two infinities—which may be one.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Beautifully put. Dying is homecoming. I’m not trivializing grief or loss, but I</p>
<p>wish I could give everyone freedom from fear of death. It changes how you live.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> Jung also said, “I’d rather be whole than good.” He had great respect for the psyche’s</p>
<p>dark side. Does evil fall away as the ego falls away, or does it integrate into some larger order?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I distinguish darkness from evil. Darkness is the inertia of existence—the</p>
<p>resistance creation works through. Evil is life twisted in upon itself, cut off from source, a kind</p>
<p>of cancer of the field. The path is radical inclusion: embrace every exiled part so nothing is left</p>
<p>out of redemption. That integration yields a higher-order goodness—wise, not naive.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> After you concluded sessions in 1999, it took two decades to publish *Diamonds from</p>
<p>Heaven*. How did writing and speaking change you? What remained to do in this life?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I stopped for several reasons. Diamond luminosity made returning to time and space</p>
<p>increasingly painful—coming back hurt. I was also running “too hot” energetically and needed to</p>
<p>recalibrate. But the deeper issue emerged later: a sadness I called “waiting to die.” I’d plunged so</p>
<p>deep into the transcendent that I lost my foothold in the immanent—this world as divine.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The remedy was to recommit to embodiment and cultivate practices that honored the</p>
<p>sacred in matter. That took nearly a decade. A second problem was the “sickness of silence.” Because</p>
<p>of law and culture, I couldn’t speak openly in my academic life. I integrated privately, but not</p>
<p>historically—I couldn’t be who I was in public. Writing the book and now speaking have healed that.</p>
<p>Memories “congealed” differently; transparency increased.</p>
<p><strong>SIMEON:</strong> Is there anything we haven’t touched that feels essential?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> One more scene. In my 50th session, at the deepest clear light I’d known, my entire</p>
<p>field rotated ninety degrees. Far off, reality opened into an even higher light. A beam struck me</p>
<p>and shattered me. I realized then the journey is infinite. There is no final plateau, only deeper</p>
<p>openness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That insight pivoted my method. The aim isn’t to “arrive,” but to become porous to</p>
<p>the totality—letting more knowledge, energy, and compassion flow in and transform us all the way</p>
<p>down to subtle physiology. We stand between two realities: daughter universe (time-space) within the</p>
<p>mother universe (primordial). The art is to let the mother’s life infuse the daughter’s form.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Given that, I now recommend a gentler path: alternate intensities, balance</p>
<p>modalities, anchor in daily practice, and be patient with time. The universe is vast, and we are</p>
<p>learning how to love it from the inside.</p>

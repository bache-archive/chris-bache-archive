In this probing conversation, host James Jesso invites philosopher and LSD explorer Chris Bache to reflect on the

collective turmoil visible in today’s screen-mediated world. Bache draws on forty years of academic work and twenty

years of high-dose LSD journeys to propose that humanity is undergoing a planet-wide psychedelic initiation. The pair

discuss the necessity of radical self-responsibility, the mechanics of shadow projection, and why turning toward pain

is the only route to deep transformation. Bache argues that embracing more than one’s share of suffering—out of

compassion and commitment to the whole—triggers disproportionate blessings and accelerates personal and collective

evolution. The dialogue offers both a sobering diagnosis of our cultural moment and a hopeful roadmap for navigating

it with courage and integrity.

**JAMES JESSO:** For listeners who don’t know, this conversation sits atop your forty-year career in philosophy and

your twenty-year journey of high-dose LSD sessions chronicled in *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*.

What I’m seeing online is a world I don’t want to inhabit. I feel complicit in something distorted and ugly: toxic

behavior wrapped in self-righteous moralism—*I’m good, you’re evil, be gone*. It makes me want to hide.

If we frame this as a collective psychedelic process, the ugliness outside looks like the stuff that surfaces inside

a hard session. You write about not turning away from that pain. Could you speak to that?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The starting point of serious psychedelic work is total ownership of your shadow. You shut the door,

sit with your mind, and enter the most daunting, ugly parts you’d rather ignore.

When people project that unowned shadow, the world grows toxic. The breakdown we’re entering will dissolve the story

of *good us, bad them*. Eventually we must accept responsibility for the pain our lives and lifestyles create.

Some in the psychedelic community get this, because progress demands shadow work. Once you learn that deeper

purification brings deeper ecstasy, you begin to embrace the shadow. Not because you like suffering, but because you

know the reward on the other side—and because compassion moves you to carry pain that isn’t strictly yours.

If you take on more than your share of suffering, the universe responds with more than your share of blessing. Our

generation—and the next—will suffer more than previous ones. When we stop resisting and simply do the work, profound

gifts emerge from that generosity.

Complete surrender accelerates the transformation. On the far side of the ordeal you’re almost back where you

started, but the psychic debris is gone. You’re still you, yet living from a purified ground.

**JAMES JESSO:** That’s powerful—thank you. *italic brackets* *\[Music fades\]* *italic brackets*

<h3>Conversation with Chris Bache</h3>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** When we talk about the soul and reincarnation, one way I like to imagine it is through trees. Just as we eat time, the more we eat, the more weight of the soul we place on trees, causing them to grow bigger and bigger. Nature has many suggestive phenomena—it spirals and builds upon itself. I ask my students to visualize each petal of a flower as representing an entire life. Each petal could symbolize a hundred years, and the soul becomes the magnificent integration of these experiences, creating an identity that honors everyone.</p>
<p>Then there’s Carl Jung's mandalas, which to me represent the soul. They reflect a deeper identity that transcends individual experiences. Are you ready to dive into our next topic? </p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** Yes, I have a basic question. As the population increases, where are all these souls coming from?</p>
<p><em><em>Chris Bache: ** That's a great question, and I've addressed this in my book, </em>Life Cycles.</em> This issue becomes a problem only if we assume that the number of souls is finite. In the beginning, perhaps there were just 60,000 human beings on the planet. If we believe there were only 60,000 souls, we'd wonder how we arrived at 7 billion today. However, just as a university can grow from 3,000 to 13,000 students over decades, the same could be true for souls. They could be lined up, waiting for the opportunity to incarnate, just as students join an ever-expanding community.</p>
<p>Robert Monroe, who ventured into the non-physical realm after an out-of-body experience, suggested that each of us is here because we encountered a graduate of "earth school" and were awed by their energy. This drove us to incarnate ourselves.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** You mentioned being born three times. What could influence that early birth, considering factors like a smoking environment?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I can’t provide a specific formula for that. Reincarnation offers a new context for exploring these questions, but when we delve into past-life therapy, we often find reasons for our choices before incarnation. Every situation has its context, and once we get into the soul's memories, we can uncover those reasons.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** What about the concept of "walk-ins"? </p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Traditionally, souls must be born and grow through life stages, but there are cases where an existing personality seems to make way for another, which we refer to as walk-ins. Some believe that souls can exchange places voluntarily. This idea is controversial; some embrace it, while others are skeptical. It suggests an interaction between the spiritual and physical realms, hinting that we are already spiritual beings inhabiting physical bodies.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** Is that a recognized phenomenon?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, it is recognized, though it's a minor thread of discussion. </p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** I've believed in reincarnation for a long time, but when does it end? Are there completed souls?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** That’s a profound question. We became self-conscious as a species only about 35,000 years ago. When we began meditative practices around 5,000 years ago, we started uncovering our deeper spiritual truths. Many religions revolve around the notion of ascending and returning home. However, we must ask, why would the divine create a physical universe at all? These systems don't fully explain it. A more mature perspective views our purpose not as escaping this world, but integrating the spiritual and physical into a conscious unity.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** That sounds challenging to conceptualize.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** It is indeed challenging. For instance, when we die, we return to a renewed existence, but it's not merely about leaving the physical behind; it's about integrating deeper consciousness here. </p>
<p>**Margaret Hiller: ** It feels like discussing this can inadvertently suggest an "up and out" cosmology when it's more about integrating within ourselves.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Absolutely, it’s about bringing that knowledge into our conscious awareness. We may think we are traveling after death, but in truth, we’re often just shifting our consciousness rather than moving through physical distance.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** You mentioned losing a parent before. How do you perceive parental connections after death?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** That's a significant point. After my own father passed away nearly 45 years ago, I found comfort in the idea that although he may be reincarnated, his essence still exists in a larger spiritual context. Our souls don’t fully incarnate; much of our energy remains in the spiritual realm, which means when we die, we reunite with our loved ones on a deeper level. Their physical presence may be gone, but their spirit continues to influence us. </p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** So, we retain connections with our loved ones?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, they leave behind traces in us and in the world. When we die, we encounter their essence, and although we may recognize them in a familiar form initially, we ultimately connect with their soul. </p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** That makes sense. </p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** This understanding expands our perception of existence. Each soul carries the essence of our loved ones, fostering a living connection even beyond physical life.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: As we explore further, we've got Michael Newton's insights to consider. When we ask where the soul comes from, the answer suggests that the soul is teased out of the divine essence. Imagine the sun casting out silver flares; the soul is like one of these flares, embodying pure potential and yet still unactualized. There are beings whose sole job is to catch and nurture that energy, helping it to birth into self-awareness. It starts with the divine but takes shape as an individual self. This pure potential undergoes a journey of self-actualization, gradually becoming more like the divine.</p>
<p>The idea is reminiscent of how ancient Greek theologians described it as logos, the seeds of the Divine. We're all incubating these seeds into deeper actualizations. Ultimately, we develop a memory of our divine essence, realizing that everything and everyone around us is also part of the divine. This connection is profound—consider the phrase: "from God to God, always in God." We come from God, we return to God, and right now, we exist within God. Despite our sense of separation, we never truly departed, only lost understanding.</p>
<p>There's another aspect worth mentioning. Newton's work suggests that the God of this universe might not be the ultimate divine being. This universe, vast and immense as it is—measured in billions of light years—is just one of many universes. There are entities responsible for each universe, yet none of them represents the ultimate being.</p>
<p>When individuals recall what they were doing before birth, they encounter a divine presence. Those who have had near-death experiences often find it difficult to articulate what they saw. They realize that the concept of God as we know it is inadequate for the magnificence of the reality they confront. This reality, though magnificent, is still not the ultimate reality, merely the generative intelligence of our system. The questions that arise are: Are we safe? Is this life part of an intelligent, meaningful exercise, or are we lost in chaos? </p>
<p>We're beginning to understand that we are safe. Nothing can extinguish our existence. The notion of hell is primitive and disappears from this understanding. What we're engaged in is profoundly creative and fulfilling, even if it feels painful at times. Ultimately, our journey is meaningful and worthwhile.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Could this be why we return with knowledge, allowing us to start at a higher level rather than from the very beginning?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely. Think of it like a university student who majors in mathematics and builds skills over time. If they decide to switch paths and explore art, they may be a beginner in that discipline, but they’re not beginners as students. A person can appear to be starting fresh while holding deep soul knowledge. Integrating all our experiences and skills into one conscious presence is part of our development. We learn in stages, working through one minute at a time.</p>
<p>As I prepare to share another near-death experience, I see a hand raised.</p>
<p>Interviewer: I've noticed that reading older texts can sometimes be challenging. I've been looking at books from the '40s and '50s, and while they contain glimmers of insight, the expression often feels convoluted. Yet, the way you articulate these ideas feels so accessible, especially in the last few decades.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That's a key point. As more people understand certain ideas, the collective psyche evolves, making it easier for others to grasp those concepts. With past-life therapy, for instance, practitioners initially needed to induce deep trance states to access memories, but as time has progressed, accessing those memories has become easier. This aligns with Rupert Sheldrake's morphic field theory: when a capacity is acquired by some, it becomes easier for the entire species. We build on the accomplishments of those before us, creating a foundation for future generations.</p>
<p>Interviewer: It’s intriguing to think that people 200 years from now will essentially be us.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Right, and let me share another beautiful near-death experience. This one comes from a woman named Carl Parish Hanna. While traveling in a state of light, she describes a magnificent presence companioning her. She could hardly see its form, but a radiant light enveloped her, filled with an unparalleled tenderness. As this being spoke, she grasped profound truths about life and death, experiencing a state of complete serenity. Any fears she held dissipated in the realization of her ability to continue experiencing life beyond physical existence. </p>
<p>She felt a great expansion of awareness, realizing that consciousness itself is life. The purpose of life is inherent, flowing naturally, independent of her individual struggles. In that moment, she absorbed bliss, an indescribable dynamic energy that filled her completely.</p>
<p>Interviewer: That’s the kind of insight we can share with our loved ones as they approach their final moments.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Exactly. To fear death is to misunderstand life's full arc. I often remind my children that life is beautiful, and at the end, we get to graduate. Some cultures celebrate death as a joyful return home, equating it to graduation or a respite.</p>
<p>Interviewer: I had a near-death experience years ago, and while I returned with new energy and insights, the immediate transition back to daily life was jarring.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, many report feeling anger or frustration after their experiences. It's easy to question why they were brought back. Once someone has glimpsed infinity, returning to the everyday can feel like a heavy burden.</p>
<p>Interviewer: I was ready to leave and found myself in a state of pure bliss, then suddenly thrust back into my body.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It's common to experience a serene longing for that blissful state. Some believe there's a purpose to why we choose to come here, and when we return, we touch upon that divine truth, regaining a sense of understanding that drives us back into life. Even the struggles have their roots in profound love and understanding.</p>
<p>Interviewer: It’s remarkable how we can have such transformative experiences only to feel the weight of ordinary life again.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Time and space present challenges. It’s dense and can feel confining, but like a weightlifter who gains strength from lifting heavier weights, this existence allows us to develop spiritual muscles. It’s tough to navigate, but it’s a necessary part of our growth. We shouldn't see ourselves as exiled from paradise; instead, we’re here to embrace the depth of this experience and grow from it.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Definitely, and now it's time to take a break for lunch.</p>

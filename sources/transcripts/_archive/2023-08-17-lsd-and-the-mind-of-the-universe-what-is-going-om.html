      <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Veteran broadcaster <strong>Sandie Sedgebeer</strong> welcomes philosopher and</p>
<p>transpersonal scholar <strong>Christopher M. Bache</strong> to discuss his book *LSD</p>
<p>and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*. Bache recounts a</p>
<p>20-year journey through 73 high-dose LSD sessions inspired by Stanislav</p>
<p>Grof’s protocols. He explains how the work evolved from personal healing</p>
<p>into a collective purification, opening him to vast fields of suffering</p>
<p>and ecstatic revelation, culminating in encounters with the</p>
<p>“diamond luminosity” and visions of humanity’s evolutionary future.</p>
<p>Bache describes the birth of the “diamond soul,” a coming planetary</p>
<p>crisis that will catalyze a species-wide rebirth, and the role that</p>
<p>carefully guided psychedelics can play in individual and collective</p>
<p>transformation. The conversation explores reincarnation, the Bardo,</p>
<p>ecological collapse, and the emergence of a spiritually awakened human</p>
<p>species.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> Welcome to <em>What Is Going OM</em>, where we explore new</p>
<p>thought from the edge of OM. Today’s guest is Christopher M. Bache,</p>
<p>professor emeritus of philosophy and religious studies and author of</p>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven</em>.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> Thank you, Sandie. It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> In 1979 you began a 20-year exploration of your</p>
<p>mind using high-dose LSD. Had you known it would involve such intense</p>
<p>pain, bliss, and decades of integration, would you still have done it?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> I might have taken a gentler path—balancing LSD</p>
<p>with psilocybin or ayahuasca—but I would still have answered the call.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> You followed Grof’s high-dose protocol. How did you</p>
<p>choose 350-500 µg as your range?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> Grof’s research at Spring Grove showed that</p>
<p>range could trigger near-death–like experiences. I wanted efficiency,</p>
<p>believing I was clearing personal karma faster. I later realized the</p>
<p>work was far bigger than personal healing.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> When did you see it wasn’t just about you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> After two-and-a-half years I was plunged into</p>
<p>oceans of collective suffering—thousands of lives over millennia. It</p>
<p>became clear the sessions were purifying the species psyche, not merely</p>
<p>my own.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> You stopped for six years, then resumed and picked</p>
<p>up at the same depth. What did that reveal?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> The intelligence guiding the work never left.</p>
<p>My first session back resumed the collective suffering exactly where it</p>
<p>had paused.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> The pain sounded unbearable. Why keep returning?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> For the joy beyond the pain. Suffering was the</p>
<p>gateway to revelatory communion with the universe. <em>Italic brackets</em></p>
<p>mark it for clarity.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> One pivotal session shattered your male identity</p>
<p>by immersing you in lives of many women. Purpose?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> It broke my gender fixation so I could enter</p>
<p>states where male and female are irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> You taught philosophy but stayed silent about these</p>
<p>experiences. How did that affect you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> Eventually the split choked my voice; I would</p>
<p>literally bark when I suppressed answers drawn from my sessions.</p>
<p><em>italic brackets</em></p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> Let’s talk Bardo. Your journey went far beyond</p>
<p>classic maps.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> I confirmed multiple Bardo layers where souls</p>
<p>process lives, yet I also touched domains outside the Bardo—the diamond</p>
<p>luminosity: a blindingly clear light that dissolves karma instantly.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> You reached it only four times in 26 late</p>
<p>sessions. Why so rarely?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> Each contact triggered a year of further</p>
<p>purification before I was ready to return.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> You received visions of a planetary crisis and the</p>
<p>“future human.” Describe that.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> Humanity faces a species-level death-rebirth</p>
<p>catalyzed by cascading ecological collapse. On the far side emerges the</p>
<p>diamond soul—a spiritually awake species incapable of harming any being.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> Will psychedelics aid that transition?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> Used wisely, they accelerate healing and</p>
<p>revelation. The current psychedelic renaissance must pair science with</p>
<p>indigenous wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> Have you fully integrated your 73 sessions?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> No. The universe told me, “Twenty years in,</p>
<p>twenty years out.” Integration may span lifetimes.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> What’s humanity’s most urgent task?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> Own our shadow, restore communion with the</p>
<p>living universe, and nurture the birth of the future human.</p>
<p><strong>SANDIE SEDGEBEER:</strong> Chris, thank you for sharing this extraordinary</p>
<p>journey.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:</strong> Thank you, Sandie. <em>italic brackets</em></p>

      <p><strong>Abstract (≈140 words)</strong></p>
<p>Broadcast live from the I Am Awake Foundation Center, this episode of <em>Conscious Living Radio</em> brings</p>
<p>together host <strong>MARK KARAN</strong>, conference co-organiser <strong>STEPHEN GRAY</strong>, and philosopher of religion</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong> to explore the collective and personal impacts of high-dose psychedelic work.</p>
<p>Bache recounts his 20-year series of 73 LSD sessions, guided by Stanislav Grof’s protocol, and the</p>
<p>visionary revelations that followed—most notably humanity’s impending “death-and-rebirth” chrysalis</p>
<p>and the emergence of the “future human.” The conversation ranges from timelines for global</p>
<p>transformation and ecological crisis to the catalytic role of individual practice, reincarnation and</p>
<p>the “diamond soul,” and the importance of integrating head, heart, and body. Audience questions probe</p>
<p>christology, Teilhard de Chardin, collective care, and the accelerating impact of individual action</p>
<p>within non-linear systems. The session closes with reflections on the Spirit Plant Medicine</p>
<p>Conference as a ceremonial empowerment hub and a call for participants to embody courage, compassion,</p>
<p>and cosmic playfulness during this pivotal century.</p>

<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p><strong>MARK KARAN:</strong> Hello and welcome to <em>Conscious Living</em>. I’m Mark Karan, broadcasting live from the</p>
<p>beautiful I Am Awake Foundation Center, where consciousness research and transformational work take</p>
<p>place. Today’s episode is spear-plant-medicine-focused, and I’m joined by my good friend and</p>
<p>conference partner <strong>Stephen Gray</strong>. Stephen, always a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>STEPHEN GRAY:</strong> Thanks, Mark. I’m delighted. We’re airing on 100.5 CFRO-FM in Vancouver and have run</p>
<p>this program locally for over 15 years. I’m thrilled about our guest today, Chris Bache, whom I hold</p>
<p>in immense respect for the work he’s done on behalf of us all.</p>
<p><strong>MARK KARAN:</strong> Absolutely. Stephen, why don’t you introduce Chris?</p>
<p><strong>STEPHEN GRAY:</strong> With pleasure. Chris Bache is professor emeritus of philosophy and religious</p>
<p>studies, formerly at Youngstown State University. Early in his career he encountered Stanislav Grof’s</p>
<p>high-dose LSD protocol—500 – 600 µg per session—undertaking 73 sessions across 20 years. Each</p>
<p>session involved headphones, eyeshades, and a qualified sitter. The following day he’d replay the</p>
<p>music and meticulously transcribe his visions. He’s the author of <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>,</p>
<p><em>The Living Classroom</em> (a new edition is forthcoming), and <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>,</p>
<p>sub-titled <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>.</p>
<p><strong>STEPHEN GRAY:</strong> Chris, feel free to correct any nuances. My two-part opening question: first, did I</p>
<p>get the synopsis right? Second, you once suggested humanity’s renaissance might take hundreds of</p>
<p>years, then later thousands. Given the accelerating crises and simultaneous spiritual</p>
<p>re-connection, how are you seeing the timeline now?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you, Stephen and Mark. Your summary is generous. I’d strengthen one point:</p>
<p>these were less “messages” than deep immersions into trans-temporal states—“Deep Time.” Around year</p>
<p>twelve the visions pivoted to humanity’s evolutionary crisis: a karmic canyon leading to a</p>
<p>before-and-after event reshaping the collective psyche. In 1995 I experienced that crisis as the</p>
<p>species itself—an excruciating global systems breakdown triggered by cascading ecological collapse.</p>
<p>Yet on the other side lay an unleashed creative contagion, birthing a profoundly transformed human.</p>
<p>No dates were given; I rely on scientists for tempo. The 21st century is pivotal. We have perhaps</p>
<p>three or four generations—labor is short and life-threatening. I’m convinced we succeed, but the</p>
<p>question is: how many children will die before we come to our spiritual senses?</p>
<p><strong>STEPHEN GRAY:</strong> Powerful. You also imply nonlinear dynamics: small perturbations gain enormous</p>
<p>influence. That elevates individual responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Exactly. As crisis energy rises, history shifts from linear to nonlinear behaviour.</p>
<p>Individual actions—both light and shadow—magnify.</p>
<p><strong>MARK KARAN:</strong> Given that, what can individuals and groups practically do? How do we move from “me”</p>
<p>to “we” to “many”?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Others are better with specifics. From a reincarnational view, every soul chose to</p>
<p>incarnate now, fully aware of the turbulence. The deeper question isn’t <em>what</em> to do but whether we</p>
<p>have the courage. The essence is a pivot into Oneness: healing the heart, entering ecological</p>
<p>balance, embodying spirit in matter. Become the being Earth needs, and you enter synergistic</p>
<p>relationship with everyone doing the same.</p>
<p><strong>STEPHEN GRAY:</strong> Beautiful. Could you sketch the “future human”? Without a signpost, as Yogi Berra</p>
<p>said, <em>we might end up somewhere else</em>.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Our prototypes are the great saints across traditions. What’s new is scale:</p>
<p>individual enlightenment is passé; it’s collective enlightenment or extinction. Humanity is entering</p>
<p>a collective dark night—purifying the “sins of our fathers,” which are ours because we are our</p>
<p>fathers. Reincarnationally, all past lives are converging. In one session they fused and exploded in</p>
<p>diamond light, birthing a 100-thousand-year-old identity: the “diamond soul.” The future human lives</p>
<p>from that integrated, compassionate awareness, consciously remembering thousands of lifetimes,</p>
<p>openly communing with cosmic intelligence while deeply rooted in body and Earth.</p>
<p><strong>MARK KARAN:</strong> That’s breathtaking, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>STEPEHN GRAY:</strong> Indeed. Let’s open the floor.</p>
<p><em>Audience Q&amp;A begins.</em></p>
<p><strong>JACOB:</strong> Your book articulated stages I feel myself entering. How does your journey relate to</p>
<p>christology? Did you experience Christ-avatar states?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Christianity and Buddhism shaped me most, though teaching world religions made me a</p>
<p>universalist. The Christ archetype, for me, transcends Jesus—an impulse mirrored in every lineage.</p>
<p>In my sessions I rarely met individuated beings—no angels, machine elves, or spirit guides. The work</p>
<p>ground me to dust and merged me with the fabric itself. So christology informs my frame yet</p>
<p>didn’t manifest as discrete forms within the visions.</p>
<p><strong>JACOB:</strong> And Teilhard de Chardin?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Striking overlaps. Teilhard foresaw the noösphere and evolutionary pivot through his</p>
<p>geologist’s lens. His insights didn’t <em>cause</em> my visions but help interpret them.</p>
<p><strong>JACKIE H:</strong> Are psychedelics accelerating collective shifts? Some meditators use low-dose 5-MeO-DMT</p>
<p>as a nature-of-mind ally. If you ran a workshop, what would you train?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> A wholehearted yes to accelerating practice—but remember there is no private</p>
<p>spirituality. Every act registers in the species psyche. Classical bodhicitta rituals—dedicating</p>
<p>merit to all beings—remind us. Our healing, insight, and compassion infuse the field, just as our</p>
<p>harm does. My workshop would focus on that ethical, collective dimension rather than dosage.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL K:</strong> You carry hope. Will inspiration spread faster in the collective than before?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Nonlinear crisis amplifies everything—truth and lies alike. Yet nature tilts toward</p>
<p>growth. Individuals who embody the future human act as catalytic seeds, radiating subtle influence.</p>
<p>Contemplative communities have known this for millennia.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL KRAUSS:</strong> <em>[off-camera, technical note]</em></p>
<p><strong>MARK KARAN:</strong> Thanks, Michael. As we wrap up, a reminder: the Spirit Plant Medicine Conference is</p>
<p>more ceremony than conference—an empowerment hub. Join us virtually or in person. Chris, Stephen,</p>
<p>any closing words?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I love this intimate gathering. I’ll premiere the new edition of *The Living</p>
<p>Classroom*, finally telling how psychedelics shaped that work. I hope to see many of you there.</p>
<p><strong>STEPHEN GRAY:</strong> Please share this talk widely. Encouragement and collective prayer are essential</p>
<p>as material challenges intensify.</p>
<p><strong>MARK KARAN:</strong> My deep gratitude to you, Chris, Stephen, Michael, and our audience. Until next time,</p>
<p>take care of each other.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract (140 words)</strong></p>
<p>Philosopher Chris Bache recounts his twenty-year, seventy-three-session program of</p>
<p>high-dose LSD research conducted under Stanislav Grof’s therapeutic paradigm.</p>
<p>Speaking to the TimeWaver community, he explains how he kept his academic career</p>
<p>at Youngstown State University separate from his clandestine inner quest,</p>
<p>painstakingly recording each session and later analyzing the material</p>
<p>phenomenologically. Bache traces his passage through perinatal death-rebirth,</p>
<p>an “ocean of suffering” that he interprets as collective human trauma, and a</p>
<p>series of transpersonal breakthroughs into psychic, subtle, causal, and finally</p>
<p>“diamond luminosity” (dharmakaya). Along the way he receives sweeping visions</p>
<p>of humanity’s evolutionary crisis and future “species-level rebirth” into a</p>
<p>higher form of consciousness. Bache closes with reflections on integration,</p>
<p>existential grief, and the need to balance transcendence with immanence while</p>
<p>participating courageously in the troubled decades ahead.</p>

<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for welcoming me to TimeWaver Summer World. Stanislav Grof, whom</p>
<p>Martin mentioned, co-founded transpersonal psychology with Abraham Maslow and</p>
<p>pioneered the clinical use of psychedelics. When I encountered *Realms of the</p>
<p>Human Unconscious* in 1979, I was a new junior faculty member and immediately</p>
<p>sensed that psychedelics would pivot both psychology and philosophy. Trained</p>
<p>as a philosopher of religion, I decided to pursue experiential—rather than</p>
<p>solely intellectual—knowledge of how the universe works.</p>
<p>Over twenty years I completed seventy-three high-dose LSD sessions in Grof’s</p>
<p>method: eyeshades, carefully chosen music, total isolation, and a trusted</p>
<p>sitter. Outwardly I remained a university professor; inwardly I embarked on a</p>
<p>hidden pilgrimage, recording every session within twenty-four hours and later</p>
<p>analyzing the data against other fields of knowledge.</p>
<p>Most people know the difference between low-dose psycholytic therapy and</p>
<p>high-dose psychedelic therapy. Early Spring Grove trials allowed a maximum of</p>
<p>three LSD sessions for terminal patients. I reasoned that if three were safe,</p>
<p>more could be safe. Multiple sessions, however, opened challenges unimagined</p>
<p>in those early studies. Looking back, I call what I did **psychedelic</p>
<p>exploration**: the therapeutic protocol used in far greater number, with</p>
<p>meticulous documentation—four hundred pages of raw notes, even astrological</p>
<p>transits correlated with phenomenology.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Crossing the perinatal plane</h3>
<p>My first ten sessions, spanning two years, dismantled my ego. At the ninth and</p>
<p>tenth the universe “snapped me like a twig,” reversing every identity I clung</p>
<p>to. I lived the lives of poor women of color across cultures. Gender, class,</p>
<p>and academic pride dissolved. Only after surrendering did I discover the glory</p>
<p>of womanhood—conceiving, birthing, laughing at bewildered husbands—and learned</p>
<p>that beyond personal history gender does not exist.</p>
<h3>The ocean of suffering</h3>
<p>For another year I was plunged into a vast collective agony—wars, famines,</p>
<p>injustice. Initially I thought this was a deeper layer of ego death; later I</p>
<p>understood the sessions were siphoning trauma from the collective human psyche</p>
<p>for transmutation.</p>
<h3>Deep time in the soul</h3>
<p>Emerging from that ordeal I experienced my entire life—beginning to end—as a</p>
<p>single, completed pattern. Returning repeatedly, I learned that states once</p>
<p>ineffable can become cognitively coherent through diligence and purification.</p>
<h3>Initiation into the universe</h3>
<p>Six years after a pause, the work resumed at the exact point it had stopped,</p>
<p>demonstrating the precision of the guiding intelligence. I was taken into</p>
<p>cosmic classrooms—“You and I Creating,” “The Cosmic Tour,” “The Council of</p>
<p>Elders”—and shown humanity’s evolutionary trajectory.</p>
<h3>Archetypal reality</h3>
<p>After an immense collective cleansing I entered high-subtle and low-subtle</p>
<p>archetypal domains. At the Platonic apex I encountered vast living forms that</p>
<p>shape space-time. At the Jungian layer I felt the species incarnating itself</p>
<p>generation by generation, a numinous yet devastating vision of humanity as a</p>
<p>single organism learning through billions of lives.</p>
<h3>Benediction of blessings</h3>
<p>Eighteen months of archetypal work gave way to a year of overwhelming grace:</p>
<p>Shunyata’s transparency, the fertile void, cosmic love, and the first eruption</p>
<p>of “diamond luminosity” as prior lifetimes fused into a single white-hot</p>
<p>presence—the <em>diamond soul</em>. I realized reincarnation is steering us toward an</p>
<p>eventual awakening where the <em>soul</em> lives consciously on Earth.</p>
<h3>Visions of the future human</h3>
<p>From session 23 onward I received “visions of awakening,” culminating in</p>
<p>1995 with a panoramic near-death event for the species. I witnessed a global</p>
<p>dark night—an ecological and cultural systems crisis—followed by an explosive</p>
<p>flowering of intelligence, creativity, and solidarity. Humanity, I was told,</p>
<p>is “built for speed” and poised to birth an unprecedented collective being.</p>
<h3>Diamond luminosity</h3>
<p>In the final five years I entered the “diamond light” four times. Each entry</p>
<p>was preceded by torturous purification and followed by deeper absorption. In</p>
<p>session 50 my field pivoted ninety degrees; beyond the diamond light lay an</p>
<p>even more transcendent “absolute light,” revealing that the divine journey is</p>
<p>endless. The goal is not a finish line but an ever-expanding capacity to host</p>
<p>the infinite.</p>
<h3>Integration and caution</h3>
<p>I ended the work in 1999, partly due to physical overstimulation, partly due to</p>
<p>heartache—an existential grief at leaving the divine realms. A decade of</p>
<p>grounding taught me that excessive transcendence can eclipse the immanent</p>
<p>divine manifest in the physical world. Our task is to balance heaven and</p>
<p>earth, serving the labor of planetary rebirth already under way.</p>

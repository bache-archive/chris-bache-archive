<p>In this Spirit Plant Medicine Conference talk, Chris Bache presents the long arc of a 20-year,</p>
<p>73-session exploration with high-dose LSD. Framing his work as cosmological research rather than</p>
<p>therapy, he describes a disciplined protocol: constant sitter, stable set and setting, careful music</p>
<p>curation, detailed post-session notes, and later timing sessions with astrological transits. Tracing</p>
<p>successive deaths and rebirths across personal, collective, archetypal, causal, and luminous strata,</p>
<p>Bache recounts the “ocean of suffering,” revelations of deep time, initiations into the universe,</p>
<p>archetypal ordeals, and extended union in causal oneness. He develops a vision of the “future human”</p>
<p>emerging through species-level crisis and nonlinear transformation, culminating in brief but</p>
<p>decisive immersions in “diamond luminosity.” The talk closes with lessons on surrender, patience,</p>
<p>and integration after returning from extraordinary states, including gratitude for the love that</p>
<p>helped him re-enter ordinary life.</p>
<h1>Part 1</h1>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> At the end of Chris’s talk, during the break, Chris will be signing his new book. He might not tell you this, so I will. The book is called <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. It’s based on his experiential work with LSD. The publisher planned a December release, but Chris got them to do an advance printing for this conference, so this weekend is the debut. I’ve read the electronic version, wrote an endorsement, and it’s a mind-blower. Please give a warm welcome to Chris Bache.</p>
<p><em>[Applause]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Give me just a second to hook up my technology. Fingers crossed. Can you put the PowerPoint on all three? Is my mic working? No? How about now?</p>
<p><em>[Laughter]</em></p>
<p>Mercury retrograde, right? Okay. Thank you. How the technology moves forward.</p>
<p>It’s wonderful to be with you again. This is such a beautiful community. When I was here last year, I spoke about a book I was finishing called <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>. It describes a 20-year journey using high doses of LSD—73 sessions—to explore the structure of the universe. That book is now here. The publisher changed the title, but in my heart it will always be <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>.</p>
<p><em>[Applause]</em></p>
<p>I want to say up front that I’m not sure what I did was wise. I pushed myself extremely hard, harder than was probably good for me. But I’ve come through reasonably intact, and I’m eager to share where the journey took me. It’s not because my experiences are unique, but because they formed a tightly focused exploration of the universe’s deep structure.</p>
<p>I did not do this as a therapist or seeking therapy. With deep respect for the many therapists here, my agenda was different. Trained as a philosopher of religion, I sought to understand our universe as deeply as I could by sinking into consciousness and exploring its depths.</p>
<p>Let me ground this in our collective psychedelic context. We have so many substances, formats, and intentions represented in this room. All honor to the diversity of our work. What I’ll share is one particular method and one particular journey. It doesn’t negate anyone else’s path; it’s simply one voice in our shared chorus.</p>
<p>This is my psychedelic lineage. It grounds in Stanislav Grof’s work. At twenty-nine, fresh out of graduate school and starting an academic career in Ohio, I found <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em> and then <em>LSD Psychotherapy</em>, the fundamental manual for session work. It changed my life and set the direction of my career.</p>
<p>In terms of structure, I’ve never “tripped” recreationally. No concerts on LSD. No all-night chats. Not because those are bad, but because in my work, every dose was in a carefully controlled environment. I was isolated, usually at home or in my wife’s office, completely protected from the world. I always worked solo with a sitter. Group work has its advantages; solo work allowed me to follow the experience wherever it led and to push when invited.</p>
<p>In Stan’s model there are two distinct modalities: psycholytic low-dose therapy and psychedelic high-dose therapy. Psycholytic work—think around 200 micrograms—peels the psyche in layers across many sessions. Psychedelic therapy is very different: highly concentrated, aimed at catalyzing transcendence—akin to near-death experience states—used at Spring Grove with terminal patients and limited to three sessions.</p>
<p>I thought, if it can be done safely three times, perhaps it can be done more. It can, but it proved far more demanding than I anticipated. It took all the resources I had. This is not a therapeutic journey; it is cosmological exploration. It requires an explorer’s constitution, preparation, and a life context that allows you to go beyond existing maps.</p>
<p>By the end I realized the process had gone so deep and created such complex challenges that I needed a different name. I call it psychedelic exploration. The method mirrors psychedelic therapy—total isolation, a trusted sitter, carefully selected music—but the difference is the number and intensity of sessions. I did three at psychodynamic levels around 200 micrograms. After that, all were 500–600 micrograms.</p>
<p>This is not a protocol I recommend. I wouldn’t do it the same way again. I would balance plant medicines with synthetics, and push high only periodically rather than so relentlessly. I have worked with psilocybin, ayahuasca, and salvia divinorum, mostly after the LSD work. <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em> focuses specifically on the high-dose LSD journey.</p>
<p>My circumstances were unusually stable: the same sitter for years; same set and setting; same intention; same physical location in northeast Ohio; same substance; similar dose levels; and the same recording practice—writing detailed accounts within 24 hours. Stabilizing the variables stabilizes the conversation with the universe’s creative intelligence. Sessions begin to speak to one another, cohering across time. You feel you are engaging a single intelligence—careful caveat: it’s layered, multifaceted, but the continuity is undeniable.</p>
<p>I kept about 400 pages of session notes, all dated. Later I tracked astrological transits. In the later years I even scheduled sessions by transits, influenced by Rick Tarnas and Stan Grof’s hypotheses about outer-planet correlations. There’s an appendix on this in the book.</p>
<p>The story I tell is not primarily personal. Yes, there was healing and insight, but typically the personal material surfaced at the start and end of a session—entering and leaving space-time. After roughly fifteen sessions, the peak hours consistently unfolded far beyond personal reality. From a philosophical perspective, that’s the story I focus on.</p>
<p>Many discussions focus on one death-rebirth cycle—the ego’s death into mystical experience. That transition is fundamental. But in extended work, you pass through multiple deaths and rebirths at different levels of reality. Shedding species mind is a different death than shedding ego. Transcending archetypal mind differs again. I borrow Grof’s convenient terms—psychic, subtle, causal—but no six boxes can capture the spectrum. They are rough signposts.</p>
<p>Over time I came to count five core thresholds. First, the death of self: transcending time-space identity. Second, a transformation at the collective level: species mind. Third, ordeals and openings in archetypal reality. Fourth, causal oneness: a condition in which reality knows itself as absolutely undivided—no outside anywhere. Fifth, diamond luminosity: what Buddhism calls dharmakaya, the pure light of absolute reality.</p>
<p>The book sets these out across chapters. Chapter 1 details methodology, because clarity here matters. I also include “A session day,” a narrative walk-through from preparation to recording. Then come the levels: crossing the boundary of birth and death; the ocean of suffering; deep time in the soul; initiations into the universe; archetypal reality; the benediction of blessings; the birth of the future human; diamond luminosity; a final vision; and the goodbye sessions. My wife, Christina, a professional astrologer, helped me read archetypal dynamics when they were relevant.</p>
<p>Let me offer a few observations at each level. First, crossing the boundary of birth and death: this is Grof’s perinatal territory, the liminal zone between space-time consciousness and the first transpersonal openings. I became a poster child for this level: intense bodily purifications, fetal sensations, reliving aspects of birth, existential angst, confronting meaninglessness, and then ego death. The ego is tough, but it’s harder to heal than to shatter.</p>
<p>In the last two sessions of that phase, the universe snapped me like a twig. I started the day as a white, highly educated male obsessed with meaning, and was inverted into the lives of women—women of color, women at laundromats with no prospects, women with no interest in philosophy. The problem wasn’t women or education; it was the social identity I had internalized. I was forced to become the opposite and to surrender. Under the arm of the Great Mother, I entered the worlds of hundreds of women’s lives. I wish every man could know this. I believe in reincarnation, but this wasn’t about reclaiming former lives as women. This was initiation: where you are going, gender does not exist. Let go. I did, and entered Spirit.</p>
<p>Then things got harder. After an expansion of compassion, I was drawn into a domain of collective suffering. It deepened, methodically, for two years—fourteen sessions. After a year I stopped for six years. When I resumed, under different life conditions and different transits, the ocean of suffering picked up exactly where it had left off, which tells you something about the intelligence guiding this work.</p>
<p>At first I interpreted this pain as an extension of ego death, consistent with Stan’s view that collective ordeals enter by resonance with personal death-rebirth. But it went on too long, involved too many beings, and exceeded any plausible “me-work.” I concluded that the target was not primarily my transformation but the species’ field itself. Somewhere along the way, personal transformation flipped into collective transformation. No one did this to me; it was my karmic contract—and I suspect many here share something similar, especially in our time.</p>
<p>Working at high doses, sessions often fall into two phases: purification and ecstasy. The gift I learned from Grof is total surrender. In a clean set and setting, anything arising is from within or through within. If you surrender completely, the process takes you deeper—into unspeakable anguish, chaos, confusion—until it crests and carries you through into teaching, clarity, and cosmology. You may return to suffering in the next session, but having gone all the way through, you internalize the full cycle: suffering, resolution, peace. That integration prevents trauma residues. You learn to trust the cycle and the intelligence holding it.</p>
<p>Exiting the first year of the ocean of suffering, I was flung into deep time. For seven sessions I experienced my entire life—from beginning to end—as a simultaneous now. Deep time is not eternity; it is a mode where spans of time are present at once. My life appeared as a tree: large branches held the themes that received the most energy; the most recent experiences were leaves at the edges. After the first deep-time session, I couldn’t remember much. It was the most meaningful thing that had ever happened, and I could barely reconstruct it. But if you keep returning to your living edge with clear focus, fragments coalesce. You learn to maintain awareness in states that once overwhelmed you.</p>
<p>Reincarnation permeated that view. If you don’t understand reincarnation, you don’t understand what is going on here. I later took a six-year break—two children, a book, a promotion. When I returned, the ocean of suffering resumed at the same depth. But now, on the ecstatic side, everything changed. I was taken beyond personal reality into a series of initiations—cosmology 101—delivered by a creative intelligence.</p>
<p>I give each session a name to hold the whole in view. Among them were “Uni-creating,” an exploration of co-creation at the universe’s dawn; “The cosmic tour,” where I was shown how things work, then shown again at larger scales; “Council of elders,” which trained me to keep cognition coherent across levels; “Dying into oneness,” repeated deaths into deeper unity; “The master plan,” glimpses of patterning; and “Healing the collective wound,” an orgy of pain that then spun me into archetypal reality. After that, the ocean of suffering never returned. Not because the world stopped hurting, but because my usefulness shifted: early on you can help by drawing pain out; later you pour grace and insight back in from higher ground.</p>

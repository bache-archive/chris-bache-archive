      <p>Humanity is in labor: that is the central image guiding this rich two-and-a-half-hour</p>
<p>Wisdom Keepers gathering.</p>
<p>After a centering visualization that expands from the cosmic to the intimate, host <strong>Bas</strong></p>
<p>and co-host <strong>Mayo</strong> welcome philosopher of religion <strong>Chris Bache</strong> and social visionary</p>
<p><strong>Duane Elgin</strong> for an unscripted “dance” between psychedelic cosmology and</p>
<p>planetary systems thinking.</p>
<p>Chris recounts the decades-long, high-dose LSD practice that revealed collective</p>
<p>reincarnation, the dark night of the species and the birth of the “diamond soul.”</p>
<p>Duane weaves in fifty years of futures research, describing our adolescent civilisation’s</p>
<p>looming rite of passage and the urgency of choosing Earth over collapse or authoritarian</p>
<p>futures.</p>
<p>Together they explore voluntary simplicity, media as the nervous system of a maturing</p>
<p>species, and practical compassion.</p>
<p>A lively Q&amp;A follows, touching on the trustworthiness of psychedelic insight, the role of</p>
<p>young people, morphic resonance, and day-to-day ways to “take suffering out of the</p>
<p>world.”</p>
<p>The session closes in a shared field of gratitude and resolve.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>BAS:</strong> Welcome, everyone. We have two-and-a-half hours together.</p>
<p>Tonight we’ll settle in with a meditation, then</p>
<p>a dialogue between Chris and Duane—two different angles, two paradigms, one dance.</p>
<p>After about ninety minutes we’ll open the circle for questions and, finally,</p>
<p>look ahead to creating more wisdom-keeper circles.</p>
<p><strong>BAS:</strong> <em>invites participants to close their eyes and feel their intention</em>.</p>
<p><strong>BAS:</strong> *Guided visualization transports the group from the galaxy to each</p>
<p>person’s body, ending in music and silence.*</p>
<p><strong>MAYO:</strong> <em>after meditation</em> These conversations combine our energies into one essence.</p>
<p>Please keep sharing in your own neighbourhoods so we can co-create reality together.</p>
<p><strong>BAS:</strong> Before the dance begins:</p>
<p>—<strong>Chris</strong> is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and</p>
<p>Religious Studies, Youngstown State University, author of *LSD and the Mind of the</p>
<p>Universe*—“Diamonds from Heaven.”</p>
<p>—<strong>Duane</strong> is author of <em>Choosing Earth</em>, former</p>
<p>staff to the U.S. Presidential Commission on the American Future, honoured for</p>
<p>pioneering work in sustainable, spiritual culture.</p>
<h3>Setting the stage</h3>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My voice is rough with a cold, but this material is too important.</p>
<p>Duane and I have been brothers for twenty-five years.</p>
<p>Common ground: the universe is saturated with intelligence and compassion, yet</p>
<p>life hurts. To see the wisdom behind suffering we must look very deep.</p>
<p><strong>DUANE ELGIN:</strong> Thank you, brother. Early in life I shifted from medicine to</p>
<p>social healing. One framing I use: ask any audience which life stage humanity’s</p>
<p>behaviour reflects—toddlers, teenagers, adults, elders. Across decades, three-quarters</p>
<p>say “adolescents.” We are in a rite of passage.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Reincarnation is not only personal—it’s a collective driver.</p>
<p>Individual and collective karma interweave; therefore our dark night is a collective</p>
<p>event. My psychedelic work showed humanity pulsing in and out of time-space,</p>
<p>each cycle woven into a larger karmic agenda.</p>
<h3>The coming compression</h3>
<p><strong>DUANE:</strong> We are in overshoot: climate, extinction, resource depletion.</p>
<p>No, we can’t avoid the crisis now; we missed that window fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Our task is to move through it with courage and new understanding.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> The grounds of civilisation are shaking. Without deep structural insight</p>
<p>we’ll collapse into despair or destructive ideologies.</p>
<h3>Living universe &amp; media</h3>
<p><strong>DUANE:</strong> My 30-year study, <em>The Living Universe</em>, argues modern science</p>
<p>misreads reality as dead matter. A living universe implies psychic capacities are</p>
<p>ecological. Mass media, now in every hand, is the nervous system of our species.</p>
<p>We must use it to reflect new priorities.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> In high-dose LSD sessions I shattered shells of consciousness:</p>
<p>ego death, species death-rebirth, visions of a future humanity of Buddhas.</p>
<p>Session 55 (1995) showed the collective dying, a narrow passage, then an upwelling</p>
<p>of creativity—the birth of the future human.</p>
<h3>Three futures</h3>
<p><strong>DUANE:</strong> I see three pathways: functional collapse, authoritarianism, or</p>
<p>transformative maturation. Only the third honours our freedom.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> My deepest visions reveal the transformation as a <em>given</em> from “deep</p>
<p>time,” yet the cost in human suffering is up to us. Everyone must show up at</p>
<p>maximum exertion—and relax into the larger process.</p>
<h3>Practical compassion</h3>
<p><strong>MAYO:</strong> What practical steps cultivate compassion?</p>
<p><strong>DUANE:</strong> 1) Watch animal-rescue videos; let your heart break open.</p>
<p>2) Withdraw legitimacy from consumerism; embrace voluntary simplicity.</p>
<p>3) Use media to grow networks of care.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Take suffering out of the world—now. Every private realisation radiates</p>
<p>outward. Do what is right in front of you with courage.</p>
<h3>Audience highlights</h3>
<p><strong>TODD:</strong> College cohorts already start from higher consciousness; optimism is</p>
<p>justified.</p>
<p><strong>HENRIK:</strong> How do you know LSD visions aren’t delusion?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS &amp; DUANE:</strong> Cross-cultural wisdom, parapsychology, and</p>
<p>rigorous scholarship ground these insights; see *The Epistemic Value of Psychedelic</p>
<p>Experience<em> and </em>Choosing Earth*.</p>
<p><strong>SUE:</strong> Has collective consciousness declined?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS:</strong> We are detoxifying; apparent decline is the surfacing of trauma for healing.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Memes, not genes, matter now. Let’s form circles.</p>
<p><strong>EVE:</strong> Every thought broadcasts into the morphic field—become a student of your</p>
<p>own mind.</p>

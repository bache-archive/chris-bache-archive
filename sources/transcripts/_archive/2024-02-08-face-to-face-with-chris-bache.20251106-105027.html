<p>Welcome to OM Times TV, a division of OM Times Media and Broadcasting.</p>
<p>Welcome to the No BS Spiritual Book Club's live streaming interview series, where leading New Thought teachers, speakers, and authors share the intimate stories behind the ten best spiritual books that have inspired them on their journeys. From well-known classics to hidden gems you might not have heard of, the No BS Spiritual Book Club saves you time and money by offering reliable recommendations from those who have walked the path before you. This is your only No BS guide to the best spiritual books that can inspire your journey of self-discovery. Here's your host, founder of the No BS Spiritual Book Club, Sandy Sedgbeer.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Hello and welcome! Joining me today to share the ten best spiritual books that have inspired him the most on his life journey is award-winning teacher and international speaker Christopher M. Bache. His latest book, <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, is, in my opinion, one of the most important books of our time. Chris Bache is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences and an advisory board member for Grof Transpersonal Training and the Grof Foundation. If you want to know why I regard <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em> as the most important book of this time, stay tuned—we'll find out more about that later in the show. In the meantime, Chris Bache, welcome to the show!</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, Sandy. It’s a pleasure to be here with you.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: I'm always intrigued to know what books our guests will choose, but I've been especially keen to learn and share with our audience your ten best spiritual books. When I saw your list, I thought, “Wow, that is one list!”—the only one so far where all ten books are favorites of mine.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That's good to hear!</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: How did you find the process of picking your ten?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It was interesting because there were so many books to choose from. In the process of selecting the ones that spoke most deeply to me at various times in my life, I found myself drawn to more intellectually oriented books since I'm an academic. At the end, I was struck by how much I don’t know. The books have helped me immensely, but there's so much in the spiritual field that I've left untouched.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: I beg to differ, and the audience will find out later why I say that. When you say there’s so much you need to know, I would have thought you know what we all want to know—and that's enough.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It's not so much that I need to know—it's just stuff that I don’t know. I feel content with what I have learned through my journey.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: But the 'don’t know' bit—I mean, we can go on forever there! Your first book, understandably, is Stan Grof's <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research</em>, published in 1975. You're a great supporter of his work, aren’t you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I am. Stan's work is crucial to the emerging paradigm in transpersonal psychology. I encountered this book right after graduating, just as I was beginning my teaching career and exploring my research direction. As soon as I read it, it activated something within me, and I knew I needed to get involved in this process. Even though psychedelics were illegal at the time, I embarked on what became a 20-year journey working with LSD in a therapeutic protocol defined by Stan, experiencing high-dose sessions—not as a clinician, but as a philosopher of religion interested in the cosmic significance of these substances.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: How old were you then?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I was 30 years old.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: And that started your 20-year journey!</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, that book was pivotal for me. I read all of Stan’s books as they came out, and I always felt that my books were primarily in dialogue with his work.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: So book number two: Ian Stevenson’s <em>Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation</em>, published in 1966.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I discovered this book around the same time I found Stan's work. At the time, I was a convinced agnostic with strong atheistic leanings. This book presents overwhelming evidence that reincarnation is a natural fact of life. I had to erase everything I thought I knew and start from scratch, which eventually culminated in my book on reincarnation, <em>Life Cycles</em>, a response to Ian Stevenson’s pioneering work.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Did you risk the ire of your colleagues when you went down that path?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I did, actually. On my first sabbatical, I didn’t plan to write a book, but I returned with the manuscript. My colleagues weren't thrilled, but it got published, translated into several languages, and they began to pay attention to the subject matter. It didn’t negatively impact my career.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: That’s great! Book number three is <em>Journey of Souls: Case Studies of Life Between Lives</em> by Michael Newton, published in 1994.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Michael Newton's work is beautiful and vital. He started as a past-life therapist and discovered that we could not only regress individuals to their former lives but also to the time between death and their subsequent rebirth. His series of books offers incredible insights about experiences in that transitional state.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: He really was a pioneer, wasn’t he?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, absolutely. His description of the Bardo existence aligns with my psychedelic experiences, although I think he focuses more on the lower half of the Bardo rather than its higher aspects.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: The fourth book is <em>Lessons from the Light: What We Can Learn from the Near-Death Experience</em> by Kenneth Ring, published in 1998.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Kenneth Ring has always been a colleague and friend. His work on near-death episodes is critically important. I used his books in my Transpersonal Studies course because they were accessible and well-researched. This book serves as an overview of near-death study and contains remarkable empirical analyses. One of my favorite chapters describes the deepest near-death episodes he's recorded, which resonate deeply with those of us interested in psychedelics.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Continuing the theme, book number five is <em>Far Journeys</em> by Robert Monroe, published in 1985.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Robert Monroe has been a companion on my journey through his works. This book was released while I was on my first sabbatical, and I was so impressed by it that I enrolled in a training program at the Monroe Institute. Monroe has been somewhat under-studied in the consciousness community. His model of the universe, developed through decades of out-of-body experiences, is fascinating and aligns well with Eastern cosmologies, particularly Buddhist views of the Bardo.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Did you have many out-of-body experiences when you were there?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: You know, I never developed the ability to leave my body. However, I had non-ordinary states of consciousness where my awareness expanded, allowing me to connect with beings in the Bardo.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: I always wanted to go there, but it didn’t work for me. Book number six is by Dwayne Elgin: <em>Choosing Earth: Humanity’s Great Transition to a Mature Planetary Civilization</em>, updated in 2020.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Dwayne has been raising awareness about humanity's potential and our impact on the planet for decades. <em>Choosing Earth</em> distills his thinking and outlines scientifically informed proposals for the next fifty years, offering recommendations for how we can engage with the environmental crisis. His wife, Colleen, has produced a companion film, and they are giving both the book and the film away for free, as Dwayne believes the message is too important to monetize.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Do you know where people can find the movie?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, you can visit Dwayne Elgin's website, dwaynelgin.com, where his books and the film are available.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: I’ll check it out. Book number seven is <em>A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Morphic Resonance</em> by Rupert Sheldrake, published in 1981.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Rupert has written an extraordinary series of books. His work helped me understand the interconnectedness of individual minds within a species. This concept of a collective model of transformation became central to my work and is, in fact, a theme in my second book, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: He took a lot of flak, didn’t he?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, he has faced significant criticism. In academia, there’s too often a disparity between public reputations and private convictions.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: It’s sad, isn’t it? People don’t feel they can be authentic and express their true thoughts.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, and Rupert has been a real hero in challenging the status quo in scientific thought.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Book number eight is <em>Cosmos and Psyche: Intimations of a New World View</em> by Richard Tarnas, published in 1996.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Rick Tarnas is another dear friend and extraordinary astrologer. In <em>Cosmos and Psyche</em>, he demonstrates how astrology can illuminate both individual lives and historical epochs. His analysis of history in relation to the archetypal energies of our solar system is profoundly thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: That book seems to tie in with your discussion about the transformation of the cosmos and the birth of the modern self. What is the modern self?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The modern self emerged during the Enlightenment—it's rational, gives birth to science, and enables a critical lens on history and culture. Now, as the modern self is established, it’s yielding to a postmodern self that reconnects us to the deeper fabric of consciousness. This shift is the future human that many of us are experiencing through our contemplative practices.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: We’ll talk more about that after the break. Book number nine is <em>Sri Aurobindo: The Adventure of Consciousness</em> by Sat Prem, published in 1968.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Sri Aurobindo is one of my heroes. He transitioned from being a political activist to a spiritual one, channeling all his works in a short period. Sat Prem’s biography distills Aurobindo’s core insights and makes them more accessible.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: We had a guest before who discussed how Aurobindo and the Mother sent thoughts to leaders during the war, influencing their actions.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: They operated from an expansive state of consciousness, showing how focused thoughts can travel to intended destinations.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Yes, that makes me want to add him to my reading list. The last book is <em>The Flight of the Garuda: Teachings of the Dzogchen Tradition of Tibetan Buddhism</em> by Keith Dow, published in 1994.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Vajrayana Buddhism has influenced me significantly. I chose <em>The Flight of the Garuda</em> as it’s one of my favorite tantric texts, despite the controversy surrounding its publication. I find profound illumination in the text that helps me process my psychedelic experiences. Dzogchen is considered a direct path in Buddhism, emphasizing that enlightenment is our fundamental condition from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Of those ten books, do you have a favorite?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I have so many favorites! I’d say the first two—Stevenson and Stan Grof—have been fundamental to my life. Reincarnation is essential to understanding life, while psychedelics have been my path to explore the deep structure of the universe. However, all ten are on my must-read list.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: If you could meet anyone from this list, who would it be?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I would have loved to meet Michael Newton. Though he has passed, I’ll be sure to look him up when I die, as he contributed so much to my life.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: I bet you’re not the only one who'll be looking him up!</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes! According to Marjorie Monroe, we can find anyone when we die, as long as we know their ID.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: That’ll keep us busy until we come back again! Well, that’s your ten best list, but this is by no means the whole of the show. We’ll take a brief break, and when we get back, put your listening ears on. You’re listening to a No BS Spiritual Book Club interview with Christopher Bache, author of <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Oh, that's a hard question. The first thing that pops into my mind is, don't do what I did. I wouldn't do it the same way if I did it over again. I would be much gentler on myself. One of the things I learned is that I thought the purpose of this work was to get to an end state, that there was an end state that would change my life, transform my life. What I learned along the way, after 17 years into this journey, is that it's an infinite progression. It's an infinite universe; you'll never get to the end of it. The whole project of pushing as hard as I did under the assumption that I could reach an endpoint was a mistaken concept.</p>
<p>In a psychedelic state, there's an amplification of what's happening in ordinary life. To understand what happens in a psychedelic state, you need to understand life itself. We must grasp the concept of reincarnation; this is the rhythm of life. We are cosmic beings who live across time frames of hundreds of thousands, even millions of years. This particular incarnation is only one of many on this planet. To truly grasp the essence of life, we need to look beyond the short-term, 100-year lifespan and consider the soul's lifespan, which is vast.</p>
<p>One major takeaway is an understanding of our historical context. Humanity is approaching a turning point, a bifurcation point marked by radical deconstruction, followed by higher reconstruction. After hundreds of thousands of years of reincarnation, we are gestating the future. We are now entering a labor period, a very intense and painful time, but like any labor, once it’s over, a new child is born. I believe humanity is giving birth to a new iteration of its own fundamental form. We are witnessing, in this century and the next, a shift in the collective psyche and the architecture of the collective unconscious. This is what I call the birth of the diamond soul.</p>
<p>You mentioned in your book that there are many layers to heaven and the death experience, and that there is no hell, but rather confrontation and accountability. Can you elaborate on that?</p>
<p>Our historical understandings of God and life have been primitive. We’ve only begun to make experiential contact with the core, essential nature of our being—the divine nature—around five or six thousand years ago. Many of our concepts around God, punishment, reward, heaven, and hell are inadequate for truly understanding the intentions of creation. When we die, we encounter a detailed remembrance of everything we've done in this lifetime, experiencing its impact on the lives around us. Bad choices lead to experiences we might call hell, while good choices lead to experiences of heaven. Yet, the aim isn't to punish or reward us in superficial ways, but to educate us so we can learn from our mistakes and our positive actions.</p>
<p>You mentioned the challenge of thinking about infinite reincarnation. How do you handle that?</p>
<p>When we die, we go home. We return to spirit, to our soul, to a larger consciousness, and are brought back into peace and wholeness. However, there are many levels of home. We can experience homecoming on introductory, intermediate, or advanced levels, each offering varying degrees of joy. After every incarnation, we get to pause, rest, and refresh ourselves, but some may face trauma that complicates their return. Most, however, return home without difficulty and are restored and reconnected with the divine. It's in that context that we make choices about reincarnation—whether, when, and how to do so.</p>
<p>It's natural to feel exhausted by the idea of reincarnating multiple times, but from the soul's perspective, there exists a desire to deepen our experience of being human and to help others. Once we’ve transcended the need for reincarnation, participation becomes optional, allowing us to support the development of others—our grandchildren, in a sense. Some may have reached this point and explored other dimensions of existence. The physical universe is merely one dimension of a multi-dimensional cosmos.</p>
<p>Regarding the existence of older souls, it raises profound questions. The Buddha, when asked about where an enlightened being goes, chose not to answer, suggesting that understanding comes from personal transformation rather than theoretical discussions. </p>
<p>You described this incredible consciousness, often referred to as a divine being. Is this something we all can experience?</p>
<p>Absolutely. Its nature is our nature. When we access the deepest aspect of our being, we connect with this consciousness. It's impossible to step out of it; we are part of the body of the universe, the consciousness of the universe. Though it's tempting to label it a being, we must remember there are no boundaries. We're destined to experience this, and when we die, we typically return to the remembrance of our essential nature, which is why we often choose to incarnate again—to deepen that experience.</p>
<p>In your book, you mentioned the pain of leaving that presence. Have you found other ways to experience it that aren't so painful?</p>
<p>I have not found other ways to experience that full intensity of communion with the light of existence. I've committed myself to embracing this physical existence and learning to love the manifest body of the divine that surrounds me. I value this world. While I continue my spiritual practice, in terms of accessing the same dimensions of luminosity, I've set that aside for now. However, I know there are beings capable of living in conscious communion with those subtle planes, although I’m not one of them yet. I maintain hope, believing that with daily practice, I could achieve it, but I also acknowledge the unique levels of reality accessible through years of work in a specific practice.</p>
<p>Knowing what you've experienced must make life challenging at times. </p>
<p>It does. Knowing that divine intelligence is always present makes life both harder and easier. It's easier because I understand we are surrounded and filled with this love and intelligence, allowing me to draw on it continuously. This knowledge alleviates the burden of uncertainty that can weigh heavily during physical existence. However, knowing the presence of that intelligence can complicate contentment in everyday life; the imperfections of my current state can sometimes hinder me from fully engaging with it.</p>
<p>You've spoken about a significant transformation that humanity will undergo. Can you share your thoughts on the timeline and its implications?</p>
<p>I haven't been given a precise timetable for this transformation, nor the details. What I experienced was humanity undergoing profound pain and global collapse, but there's certainty that we will get through it, and we will be transformed in this process. It’s like a woman in labor—despite her reluctance, there's no choice when the moment comes. Similarly, we are in this transformation, whether we wish to be or not. The key is navigating it well. Each individual has a role to play in this collective transformation, and our actions can significantly influence the outcome of this crisis.</p>
<p>In the end, knowing we will eventually be part of this transformation brings hope. </p>
<p>Indeed. The joy we’ll experience when this new human being emerges, like welcoming a newborn, will make all the pain and suffering worthwhile. This is an extraordinary moment in human history.</p>
<p>Thank you, Chris Bache, for sharing your insights. Your contributions to the spiritual discourse are invaluable.</p>
<p>Thank you, Sandy. I appreciate the work you are doing and the attention you've given to my work.</p>

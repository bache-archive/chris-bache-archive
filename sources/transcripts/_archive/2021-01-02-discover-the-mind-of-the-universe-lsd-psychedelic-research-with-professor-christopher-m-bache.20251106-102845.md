# Discover the Mind of the Universe — LSD, Psychedelic Research, and Consciousness

**Luisa: ** Passion harvest. Hello, passionate listeners and watchers, welcome to Passion Harvest. I am Luisa, your host and international passion ambassador. I am really excited about my guest today. I've just read his amazing book. If you don't know who he is, Christopher M. Bache, PhD, is a professor who set out to explore his mind and the mind of the universe on what became a life-changing journey with the help of the psychedelic drug, LSD. 

Chris's 73 high-dose LSD sessions over 20 years drew him into a deeper communion with cosmic consciousness, pushing the boundaries of theory and practice. His experiences transcended personal transformation into collective transformation, revealing a perfect balance between spirit and matter. He has taught at Youngstown State University for 33 years and is also an adjunct faculty member at the California Institute of Integral Studies, part of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and serves on the Advisory Council of Grof Legacy Training. 

Chris's passion lies in studying the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. An award-winning teacher and international speaker, he has written four books, including *Life Cycles*, *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, *The Living Classroom*, and *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, which chronicles his 20-year journey with LSD. This is his story, and this is his passion. Professor Christopher Bache, welcome to Passion Harvest.

**Christopher Bache: ** Thank you so much for having me, Luisa. It’s nice to be with you.

**Luisa: ** It's so nice to be with you as well. I just read your book, and it's fabulous. I'd like to dive right in for those who haven't read it. What is the book about, and what story are you telling?

**Christopher Bache: ** Well, I was trained as a philosopher of religion, and just as I was beginning my career at Youngstown State University, I came across the work of Stanislav Grof, the foremost authority on integrating psychedelics into psychotherapy. I read his book, *Realms of the Human Unconscious*, which had just been published back in 1978. I immediately saw how extraordinarily important this work was, not just to psychology but to philosophy as well. We are currently undergoing a renaissance of psychedelic research, but Stan's work comes from the very early generation of this research. 

Understanding the significance of psychedelics, I sought to explore what they could teach me about myself, my mind, and ultimately, the mind of the universe. So I began a journey that lasted 20 years, during which I chose to work with very high doses of LSD in controlled circumstances, following a therapeutic protocol pioneered by the early researchers, particularly Stan. Over the course of 73 high-dose sessions, I meticulously recorded the results. After completing the sessions in 1979, between the ages of 30 and 50, I spent another 20 years processing and digesting those experiences. Eventually, in 1999, I published *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, which tells the complete story of where this journey took me into the universe.

**Luisa: ** It sounds incredible. You experienced such deep, emotional, and physical suffering, yet also profound insights into universal truths. Can you explain to the audience what a session looks like? 

**Christopher Bache: ** My sessions always began in the early morning, in isolation either at home or in my wife's office, always with a sitter to monitor me. My first wife, who is a clinical psychologist, was my sitter. I lay down on a mattress surrounded by pillows, wearing eye shades and listening through earphones to carefully selected music, designed to pace the unfolding of the session. This setting was protected from external distractions, allowing me to focus deeply within. Each session lasted all day, from early morning until late afternoon or evening.

**Luisa: ** I asked you earlier about the physical toll on the body. What was that like aside from the emotional and spiritual aspects?

**Christopher Bache: ** Physically, I found it to be a beneficial process. LSD amplifies consciousness, stimulating it in ways that reveal a lot about what we're facing in our lives. In these states, the body begins a detoxification process, pulling out things we'd rather not confront, fears, and aspects of our shadow self. If you confront these things clearly, you can lift them out of your system, undergoing a death and rebirth process where your identity is shattered, allowing you to experience deeper transpersonal or spiritual states of consciousness. 

This cycle of purification continues, revealing material that comes from collective levels of consciousness rather than just personal experiences. I realize that this perspective may seem radical, but through deep purification processes, which are well-known in spiritual traditions, you clear material not only from your personal history but also from the history of our species. Although this process can involve suffering, the net result is uplifting and clarifying for both the body and emotions, leading you into ecstatic states of consciousness as the process deepens. My body is in good shape, and I wouldn’t have missed this journey for the world.

**Luisa: ** It’s fascinating. You discuss both the death and rebirth of the ego during the process of surrendering. Interestingly, you also mention that you affected collective consciousness, which is a unique perspective.

**Christopher Bache: ** That was surprising to me. Initially, I thought this work was about personal healing or enlightenment. However, as I delved deeper, I found myself processing vast tracts of collective pain—thousands of years of human suffering that felt like Dante’s Inferno flowing through me. At first, I thought this was just a deeper form of ego death, but over time, it became clear that I was engaging in a healing process for wounds lodged in the collective unconscious. 

This realization—that personal transformation opens into collective transformation—was profound. We are all hardwired into the collective psyche, and while dealing with our own issues, we process collective issues simultaneously. Our healing impacts the collective psyche, especially when using psychedelics, where these dynamics become intensified. After two years of this collective healing, I transitioned into yet another level of consciousness where the rules of the game changed again.

**Luisa: ** I can't wait to hear about that soon. It's intriguing to think about how our personal transformation intertwines with the collective one, especially in such chaotic times. 

**Christopher Bache: ** Exactly. We're organically embedded in the collective psyche, much like we're physically interlinked with the ecology of Earth. We can’t separate ourselves from the psychological ecology surrounding us. My experiences revealed how intimately connected we are, where every individual life is a fractal cell within the larger life of our species, ultimately within the universe itself. There's no separation between personal and collective transformation; our individual issues are always reflected in societal dynamics.

**Luisa: ** It’s a delicate balance between autonomy and oneness. Do you believe we are all one? Some describe it as the creator having multiple personalities through humans. 

**Christopher Bache: ** I think the core insight from many spiritual traditions—that Atman is Brahman—captures this truth. The essence of the individual is the essence of the totality. At the core of every person is an energy and consciousness that resonates with the Divine itself. Out of this oneness arises compassion and a concern for justice and fairness. Those who achieve spiritual realization become aware of this fundamental oneness, living with consciousness both as individuals while also feeling connected to the oneness of existence.

**Luisa: ** That’s a beautiful insight. We often get lost in our personal narratives. Are our thoughts our own?

**Christopher Bache: ** They both are and aren’t. This can be quite complex. My thoughts, when I speak to you, are my own. However, if we step into deeper states of consciousness, we may discover that many influences arise from beyond our personal lineage, including collective and cosmic causes. Artists often express this when they create, feeling that inspiration flowed through them from something larger. This blending of personal agency and deeper creativity characterizes our lives, especially within psychedelic experiences.

**Luisa: ** I was curious if we have time for you to share some pivotal moments from your book. You speak about transcending time and space, where past, present, and future all blend. Can you explore that a bit?

**Christopher Bache: ** Yes, one of the surprising aspects of my journey was discovering that time doesn't function linearly as we commonly perceive it. In my sessions, I experienced what I call "deep time," where I viewed my entire life as a simultaneous now. It was like all moments were branches of a tree, where I could see my life trajectory, past experiences, and future possibilities all at once.

Over time, my experiences of deep time expanded beyond my personal life into humanity’s evolutionary trajectory. I didn’t see this as something yet to come but rather something simultaneously arriving and already completed. In extreme states of consciousness, I encountered archetypal principles that exist beyond linear time, revealing a different way of perceiving existence.

**Luisa: ** Is everything happening now?

**Christopher Bache: ** From certain perspectives, it might seem so. However, that view can be limiting. I find it challenging to think coherently within that frame because my mind requires some structure of cause and effect to understand life on this planet. While time can become variable in deep states of consciousness, I hesitate to say everything occurs simultaneously as it creates a paradox within my understanding of existence.

**Luisa: ** Thank you for that candid response. You discussed seeing the trajectory of your life. Is everything pre-planned?

**Christopher Bache: ** No, it's not pre-planned. I believe in probabilities rather than a deterministic outcome. Our experiences in life are shaped by choices we make, guided by our understanding of the trajectory of our incarnation. While some aspects may feel inevitable, the universe operates with chance alongside a conditioning force, or karma, that respects the role of choice. The more attention we pay, the more freedom we create in our choices.

**Luisa: ** Great answer! Has your life unfolded how you observed it during your LSD experiences?

**Christopher Bache: ** In many ways, yes. I didn’t see every detail, but I gained a deep understanding of my purpose. The essence of what I learned during those experiences has become integral to my life, guiding me at an intuitive level. My life has evolved along the lines I sensed, and while I'm not the same person I was 40 years ago, I feel that the core of who I am has remained connected to that deeper knowing.

**Luisa: ** That’s fascinating, especially your insights on the evolution of the species from your experiences. Would you mind sharing more with the audience?

Chris Bache: This is a big topic, but I'm happy to touch on it. It was one of the big, deep surprises of my journey, as I never imagined that something like this would become part of it. I was initially thinking in terms of the conventional descriptions of enlightenment found in spiritual or mystical traditions. However, over years of work, I began to receive a series of visionary experiences. These weren't just visual; in these states of consciousness, you learn by becoming what it is you're experiencing. I had a systematic initiation into various visions of humanity's trajectory. I entered into a deep absorption with the species mind over time. The message I received consistently was that humanity is at a turning point—a decisive moment in our history. We're approaching a bifurcation in our evolutionary development, where the past diverges from the future. This change will affect not just our economy or politics but the very architecture of the collective psyche. All humans born after this pivotal period will operate within a different archetypal structure. This is a profound spiritual awakening, an extraordinary change that will mark history.

Luisa: Wow. 

Chris Bache: I was shown visions of the future human, the being we are becoming in history. They did not explain how it will happen or what form it might take until several years later. In 1995, I had an experience I refer to as the Great Awakening. After significant purification, I was propelled deep into time, where I dissolved into the essence of humanity. I experienced both the death and rebirth of humanity—not as an individual, but as a species. It was a time of crisis, loss, and turmoil, a moment when it felt like we could be facing extinction. But just when it became overwhelming, the pressure lifted, and humanity survived—albeit significantly pared down. This survival changed us fundamentally at our core. In the depths of that global crisis, we discovered essential principles, values, and truths. This transformation was irreversible. 

I believe it's fundamentally about encountering the truth of our oneness. It's the realization shared by mystics for thousands of years: we are essentially one with each other and with life itself. Once you have that experience, you cannot harm others. You would never allow your actions to hurt them. We began to build a civilization based on this interconnectedness—truly inclusive and functioning for all. This period marked a pivotal point in our spiritual development.

Luisa: And you mentioned the pared-down human. Does that mean there will be fewer souls incarnated in physical form?

Chris Bache: I draw that insight not only from my experiences, though it resonates, but from ecological literature. Experts are plotting the hard numbers and discussing the old Earth versus the new Earth. The old Earth reflects pre-damage from industrial civilization, while the new Earth represents the post-damage reality. They estimate the planet's carrying capacity could be about two billion people, while we currently approach over seven or eight billion. The pressure will become critical, and many individuals, even those who haven't taken psychedelics, are aware of this impending disruption. 

Luisa: You mentioned sorrow. Is there a timeline for this sorrowful period in our history?

Chris Bache: I think the 21st century marks the beginning of what I would call the dark night of our collective soul. This notion of the dark night is a technical term used by scholars of mysticism, referring to an intense purification preceding mystical awakening. It's a time of letting go of the past before moving into a genuinely new future. I believe this century will unfold slowly, taking several generations. Clearly, things are accelerating technologically, socially, and intellectually. The world is speeding up, and how we navigate these pressures will determine how long this transformation takes.

Luisa: There is a palpable sense of fear in the collective consciousness. How can we move through this fear-based state?

Chris Bache: There are legitimate reasons to be afraid. We have not addressed many issues well, and consequences are coming. From a realistic perspective, I fear for future generations. However, my deeper experiences have revealed a profound wisdom permeating the universe. The universe is extraordinarily intelligent and compassionate. Yet, seeing that compassion requires looking deep beneath the surface. It can appear harsh and unwise, but it’s essential to understand that what feels like evil often manifests in ways that are not malicious, but part of the divine experience. Many times, in my sessions, I was drawn into deep realities beyond description. It was an experience of a universe filled with extraordinary intelligence.

This intelligence is fundamentally behind our current moment in history. Despite the demanding circumstances, we're being summoned into a higher order of existence. Although the journey may not be comfortable, it is profoundly meaningful and poses an extraordinary adventure. Engagement with this intelligence can overshadow fear. I've lost my fear of death through my experiences; I know where I'm going when I die. And understanding this diminishes the strength of other fears.

Luisa: Many people wonder about what happens after we die. Your lack of fear is comforting.

Chris Bache: We've learned so much about the afterlife from various studies, including near-death experiences, reincarnation research, and insights from spiritual traditions. These studies indicate that consciousness continues even after death. The evidence is remarkably consistent, showing that death isn't the end of existence. The truth is that we can experience transformative states before physical death—realities that reveal our essence transcends the physical form. Our inner essence remains intact, and we carry all of our memories with us. This understanding is rooted in a spiritual reality we can access right here and now.

Luisa: What is the purpose of the cycle of life, death, and rebirth? Is there an endpoint to this cycle?

Chris Bache: These are big questions! I believe there isn't a recognized endpoint like we can define for the universe. Reincarnation helps lift the burden of time, suggesting that we have an open-ended period for growth and evolution. Traditional views posit that we advance spiritually over lifetimes until we realize our divine nature and attain moksha, but this raises questions about why we exist in the first place. Through my experiences, I saw a different perspective, where all our past lives fuse into a higher order of human being—where the soul, which integrates all experiences, awakens.

This "diamond soul" emerges, allowing us to see ourselves as souls with an expansive understanding of time. This is not an end but a significant milestone. Imagine if this could awaken in everyone, transforming the history of our planet! We’re on a path to awaken this diamond soul together, living in spiritual awareness right here on Earth. 

Luisa: Our lives are like a brief moment in time, yet they hold such significance, especially during this pivotal time.

Chris Bache: This moment is rich with purpose, especially as many have incarnated with the karmic imprint of numerous past lives. It's as if we're loading up to finish an essential journey. This brief life we have is immensely meaningful.

Luisa: I love that perspective! As we work through our karmic histories, it creates space for growth.

Chris Bache: Absolutely! We're expunging karma exponentially, building upon what we’ve learned. Each incarnation is not merely an opportunity for atonement but a chance to grow and love more deeply, more richly. This journey is about crafting something beautiful together.

Luisa: Such profound insights! Why did you ultimately stop your LSD sessions?

Chris Bache: I stopped for two reasons. The primary one was that I found it increasingly difficult to return after entering deep communion with what I call "diamond luminosity"—the clear light of absolute reality. I was often dissolved into a level of consciousness so pure, it was soul-satisfying, but these are temporary states. Eventually, it became too painful to return to the mundane realm. I made a deal with the universe to stop until I could remain in that state permanently. Now, I've committed my life to digest the blessings I've received and share my understanding with others. I hope my story resonates and supports others on their own journeys. 

Luisa: It’s been an absolute honor talking with you, Chris. Your message is powerful and significant.

Chris Bache: Thank you, Luisa. It's been a wonderful conversation.

<p>**Chris Bache: ** What is a group mind or collective consciousness? In my experience, I’ve found that the patterns of collective mind are particularly evident in the classroom. Here, I draw upon Rupert Sheldrake's work on Morphic field theory and formative causation to understand the dynamics emerging among students. When a group gathers with a common intention, if we can strengthen that intention and enhance the quality of engagement, the results can be profound. </p>
<p>This engagement shouldn't just be passive; we need emotional intensity. In a busy university course, it’s easy for students to become passively involved. However, when we create an atmosphere of active engagement, allowing students freedom of choice in meaningful exercises, the impact is significantly amplified. The choices they make freely carry greater weight compared to those that are forced upon them. Meeting consistently—week after week, month after month, and often year after year—creates a certain porosity, a transparency among the students. </p>
<p>It’s not unusual for students to show up in each other's dreams or to experience synchronization. I’ve often noticed that in the early hours of morning or during quiet moments in class, a sort of transparency opens between my mind and my students’. There are times when, while seeking an example to illustrate a point, I’ll inadvertently pull from a student’s immediate life experience. This unexpected connection can spark engagement and a visceral reaction in them, even though I’m not consciously aware of making any psychic contact. It seems to be more about a flow, an exchange of information occurring among everyone present.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought this was a form of psychic bridging between my mind and theirs. Over time, however, I embraced a more collective viewpoint, seeing it as the conscious emergence of an entity—a standing wave within larger currents of mind.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** Can you elaborate on this concept of the standing wave?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Absolutely. The metaphor I use often draws from fluid dynamics, chaos theory, non-linear mathematics, Jungian psychology, and transpersonal theory. Together, these serve to illustrate a simple observation: mind is an inherent quality of life that characterizes every pattern of existence. If the physical world is shaped by collective social patterns, then there will be corresponding patterns of consciousness.</p>
<p>When people gather regularly with a shared intention, there’s an accumulation of energy in our collective consciousness. I've come to understand that classes themselves possess a mind. Each course has a cumulative learning effect influenced by all students who have ever taken it. This creates what I call a ‘course mind,’ shaping the learning experience of current students based on the wisdom and energy of those who came before.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** Do the new students come in at a higher level because of this?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, they do. Over the years, I've noticed that I frequently need to redesign my courses because students arrive with a baseline understanding that is significantly higher than in the past. They grasp concepts more quickly, signaling that they’re three or four weeks ahead on the syllabus during the first week of class. This shift means that ideas we used to spend time persuading students about are now readily accepted.</p>
<p>Factors contributing to this phenomenon could include improved teaching methods or cultural shifts. However, I believe that the learning undertaken by previous students genuinely facilitates understanding for those who follow, allowing for a quicker grasp of concepts and enabling us to progress faster through the curriculum.</p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** What about the concept of individual mind? Is it a misnomer to think of our individual minds as entirely separate? In our culture, especially in America, there is a strong emphasis on individuality, and the term "group mind" often elicits fear of losing that individuality.</p>
<p><em><em>Chris Bache: ** You're absolutely right. There’s a cultural paranoia surrounding the idea of a group mind, often exaggerated in scenarios like those depicted in the </em>Star Trek</em> series with the Borg, where such a mindset is portrayed as dehumanizing. The reality is quite the opposite: evolution has discovered a way to cultivate not only groups but also individuals within those groups. </p>
<p>I connect the concepts of reincarnation and evolution, seeing that these evolutionary processes are developing individuality within a collective framework. Individuality is incredibly precious and vital from an evolutionary standpoint. When we examine the essence of individuality closely, we often find it reflects an open system, shaped by the cultural and psychological history of our species. For thousands of years, we’ve been on a journey that enhances individuality while still being part of something greater.</p>

<p>Regina Meredith welcomes philosopher and religious-studies scholar <strong>Christopher Bache</strong> for an</p>
<p>exploration of his twenty-year odyssey with 73 high-dose LSD sessions. Bache recounts the strict</p>
<p>protocol he followed, the alternating agony and ecstasy of ego dissolution, and the vast</p>
<p>transpersonal realms he encountered—from archetypal feminine identity to collective human</p>
<p>suffering, cosmic architects, and visionary glimpses of humanity’s evolutionary future. He</p>
<p>describes the “diamond soul” awaiting birth within the species, explains how karma operates across</p>
<p>lifetimes, and reflects on the global crisis as a multi-decade rite of passage toward higher</p>
<p>consciousness. Throughout, Bache emphasizes that psychedelics are merely amplifiers; it is</p>
<p>consciousness itself that drives transformation. The conversation offers both cautionary notes on</p>
<p>extreme psychedelic practice and an inspiring vision of humanity’s potential.</p>

<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Hi, everybody. We’re about to have a phenomenal conversation with</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Bache</strong>, whom I consider a hero for undertaking a journey most of us could not</p>
<p>withstand—73 carefully structured LSD sessions to probe the nature of consciousness. Welcome,</p>
<p>Christopher.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> Hi, Regina. It’s good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> After reading your book <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, everyone asks the</p>
<p>same thing halfway through: why did you keep going? You endured pain so intense it sometimes took</p>
<p>months to recover, yet you returned again and again. Why?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> Looking back, it was probably foolish to push so hard, but I was young and</p>
<p>driven. Trained as a philosopher of religion, I wanted to understand the deep structure of reality.</p>
<p>When I discovered Stan Grof’s protocol, I decided to pursue it relentlessly. Each bout of</p>
<p>suffering was followed by breakthroughs of ecstatic bliss and profound insight—rewards that far</p>
<p>outweighed the pain.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Your first phase was the “death of ego,” and you wondered, *What was I</p>
<p>thinking?* Describe that initial dissolution.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> To reach broader consciousness you must surrender the narrow bandwidth of</p>
<p>body-mind ego. Whether gradual or sudden, that identity must shatter. Once it does, awareness</p>
<p>expands into deeper registers. Over a long journey you die many deaths, but the first ego death is</p>
<p>the gateway from time-space identity into spiritual reality.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Later you became a woman—experiencing life, birth, and connection from a</p>
<p>female perspective. How did that change you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> About two-and-a-half years in, the universe forced me to perceive solely</p>
<p>through a feminine identity—the opposite of my male academic self. At first it was terrifying; then</p>
<p>an ecstatic world opened. I became hundreds of women under the Great Mother’s arm. Gender roles</p>
<p>dissolved, preparing me for realms where gender doesn’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Session 11 plunged you into archetypal mass suffering—war, violence, horror.</p>
<p>What did that teach you?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> The pivotal vision was the <em>killing of the children</em>, awakening soul-level</p>
<p>compassion. I learned that historical trauma is buried in the collective psyche much as personal</p>
<p>trauma lodges in the individual. My sessions shifted: I was no longer the patient; some aspect of</p>
<p>humanity was being healed through me.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Today many see current conflicts as “end times.” From your vantage, how do you</p>
<p>interpret this era?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> In 1995 I experienced humanity’s death-and-rebirth: a global systems crisis</p>
<p>triggered by escalating ecological breakdown. I wasn’t shown dates or specific events, only a long</p>
<p>period of destabilization that forces spiritual evolution. Current turmoil is just the overture of</p>
<p>decades of deepening challenge that will birth the future human.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Session 15 revealed karma in action. What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> Beyond theory, I witnessed my entire life—beginning to end—as a completed</p>
<p>whole, embedded in a karmic fabric with everyone around me. Choices ripple through time; our task</p>
<p>is to respond skillfully within that meaningful weave.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky just claimed free will is an illusion. Your</p>
<p>thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> That view rests on a 19th-century deterministic metaphysics. Quantum</p>
<p>reality values indeterminacy. Yes, much of our psychology is conditioned, yet within conditioning</p>
<p>we choose—and those choices can increase or decrease conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> You define the soul as “a story of individual consciousness ultimately sourced</p>
<p>in cosmic intelligence, moving between physical universe and metaverse.” Can you expand?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> The soul is a center of integration collecting experiences across all</p>
<p>lifetimes. Its essence is the same light that is the essence of the totality. Our evolutionary</p>
<p>challenge now is to awaken that soul <em>inside</em> time and space—what I call the birth of the diamond</p>
<p>soul.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> You paused for six years at your wife’s request, then resumed at the exact</p>
<p>point you’d left off.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> Yes. The work restarted in the same ocean of suffering, then vaulted into a</p>
<p>crash course in cosmology—encounters with vast pre-temporal beings whose actions shape time and</p>
<p>space.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Tell us about those galaxy-sized beings.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> They were unimaginably ancient, more real than time-space—archetypal</p>
<p>architects of creation. Human experience, even male–female polarity, expresses their intentions.</p>
<p>Our minds are fractal sparks within a species mind, nested in planetary, solar, and galactic</p>
<p>intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> You saw reincarnation as collective purification.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> Exactly. Individual journeys are facets of a species-wide evolution. We</p>
<p>incarnate in historical waves to heal unfinished business together.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Many assume oneness is the final goal. You discovered otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> Oneness is foundational—awakening compassion and revealing our true nature—</p>
<p>but evolution continues. The universe has billions of years of creativity ahead. My final visions</p>
<p>hinted at futures that sound like science fiction.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Please share.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> The future human—the diamond soul—embodies healed heart, expansive mind, and</p>
<p>radically enhanced senses. In my 73rd session I experienced “diamond vision,” seeing with</p>
<p>thousand-fold clarity. Humanity is a hothouse for consciousness that may ultimately seed other</p>
<p>worlds.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Sessions 71–73 showed that the human vehicle is built for rapid</p>
<p>transformation.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> Individual learning accumulates in a deeper collective structure. Periodic</p>
<p>shifts in that “plate tectonics of the psyche” re-basement all future incarnations. We are entering</p>
<p>one now.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Final thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> Psychedelics are just amplifiers. Consciousness does the work. Many</p>
<p>pathways—meditation, prayer, service—lead to the same depths. Use whatever method safely opens your</p>
<p>heart and mind.</p>
<p><strong>REGINA MEREDITH:</strong> Christopher, thank you. I look forward to continuing this in the studio.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER BACHE:</strong> Thank you, Regina. I do too.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In this excerpt from <em>Adventures Through the Mind</em>, Chris Bache reflects on what it means to be</p>
<p>a “good person” from the vantage of deep psychedelic practice. He describes moments in which a</p>
<p>transparent oneness opens—feet rooted in the earth like a tree, intimacy with grass, and a living</p>
<p>sense that all beings share one breath. From that ground, harming anyone feels unthinkable and</p>
<p>helping everyone simply arises. Goodness, he suggests, is a compass pointing toward oneness, with</p>
<p>compassion, fairness, and justice as its fractal expressions. The host presses on the challenge of</p>
<p>enactment and integration—how fleeting experiences become lived ethics when ordinary life resumes.</p>
<p>Bache answers with humility: constant self-checking, recommitment, apprenticing to better examples,</p>
<p>and practicing within community (sangha). Integration is lifelong work; progress is gradual, and</p>
<p>family reliably punctures spiritual pretensions. Humor and realism temper the ideals throughout.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> Given where we are, and given your deep psychedelic work, what does it mean to be a good</p>
<p>person right now? What does it take?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yeah, that’s a large question. Many ways to answer it pop into my mind, and all of</p>
<p>them are wrong, so I’m sifting through layers. <em>[applause]</em></p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In some of my deepest experiences, something falls away and something opens. I</p>
<p>experience the world truly as living and breathing as one. My feet feel rooted in the earth the way</p>
<p>a tree is rooted. I look down at the grass and feel complete continuity of being—different species</p>
<p>sharing the same moment in time, the pulse of the universe in utter simplicity.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In that transparency of being, my mind opens into a delicious sense of presence,</p>
<p>an intimacy even with grass. My heart opens, and the idea of harming anyone is the farthest thing</p>
<p>from my mind. Helping everyone is the most natural thing in the world. It’s not “being good”; it’s</p>
<p>being alive in oneness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Goodness is a compass needle pointing toward that fundamental truth of oneness. Its</p>
<p>derivatives—compassion, fairness, justice—are fractal manifestations of oneness in circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> So, what does it take today? A commitment to serving a good that isn’t private—a</p>
<p>collective good that includes future generations and species unlike us. It’s an honest confrontation</p>
<p>with what is, to bring about a better life for other beings.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> At its essence it’s simple; enacting it is complicated. If action isn’t grounded in</p>
<p>oneness, maybe there’s something not to trust in it. My deepest answer is frankly mystical: in</p>
<p>oneness, goodness just arises—like the spontaneous upwelling you feel when you encounter beauty.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> I have a joking and a serious response. The joke is: should we all just take 500 mics of</p>
<p>LSD? The serious part is about the dance of enactment. I’ve had that oneness, and yet most of the</p>
<p>time I’m not there. A deep experience doesn’t automatically make a deep person. How do we remember?</p>
<p>How do we catch ourselves forgetting? Maybe this is a question about integration.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> We go up the mountain, receive blessings, and then Monday morning we go to work.</p>
<p>Over and over, it means engaging how we’re showing up, checking ourselves, and recommitting to do</p>
<p>better—again and again.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> For me, much of it played out in teaching. I loved being with students, always</p>
<p>wanting to do better, and constantly catching myself—making assumptions, drawing false inferences,</p>
<p>being tired and letting them down one day—then coming back to do better the next day, next week,</p>
<p>next semester.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Integration is rightly getting more attention, but the term only carries us so far.</p>
<p>It’s hard to live our visions. It commits us to sustained awareness of how poorly we’re embodying</p>
<p>what we know to be true—and to keep trying anyway.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Being around genuinely good people helps. Their example makes it easier to face our</p>
<p>shortcomings: “They’re doing this better; I can learn.” In Buddhism, spiritual friends—sangha—are a</p>
<p>pillar of progress.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Practice and practice and practice. Ten years later, maybe we’re in it a little</p>
<p>more; ten years after that, a little more. And if we ever think we’re there, ask our young children.</p>
<p>They’ll set us straight. <em>[laughter]</em></p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong> Or, as Ram Dass quipped, if you think you’re enlightened, go spend a week with your</p>
<p>parents. <em>[music]</em></p>

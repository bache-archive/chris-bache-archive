<p>Chris Bache joins host Jef Baker for a wide-ranging Bicycle Day discussion on</p>
<p>Bache’s twenty-year journey through seventy-three high-dose LSD sessions, the</p>
<p>methodology he adopted from Stanislav Grof, and the insights captured in *LSD</p>
<p>and the Mind of the Universe*.</p>
<p>Bache explains his rigorous recording and integration process, the importance</p>
<p>of music as a mnemonic trigger, and why recall becomes critical at 500–600 µg</p>
<p>doses.</p>
<p>He contrasts LSD’s “clean,” culture-light territory with plant medicines</p>
<p>steeped in ancestral use, outlines five nested levels of consciousness—from</p>
<p>personal through “diamond luminosity”—and shares visions of a collective</p>
<p>species-wide death-rebirth leading to the “future human.”</p>
<p>The conversation closes with reflections on integration, the perils of psychic</p>
<p>inflation, and psychedelics’ role in catalyzing a new cosmology suited to the</p>
<p>civilizational crises of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> <em>[Intro music fades]</em> Author and psychedelic explorer Chris</p>
<p>Bache has documented insights from seventy-three high-dose LSD sessions</p>
<p>conducted over twenty years. Following Stanislav Grof’s protocol, he went on a</p>
<p>life-changing journey into deep communion with cosmic consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s a pleasure to be with your community again. My new book,</p>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, distills those sessions. Writing took five</p>
<p>years after decades of note-taking and digestion.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> Your integration process—writing within twenty-four hours while</p>
<p>replaying the session music—really struck me.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Recall is a serious issue at 600 µg. Listening to the same</p>
<p>music in sequence lets me “stand at the edge of the well,” re-entering just</p>
<p>enough to capture the ineffable.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> You always worked eyes-shaded, with a sitter, completely</p>
<p>internalized?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. Three medium-dose warm-ups, then only high doses—about</p>
<p>500–600 µg—over seventy-three sessions. Safety and isolation were paramount.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> Why such large doses?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Initially, time was scarce in a dual-career family. I thought</p>
<p>I could move through personal karma faster. Soon the content exploded beyond</p>
<p>the personal into collective and trans-personal domains.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> You’d change your protocol today?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’d mix high and low doses, balance LSD with psilocybin or</p>
<p>ayahuasca—be gentler. Back then, starting in ’79, knowledge and access were</p>
<p>limited.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> You describe two phases in every session: cleansing then</p>
<p>ecstasy.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Exactly. Intense purification peaks, a death-rebirth, then</p>
<p>ecstatic transcendence. Depth depends on how thorough the cleansing is, both</p>
<p>in the session and across the entire series.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> You map five core platforms of consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Personal, collective, archetypal, oneness, and diamond</p>
<p>luminosity (Dharmakaya). Each requires a different death. Entering archetypal</p>
<p>reality meant dying as a human being to access forces shaping space-time.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> Deep-time visions led to insights on humanity’s future.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Starting around session 55 I experienced our species’ death</p>
<p>and rebirth—a dark-night crisis birthing the “diamond soul.” Post-crisis</p>
<p>humans awaken to soul-level identity, unlocking vast compassion and communion</p>
<p>with cosmic intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> Are we in that labor now?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I believe so. The ecological and systemic unraveling is a</p>
<p>collective purification. It’s painful but purposeful—an evolutionary</p>
<p>threshold.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> Where do psychedelics fit?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Therapeutic research opens the door, but mystery-school work</p>
<p>is essential. Psychedelics reconnect us to deeper mind, Earth consciousness,</p>
<p>and the universe precisely when materialist worldviews fail.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> You caution about integration after stopping in ’99.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Integrating sessions differs from integrating an entire</p>
<p>journey. I drifted into longing for death to regain transcendence. It took ten</p>
<p>years to ground fully in the world of immanence.</p>
<p><strong>JEF BAKER:</strong> Final advice?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Respect the medicines, integrate thoroughly, beware psychic</p>
<p>inflation, and remember: the divine wants to be known—ineffability is</p>
<p>overrated.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In this second Edge of Mind conversation, Andrew Holecek and Chris Bache dive deeper into Bache’s</p>
<p>twenty-year, high-dose LSD practice and the philosophy it revealed. They explore openness and</p>
<p>contraction as the “combustion cycle” of awakening, ego death as training for physical death, and</p>
<p>the rhythms of surrender that move awareness through personal, collective, archetypal, and</p>
<p>extrasamsaric domains. Bache differentiates contemplative “slow-bake” realization from</p>
<p>cosmological exploration catalyzed by psychedelics, recounting his encounters with the “diamond</p>
<p>luminosity,” clear light mind, and the intuition of an infinite progression beyond any final</p>
<p>omega point. The dialogue turns practical with integration, risks, and constitutions required for</p>
<p>this work, then widens to reincarnation, voluntary embodiment, near-death research, and a</p>
<p>species-level inflection—an ordeal that could seed the emergence of the “future human” rooted in</p>
<p>compassion, creativity, and shared responsibility.</p>
<h1>Part 1</h1>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Welcome everybody to our ongoing Edge of Mind podcast, where I have the honor to spend more time with this remarkable thinker and explorer, Chris Bache.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Today we’ll continue unpacking aspects of his journey introduced in part one. A brief bio, then we’ll jump right in.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Chris is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years, a Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and on the advisory board for Grof transpersonal training and the Grof Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> An award-winning teacher and international speaker, he is the author of several books and, last I recall, living in Portland. Are you still there?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> We’re in Weaverville, North Carolina now.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> I’m glad I asked. Chris, thank you again for returning to unfold more of the implications of your journey.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s a pleasure to be with you today, Andrew. Thank you for the invitation.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> I was rereading the latter chapters of <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em> and also <em>The Living Classroom</em>. There is rich interconnectivity between them.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> I’d like to start with a narrative close to my heart: openness and contraction. Using your language, it feels like the combustion cycle of the path.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> We can feel openness and contraction somatically, not just as concepts. Perhaps we can begin here, letting this theme dilate into the diamond luminosity, the climax of your book.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Good place to start.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In my experience, psychedelics—and specifically LSD, my primary medicine—amplify consciousness. When consciousness is amplified, quiet signals get loud. You become aware of more.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> How you meet what emerges is decisive. If you engage the shadow consciously—fears, habits, constrictions—and trace them to their roots, they resolve. With each resolution, consciousness opens into more spaciousness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Letting go of what holds awareness small—especially the time-space, historical ego—reveals deeper dimensions of what you truly are.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Continue and you pass through multiple layers. At certain points you must surrender not only personal identity but identity as a human being, and even the time-space frame itself.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Experience flows beyond time and space. This is natural. LSD accelerates what nature already does.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> At birth, consciousness contracts into an individual identity. At death, it expands into deeper spiritual awareness. Sessions intensify this contraction–expansion, letting you burn off more karma than usual. Meditation works similarly.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> My running definition of meditation is “habituation to openness.” Etymologically, the Buddha is the “opened one” as much as the “awakened one.”</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> How early did this become apparent in your journey? And how did it help you go further?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It began in my first session. I couldn’t remember anything about myself—name, work, even whether I was male or female. Identity was gone.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Frightening at first, then identity returned later in the session. That initial shock taught me the cost of ego death. It is a real death.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It trained me in surrender. If you can’t control self-identity, you learn to let go. As stakes rose, I knew surrender was the key.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> About two and a half years in, the individual ego inverted and collapsed. A death was followed by rebirth into a deeper state.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> After two years immersed in the ocean of suffering—the unfinished pain of humanity—another death catapulted me beyond the collective unconscious into archetypal reality.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The pattern repeated: death, opening, deeper light. Even light showed gradients—levels of purity and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> A caution: in psychic and subtle domains, the sensation can be of getting larger. Later, it reverses. Vast fields of light contract into the present and explode awareness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I began to wonder whether “psychedelics” as mind-openers miss that they are also mind-contractors—into the present, present, present—until you drop into a different order of presence.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Beautiful. In Vajrayana, there is language about the “fourth moment” accessible only through the present moment. Healthy contraction becomes the portal to the timeless.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Another frame: your path differs from contemplative slow-bake realization. Yours is temporary immersion. The experiences are revelatory, but not the same as stabilized realization.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. Apples and oranges. An enlightened experience does not make an enlightened being. Experience has a beginning and end. Realization abides.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Deeper states are also more open states. They show how we construct the self moment to moment. The ego is a process, not a product.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Does that reflect your discovery?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It does, especially early on when understanding your personal contractions is helpful.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> But my work became cosmological. I left not only the personal ego but deeper strata to explore how the universe constructs reality—how archetypal fields structure time-space, how oneness manifests as multiplicity, how the fertile void births time and space.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I often wished for a PhD in physics. The universe can only communicate what we can understand.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Integration then is ingestion, digestion, and metabolism. Too much opening without enough digestion can mimic psychosis—an “eating disorder” of the soul.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The work carries risks and needs careful supports. But I did not feel on the psychosis edge. The opening unfolded systematically, peeling layers safely.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> If integration had failed, I would have paused. For me, there was always a comfortable congealing after opening. Constitution matters. One needs a strong enough self to be no one.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Toward the end you stopped after 73 sessions. Your system was running hot. The feast exceeded capacity to digest in this lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That’s fair. Not because I failed to ride the winds, but because I rode them too long.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Our traditions often underestimate the dimensions of the divine. Even skillful use can open intimacy with the universe beyond time and space. Coming back became too painful. I chose to stay and digest.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> You write movingly about longing for death as return to the beloved. Why will dissolution at death be easier or different than now?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I don’t think it will be different. If I died now, the training would serve. Spiritual and physical deaths are intertwined.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> There is the domain of light and the green, manifest world—dharmakaya and nirmanakaya. They interpenetrate. Death is an intersection between modes.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’ve been taken through dying many times. I’ve studied the bardo confusions and addressed many. I may be wrong, but I expect death to be joyful and easy. Clinging has softened.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Let’s rebrand language. “Psychedelic” can be loaded; “entheogen” helps. “Death” could be “transition.”</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In the diamond luminosity chapter, after many deaths, the concept of death loses meaning. You learn you cannot die. Form dies; you do not.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Repetition breeds familiarity. The Tibetan word for meditation means “to become familiar.” Die often and you befriend the process.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> His Holiness the Karmapa said at the moment of transition, “Nothing happens.” To reach that is cherished.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Agreed. Though my most extreme strip-down came in the 70th session. Context matters. Depth can be demanding even with surrender.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> If death is the grand opening, then we have something to look forward to. Near-death research shows how one encounter changes lives.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. One clear touch can dissolve thousands of years of wandering. People recognize reality’s objectivity. It is hyper-real.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Another theme: to become one with the universe, first become one within. Befriend the shadow and stop outsourcing it to the unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> When you move into intimacy with life, unintegrated pieces surface to be healed. Oneness with life deepens oneness within, and vice versa. Integrity blossoms.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> And we must relinquish “private enlightenment.” Everything we do for others is our awakening.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. Service dissolves the last spiritual shadow.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> With your permission, let’s turn to the light—diamond luminosity. Would you walk us through?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> This transition came 15 years into the work. I had passed ego death, the ocean of suffering, archetypal reality, and received profound blessings—oneness, shunyata, cosmic love, and insights into reincarnation and humanity’s future.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I had experienced many forms of light. Then, after a full death process, the next session dropped me directly into fruition and into a luminosity beyond any before.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I called it the death state. A swirling disc appeared containing all moments of my life. I fell from the center to touch one facet, instantly dying into luminosity, then returning to the center. Over and over, until coming and going ceased and I abided in that clarity.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Ecstasy, yes, but more than that—clarity. Breathtaking clarity. The context within which all thought and feeling occur, yet itself only clear.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Touching it for one second dissolves ages of samsaric shadow. I understood this as extrasamsaric reality. At first I thought sambhogakaya; later I recognized dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Of course I wanted to return next session, but I wasn’t taken back for a year. Five sessions of purification followed, then diamond luminosity again. This repeated: about a year of intense work, then re-entry.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The second immersion was deepest. My cosmology inverted. Far in the distance was a reality of light more exquisite still. A ray struck and shattered me. I called it absolute light—beyond diamond luminosity.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In an instant I realized there is no end state. It is an infinite progression. Death keeps returning as we push.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Later immersions did not go “deeper” but compressed diamond luminosity into my being, dissolving bodily structures, crunching into the cellular level in fierce purification.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> This culminated in initiation into Buddha-nature, the pure nature of mind—embodied diamond luminosity, the abiding foundation of existence without beginning or end.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> <em>[Music]</em></p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Thank you for trusting us with that. Using Buddhist nomenclature risks shrink-wrapping the mystery, yet it orients us—dharma-dhatu, dharmakaya, clear light mind.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I use terms to point, but stay humble before the great contemplatives.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Another frame helps. The universe is 13.7 billion years old; Earth about 4.5. Self-awareness emerged gradually. Only a few thousand years ago did we develop technologies of mind to access the universal within.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Awakening is real, but it is the tip of an exquisite iceberg. If we look 100,000 years ahead—a blink in cosmic time—surely deeper capacities will flower.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> So we honor categories and also refuse to ossify them. Openness keeps us in intimacy with the beloved and the light birthing the world each second.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> You used “extrasamsaric.” Do you mean beyond the bardos and cycles?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Beyond bardo patterns into a world of light. Individuality there is translucent, not annihilated. Liberation stabilizes individuality rather than extinguishing it.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Where does the light go when post-session reality returns? How does it relate to appearance?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The light doesn’t go anywhere. It manifests the world. Physics says matter is light—quarks, fields, energy. Deep mind finds light; deep matter is light. Two doors to one house.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> When clear, the world is a miracle—genius at every scale. When clouded, the mind casts shadows.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Is the return to form a dissociation or a healthy differentiation?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> There’s a pathological way and a happy way. In the happy way we return as a human bubble among countless bubbles, essence shared, forms diverse. Kinship deepens responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Let’s touch samadhi. Why does it end? Why not abide forever?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Some beings stabilize abiding clarity. For most of us, habits of embodiment reassert. If your aim is awakening, you can cultivate abiding transparency.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> If your trajectory is cosmological exploration, the burden is temporariness. Breakfast still awaits.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> A healthy way back trusts the wisdom of the universe and accepts human limits without inflation.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Then the aim is ending involuntary rebirth. Openness becomes so familiar that, at death, you abide as openness. Rebirth becomes voluntary, out of compassion.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That’s fair. Involuntary incarnation ends; voluntary embodiment begins. Long term, I believe we all become tulkus.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In one session, former lives streamed into me until they fused. A diamond light burst from my chest. Individual consciousness actualized to a degree I’d never known—the birth of the diamond soul.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I think humanity is gestating this collectively. We transition from escape-oriented moksha to awakening here. The “future human” is more peaceful, compassionate, creative, and insightful.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> To my ear, “growing down” into embodied integration complements “growing up.” Yet I struggle with optimism. Evolution stumbles. The winds don’t feel favorable.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Outside my visionary experience, I have no reason for optimism.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Beginning in the early 1990s, visions came unbidden: a turning point and a collective awakening.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In my 55th session, instead of diamond luminosity I dissolved into the collective psyche across deep time and experienced a global systems crisis—billions dying, an unraveling that felt like extinction.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Then the storm subsided. Survivors rebuilt with compounding freedom, insight, and values—a species-level death and rebirth.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In the 70th session, I was shown the archetypal structure of the future human. It brings me to tears even now.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I was also shown a mechanism. The collective psyche will enter a highly energized, non-linear state—far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Creativity will surge; change will accelerate beyond linear forecasts.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It will likely get very hard. We will lose hope repeatedly. A deeper vision can help us endure and act.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Let’s end with prescriptions. What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Duane Elgin’s <em>Choosing Earth</em> lays out the next five decades soberly and offers grounded actions for a safe landing. He gives the book away.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> From a reincarnational view, each of us chose to be here now with the talents and challenges we carry. We are standing where we need to serve.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Make the commitment that your life counts toward the good, then look around. All talents are needed—medical, political, creative, practical.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Do spiritual practice. Face the shadow. Build community. Learn to do more with less. Share. Restructure social and political life away from ego.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Any final thread from <em>The Living Classroom</em>?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Consciousness is unified from the start. Everything we do radiates in a 360-degree field. Teaching and life have quantum qualities, not just atomistic ones. Strengthen the sinews that bind us to all life.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Conversations change lives. Thank you for your bravery, heart, and capacity.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you, Andrew. Love and blessings.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW HOLECEK:</strong> Love and blessings. Until next time.</p>

</ul>
<p>“absolute light,” and insight that awakening is an infinite progression beyond any omega point.</p>

<p>the “diamond soul” as fused continuity of lifetimes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nondual physics and phenomenology: light as foundation of matter and mind; individuality liberated rather than</li>
</ul>
<p>erased, grounding kinship and ecological responsibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Species pivot: visions of global crisis leading to non-linear, far-from-equilibrium transformation and the</li>
</ul>

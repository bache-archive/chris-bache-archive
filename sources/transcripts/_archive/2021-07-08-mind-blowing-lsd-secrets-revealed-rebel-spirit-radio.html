<p><em>Abstract — 124 words</em></p>
<p>Host Nick Mather speaks with CHRIS BACHE about his 20-year, 73-session, high-dose LSD journey chronicled in <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. Bache explains the rigorous Grof-inspired protocol he followed, why he does not recommend others copy his path, and how intention yields to surrender at high doses. He describes engaging a “generative intelligence” of the universe, develops a nuanced model of reincarnation oriented to embodying the soul on Earth, and argues that long-term ethical choices accelerate growth. The conversation explores collective purification, the “ocean of suffering,” successive deaths and rebirths into archetypal, causal, and “diamond luminosity” (clear light) realities, and critiques axial-age religions for undervaluing women and nature. Bache sees psychedelics as amplifiers of consciousness and catalysts for eco-spiritual renewal.</p>
<p><em>[Music]</em></p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Welcome to Rebel Spirit Radio, exploring spirituality, consciousness, the esoteric, and humanity’s sacred relationship with a living Earth. I’m Nick Mather. In this episode I speak with CHRIS BACHE, author of <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, which details 73 high-dose LSD sessions over two decades. We’ll discuss reincarnation, human evolution, cosmic intelligence, our ecological moment, and more. Chris is Professor Emeritus in philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct faculty at CIIS, an emeritus fellow at IONS, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. His books include <em>Life Cycles</em>, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, <em>The Living Classroom</em>, and <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. Chris, welcome to Rebel Spirit Radio. I’m grateful for your time and excited for this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’m glad to be here.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> I thoroughly enjoyed your book. It’s personal, beautifully written, and necessary. It feels like the source material that undergirds your other work. For listeners new to you: what led you to this journey, and why LSD?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Quite unexpectedly. I grew up in Mississippi, earned a theology degree at Notre Dame, and I’m the last person you’d expect to write a psychedelic autobiography. After finishing doctoral work at Brown as a philosopher of religion, I began teaching at Youngstown State. I encountered Ian Stevenson’s research at the University of Virginia, which convinced me that reincarnation is a fact of life. Even more influential was Stanislav Grof’s work. In 1978, reading Grof convinced me psychedelics matter for philosophical inquiry, not just psychological healing.</p>
<p>I concluded that the most important contributions in my field would come from writers with an experiential basis. Though psychedelics were illegal, I began a private, hidden inquiry that became 73 high-dose LSD sessions following Grof’s <em>LSD Psychotherapy</em> protocol. By day I was a conventional professor; privately I explored the deep structure of consciousness and how the universe manifests within it. That’s how it started.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Coming from religious studies myself, it’s refreshing to hear emphasis on practice. You also make clear you don’t recommend others do what you did.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Correct. Setting legality aside—that landscape is changing—I would not recommend my specific protocol today. Knowing what I know now, I would suggest a different, gentler path.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> The book doesn’t read like a lark in Las Vegas. There’s real pain and difficulty. You also had to keep it secret for a long time. With the changing landscape—Oregon and beyond—do you ever think about teaching this material in a more open classroom?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I did some teaching at CIIS after <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, but the core of my work took place between 1979 and 1999, ages 30 to 50. I’m in my early 70s now. It would be fascinating to teach this in-person today. There was an upside to waiting 20 years to write <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>: high doses push you far beyond most mystical literature, using a methodology very different from contemplative traditions. There were riddles that took years to understand. By holding the material and working through its puzzles, I could present a clearer arc of the journey.</p>
<p>Methodologically, this wasn’t recreational. It paralleled today’s therapeutic set-and-setting, but aimed at inquiry. Each session I was isolated from the world, lying down with eye shades and headphones, listening to carefully sequenced music, under the care of my then-wife, a clinical psychologist, who sat for all my sessions. I wrote each session within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Would the same methodology apply at lower doses?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes, though the journey differs. Lower doses tend to peel layers gradually through psychodynamic material. High doses catalyze powerful catharsis and move quickly through perinatal territory into transpersonal domains.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Many people begin with an intention. You’ve written that at high doses intention didn’t matter—you were taken where a larger intelligence wanted. Is intention still useful at low doses?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The essence is surrender within safe containment. At lower doses, intention can influence direction. At high doses, intention shatters. A larger consciousness guides the journey. Often I didn’t understand the deep structure until years later. Throughout, I was engaging an intelligence I call the mind of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Is that what others might call God, or something beyond?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> “God” carries cultural baggage. You might call it the Dao, or the generative intelligence responsible for the Big Bang and the unfolding of time-space. The universe is vast, ancient, and—psychedelic research adds—conscious. Mystical traditions gesture at its qualities, but even then we’re describing the hem of the garment.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Let’s go deeper into your cosmology, especially reincarnation. Stevenson’s research is compelling, but your view departs from traditional models.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The data support continuity of memory across lives; our consciousness is older than our body. How it works—the “physics” of reincarnation—remains opaque. I reject simplistic notions like devolving from human to animal. Multiple lives can condition a present life simultaneously; imagine a hand of cards dealt from a larger deck of former lives.</p>
<p>When we die, consciousness expands into a larger state—call it the soul, the consciousness that holds all incarnational experience. At birth, we contract into specific historical and social conditions. Classical models emphasize awakening and leaving time-space. I think the intermediate goal is different: to awaken and fully embody soul consciousness here. I call this the birth of the diamond soul—remembering former lives and living the deep life gestating across centuries.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Can we act now, even without past-life recall, to shape future rebirths?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. Understanding karma’s cause-effect dynamics naturally shifts choices: non-injury, generosity, long-term thinking—“seven generations” as Indigenous wisdom teaches. Recognizing we are leaves on the same branch, we choose for the good of the tree, accelerating development.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> In that light, those future generations are us. If we truly believed we’d return in 100 years, how would we live now?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> We’d care for ecosystems we’ll re-enter and build just societies we might be born into. Reincarnation frames ecological and social ethics in the long arc.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Are we undergoing a collective spiritual transformation?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> There’s a growing thirst for spiritual truth that isn’t necessarily religiosity. Religions help evolving humanity move from A to B, but no tradition is eternally sufficient. We’re at B and need visions to carry us to C. Axial-age religions share two deep errors: they got women wrong and nature wrong. An “up-and-out” theology devalues Earth. We need gender-balanced and species-balanced visions that honor physicality as sacred.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> I felt early in the pandemic we were offered a last chance. Then business roared back. Your book suggests we must go through the pain—a necessary initiation.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Humanity is being initiated into a new maturity. The ego is a beautiful achievement, but it fragments. We’re inheriting the consequences of an ego-built civilization. A detoxification and purification are underway. Think birth: long gestation, then intense labor. A “future human,” the diamond soul, has been gestating for millennia. Now it’s time to be born. Labor is hard work—and global.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Does this include ancestral trauma and gifts?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes, though it’s subtle. We carry not only pain but also strengths from former lives and ancestral lines—musical, mathematical, social intelligences. Therapy literature skews toward suffering, but most learning is positive and cumulative. Our ancestors live through us; we are the ancestors of our future selves.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> You write that evolution grows species, reincarnation grows individuals. How do they connect?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Reincarnation is evolution’s higher octave. As individuality emerges within species, choices shape learning across lives. It’s an emergent, self-transformative process arising from within, not external intelligent design.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Let’s talk about suffering. You describe embracing an “ocean of suffering.”</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In therapeutic set-and-setting, consciousness becomes hyper-aware and spontaneously cleanses. You meet fears and pains from this life and others. Early on, expansion beyond time-space threatens ego death; surrender liberates deeper textures of mind. Persist, and new layers of dying and rebirth open deeper dimensions.</p>
<p>At a certain point I was drawn into vast fields of species-wide suffering—anger, torture, grief—spanning two years of work. It wasn’t about my personal transformation. It was service: allowing humanity’s trauma to pass through expanded awareness so it could resolve. Each session cycled purification followed by ecstatic instruction. After a culmination, that phase stopped. I moved beyond the collective psyche into archetypal reality, then through another death into causal oneness—the undivided ground where all reality functions as a whole—and then beyond.</p>
<p>My concern for readers is the sheer quantity of suffering reported. I’m no masochist. Suffering is part of purification. The deepest breakthroughs follow the deepest cleansings.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Your inner title is “Diamonds from Heaven.” Are those the blessings beyond the suffering?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Many blessings arise, but “diamonds from heaven” refers specifically to four sessions in the final five years where I was immersed in an ultra-clear “diamond luminosity,” a dimension of pure light beyond imagination. In Buddhist terms, it corresponds to dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality, the radiance from which the Big Bang emerges.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Your cosmology resonates with Buddhism, though you diverge on “leaving” time-space.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’m shaped by many traditions—especially Christianity and Buddhism. My journey affirms their deepest truths while eclipsing the axial religions’ limits. It doesn’t endorse any tradition’s claim of unique privilege. It emphasizes serving the whole, self-sacrifice, long vision, and communion with inspiration arising from the depths of nature and being.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Many are seeking new forms—eco-spirituality, renewed pagan sensibilities, archetypes. Advice for grounding ourselves as a new vision unfolds?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Neo-paganism and eco-spirituality restore nature to spiritual discourse, reconnecting body consciousness with Earth and stars. A living, rhythmic cosmos—felt in serious astrology—is part of that reconnection. Psychedelics have appeared at a decisive moment. Our culture, highly educated yet mechanistic, taught a purposeless universe. Mind-openers amplify consciousness and give direct experience that the universe is living intelligence—far beyond our old images. Used carefully, they reanimate the vision quest, deep meditation, and solitude in nature. Many movements are helping us break old husks and glimpse where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Where can people find you and your work?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> My website, chrisbache.com, is the best place. Academia.edu hosts my academic articles. My books are widely available, including bookshop.org. I’m hosting six-week conversations around <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em> for readers—open to those with and without psychedelic experience. Psychedelics amplify consciousness; they don’t create it. And I go where I’m called. Otherwise, I’m content to grow old gracefully.</p>
<p><strong>NICK MATHER:</strong> Thank you, Chris. I’ve enjoyed this conversation. To listeners: if you enjoyed the podcast, please review, subscribe, and consider supporting via Patreon. Until next time, may you be in peace and flourish in all possible ways.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract (145 words)</strong></p>
<p>Philosopher of religion <strong>Chris Bache</strong> joins Conscious TV host <strong>Ian McNay</strong> to discuss the disciplined</p>
<p>psychedelic research that underpins <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>—his chronicle of 73</p>
<p>high-dose LSD sessions conducted over twenty years. Bache explains how</p>
<p>Stanislav Grof’s therapeutic protocol, rigorous note-keeping, and months-long</p>
<p>integration cycles allowed him to explore successive layers of reality: ego</p>
<p>death, collective suffering, archetypal domains, and the diamond luminosity of</p>
<p>dharmakaya. He contrasts this methodical inquiry with recreational “tripping,”</p>
<p>describes the energetic toll such work takes on the body, and reflects on the</p>
<p>deep sadness that followed his final sessions—a “loss of communion” eventually</p>
<p>healed through family life, nature, and writing. The conversation also covers</p>
<p>Bache’s concept of “quantum pedagogy,” where private mystical practice</p>
<p>mysteriously activates his university students, illustrating consciousness as a</p>
<p>shared field rather than an isolated phenomenon.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>Hello and welcome again to Conscious TV. I’m Ian McNay, and my guest today is</p>
<p>Chris Bache. Hi, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Hi, Ian.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>We discovered you after a London lecture and thought your story fascinating.</p>
<p>You’ve written <em>Life Cycles</em>, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, <em>The Living Classroom</em>,</p>
<p>and an upcoming book, <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>, about a twenty-year journey into</p>
<p>the mind of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I was trained as a philosopher of religion—concerned with life’s meaning,</p>
<p>the universe’s structure, and the limits of consciousness. In 1978 I read</p>
<p>Stanislav Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>, was stunned by its rigor,</p>
<p>and decided to explore those realms myself.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>Your driving questions were about consciousness—its potentials and</p>
<p>boundaries—rather than the usual <em>Who am I?</em> themes.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. Meeting Ian Stevenson’s reincarnation work and Grof’s psychedelic</p>
<p>research the same year blew my agnostic framework apart. I split my life:</p>
<p>publicly a university professor; privately, from 1979-1999, 73 high-dose LSD</p>
<p>sessions using Grof’s eyeshade-music protocol—500-600 µg each time.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>All carefully documented.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Within twenty-four hours I wrote full phenomenological notes—dates, music,</p>
<p>dose, body temperature—everything. Over years I saw a sequential curriculum: ego</p>
<p>death, immersion in humanity’s ocean of suffering, archetypal realities, and</p>
<p>finally the diamond light of dharmakaya.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>That takes courage. You surrender without knowing where it leads.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Grof taught me to trust the process. Each shattering is held by a greater</p>
<p>intelligence. You die, awaken as another being, and continue the dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>What dies, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>First the personal ego—the conditioned story of “Chris Bache.” Later even the</p>
<p>sense of being human dissolves, opening to archetypal and causal domains:</p>
<p>realities of immense energy that require repeated visits to stabilize awareness.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>You never used LSD recreationally.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Never. No concerts, no late-night chats. This was disciplined cosmological</p>
<p>research.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>Mid-journey you wrote <em>The Living Classroom</em>, noting how private sessions</p>
<p>mysteriously activated your students.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Synchronicities exploded. My spontaneous lecture examples mirrored their</p>
<p>weekends. I realized classrooms have morphic fields; teaching became quantum</p>
<p>pedagogy—opening and closing those fields responsibly.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>After your final sessions you felt profound sadness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>I’d tasted the diamond light so deeply that ordinary life seemed a grey exile.</p>
<p>Integration guidance said twenty years; I’m still absorbing. Family, students,</p>
<p>nature, and finally writing the book have re-rooted me in the imminent divine.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>Do psychedelics and contemplative practice reach the same truths?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>My maps match the great mystical traditions. Psychedelics are simply a</p>
<p>different, accelerated method—though experience alone doesn’t make a mystic;</p>
<p>lifelong practice does.</p>
<p><strong>IAN MCNAY:</strong></p>
<p>Chris, thank you for sharing this extraordinary journey.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Ian. It’s been a joy.</p>

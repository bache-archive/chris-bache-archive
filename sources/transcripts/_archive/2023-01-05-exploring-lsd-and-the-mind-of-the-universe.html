      <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In this conversation, CHRIS BACHE outlines his path of “cosmological exploration” using</p>
<p>Grof-style high-dose LSD sessions to investigate the deep structure of consciousness. He</p>
<p>contrasts spiritual awakening with cosmological inquiry, explains why longer windows of</p>
<p>psychedelic action can enable deeper purification, and describes his protocol</p>
<p>(eye-shades, curated music, full-day internalization, detailed next-day notes).</p>
<p>Bache discusses guidance as a vast, formless intelligence, the appearance of deities as</p>
<p>collective thought-forms, and his progression through perinatal, collective, archetypal,</p>
<p>causal oneness, and “diamond luminosity” states. A pivotal vision shattered his belief in</p>
<p>an endpoint, revealing an infinite ascent. He shares visions of a species-level crisis as an</p>
<p>initiation toward a “future human,” reflects on meaning in a materialist culture, and</p>
<p>suggests balancing careful psychedelic work with sustained contemplative practice. The</p>
<p>dialogue closes with practical counsel on healing, service, and orienting attention toward</p>
<p>the living universe as an act of devotion.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> And all of a sudden my visual field pivoted 90 degrees. I saw reality far in the distance,</p>
<p>like galaxies. Out of that reality, a beam of light hit me and absolutely shattered me.</p>
<p>It was more powerful than the diamond luminosity that had been my ultimate reality</p>
<p>50 high-dose sessions in. In one second it completely changed my understanding of reality.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Thank you, Chris. Thank you for being willing to hop on with me.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Glad to be here today, Luke.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Cool. Everyone, this is CHRIS BACHE. He’s a PhD and professor emeritus in the Department</p>
<p>of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years.</p>
<p>An award-winning teacher and international speaker, Chris explores the philosophical implications</p>
<p>of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. Today we’ll focus on ideas</p>
<p>from his book <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>, the story of 20 years and 73 high-dose LSD sessions.</p>
<p>Welcome, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you, Luke. It’s good to be here with you.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Awesome. I thought we’d trace a path many people follow with psychedelics. Often it starts</p>
<p>with microdosing for productivity, then moves into therapy, then spiritual awakening. You took a step</p>
<p>beyond awakening. Could you tell us about that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I call that step “cosmological exploration.” It overlaps with healing and awakening,</p>
<p>but it’s different. Spiritual awakening cleans the system so we can abide more transparently in our</p>
<p>essential nature—what Buddhists call Buddha-nature, others call divine nature. Cosmological exploration</p>
<p>seeks the deep structure of consciousness and the universe: how reality works, why things are the way</p>
<p>they are, and what the deep cosmic architectures are.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> I’d love to ask about those layers of reality, but first the path and protocol you followed.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In 1978, fresh out of graduate school, I read Stan Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em></p>
<p>(1976) and immediately recognized its significance for philosophy of religion. I’m not a therapist; I’ve</p>
<p>always been drawn to the philosophical implications. Answering that call, I began a 20-year project:</p>
<p>four years of intense work, a six-year pause, then ten more years.</p>
<p>I chose high-dose LSD—typically 500–600 micrograms. I don’t recommend that approach today.</p>
<p>If I were doing it over, I’d be gentler, use lower doses, and include a wider spectrum of medicines.</p>
<p>Back then, this was pre-ayahuasca for most Westerners, and I trusted Grof’s LSD research.</p>
<p>My early assumption was: if karma is finite, then bigger doses would clear more in fewer sessions.</p>
<p>That turned out to be wrong. The work quickly opened into collective dimensions, and communion with</p>
<p>the universe at large presented itself.</p>
<p>Protocol-wise, I followed Grof’s <em>LSD Psychotherapy</em>: total isolation with a trusted sitter; lying down</p>
<p>with eye-shades and headphones; carefully curated music; staying inward from morning through evening;</p>
<p>then making detailed records the following day.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> You’ve since experienced psilocybin and ayahuasca. In the book you noted LSD’s long window lets</p>
<p>you “buff the diamond” more. Ibogaine runs 24–48 hours, while 5-MeO-DMT can be 15–20 minutes.</p>
<p>Would ibogaine’s long window be better for awakening? And what might a 5-MeO protocol look like?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I haven’t used ibogaine, so I can’t compare beyond the window. Each medicine amplifies mind</p>
<p>with its own texture and spectrum. Regarding window length, Rick Strassman’s <em>DMT: The Spirit Molecule</em></p>
<p>showed that powerful DMT experiences didn’t necessarily produce deep lasting change. My take is that a longer</p>
<p>window gives big mind more time to interact with and purify small mind—allowing deeper transformation.</p>
<p>Short windows can grant rapid access to very deep states, but there’s less time for integration in situ.</p>
<p>5-MeO-DMT is remarkable and can open very deep realities quickly, but I’m not comfortable rating its</p>
<p>transformative potential against LSD beyond saying that window length matters. Many variables are at play.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> One thing I appreciated in the book is how close you stayed to the phenomenology, not over-interpreting.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> That was intentional. Presenting 20 years of dramatic experiences is a challenge. I chose to stay</p>
<p>close to the raw experience because, for me, the phenomenology was more valuable than any interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> You don’t recommend people do what you did. Yet many will still use psychedelics for awakening.</p>
<p>What slower, safer structure would you suggest that also harmonizes with “slow-burn” traditions?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> With the caveat that I don’t guide others clinically: for awakening, I’d emphasize low doses,</p>
<p>because awakening dissolves the glue of egoic patterning. Pair low-dose work with sustained meditation,</p>
<p>occasionally going deeper to challenge boundaries. The goal is steady unbinding, not fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Many people report “just the right experience at the right time,” as if guided. Did you feel guided?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Always. I engaged—and was engaged by—a larger intelligence. It never crystallized into a personified</p>
<p>form and changed quality as I went deeper. I think our mind acts as a seed-crystal that catalyzes certain</p>
<p>expressions from an infinite consciousness. As our mind transforms through repeated encounters and integration,</p>
<p>the intersection changes, and so does what arises. The guidance was palpable yet formless.</p>
<p>Beyond the collective psyche and even beyond human history, interpretive frameworks fall away.</p>
<p>Images of gods, angels, and religious concepts dissolve. You enter terrains past Jung’s archetypes, where</p>
<p>no historical category applies. Guidance remains, but without form.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> On forms: entity encounters are a popular topic. Someone told me they met Ganesh. What’s the meaning</p>
<p>of encountering a particular deity?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I don’t consider my experiences normative; medicine, method, and personality all vary. Still,</p>
<p>when we touch infinite compassion, intelligence, or creativity, the mind may clothe those qualities in forms</p>
<p>we know—Jesus, Mary, Ganesh—or in forms from traditions we’ve never studied. I understand these as spiritual</p>
<p>principles wearing the garments of collective thought-forms, built by millennia of devotion, imagery, ritual,</p>
<p>and prayer. Those forms are powerful. Sometimes we meet the principle itself through that garment; other times</p>
<p>we meet the garment directly.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to go beyond all such forms. In my DMT-like encounters, entities appeared at certain strata,</p>
<p>but as work deepened, granularity diminished. Populations of beings give way to vast, less-segmented fields</p>
<p>of consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Early on you shifted from “about me” to “about the collective,” and reincarnation became obvious.</p>
<p>What levels did you move through, and how did experience change?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Two thinkers shaped me at the outset: Grof and Ian Stevenson. Stevenson’s careful cases of children</p>
<p>with verifiable past-life memories convinced me of reincarnation before my psychedelic work, and my sessions</p>
<p>greatly deepened that understanding.</p>
<p>As for levels: working at high dose, it took roughly ten sessions to move through the perinatal layer—the</p>
<p>interface between personal and transpersonal consciousness. There you encounter death-rebirth, relive birth,</p>
<p>face existential dread, and undergo ego death. I expected easier access to spiritual reality afterward, but</p>
<p>the cycle repeated at a different altitude. Intense collective anguish rose for another year or two.</p>
<p>At first I misread it as “deeper personal ego death,” but the content was irreducibly collective. The patient</p>
<p>wasn’t me; it was, in some fashion, the human family. Vast collective coex systems—what I called meta-matrices—</p>
<p>held the species’ suffering. After a culminating “ocean of suffering,” that quality ceased, and I was spun into</p>
<p>archetypal reality. Another death-rebirth cycle followed from there.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> For listeners: a coex system in Grof’s terms is a system of condensed experience.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes—an aggregate of memories and affects around a theme. Meta-matrices are the same dynamic at the</p>
<p>collective level.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Is that like ancestral healing?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> They rhyme. Ancestral work stays within a biographical lineage. My work broadened quickly into soul-level</p>
<p>and species-level process. I haven’t focused on ancestors per se, but there’s clearly overlap.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Where do animals fit in?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Many people encounter species minds and totems. My focus was drawn to human consciousness—humanity is the</p>
<p>greatest danger to life here. Heal humanity and the rest benefits. Others’ work with nonhuman intelligences is</p>
<p>essential; it just wasn’t my assignment.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> You describe a jump into archetypal reality that made everyday life feel “less real.” Did your sense of</p>
<p>reality change in jumps?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Repeatedly. Retrospectively, I sketched five overlapping cores: personal mind, collective mind,</p>
<p>archetypal mind, causal oneness, and diamond luminosity. Moving from personal to collective is a step up in</p>
<p>organization. Archetypal reality was a quantum step: I often sensed I was in a domain more real than time and</p>
<p>space. Plato’s archetypes are a useful pointer, but I experienced them as living intelligences moving on vast</p>
<p>timescales—too immense for full cognitive grasp. At a “lower” archetypal tier, I repeatedly experienced our</p>
<p>species as a single organism, with networks linking us like neural and psychic connective tissue. We are</p>
<p>hard- and soft-wired into species mind. Healing oneself contributes to collective healing.</p>
<p>From archetypal depths I moved into what I called causal oneness, where the universe is a single organism.</p>
<p>There are differentiations, but no separate selves. Experiences of emptiness (śūnyatā), the void, cosmic love,</p>
<p>and the birth of what I later called the “diamond soul” all unfolded there.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Then came the diamond luminosity.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes—hyper-clear states of light, far beyond previous clarity. Over four years I entered that reality</p>
<p>only four times; between them were demanding purification processes to sustain clear cognition in higher energy</p>
<p>fields. After two deep entries, something changed: instead of going farther “out,” the diamond luminosity began</p>
<p>pressing farther “in”—into body, mind, heart.</p>
<p>A pivotal moment came in my 50th session—only my second time in that light. My field pivoted 90 degrees and I</p>
<p>saw a distant reality, galaxy-like. A beam from it shattered me. It was even more powerful than the diamond light</p>
<p>I had taken as ultimate. In an instant I understood: there is no endpoint. I let go of the finish-line myth and</p>
<p>focused on absorbing what I was being given as deeply as possible.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Later you saw a vision of humanity’s future. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Beginning in the mid-1990s, I received a series of initiations into the human story—visions of an</p>
<p>historical process trying to awaken the species, not just individuals. In 1995, after deep work in the diamond</p>
<p>light, I dissolved into species mind and deep time. I experienced, as our species, a global systems crisis</p>
<p>driven by cascading ecological failures. Details were not given—only the fact and feel of it. At the peak,</p>
<p>we crossed a threshold. On the far side, picking ourselves up over years and decades, we were permanently changed.</p>
<p>Our hearts opened to one another, our minds opened to the universe, and synergies around new values, insights,</p>
<p>and capacities began compounding.</p>
<p>In a later session I was shown a further arc: we are gestating the next evolutionary form of the human. Reincarnation</p>
<p>is key. Across lifetimes we expand to soul, contract to ego, repeat. Eventually, soul consciousness ignites within</p>
<p>historical identity. In one session, a critical mass of former lives fused, catapulting individuality into a new</p>
<p>order. I believe humanity is nearing that collective threshold. Birth is short and often traumatic. I think we will</p>
<p>make it through—and grow up.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> That reframed meaning for me. In materialist culture we face a meaning crisis. Did your sense of mental</p>
<p>illness and transpersonal access change?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> It’s a big question, and clinicians can speak more precisely. Joseph Campbell paraphrased: the mystic</p>
<p>swims in waters in which the psychotic drowns. Opening to larger realities can injure if we’re unprepared.</p>
<p>Hence the importance of carefully screened, well-supported settings. I’m less focused on pathology categories</p>
<p>and more on differentiating destabilizing confusion from clarifying initiation. Done well, these are not delusions</p>
<p>but profound educations in the fabric of reality.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Could you walk us up the five levels briefly?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> From personal to collective, archetypal, causal oneness, then diamond luminosity—each involves dying to</p>
<p>assumptions and being reborn into a greater real. In causal oneness you dissolve into the universe as it experiences</p>
<p>itself. In diamond luminosity, clarity surpasses imagination.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Your paragraph “Beyond the Diamond Luminosity” changed everything for me.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> For me too. Fifteen years in, I thought there was a goal—union with God, the primal void. I’d had many such</p>
<p>unions. Then that beam shattered the endpoint myth. The universe is too vast. From then on, I released striving for</p>
<p>“the end” and received what was given.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Coming down the mountain, you also described how to worship—how to orient attention. How has your view of</p>
<p>God and religion changed?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> <em>[Laughter]</em> I need water for that one.</p>
<p>I trained as a theologian and philosopher of religion and largely studied my way out of traditional theology.</p>
<p>Psychedelic work then initiated me into the living realities behind doctrines. It affirmed an infinite intelligence</p>
<p>and compassion manifesting as this universe, yet eclipsed any single tradition. I don’t feel devotionally bound to</p>
<p>one lineage. I prefer “mind of the universe” to theological labels. I honor the cathedral of galaxies—Hubble and</p>
<p>JWST images are profound meditations—and I honor the hidden drivers behind visible nature.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> The West’s meaning crisis is acute. Not everyone will walk a psychedelic path. How can people prepare for</p>
<p>what’s coming?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Psychedelics can “pop” the bubble of flat materialism and reveal a living, meaningful cosmos. Reincarnation</p>
<p>research helps people sense purpose woven through a life. But concepts must be held lightly—humility is essential.</p>
<p>Live with integrity, serve the purpose of your incarnation, and let outcomes unfold. My understanding is that we</p>
<p>choose our incarnations. If so, doing our best where we are is enough.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Practices: process-oriented versus goal-oriented?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Think verbs over nouns—reality as process. Orient not to a fixed summit, but to continual deepening and</p>
<p>alignment.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Scriptures can be exclusivist—“worship no other.” What do you make of that?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Historically, religions were place-bound and identity-forming, often in contrast with neighbors.</p>
<p>That made sense then. Steamships, planes, and now the internet changed the game. The wisdom now is planetary:</p>
<p>seeing patterns across traditions and, at depth, moving beyond all of them into the larger landscape that deep</p>
<p>experience reveals.</p>
<p><strong>LUKE:</strong> Thank you, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Thank you, Luke. These conversations help me digest the work, and I hope they serve others too.</p>

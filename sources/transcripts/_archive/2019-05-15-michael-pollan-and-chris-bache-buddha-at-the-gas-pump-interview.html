<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Rick Archer hosts Michael Pollan and CHRIS BACHE for a wide-ranging conversation on psychedelics,</p>
<p>consciousness, science, and spirituality. Pollan traces his path from food and nature writing to</p>
<p>investigating the “psychedelic renaissance,” describing clinical research with psilocybin for</p>
<p>cancer-related distress, depression, addiction, and more, and explains current neuroscience around</p>
<p>the default mode network, ego dissolution, and brain network integration. BACHE affirms the value of</p>
<p>rigorous phenomenology alongside biology, discusses reincarnation research, and outlines his</p>
<p>twenty-year, high-dose LSD regimen conducted with Stanislav Grof’s method—its ordeals,</p>
<p>purifications, and transpersonal dimensions, including collective healing and the “ocean of</p>
<p>suffering.” Together they explore integration, ethics, decriminalization, and whether meditation can</p>
<p>reach the same realizations. In the final act, BACHE shares his vision of the “future human”—the</p>
<p>“diamond soul”—and a coming civilizational labor that births deeper planetary oneness.</p>
<p><em>[music]</em></p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Welcome to Buddha at the Gas Pump. I’m Rick Archer. This is an ongoing series of</p>
<p>interviews with spiritually awakening people. There are over 500 interviews at batgap.com, where you</p>
<p>can browse past episodes. This program is made possible by the support of appreciative listeners and</p>
<p>viewers; there are donation options on the site.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> My guests today are Michael Pollan and CHRIS BACHE. I’ll introduce Michael first.</p>
<p>He’s the author of eight books, including <em>How to Change Your Mind</em>, and earlier bestsellers on food</p>
<p>such as <em>Cooked</em>, <em>Food Rules</em>, <em>In Defense of Food</em>, and <em>The Botany of Desire</em>. He’s a longtime</p>
<p>contributor to <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> and teaches at Harvard and UC Berkeley, where he is the</p>
<p>John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Science Journalism. In 2010, <em>Time</em> named him one of the</p>
<p>100 most influential people in the world.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Chris has been on BatGap before in a panel. He is Professor Emeritus in Philosophy</p>
<p>and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct faculty at CIIS, and a fellow at IONS.</p>
<p>An award-winning teacher, he explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary consciousness,</p>
<p>especially psychedelics. His books include <em>Life Cycles</em>, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, *The Living</p>
<p>Classroom<em>, and the forthcoming </em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Michael, some folks still think of you as “the food guy.” How did you shift into</p>
<p>writing about psychedelics?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> Before food I was really “the nature guy.” I’ve long been fascinated by the</p>
<p>reciprocal relationship between humans and other species—co-evolution—especially plants. In *The</p>
<p>Botany of Desire* I suggested that domesticated plants manipulate us as much as we manipulate them,</p>
<p>evolving to gratify human desires. Food is one desire, beauty another. I was most intrigued by the</p>
<p>plants—and fungi—that thrive by gratifying our desire to change consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> I’d written on cannabis and plant intelligence, then set it aside while doing</p>
<p>food work. I stumbled on new research giving psilocybin to people with cancer to help with fear of</p>
<p>death or recurrence. As a journalist I sensed something was in the air—serious scientific interest.</p>
<p>At a dinner party a prominent developmental psychologist my age was casually discussing a recent</p>
<p>acid trip and the insights it gave her. A few data points and I thought: there’s a story here.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> I pitched <em>The New Yorker</em> and wrote “The Trip Treatment” in 2015—straight</p>
<p>science journalism: researchers, volunteers, the neuroscience and psychology. The volunteer</p>
<p>interviews were extraordinary. One guided journey could completely reset a person’s relationship to</p>
<p>death; about 80% found relief from existential distress. It’s remarkable—a single intervention in a</p>
<p>field where we rarely see that.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Beyond cancer, what else is being studied?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> Depression is big. In the cancer trials, depression scores dropped, so the FDA</p>
<p>encouraged dedicated depression studies. Early work at Imperial College with treatment-resistant</p>
<p>patients showed significant but sometimes short-lived improvements—months rather than years—yet</p>
<p>encouraging. There are trials for alcohol, nicotine, and cocaine addiction; behavioral change may be</p>
<p>a key application. Johns Hopkins is looking at eating disorders; anorexia is notoriously hard to</p>
<p>treat. There’s been a small OCD study and work with high-functioning autistic people with social</p>
<p>anxiety. These conditions share rigid, ruminative patterns—deep grooves of thought and behavior.</p>
<p>Psychedelics deliver a jolt that can break loops and give perspective, provided there’s careful</p>
<p>preparation, guided sessions, and integration afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> The model is two guides—a man and a woman—non-interventionist but providing a</p>
<p>sense of safety so you can surrender. Then you meet soon after for integration: tell the story,</p>
<p>interpret it, and translate insights into life.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Do the therapists themselves take psilocybin to understand it?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> Off the record, some have; none will say it publicly for reputational reasons.</p>
<p>Frankly, curiosity arises naturally. I realized I couldn’t really grasp the volunteers’ experiences</p>
<p>without having my own, so part of my book is autobiographical work with underground guides, since I</p>
<p>couldn’t enroll in the trials.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Since the 1970s there’s been a clampdown. Is research still a trickle?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> The bottleneck is funding. There’s no federal money; it’s private philanthropy.</p>
<p>But the FDA decided back in ’92 to treat psychedelics like any other drug. If you make the case,</p>
<p>they’ll allow trials; the DEA will license. Now there are multi-site depression trials. Serious</p>
<p>researchers aren’t being blocked; they’re constrained by resources.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> These aren’t dulling drugs; they open awareness. People say, “Most profound</p>
<p>experience of my life, and I don’t want to drink or smoke anymore.”</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> Exactly. Most psychiatric drugs manage symptoms and are taken daily, sometimes</p>
<p>for life. Here, one or two sessions with a short-acting, non-toxic compound can catalyze enduring</p>
<p>change. A leading hypothesis involves the default mode network (DMN), a tightly linked midline</p>
<p>network connecting prefrontal areas with memory and emotion centers. It’s implicated in the sense of</p>
<p>self, autobiographical memory, mental time travel, and theory of mind.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> Under psychedelics the DMN down-regulates dramatically. That surprised</p>
<p>researchers expecting fireworks everywhere. The degree of DMN quieting correlates with reported ego</p>
<p>dissolution. When the conductor steps back, previously segregated networks start talking directly.</p>
<p>You see increased global connectivity—potentially explaining synesthesia and novel associations.</p>
<p>Temporary rewiring creates new pathways that, if exercised, can persist.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> If the brain filters rather than produces consciousness, DMN quieting could reduce</p>
<p>filtration so more consciousness shines through. Meditation research shows something similar; Judson</p>
<p>Brewer’s fMRI work found DMN down-regulation in experienced meditators.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> Yes—different vocabularies for a shared phenomenon. You say “reducing valve,” I</p>
<p>say “ego walls.” Either way, the boundaries soften, allowing merging—internally and externally.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Chris, thoughts so far?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I appreciate Michael’s careful reporting. He’s brought a rigorous, accessible voice</p>
<p>to a topic many would not otherwise consider. It’s invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Shunryu Suzuki spoke of little mind and big mind. Little mind gets things done.</p>
<p>When ego becomes transparent, big mind—vast, inclusive—surfaces. The traditions agree there are many</p>
<p>layers of ego to clarify. As ego quiets, the background field of awareness comes forward. Then we</p>
<p>ask: what is mind itself? If there is mind-at-large, we’re off to the races.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Science and spirituality can complement each other: treat spiritual claims as</p>
<p>hypotheses and investigate them experientially. Our nervous system is the instrument; psychedelics</p>
<p>can be a tool.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Science excels at quantifying correlates; we can also rigorously study the</p>
<p>qualitative nature of experience—careful screening, shared regimens, detailed phenomenological</p>
<p>reports, cross-comparison, and cross-cultural synthesis. Critical doesn’t only mean neurological.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> A big question is whether brains produce consciousness or whether mind precedes</p>
<p>matter. Consensus science assumes production, though no one knows how cells yield subjectivity. Many</p>
<p>people flip after psychedelic experience.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> See Mark Gober’s <em>An End to Upside-Down Thinking</em> and Jeffrey Kripal’s <em>The Flip</em>.</p>
<p>Anomalies keep pecking at strict materialism.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Reincarnation research shifted me. Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia</p>
<p>documented detailed cases of young children recounting prior lives with verifiable specifics,</p>
<p>including birthmarks matching fatal wounds in his two-volume <em>Reincarnation and Biology</em>. If</p>
<p>memories predate the current body, mind cannot be only brain-made.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Like radios receiving fields. But individuality and its continuity are subtle</p>
<p>questions. Here’s another: traditions describe a subtle body. Is it prudent that anyone can ingest a</p>
<p>psychedelic without that preparation, or can psychedelics themselves help prepare?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> Chris?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I won’t assume fixed answers about the subtle body. But I do have convictions about</p>
<p>how deep psychedelic work impacts subtle energies. My background: immediately after grad school in</p>
<p>’78 I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work. Convinced that, in carefully controlled settings,</p>
<p>psychedelics could open deeper structures of mind, I adopted his methods.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Grof distinguishes lower-dose, incremental peeling (15–200 micrograms LSD) from</p>
<p>high-dose work (up to ~500–600 micrograms), originally used with the terminally ill to catalyze</p>
<p>near-death-like encounters that reduce anxiety. After a few lower-dose sessions, I undertook a</p>
<p>20-year regimen of high-dose, fully internalized sessions—73 in total at 500–600 micrograms—always</p>
<p>with a trained sitter. My wife, Carol, a clinical psychologist, sat every session.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I do not recommend this protocol. It’s more demanding than early models envisioned.</p>
<p>But done cautiously—about five sessions a year with deep integration—it revealed opportunities and</p>
<p>challenges. One challenge: each descent stabilized at a deeper level of consciousness and a higher</p>
<p>energy state, triggering intense purification—physical, emotional, mental. You must work the body</p>
<p>and subtle energies: detoxifying, clarifying emotions, strengthening the system.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Vajrayana Buddhists do ngöndro—hundreds of thousands of foundational practices,</p>
<p>including prostrations—to purify and strengthen before advanced teachings. Psychedelics can compress</p>
<p>this, but they still demand purification. If you go deep quickly, catharsis is powerful.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Your book describes convulsions, vomiting, excruciating ordeals, followed by</p>
<p>ecstatic breakthroughs—core cycles of crisis and higher health.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Psychologically, psychedelics are amplifiers and catalysts. They make what is small</p>
<p>loud and what is distant close. Early on I imagined it was about “fixing Chris.” After a crushing</p>
<p>ego death, a two-year passage through an “ocean of suffering” followed—so vast I concluded it was</p>
<p>not merely personal. The universe seemed to be using my sessions to process lodged pain in the</p>
<p>collective psyche. As each of us retains our own history, the species “mind” retains the totality of</p>
<p>human experience. Healing at that level benefits us all.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Like Christ carrying the sins of the world—or the bodhisattva vow—though you frame</p>
<p>it as a natural impulse to relieve suffering when given the chance.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Exactly. You sometimes get that chance in deep work.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> How did the shift from personal to collective occur? Was it in the session or in</p>
<p>later processing?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Both, but the reframe matured over years of study and writing *Dark Night, Early</p>
<p>Dawn*. Existing paradigms focused on individual therapy or enlightenment. Integrating Rupert</p>
<p>Sheldrake’s morphic fields with Grof’s model gave me intellectual permission to interpret the data</p>
<p>collectively. Subsequent archetypal experiences showed the two-way flow between individual and</p>
<p>species mind.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> Skeptics will say: “Drug-induced delusions.” Why should a molecule afford true</p>
<p>insight?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> We should be cautious. But several considerations argue for taking these data</p>
<p>seriously. Sometimes knowledge arises that the experiencer could not have known and is later</p>
<p>verified—perinatal details, accurate ethological or physiological information. Grof even reports a</p>
<p>case where, after a session, a sitter contacted parents at a number given in the session and</p>
<p>verified their son had died and “was okay.” Unusual, but not dismissible out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> You also said you wouldn’t recommend your regimen. Why not—and how did you keep</p>
<p>returning after such agony? Weren’t you worried about frying the circuits or opening to negative</p>
<p>realms?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I trusted Grof’s scholarship and method, especially the imperative to surrender</p>
<p>fully to the process. It can be horrific and take months to understand, but it moves toward healing.</p>
<p>I paced the work, cared for my body, maintained spiritual practice, kept detailed records, and</p>
<p>integrated carefully. The deeper reason I wouldn’t repeat that intensity is what I learned late:</p>
<p>there is no terminus. After many permutations of unity, I was immersed in the diamond luminosity—a</p>
<p>Buddhist Dharmakaya-like clarity—when my visual field pivoted as a ray of light shattered me. I</p>
<p>understood viscerally: the universe is an infinite progression. You cannot “finish” it. That insight</p>
<p>made me gentler about trajectory and pace.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Are psychedelic visions projections or perceptions of realities ordinarily beyond</p>
<p>our range?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> If there is a creative intelligence—mind of the universe—then methods that open</p>
<p>into it afford genuine contact. Temporary immersion in infinity leaves lasting impress: of truth,</p>
<p>love, and meaning. We still must contend with distortion and incompleteness, but the noetic quality</p>
<p>William James noted is unmistakable.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> With discipline, can meditation reach the same places?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I believe so, with caveats. My north stars are the great contemplatives. Sustaining</p>
<p>these states for months or years commands the highest respect. Carol, my former sitter, later</p>
<p>completed a traditional three-year retreat. I see deep resonance between psychedelic cosmology and</p>
<p>the meditative traditions, while noting that classic maps are stage-specific, reflecting their</p>
<p>contexts. Psychedelics can push edges in areas like trans-temporal immersion. I began with an</p>
<p>“enlightenment track” but was drawn into a second track—cosmological exploration. Late in the work</p>
<p>those tracks began to braid.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> After 51 years of meditation I resonate with your gentler pacing. Whatever the</p>
<p>path, safety first.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Agreed. If psychedelics are amplifiers, they do nothing that consciousness cannot</p>
<p>do by other means; they accelerate and focus.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Audience questions. Amit from New Zealand: after ayahuasca I woke deeply fatigued</p>
<p>for months. Any practices to integrate and minimize detrimental energetic effects?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Each medicine has its character, and strong doses impact physiology and psychology.</p>
<p>Be gentle. Cultivate contemplative practice, tend the body and subtle energies, and stabilize</p>
<p>emotionally and mentally. There is no one formula; assemble a regimen—meditation, breathwork,</p>
<p>stretching, movement, clean diet, community, and time—that supports recovery and integration.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Bobby from Georgia: If psychedelics glimpse true nature, is ordinary life veiled by</p>
<p>a sheath formed in childhood? Are infancy and early childhood akin to psychedelics?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Children may retain sensitivities later conditioned out, but I wouldn’t wish the</p>
<p>extremes of psychedelic experience on a child. More broadly, many lines of research—NDEs, OBEs,</p>
<p>reincarnation—suggest a rhythm: death expands us; incarnation contracts us. Over many lives those</p>
<p>polarities gradually reconcile so spiritual and physical dimensions integrate within a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> David from Cambridge: If widely available, could psychedelics harm society? Are</p>
<p>restrictions prudent?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Traditional cultures with long relationships to entheogens use them ritually, not</p>
<p>recreationally. We must learn from them: careful containers, trained guides, communal context. I</p>
<p>favor decriminalization—no one should be jailed for mushrooms—and robust education. These substances</p>
<p>are non-addictive and physiologically safe when used wisely, but they are powerful and deserve</p>
<p>respect.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Michael, thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL POLLAN:</strong> Thank you. My paperback is out Tuesday; by the time this posts it will be</p>
<p>available.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> We’ll link it on batgap.com. Chris, let’s continue a bit longer.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> I want to save time to discuss your “future human” vision—the diamond soul. First,</p>
<p>one last audience question…</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> If psilocybin were widely available, could all hell break loose?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Again, ritual wisdom, education, and decriminalization over commercialization. Move</p>
<p>slowly and build responsible culture.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Great. Now, the birth of the future human.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In high-dose sessions your identity explodes. For hours you become another kind of</p>
<p>being—taught by the universe according to your capacity. About twenty-three sessions in, a series of</p>
<p>visions began concerning human evolution. The message repeated: we’re poised on the edge of a</p>
<p>breakthrough that will alter the baseline of human consciousness. Pressure is building; detoxification</p>
<p>is accelerating across generations.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> For years the “how” was hidden. Then, in 1995, after a grueling descent into deep</p>
<p>time, I experienced the death and rebirth of humanity—not as “Chris having a vision,” but as the</p>
<p>species itself. A global systems crisis—driven foremost by ecological breakdown—precipitates a</p>
<p>collective labor. The suffering is terrible. It feels like extinction. Yet at the peak, the storm</p>
<p>passes. Survivors emerge into unprecedented connection—new values, technologies, social forms, and a</p>
<p>lived sense of oneness with responsibility to all life.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Parallel to this, reincarnational integration accelerates. Former lives fuse—light</p>
<p>winds on a spool—until they culminate in a qualitative shift: the “diamond soul.” An individuality</p>
<p>more whole than the sum of lives, with mind and heart open to the universe and to each other. That,</p>
<p>to me, is the future human.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> If that arc sounds frightening, the best preparation isn’t stockpiling goods but</p>
<p>stockpiling consciousness—ethics, service, compassion.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Exactly. Survivalism clings to ego. What carries us forward is generosity, clarity,</p>
<p>and courage—together.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Anne Baring wrote of your book: “Once or twice in a century a book appears with the</p>
<p>explosive force of a supernova… opening our minds and hearts to a new vision of the universe and our</p>
<p>inseparability from the ineffable being we have called God.”</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I did the work over twenty years and waited another twenty before publishing. It</p>
<p>took that long to digest.</p>
<p><strong>RICK ARCHER:</strong> Chris, thank you. And thanks again to Michael. Visit batgap.com for newsletters,</p>

      <p>This dialogue between Chris Bache and Richard Rudd deepens their exploration of</p>
<p>reincarnation beyond evidence and into meaning, agency, and practice. They</p>
<p>contrast deterministic narratives with a universe alive to our responses, where</p>
<p>chance and intention both matter and where learning carries forward across</p>
<p>lifetimes. Drawing on Tibetan Bardo teachings, near-death life review research,</p>
<p>and Bache’s psychedelic work, they sketch an after-death journey of loving</p>
<p>debrief and iterative growth. Rudd introduces karmic “fields,” Termas</p>
<p>(treasures) and Tulkus (intentional rebirth), while Bache situates them within a</p>
<p>vast cosmology of collective evolution. They weave involution and evolution,</p>
<p>Aurobindo’s metaphysics, and contemporary physics speculations into a</p>
<p>both/and view of freedom and fate. Practical implications include living as a</p>
<p>soul, seeding memory across lifetimes, forming communities of return, and</p>
<p>cultivating “diamond awareness” amid a challenging historical transition.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Well, hello, Richard. It’s good to continue our discussion. In our previous talk,</p>
<p>we began with evidence for reincarnation, those extraordinary children around the world. We</p>
<p>started unpacking that evidence into rhythms of life and stages of human evolution that</p>
<p>reincarnation makes possible. We restored a sense of meaning in the challenges embedded in our</p>
<p>lives, and we saw how therapy can deepen when we address pain rooted in our deeper history.</p>
<p>Today let’s go farther. What are we? What does it mean that we are reincarnating beings in a</p>
<p>universe that supports, nurtures, and created this dynamic? That’s a huge difference. To live in a</p>
<p>universe with a maternal-paternal energy feels like being born into a very different framework.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I also want to say that thinkers sometimes drift into strict determinism, as if every</p>
<p>little detail is preordained. I don’t think we have to go there. Chance is one of the universe’s</p>
<p>powerful elements. We can affirm meaning and intentionality without forcing every detail through</p>
<p>that press. What’s important is understanding that the universe pays attention to how we respond</p>
<p>to chance events as well as intentional ones. Our learning and the quality of our response carry</p>
<p>forward and do us credit, regardless of the origin of our challenges.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Funnily enough, today I recorded a short meditation. I asked people to imagine the</p>
<p>universe criss-crossed by fields of karma, like ley lines rippling through time and space. Then I</p>
<p>invited them to send one beautiful thought from the depth of their soul into that ocean and watch</p>
<p>the universe respond, opening like synapses, sighing and expanding. The incalculable power of a</p>
<p>single pure thought dropped into time-space—that’s a potent contemplation.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Absolutely. That mirrors my psychedelic work. Nothing I did at deep levels was mine</p>
<p>alone. The pain came from a larger web and the healing spread through that web. Practices like</p>
<p>your meditation shift our tilt in the universe. Our senses suggest life happens to us and we’re</p>
<p>its victims. But when you send healing and love into the field and watch it respond—immediately</p>
<p>and indirectly—you experience life as a dynamic field. At subtle levels, you are co-creating your</p>
<p>universe. Karma from the past still moves through the system, but the balance tilts from passive</p>
<p>recipient to generator of the life you now inherit.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> You’re no longer a victim; you’re a creator—an active participant. We received a</p>
<p>great question: what happens to us when we die? Many cultures map this. The Tibetans especially</p>
<p>have a living tradition—the Bardo teachings. Psychotherapists have explored this terrain too:</p>
<p>Joel Whitton’s <em>Life Between Life</em>, Michael Newton’s <em>Journey of Souls</em> and <em>Destiny of Souls</em> use</p>
<p>deep regression to chart the territory. We really have two halves of life: birth to death, and</p>
<p>death to birth. We’ve missed the second half, and you need the whole circle. Let’s jump in.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> The Tibetans coined “Bardo” for the in-between, but it also names transformational</p>
<p>thresholds—birth and death being archetypal. We undergo many deaths and births within one life,</p>
<p>so it’s logical to see that pattern everywhere in the cosmos. You’ve experienced repeated</p>
<p>transformation in your journeys—constant rebirth, yes?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. I once thought there was a single ego death that launches you into the spiritual</p>
<p>universe. I found there are many layers. Being operational at one layer doesn’t grant access to</p>
<p>deeper ones. You undergo another metamorphosis—another death and surrender—to be reborn into the</p>
<p>next layer, and so on. That reflects the Tibetan idea: each Bardo is a discrete layer of</p>
<p>consciousness. We in the West sometimes use “Bardo” for the whole post-mortem journey, which is</p>
<p>fine, but the Tibetan usage maps stages—Hungry Ghost realms, heavenly realms, and more. The core</p>
<p>pattern matches what psychotherapy finds: after death we reunite with our soul and soul lineage.</p>
<p>We debrief the life we just lived in absolute love—love so deep it’s beyond forgiveness. We see</p>
<p>what we did well and where we fell short.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> That echoes the “life flashing before your eyes,” a timeless replay. It’s natural to</p>
<p>have deep reflection at the end—just as we do in life.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In near-death accounts, the life review is a snapshot of the fuller process—reliving</p>
<p>every nuance, far beyond what we track in time. We see how our actions ripple into others’ lives.</p>
<p>We feel the hurt our harmful deeds caused and the help our good deeds gave. We experience the</p>
<p>seamless fabric of our life.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> And we experience it without a physical body—through subtler bodies: astral, mental,</p>
<p>causal. Without physical buffering, the intensity can be huge. That may underlie ideas of eternal</p>
<p>damnation or eternal bliss—the sense of eternity outside time. Feeling the harm we caused and its</p>
<p>ripples could seem infinite in that state. I imagine we taste subtle dimensions of karmic</p>
<p>repercussions—very intense.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> What locks that phenomenology of eternity into harsh metaphysics is the mistaken view</p>
<p>that we live only once. If there’s one chance and we failed, then punishment must be forever. But</p>
<p>no tradition that explores deeply finds that. We are accountable; we feel the pain we caused so we</p>
<p>can learn—and then return to do better, and better, and grow.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> I come from a lineage of distillers. I picture a distillation or fermentation after</p>
<p>death. The grosser elements precipitate back to lower planes, carrying unresolved karma, while</p>
<p>the quintessence—what we truly learned—crystallizes and stays with the soul’s trajectory. Our</p>
<p>acts also seed the collective field; we co-create humanity’s karma. We return to pick up where we</p>
<p>left off, yet with an enhanced soul. Our lives trace an arc—perhaps a spiral or Kundalini wave.</p>
<p>If you can track that arc inwardly, you can remember where you’ve been and sense where you’re</p>
<p>going. Awareness can even help predict—or co-create—your next return.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’ve never cared much for family genealogy, but I care deeply for my soul’s genealogy—</p>
<p>deep remembering of who I am across time. You gain a felt trajectory of development. And you’re</p>
<p>right about the collective. Individual and collective evolve together—distinct yet intertwined.</p>
<p>Everything we do seeds the species, and what the species does seeds us. When I leave space-time,</p>
<p>even if I leave the system, my experiences—and yours—are held by the human psyche. Our love and</p>
<p>understanding become part of humanity’s storehouse and its generative matrix for birthing the</p>
<p>next generation.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Beautiful—like an Akashic field that remembers and grows. I love the Tibetan notion</p>
<p>of <em>Terma</em>—treasures of wisdom seeded in time, awaiting discovery by destined teachers. Stories</p>
<p>say Padmasambhāva emanated Termas into future epochs like depth charges. They go off at the right</p>
<p>time through emanations of his lineage. That model changed me. I had an opening, a wisdom memory</p>
<p>rushed through, and I’ve spent my life unpacking it. It shows how subtle layers survive</p>
<p>time-space. It also relates to involution, which we could dive into. What is involution, Chris?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> First, let me celebrate your receiving the Terma of the Gene Keys. You didn’t make</p>
<p>them; you received and unpacked them—your half of a larger descent. Reincarnation has a bottom</p>
<p>half in matter and a top half in spirit. There is a community below and a community above—layers</p>
<p>of spiritual beings, angelic and enlightened, helping our gestation. Teachings also descend as</p>
<p>gems of empowerment. When a culture truly understands reincarnation, it tracks great beings and</p>
<p>great teachings through time—Tulkus and Termas—and recognizes patterned descents into minds at</p>
<p>specific moments. Beyond the details, the deeper fabric is the grandeur at which reincarnation</p>
<p>operates. It’s not “who was I in the 17th century?” It changes our dialogue with the universe and</p>
<p>thus our sense of self: a time-traveling being, many times in the spiritual world, incarnating</p>
<p>diamond teachings into body, heart, and mind. That opens the human playing field.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I teach at a university where the secular creed says the universe appeared by chance,</p>
<p>driven by random mutation, your life has no meaning, and when your brain stops, you’re gone. It’s</p>
<p>a crushing philosophy. Beginning from empirical evidence and deepening through spiritual</p>
<p>dynamics, reincarnation restores meaning. Involution is the downward flow of truth, beauty, and</p>
<p>purpose; evolution is our cultivation of it in circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> I sometimes see involution as the future burrowing into the past and evolution as the</p>
<p>past spiraling toward the future. Aurobindo framed involution as spirit seeded in matter. A rock,</p>
<p>a mountain—sleeping consciousness awaiting time. Plants show more; animals even more, meeting your</p>
<p>gaze with emotion. In humans, spirit is obvious—we can do this. Everything is a gem; every atom</p>
<p>holds a spiritual seed awaiting its moment. Where evolution meets involution is the eternal now.</p>
<p>This also softens the free will versus determinism paradox. From involution, all is seeded; from</p>
<p>evolution, everything is created anew. Together they meet like a funnel. Aurobindo really nailed</p>
<p>that—though he’s not easy reading.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Our daily life shows both. Many aspects are highly conditioned, and yet we’re not</p>
<p>subservient to them. We have a cubic centimeter of free will we can expand to a cubic meter. We</p>
<p>can incubate choice. And that’s how I see Gene Keys—tell me if I’m wrong—helping people make</p>
<p>informed choices by sitting deeply with the karmic core and deciding how to engage its outcome.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Exactly. In Gene Keys there are three layers: Shadow, Gift, and Siddhi. The Shadow is</p>
<p>the seed, the Gift the flower, the Siddhi the fruit that contains the next seed. Our densest</p>
<p>places hold hidden heights. As we learn, forgive, and evolve, those heights emerge. Our role is</p>
<p>to enter density as intermediaries and unlock it. That’s a profound responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Over long time the shadow seeds evaporate through reflective awareness; creative seeds</p>
<p>grow. We become increasingly transparent to the universe’s intelligence. If that’s true</p>
<p>collectively, humanity can cook its seeds and move beyond historical limitations. Then the</p>
<p>greatness we glimpse in Tulkus and Termas becomes a species-wide aspiration—we become a people of</p>
<p>light more than shadow.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Especially as we better sense the universe’s parameters. You’ve got wonderful slides</p>
<p>as backdrop—care to share?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> <em>[slides shown]</em> I collect NASA images and meditate on them—the distances, the billions</p>
<p>of stars, the life burgeoning on countless worlds. The universe’s profligate fertility and scale</p>
<p>give context to evolving life. If life were meaningless chance, we’d be cut off from this</p>
<p>greatness. If reincarnation is real and we’re not limited to one body’s span, then across</p>
<p>countless incarnations our minds become intimate with this generativity. This is our playground</p>
<p>without the physical body—and, holographically, perhaps even within it.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> As above, so below—a truth many have touched. Our Hologenetic Profile maps inner</p>
<p>workings that fractally correspond far beyond one body. Taoist alchemy found galaxies within,</p>
<p>corresponding to glands and energies. Knowing correspondences lets awareness travel outward from</p>
<p>within. People touch this in dreams, astral projection, deep meditation, or psychedelics. Feel</p>
<p>free to share a taste.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I’ve tried to do so carefully in <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. We’ve only been</p>
<p>conscious of the Mother Universe for a few millennia. Writing is about five thousand years old,</p>
<p>the Upanishadic breakthroughs three to four thousand. That’s nothing beside the billions of</p>
<p>years ahead. We’re just waking up. Practices that reinforce our hybrid nature—spirit and matter,</p>
<p>pure light and pure green—deepen those correspondences. As we internalize them, we become a more</p>
<p>conscious mortar and pestle, integrating above and below. Keep it up for tens of thousands or</p>
<p>millions of years and ask the only serious question: what do you want to be in a million years?</p>
<p>Because you’ll be here. So what is your deepest heart’s desire?</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Recently I heard Roger Penrose. Against the heat-death narrative, he suggests the</p>
<p>extremes meet—ultimate slowing mirrors ultimate speed—and an elegant logic gives birth to another</p>
<p>universe from that limit. He even reads repeating shapes in the cosmic background as leftovers</p>
<p>from a previous aeon. That blew me away—coming from a physicist.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Ervin László notes the exquisite fine-tuning of our Big Bang—balances in the first</p>
<p>picoseconds. He asks: is this the first try? Perhaps expansions and contractions repeat. Maybe</p>
<p>this isn’t the first Big Bang but the thousandth, each learning from the last—the background</p>
<p>radiation preserving traces as the universe perfects itself.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Wide views are rich, but how does this help me today? It invites us to engage life as</p>
<p>an intelligent convocation of circumstances, not blind determinism. If we meet our challenges as</p>
<p>intentional—chosen for us by us when we knew more—and trust that our choices matter even when</p>
<p>effects are delayed, life changes. Hard things soften; barren soil grows.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> It also gives a different backdrop for our world’s problems. Action from trust differs</p>
<p>from action from fear. Befriending our death and taking a long view—what if communities agree to</p>
<p>return together? That’s why these teachings appeared: to give a focal point for continuous</p>
<p>collective work across lives. Interconnected by the internet and shared resonance, we can</p>
<p>recognize the path again, even as children. Synchronicity guides us. Memory is the game. More of</p>
<p>us carrying memory through the Bardos opens those Bardos for others. As with Tulkus retrieving</p>
<p>objects, once you learn the wormholes, you can play more and bring awakening into the collective.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> I think we’re shifting from ego-based lives to soul-based lives rooted in a much deeper</p>
<p>cosmic biography. In the Buddha’s enlightenment, one watch of the night was seeing all his former</p>
<p>lives. Remembering isn’t just facts; it gathers the entire treasury into the present soul. When</p>
<p>he did so, he shattered suffering—living small as if you are only this body. The soul is waking</p>
<p>inside time and space. Allies arrive because waking up is social and generative, never private.</p>
<p>This shift rivals the cognitive leap two hundred thousand years ago, but now awareness, not</p>
<p>anatomy, is changing.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> And how that dovetails with a darkening historical period and the birth of the diamond</p>
<p>soul—what I call diamond awareness. Maintaining memory between lives excites people to be here</p>
<p>and to return. Instead of escaping, it’s a compassionate, even warrior stance: this place needs</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The creative genius that birthed galaxies also birthed reincarnation. Religions didn’t</p>
<p>invent it; nature did. I doubt it would cultivate us to the first inklings of our deep essence</p>
<p>only to have us depart. Awakening is part of transforming time and space itself. We are changing</p>
<p>the world—heaven on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> And the prophecy. Let’s leave that as a seed for next time. Wonderful—thank you, Chris.</p>
<p>I wonder what our former-life history is that makes our dialogue so easeful and fruitful. I honor</p>
<p>that history, whatever it is. I will contemplate it.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Much love.</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD RUDD:</strong> Great. Thank you.</p>

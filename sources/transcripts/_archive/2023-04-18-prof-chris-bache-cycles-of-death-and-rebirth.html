      <p>In this short clip from the Scientific &amp; Medical Network, Chris Bache distills a core lesson from his</p>
<p>high-dose LSD research: spiritual awakening unfolds through repeated cycles of death and rebirth.</p>
<p>Using a simple diagram, he contrasts egoic, time-space consciousness (beneath the line) with</p>
<p>transpersonal reality (above it). The first crossing—commonly called “ego death”—shatters personal</p>
<p>identity and initiates entry into spiritual domains. Pressing further, he says, requires passing through</p>
<p>additional gates at the psychic, subtle, and causal levels (in Stanislav Grof’s terms). At each threshold</p>
<p>one must relinquish everything previously attained to stabilize in a wider field of awareness. Bache</p>
<p>stresses he is not promoting a fixed cosmological map; rather, he emphasizes the recurring demand</p>
<p>for radical surrender as deeper strata of consciousness open.</p>

<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> When one works with very high doses of LSD, one goes through a series of</p>
<p>death–rebirth experiences. In this image, the drop at the center beneath the line represents our egoic</p>
<p>consciousness—our private consciousness. Everything above the line represents spiritual reality,</p>
<p>transpersonal consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> The first death–rebirth experience takes place at the interface of our time–space</p>
<p>consciousness and the beginnings of spiritual consciousness, and it is usually referred to as ego death.</p>
<p>It is the complete destruction of our personal time–space identity and the beginning of an opening</p>
<p>into spiritual reality.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> If we continue this process—if we press deeper and deeper into spiritual reality—we</p>
<p>go through more deaths, more cycles of death and rebirth, at the psychic, subtle, and causal levels of</p>
<p>consciousness, to use terms that Stan uses. I have no vested interest in a particular cosmological map</p>
<p>that delineates the various strata of transpersonal consciousness. I am simply making the point that as</p>
<p>you go into deeper levels of consciousness you reach certain gateways, and at these gateways you must</p>
<p>give up everything—everything you have known up to this point in your journey—in order to enter</p>
<p>the new fields of consciousness that are beginning to open to you.</p>

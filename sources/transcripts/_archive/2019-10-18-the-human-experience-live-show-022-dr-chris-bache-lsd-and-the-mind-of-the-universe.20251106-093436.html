<p>Welcome to The Human Experience podcast, the only show designed to fuse your left and right brain hemispheres by tackling the most entertaining and mentally engaging topics on the planet. As we embark on this ascent, make sure your frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes are in their full upright position as you take your seat of consciousness. Relax your senses and join us on this journey. We are the intimate strangers. Thank you for tuning in.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome! We've got an incredible show planned for you this evening. We will dive into consciousness, psychedelics—specifically LSD—and the exploration of consciousness. Thank you for being here, especially those joining us on the YouTube live version. So sit back, grab a drink, and enjoy the conversation. The Human Experience is in session. My name is Xavier Katana, and joining me tonight is Dr. Christopher Bache. Dr. Bache is a professor, researcher, and author who has dedicated over 30 years to the study and writing of consciousness, philosophy, and religion. He received his PhD in philosophy and religion from Brown University and became a professor of religious studies at Youngstown State University. His acclaimed works include <em>Life Cycles</em>, <em>Reincarnation</em>, <em>The Web of Life</em>, and his latest book, <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven</em>. Chris, thank you for making time for us today. Welcome to HXP.</p>
<p>Thank you, Xavier! It's a pleasure to be here and engage in this conversation.</p>
<p>Let's start with your journey into this fascinating field. How did you become involved in this work? Would you say it's an unusual field to pursue?</p>
<p>It certainly is. I come from a very classical and mainstream background, raised in the Deep South and educated at prestigious institutions like Notre Dame, Cambridge, and Brown University. My early education in religious studies was quite traditional. Shortly after beginning my teaching career in 1978, I was publishing articles based on my dissertation and searching for directions for my research when I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof. He is regarded as one of the foremost authorities on integrating psychedelics into psychotherapy. His book, <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>, was an eye-opener for me; I felt I had found my life's work in that moment. I recognized the profound significance of this research—not just for psychology but also for philosophy—understanding how psychedelics function as amplifiers of consciousness. They heighten our sensitivity to our mind for a limited period, allowing us to systematically explore the deeper dimensions of consciousness. However, psychedelics had been made illegal in the U.S. in 1970. So, I had to make a difficult choice—essentially dividing my life into a daytime job and a nighttime job. During the day, I fulfilled my responsibilities as a professor of religious studies, lecturing and attending meetings, while at night, I delved into the hidden side of my life, rigorously using LSD to explore my own consciousness. When I reached the limits of my own consciousness, I transitioned into a broader exploration, which I think of as the mind of the universe.</p>
<p>That's fascinating. Did you feel at any point that researching this subject could jeopardize your career, given the taboos surrounding it?</p>
<p>Absolutely. It was a reasonable concern. I was acutely aware that I was breaking the law to conduct this work. I believed that at some point, society would reclaim these important substances, but I couldn't wait for that moment. I knew that going public with my work could endanger my job, which I loved, as teaching and connecting with my students brought me immense joy. Thus, I kept my research private. While close colleagues in my department were aware, I never discussed it with my students and did not seek public recognition. Between 1979 and 1999, I completed 73 high-dose LSD sessions based on Grof's protocols. This was a critical period during which I was between 30 and 50 years old, and I'm now 70. I've spent two decades integrating and digesting these experiences before writing this book.</p>
<p>That's quite a commitment. What made you choose LSD specifically? Why not other substances like DMT or Psilocybin?</p>
<p>To understand that, we must look back to 1978 and the state of psychedelic exploration at the time. Ayahuasca was barely known, and though Psilocybin mushrooms existed, the era of DMT had not really arrived. More crucially, my foundational work was based on Stanislav Grof's research, primarily conducted with LSD, which I came to trust based on what I read. Although I've explored other psychedelics since, such as Psilocybin, DMT, and Ayahuasca, my principal work—my core reflections—were based on those 73 LSD sessions.</p>
<p>It's interesting to consider that in 1967, Congress passed laws banning LSD, culminating with the Controlled Substances Act around 1970. In your book, you mention experiencing synchronicities during your work. Could you elaborate on that?</p>
<p>Certainly. I didn't consciously anticipate synchronicities when I began, but as I continued my work over the years, I noticed that some of my students seemed to be activated in their lives due to my psychedelic research. There was a spillover effect of consciousness transformation stemming from my sessions. This led me to serious reflection on how to balance my research while ensuring the well-being of my students, eventually resulting in my writing the book <em>The Living Classroom</em>. In it, I don't even mention psychedelics; instead, I focus on the nature of consciousness and what occurs when people gather with intention and sustained exercises over time.</p>
<p>Your exploration of consciousness amplifiers is fascinating. What kind of questions were you asking during your sessions, and what answers were you seeking?</p>
<p>I originally entered this research with a focus on enlightenment, having meditated for several years and encountering typical blocks that many face in early practice. I thought that by conducting these sessions, I could engage with my unconscious and confront the obstacles I was facing, thereby expediting my spiritual growth. This individual transformation model was soon challenged, as I quickly found myself involved in vast purification processes that extended beyond my individual experience to encompass thousands—perhaps even hundreds of thousands—of people. My work propelled me into deep, energetic states of consciousness, and when focused, I learned how to impact portions of the collective unconscious.</p>
<p>Could you expand on your method? How did you approach these high-dose sessions?</p>
<p>Stan Grof differentiates between low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy. Low-dose therapy involves peeling back the unconscious gradually over multiple sessions. Conversely, high-dose therapy thrusts patients—often those facing terminal illnesses—through their personal unconscious layers, seeking a transformative encounter with the universe. Early researchers aimed to elicit near-death experiences in these subjects. I followed their protocol but pushed the boundaries by choosing to engage in numerous high-dose sessions over 20 years, consistently utilizing doses of 500 to 600 micrograms of LSD. This altered state of arousal amplifies consciousness and allows for deeper introspection. My sessions weren't about recreational use; I strictly isolated myself from the outside world, focusing solely on the internal experience, carefully curating an environment conducive to exploration. Each session became a communion with the universe, allowing me to systematically delve deeper into both my consciousness and the larger consciousness surrounding us.</p>
<p>This was a protocol designed for serious exploration. After your sessions, how did you integrate the insights you gained?</p>
<p>Integration is crucial, and unfortunately, under-discussed. The danger of these experiences is psychic inflation—where one might mistakenly believe that having profound experiences automatically makes them wiser, when in reality, groundedness is vital. After each session, I returned to teaching and engaged with my family, which helped ground me in reality. I documented my experiences meticulously, reflecting on them within 24 hours. Applying the lessons learned requires a courageous willingness to confront the hard truths that arise as well as a commitment to grounding those experiences in daily life. I believe that maintaining a daily spiritual practice, whether through meditation or yoga, is essential for anyone delving into non-ordinary states of consciousness. My wife, a clinical psychologist and serious meditator who never participated in psychedelic sessions, was my sitter throughout. She consistently reminded me that the value of the sessions lies not merely in what happens during them but in how I incorporate those lessons into my everyday existence.</p>
<p>It seems that this grounding practice is indispensable. Were there specific protocols you followed for grounding post-session, beyond personal accountability and relationships? </p>
<p>Drawing from my knowledge of shamanism and diverse spiritual traditions, I recognized the common necessity for grounding after profound experiences. It's akin to returning from a meditation retreat where one must reacquaint themselves with mundane life after deep states of consciousness. The essence of grounding involves stillness, absorbing experiences, and bringing them back into everyday life. As a faculty member familiar with various spiritual practices, I understood the importance of embracing a daily spiritual routine to maintain harmony with the insights gained during these sessions. That routine for me included meditation and light yoga, ensuring I cared for both my physical and subtle energy bodies. </p>
<p>It’s crucial to have that solid grounding to prevent the unraveling that can occur from such deep explorations. You’ve made it clear that your approach was deliberate—a focused intention to connect with yourself and consciousness, separate from the distractions of daily life.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: In that controlled setting, the most important thing is to ask yourself at the beginning of every session: Are you ready to die? Are you ready to give it all up? Because you confront many deaths in this process. You don’t die physically, but you go through processes so deep that you feel like you're dying. There are moments when the death agonies are not personal; they're species-wide. When you move into archetypal reality and then out of it, you're dealing with orders of magnitude that are really hard to relate to anything on earth.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Let's define archetypal reality. Can you explain what that means?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Sure. The two figures that come to mind most are Plato and Carl Jung. Plato's ideas suggest that there is a reality behind the physical world that informs and organizes the fundamental structures of the physical world—an order beyond physical reality. Jung, of course, talks about archetypes and the collective unconscious, suggesting that there's a collective mind, the background in which our individual minds float. </p>
<p>When I entered archetypal reality, I had experiences on both levels. At a high level, I encountered vast beings responsible for creating space-time. They were so immense that I could not wrap my mind around them. Unlike Plato’s eternal ideas, my experience of these archetypes was that they were living structures—dynamic entities that change slowly over time, yet they still evolve. </p>
<p>When I went into a lower level of archetypal reality, I experienced the collective unconscious of humanity. I saw our individual minds as nodes within a larger landscape of consciousness and how we interact with this collective mind in complex ways. Every deeper level of consciousness is a step into a higher level of energy. Each time you shift to a deeper level, you have to manage a much higher energy level. You go through intense purification processes to acclimate your energy, ensuring your experiences at these deeper levels are coherent.</p>
<p>Interviewer: I want to inject a little bit of my own personal experience. Although I've only had a handful of LSD sessions, Ayahuasca has been significant for me. I take it in a controlled setting with instructed shamans, and while I try to regard it skeptically, I’ve encountered an intelligence that’s difficult to explain. Looking at it through the lens you've described, it does fit into a purification protocol—a refining of consciousness to understand a larger reality. </p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely. Ayahuasca is extraordinary medicine. If I were starting this journey over again, I would balance low and high dose sessions, as well as LSD with Ayahuasca and psilocybin. Each substance offers different experiences; for instance, psilocybin and Ayahuasca are more body-grounded compared to LSD, which often pushes toward higher cosmic levels. </p>
<p>Ayahuasca is a remarkable teacher. People who engage in serious Ayahuasca sessions don’t need convincing that there's an intelligence communicating with them. It’s visceral; these intelligences reveal truths about existence that lie outside normal consciousness. As you experience these truths, they start to make more sense, aligning with what spiritual teachers throughout history have suggested about the nature of the universe.</p>
<p>Interviewer: For those listening who may not access LSD or Ayahuasca, is it possible to reach these states through meditation or inner work?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely. The cosmology that emerges from this work aligns with many mystical traditions. Psychedelics amplify consciousness rather than create experiences. Therefore, it’s possible to have profound experiences through meditation. That said, some of the more radical experiences may only show up in the deepest spiritual traditions.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Let’s talk about "diamond luminosity." How did you engage with this state, and would you call it the final point or a state of oneness with source?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That came after years of work. I had done four years of intensive work, then paused for six years, and resumed for another ten. Halfway through that duration, I experienced extraordinary spiritual insights—emptiness, the oneness of existence, and the primordial void. Yet, after what felt like completeness, I realized there was more to explore. </p>
<p>Individuals often encounter light after death-rebirth experiences. For me, after touching once on the diamond luminosity, it became the main focus of my work. I pursued this state, which I describe as incredibly clear and pure. It was something very specific; not just an idea but a profound quality of light. I managed to touch it during four sessions after significant purification processes. </p>
<p>Interviewer: Was there something you felt you left behind when you decided to stop?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I stopped for two main reasons: pain and heartache. The intensity of these experiences activated powerful energy waves through my body, and my energy system struggled to manage it. I needed to let my body cool down and focus on integrating my experiences. Additionally, the heartache was immense; transitioning between these intense luminosity states and regular consciousness became painful. </p>
<p>I knew I was leaving those profound experiences for the rest of my life, realizing I couldn't just return to that level at any point. I made a deal with the universe: not to bring me back until I could stay fully present in that space.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Looking back, what warnings do you have for those who might explore psychedelics today?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The more experience I've had with psychedelics, the more cautious I’ve become about using them in uncontrolled environments. Many people have transformative experiences tripping, but the potential risks are significant. Entering deep levels of consciousness in a chaotic setting can lead to overwhelming experiences. </p>
<p>It's essential to complete any experience thoroughly. If you don’t see your experiences through to the end and try to halt the process midway, it can leave you stuck with unresolved energy. So, approach these substances with extreme caution, do your research, and understand the methodologies behind them.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I wish people could eliminate the fear of death. My experiences have led me to look forward to it, understanding it as a homecoming, to return to the essence of life. If you can experience that reality before you die, you can engage with both the physical world and spiritual reality simultaneously. </p>
<p>Interviewer: Thank you, Chris. This has been a phenomenal conversation, and I sincerely appreciate the precision with which you articulated your experiences. </p>

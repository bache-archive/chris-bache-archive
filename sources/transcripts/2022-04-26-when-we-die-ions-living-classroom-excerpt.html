<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> I think when we die, everything we've learned and all the good we've done, as well as our mistakes, goes with us. Our learning is retained within the collective psyche of our species. All of our experiences are preserved by the individual consciousness, which continues its learning once it leaves time and space. But because we are members of this species, and because the species has a mind that integrates all the conscious experiences of its members, my experiences and everything I've written about—and everything we're talking about here—are not lost to humanity when I die. They are literally hard-wired into the collective psyche, the collective unconscious, right now.</p>
<p>This means we have to think in a quantum fashion rather than an atomistic one when considering what happens to these fields as physical bodies come and go. Souls endure. Species have a soul. There is a species soul. There's an Akashic field, as Laszlo talks about. You could even describe it as the Akashic Soul of the Universe. There's this tremendous network of consciousness constantly integrating the experiences of all its members. So, I can imagine any number of variations of what happens to these fields after we are no longer on the scene.</p>

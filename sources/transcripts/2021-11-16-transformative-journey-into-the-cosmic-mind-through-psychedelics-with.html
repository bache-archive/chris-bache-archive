<p>Hello everybody, this is Vanese McNeill from MAGICAL EGYPT, live. Today, I have a very special guest with me. Chris is one of my favorite people in the entire world. I think he has some of the most important knowledge to share with us, as well as wisdom. I'm also now declaring that he's a prophet as well. So welcome, Chris.</p>
<p>"Happiness. I don't know about the prophet part, but okay," Chris replies with a hint of amusement.</p>
<p>"Well, sweetie, I have to say things have got interesting since we last talked, right?" Vanese responds.</p>
<p>"Yeah, the turbulence of this century is certainly increasing, isn't it?" Chris observes.</p>
<p>"It is indeed, my dear. It is indeed, but it is necessary, if I understand you correctly," Vanese acknowledges.</p>
<p>"As I've written about in my book <em>LSD, in the Mind of the Universe</em>, there's a chapter on the birth of the future human, where I summarize all the visions that I was given through many years of doing deep psychedelic work. The vision simply showed me that humanity was coming into this period of profound spiritual awakening—a major spiritual turning point, a tipping point that would change human history. However, going into this period, we were going to experience tremendous suffering—an unraveling of civilization as we've known it. But coming through this, we would be changed profoundly, tapping into levels of our core and realizing potentials that have only been achieved by relatively few in history. This shift in the collective psyche must be realized by the entire population. Now, whether this suffering is inevitable, I don't know. I only report the visions, and they show that it's not going to be terminal. It's not about extinction. Instead, it is labor, and labor results in birth—a new birth for the human family." </p>
<p>"Mmm, and labor, while not fun, is necessary for this birth. I also believe that we need guidance through this process, and that's why I'm talking to you today," Vanese reflects. "I would love for you to share with us a little about the course you have coming up."</p>
<p>"You're breaking up a little bit, but I'll assume I can just go ahead and talk now," Chris replies, adjusting to the conversation. "After spending 20 years doing deep LSD journeys, I spent another 20 years digesting those experiences and eventually wrote down the story of this journey in my book, which I prefer to call <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>. Now that the book has been out for about a year and a half, I'm being invited to roll out this course with The Shift Network. It's a seven-week journey through the material covered in the book. Everyone who signs up will receive a free e-copy of the book, allowing them to read the chapters week by week as we go through the course. </p>
<p>"I'm inviting people to join me on this journey through conversations, talks, Q&amp;As, and visualization exercises. I believe many of us have deep psychedelic experiences, and I've put a lot of energy into clarifying the concepts involved. The experiences at the heart of this course aren't primarily personal; rather, they address the deep structure of the universe and the experiences that resonate with the human family as a whole. </p>
<p>"In the first module, we'll cover methodology, addressing people's questions and concerns about psychedelics. I’ll explain what psychedelics do and don't do, detailing my protocol and the extreme nature of my approach, which I don't recommend others adopt today. Then, in the second module, we’ll explore crossing the boundary of birth and death, let go of our egoic identity, and discuss the process of ego death and purification. I found that working with high doses of LSD led me to experience a collective purification process, aiming not just at my personal transformation but at healing a portion of the collective psyche. There’s much to cover there.</p>
<p>"In the third module, we delve into archetypal reality. I differentiate between two levels of my experiences: a quasi-Jungian level, where I encountered the human family as a unified being, and a higher, quasi-Platonic level, engaging vast cosmic forces responsible for our reality’s conditions. This leads us through an exploration of oneness, experiencing emptiness of self and a world breathing as one.</p>
<p>"The sixth and seventh modules will focus on the birth of the future human, which I view as an evolution of our species. I experienced visions revealing that nature is putting us through pressure to foster this transformation, leading to a new collective psyche. Lastly, we’ll discuss integration—how do we integrate such intense experiences and what they mean for living in time and space?"</p>
<p>"I think it sounds amazing. I’m very fortunate to have a cheat sheet here," Vanese states. "But before we dive deeper, I think your journey encapsulates the male experience, expanded into a broader human journey. Most of us struggle to move beyond our personal stories."</p>
<p>"Right," Chris agrees. "For many of us, our journeys barely go beyond the personal. We're not fully able to elevate into collective consciousness."</p>
<p>"Exactly! Can you give us a sneak peek of what to expect in this journey?" Vanese probes.</p>
<p>"We'll start with the first module on methodology, then transition into crossing the boundary of birth and death. It’s about letting go of our egoic frames to explore dimensions broader than our historical context. We’ll discuss ego death, but not in a damaging way. It’s about allowing the ego to set aside so we can enter larger dimensions of existence. This leads us into examining collective suffering, which flows from our historical wounds, many of which still resonate in the collective psyche. </p>
<p>"This journey ultimately aims to explore those deeper layers, emphasizing the larger truths that connect us all. These experiences link to what I refer to as the 'future human'—an evolution of our consciousness." </p>
<p>"That sounds absolutely profound," Vanese responds, visibly reflecting on the implications. "What do you envision the integrated future human will look like?"</p>
<p>"I think we’ll carry the depth of knowledge from thousands of incarnations,” Chris explains. “The future human will not be marked by physical extremes; rather, we'll experience profound psychological changes, entering the 'One Heart' of humanity—a deeper communion with the mind of creation. We’ll see the world through a new lens. My last psychedelic journey gifted me what I call 'diamond vision'—an acute perception that allowed me to see the interconnectedness of existence in vivid detail." </p>
<p>"That's a beautiful vision," Vanese says. "One that contrasts sharply with some sci-fi depictions. I'm reminded of something I read about the relationships between sleeping and dying. It makes me think that life may mirror these grand cycles of existence, right?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Chris agrees. "There's a rhythm to it all, a Mandelbrot-like pattern where each layer through dying unfolds deeper perspectives. This is invaluable; it helps us tap into intuition and a broader state of consciousness."</p>
<p>“And for those navigating the divides we see in the world today—the bifurcation of opinions—is there something from your experience that could guide us through this chaotic moment?” Vanese inquires.</p>
<p>“Good question,” Chris replies thoughtfully. “I don’t know that there's one answer, but I can share this: consciousness is an infinite ocean, and my mind acts as a catalyst within it. Each psychedelic experience interacts with this vast consciousness, refining me over time. The more I allow myself to be purified, the deeper my experiences became. There is no end to this journey—a continual process of discovery. The visions I bring back are meant to be shared to enrich collective understanding and integration. We’re all on this journey together.” </p>
<p>“Thank you, Chris. Your insights are precious,” Vanese concludes, filled with respect for the journey they are exploring together.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: In terms of what would be useful to people, a number of things come forward. One of them is to trust the intelligence of the universe, to trust the wisdom that is alive and operating. We are taught that the universe came about by chance and evolves through random mutation, screened by brutal survival of the fittest. That's not an accurate reflection of my psychedelic experience at all. In my experience, we are surrounded by orders and magnitudes of intelligence. When you delve deeper into the universe, you're entering into more awareness, more consciousness, more intelligence than we typically experience within time and space. We must trust the universe that has created the conditions of reincarnation, where we choose our lives and the circumstances of our entry, including the difficult ones. Understanding reincarnation not just as a personal soul story, but as part of a collective human family narrative that incarnates intelligently, generation after generation, is crucial. Recognizing this intelligence helps us see how the human family is being catalyzed to embody a deeper form of functioning—an evolved way of being human.</p>
<p>If I were to impart one thing to people, it would be to lose their fear of death. I wish I could convey this absolute freedom from the fear of death because fearing death reflects a misunderstanding of cosmology. The hard work is done here, within time and space. When we die, it is graduation, homecoming, recess—filled with joy. Many Hollywood narratives about death are simply nonsense. When one experiences death personally or hears from those who have experienced near-death episodes, it becomes clear that death is merely a transition to a happier, finer place. We may eventually choose to return to time and space again because of the immense value it offers. Death is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>The wisdom of the universe, the cyclical nature of life, and the design behind reincarnation all point toward a species yet to be fully imagined. Billions of years have gone into this process, and it will continue for billions more. Every time we think we could do it better, we realize we have limited perspective. Even in our deep visionary states, we catch glimpses of what is being built, and I believe we will witness early signs of this evolution within this century.</p>
<p>Vanese McNeill: I couldn’t agree more. I recall when I was a student and came across great saints or sages who chose death rather than compromise their beliefs. They were burned at the stake because their convictions were so strong, and their messages still resonate in our lives today. It's been evident that with the recent pandemic, people remain in a state of fear of death. I'm curious about how someone who hasn’t been on your journey can arrive at that state without undergoing what you have. How can I reach that understanding without taking multiple doses of LSD?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: There are several ways to approach this. First, I suggest reading well-researched studies on near-death experiences. Engaging with this literature can fundamentally shift how you perceive and anticipate death. Another valuable body of work is the reincarnation literature, which presents compelling evidence for reincarnation. If we reincarnate, it alleviates the fear of dying by illustrating that death is not the end; it's merely part of a continuous cycle from birth to birth. There’s also the valuable literature on past life therapy, where individuals confront former lives to heal. By integrating these various bodies of knowledge, we can diminish our fear of death.</p>
<p>Additionally, spending time with people who have undergone spiritual practices that dissolve their fears can impart experiences of fearlessness in confronting life. It’s not magical or supernatural; it's about opening ourselves to a larger horizon where certain fears dissipate. This can be learned and shared, becoming a communal value. You certainly don’t need to do what I’ve done to awaken this sense of fearlessness.</p>
<p>Vanese McNeill: That makes a lot of sense. I am familiar with the literature, and indeed, there are overwhelming insights. Dolores Cannon has done incredible work on this. I think of cultures, like the Druze in the Middle East, where children who pass away due to traumatic experiences can return quickly and identify their past relatives—it's uncanny.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Ian Stevenson's research is a game changer. He’s like the Charles Darwin of reincarnation, providing numerous cases of children who not only have continuity of memory but can also recognize people from their past lives, often remembering intimate details and, in some fascinating instances, carrying scars indicative of their previous life’s death wounds. This suggests that both mind and cellular memories transfer across lives.</p>
<p>Vanese McNeill: I remember a friend of my father’s who had a recurring pain in his right shoulder. After going to a past life regressionist, he learned he had been stabbed through the body and, through acknowledgment of that pain, found healing. This mirrors the work you do—it's akin to personal and cosmic healing. There’s a chain of healing that continues through us.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It may sound exotic in hindsight, but when you’re in the experience, it feels natural. I believe any compassionate parent would act to alleviate suffering when witnessing their child or others in pain. It becomes instinctive. In both the physical world and during psychedelic sessions, if you're presented with the chance to engage with suffering, it’s a natural response to bring that suffering into awareness for healing. I didn’t pursue this work by obligation; I believe my soul chose this path before I was born. We who have come into this intense period bear responsibilities for the collective human family. Our existence during these challenging times is a profound undertaking, and we are manifesting that intentionally.</p>
<p>Vanese McNeill: I resonate with that. I've always been compassionate, even accused of being pathologically forgiving. Nowadays, I feel my compassion growing exponentially. It’s as if I am being called to evolve, and I see that happening around so many people. We can do this work on multiple levels, and it’s just as crucial to heal ourselves as it is to address larger-scale issues. I truly encourage everyone to read your book or join your course; it feels like divine work you are sharing. Participants will come away with a broader understanding of the universe and how to contribute positively to our evolution.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It’s like being a soldier, but of a very different kind. Here, we conquer by surrendering. We face pain not through fighting but by allowing it into our awareness. It’s akin to a woman in labor who doesn’t resist pain but collaborates with it to bring forth new life. Writing this book was challenging for me and took years to articulate these deeply personal experiences, which I initially wanted to keep private. However, I felt a pressing need to share it now, especially during such tumultuous times. We all need to show up and offer our gifts to support one another through this pivotal moment in history. If we pursue this with intelligence and compassion, we can diminish suffering and create a better world for future generations.</p>
<p>Vanese McNeill: We’re fortunate to have you, Chris, and I’m grateful you didn’t wait. Hearing this from you is powerful. I apologize for my connection issues, but there’s a link in the chat for your upcoming course, which everyone should check out. If they can't attend, sharing it is just as important so we can all contribute as you mentioned.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, Vanese, for this conversation and for hosting such meaningful discussions that facilitate humanity's awakening. Anyone interested in the course can find it at explorecosmicmind.com. There are also free bonuses available, including an ebook and access to some unpublished articles. I hope it attracts a wonderful group of curious souls eager to contribute positively.</p>
<p>Vanese McNeill: It will be an exceptional group. I’ll ensure everyone knows about it. Thank you, Chris, for your time today. The course starts on November 30, right?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, there’s an invitation event today, and then the course officially begins on November 30, running every Tuesday for three weeks, with a break for Christmas, before continuing through January.</p>
<p>Vanese McNeill: Wonderful! I’m looking forward to it and hope to see many from the MAGICAL EGYPT community there. Thank you, Chris, and have a great evening.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, Vanese. Bless you.</p>
<p>Vanese McNeill: Bless you, too.</p>

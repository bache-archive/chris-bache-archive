      <p>**Interviewer: ** In class, there are those imminent experiences when mind, body, heart, and spirit really come together. Personally, I feel lucky and happy to have you with us this week. I only know a little about your life's work, so I’ll just let you speak. Okay?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Come on, people, let it rip. Feel how that changes the energy—just that little bit. I don't have time to mess around anymore. We don’t have time to mess around anymore! There’s just not time. There’s only time to get down to the serious stuff. So let’s get down to it.</p>
<p>Rick asked me to talk about teaching, as if I’d picked up some incalculable secret knowledge from thirty years of teaching in Ohio. I don’t know—so I’ll just tell you what I’ve got, and then you can decide whether it was worthwhile. But we’re going to have fun tonight, no matter what. And, you know, you wouldn't mind if we finished before ten o’clock, would you? It’s been a long day. You people have been working hard. For me, a talk is simply an excuse to get to the discussion, right? Because that’s where the real juice is, the heart of it. So I’m just going to lay out some bullets, throw out some material to focus our discussion, but I’m really hoping we can move quickly into conversation. If that goes well, we’ll still be out of here before ten o’clock.</p>
<p>Is Robert here yet? Oh—there he is, among his many illustrious publications. One of those you may not have come across is his beautiful introduction—his prologue, preface—to <em>The Living Classroom</em>, which was a great honor. He really made me look good, very good. It was just an honor. So this is kind of PCC certified, you know.</p>
<p>How many people have read this? Okay, alright. I’m going to hit some bullet points but put it in a larger context—give you some backstory on how I came to write it, what happened during it, and what it’s about. This is like my second Saturn Return book. I started teaching in 1979, and this was published in 2008—pretty much exactly twenty-nine years. When I was coming up on sabbatical—because that’s the only time I get to write books—I was weighing two options: a book on psychedelics, or <em>The Living Classroom</em>. So I went into session space, as I usually do with an important question. After I was done with the various things, I asked, “What should I write?” And it said, “Definitely <em>The Living Classroom</em>.” Because, by the time you write the psychedelic book, you’ll be so far out in left field you’ll be beyond the mainstream pale. But where you are with <em>The Living Classroom</em>, you can do it in a mainstream fashion. So I said, “Okay.” As soon as I agreed and set that intention, wonderful things began to happen: I got grant money to spend more time writing, and just a lot of wonderful things fell into place. <em>The Living Classroom</em> has been published—six excerpts or chapters have appeared in five different anthologies. It’s gotten more airplay than anything else I’ve written, and I think that’s because of Robert McDermott’s preface, and because the idea of collective fields of consciousness—the time for that idea has come. Society is ripe for it.</p>
<p>So, as the second Saturn Return, this book is really a summation of the most important things I learned about teaching from my thirty years at Youngstown. For a little more background: when I had my second Saturn Return and came to Youngstown, it broke my heart. I really didn’t want to be there. I mean, I hadn’t gone to seven years of graduate school to teach at open-enrollment undergraduate college—a rust-belt town in Ohio, with no graduate students. It wasn’t my ideal, and like anyone with a grain of sense, I tried desperately to leave for several years. When you’re just out of graduate school, you have a few years when you might jump into something new. I tried jumping.</p>
<p>Problem was, I had also encountered Stan Grof’s work. I started my own psychedelic work in 1979, a year after I started teaching, and my mind was radicalized quickly. One year I was writing essays on a unified theory of metaphor; two years later, I’m writing about the emergence of perinatal symptoms in Buddhist meditations. My department kept wondering, “What the hell happened to him?” They hired a traditional analytic philosopher of religion, and suddenly there I was, saying, “Hey, this guy—Grof—he’s onto something seriously good.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t happening, though. Religious Studies is a very conservative discipline. It just wasn’t happening.</p>
<p>Four years in, the only job that had opened in five years opened up that year, and they chose the very traditional philosophical/theological type. At a teaching university, you’re really in the classroom a lot—three courses a quarter, nine a year, plus summer. It’s just pounding, difficult teaching. I said, “Okay, I give up. This isn’t what I wanted, but it seems to be what life wants. So I surrendered: I’ll become the best teacher I can become. Let’s see what happens.” And it went in some very interesting places. The result is in this book.</p>
<p>A third of <em>The Living Classroom</em> is my students—the back third, really, is a second book: essays my students have written, just beautiful work. There were hidden reasons, I’d later learn, for why I was in Youngstown. There were benefits: without graduate students and their responsibilities, I could explore. If I wanted to learn something, I taught a seminar. I taught courses outside my discipline; I learned a lot and was able to innovate in our curriculum. I taught what I call Transpersonal studies—near death research, reincarnation, out-of-body experiences, Transpersonal psychology of religion, seminars on Stan Grof’s work. There were trade-offs, but one of the great benefits was non-traditionally aged students: about forty percent of our students. That was a nice compensation for not having graduate students—they were much more serious about their studies.</p>
<p>But the other thing Youngstown gave me was an opportunity for deep spiritual practice. There’s not much to do in Ohio; it’s kind of boring. You watch the corn, watch the corn some more—so it’s a contemplative, smooth environment if you want to do deep, serious work. I found I wanted that. I started my psychedelic work right when I started my career: four intense years, stopped for six years, then another ten years after that.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve always loved teaching, always loved to talk. Teaching at an open-enrollment university is truly front-line teaching. Many of my students were the first in their family to go to college, with people pulling them down—“What do you want to go for? Just get a job at GM Lordstown, make cars.” You have to do what I call full-contact teaching—no prisoners. You provide motivation, you have to kick them in the butt, slap them around (metaphorically). When I come here to teach, you’re all so easy, so motivated. There, it’s a different game, and they make you work for it, but I was willing.</p>
<p>Eventually, my classroom became like a dojo. You’re on my mat. Nobody gets hurt, but you’ll hit the floor a few times, and no time to mess around—let’s get down to it. Thirty percent of my students dropped out by the end of the first week. The first day, I tell them: just getting credits in the humanities is perfectly good reason to be here. Second day, it’s not—you can get credits elsewhere more easily. But I also show them what’s possible if they’re willing to work. I find they are, if you give them a quality product. A lot have been damaged by high school, have low expectations. If you give them substance, they’ll work for it and open their hearts.</p>
<p>But when you start using psychedelics, you have to make adjustments professionally. I had to split my life in two. Professionally, I did what professors do: committees, publishing. Personally, I did the Grofian deep psychotherapeutic work. I kept them separate; you cannot blend those two in the classroom. The good people of Ohio do not want to hear their professors are experimenting with psychedelics! So I did not talk about my personal work with my classes. Even among faculty it was years before they figured out what was going on. I’d borrow a tape player from a colleague for sessions, and he started suspecting, but I kept quiet.</p>
<p>Because those two were kept separate outwardly, it produced fascinating consequences that taught me about the nature of consciousness. Even though I split my world, consciousness itself did not split—mind is not dividable that way. Things began happening, connections forming, and there were consequences for splitting myself like that. You know what you’re doing, but I didn’t really understand the long-term ramifications until much later.</p>
<p>Early in my teaching, a student asked me a question. After you’ve taught a course a few years, you’ve heard all the questions. So my mind started running with my usual answer. But this time, I stopped and thought, “Among all possible answers, what could I say that would be most in tune with this student?” My mind stopped—and suddenly, I had this image: a door in the back of my mind, and a piece of paper passed through. On it, an idea, an answer I’d never given before. So I tried it, and the magic happened: teaching happened. The student’s eyes lit up, the energy in the room shifted. It worked.</p>
<p>Now, I really prepare for my classes—look, I even brought notes to Esalen! But that door in my mind taught me about integrating improvisational intuition with my prepared material. I started paying attention to that door and working with it. When I did, something happened in the room that didn’t happen when I stuck strictly to my script.</p>
<p>As I continued my psychedelic work—if you’ve read <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, you know I dropped into some deep stuff quickly, engaging collective dynamics, entering hell realms and the ocean of suffering. Wherever I was on Saturday, Monday morning I was back in the classroom. I would not let my personal work get in the way of my commitment to my students.</p>
<p>Then one ordinary day, teaching Introduction to Eastern Religions, a student came up after class—after making sure the room was empty—and said, “It’s funny you used that example today, because that’s exactly what happened to me this week.” He told me a story, and it really was like I’d quoted his life. That was interesting—a little synchronistic—but I never thought of myself as psychically sensitive. I’ve always seen myself as rather brick-ish in that regard, a psychic brick. Some people have those experiences—I always envied them. Not me.</p>
<p>But a few weeks later, it happened again: someone told me the same thing had happened to their mother. Over time, the deeper my psychedelic work, the more frequently this sort of thing began to happen—pieces of my students’ lives appearing in my lectures, without me intending it or even being conscious of it. I’d reach for an example and somehow, something would connect me to them and I’d use their life to illustrate a point.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re just in the room for three credits and suddenly the professor uses your life as an example—how could you not take that personally? How could you not snap to attention? This started happening often enough to become a semi-regular thing in my classroom.</p>
<p>As I went into even deeper territories—into the deep ocean of suffering, collective Death-Rebirth—my students were drawn into deep existential crises in their lives. We were all part of one giant, co-melting system: addictions bottoming out, fragile marriages forced into grow-or-die situations, people suddenly unearthing old pains like sexual abuse. I never spoke about some of these things, but something was bringing them up in students’ lives. This absolutely was not my intention. In fact, as this began to happen, I tried to slow it down because I didn’t understand it, so I couldn’t control it. How do you ensure informed consent in a process so involuntary? I even put on my syllabus, “Caution: Taking this course may be dangerous to your psychological equilibrium.” The students thought I was being cute.</p>
<p>This thing—I called it “the magic.” I’d come home and say to my wife, “The magic happened today.” Out of nowhere, a lightning bolt hit, we’d have an intense conversation after class, and suddenly something was moving in their life. I began functioning like a lightning rod, and at that time, I didn’t understand what was going on. I knew it had to do with my psychedelic work, but wasn’t prepared for the magnitude of the paradigm shift I’d have to make to understand it.</p>
<p>By the way, everything in <em>The Living Classroom</em>—I had been thinking about it, wrestling with it, but it all dropped in, intact and complete, in one psychedelic session. The fundamental structure became clear, and that clarity gave me the courage to articulate it—because if it was happening to me, it was happening to others. And it’s not about psychedelics per se—any powerful spiritual practice that drops you deep into the collective psyche can open you at that level and generate an energetic shockwave, touching lives you’re karmically connected to. As a teacher, that's my students; for you, it might be business partners, research colleagues, anyone in your relational network. The universe doesn’t always regard individuals separately—it just moves. </p>
<p>I began to realize I was teaching on two levels. For most students, I was an ordinary professor, a relationship about information exchange. But there was a second group who took all my courses—not for information, but because being in my classes became a source of inner transformation. They felt a positive movement in their lives—again, not by my intention, but by some energetic resonance. </p>
<p>This isn’t supernatural or paranormal; it’s just natural. Life is like that. Minds are not fundamentally separate; there’s an underlying unity. When people focus intention together, there’s a natural sharing. If one of you is working deep, the universe seizes the opportunity to awaken and heal others. It wasn’t something I was doing, but something the universe was doing, almost in spite of me.</p>
<p>Teaching is information transfer, and all the magic in that dance—but underneath, it’s also mind engaging mind in the unified field of mind. Clarified states of consciousness are contagious—you can’t help it. Negative states are contagious too, but clarified consciousness is especially contagious. Our spiritual ecology doesn’t allow private realization; if you begin to wake up, there’s an energetic component, and people around you begin to wake up. If you’re teaching or doing any group work, you have to be prepared for that consequence. In fact, you can’t stop it. There may be a reason people do this work in monasteries or mountains, to buffer it. But if you’re going to do it in the world, you have to be prepared to handle the implications—and the better a teacher you are, the more powerfully this will emerge. Because teaching is that magical mystery, that resonance, organizing intention, being in the dance—and if you’re good at that, this just happens more readily.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes, so eventually I had no recourse—I had to learn what was happening. I had to understand what it means to teach at this level. What does it mean to teach when your very presence becomes an added catalyst in the room? It's not just the ideas that act as a catalyst, but you become the catalyst. I had to learn how to manage—not control, but manage—the energies involved, make things more efficient, protect the students, and choreograph the flow a bit. Then I realized what was happening in the room was too big to understand as just an energetic resonance between my spiritual practice and the students. That was only part of it. I began to notice something else: students started showing up in each other's dreams. There was a social phenomenon at work.</p>
<p>Rupert Sheldrake's work on morphogenetic resonance and morphic fields influenced my understanding, but I initially thought his concepts applied to vast evolutionary fields, not to something as contained as a 15-week class. Then, during a psychedelic session, it became clear: even short-term groups generate fields. Whenever people gather with focused intention and sufficient engagement, especially in repeated contexts, fields emerge. This happens because consciousness is inherently unified—it's not simply about connecting separate entities, but about bringing an underlying potential into form: group fields, or group mind.</p>
<p>Take Phil Jackson, the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. He's not typically seen as mystical, but he described how, in critical situations, players become totally in sync, acting as if they’re five fingers on the same hand. Howard Bloom, in his book <em>The Global Brain</em>, observed: "Without knowing it, individuals form a team. Even in our most casual moments, we pulse in synchrony." I began to realize, just as Rupert Sheldrake's theory predicts, that there was a learning curve shift in my classes. It’s almost like one class was starting where the last class stopped. You have the course structured, think you know what to expect, but suddenly students are already ahead—already in B or C before you even get started—forcing you to rearrange your syllabus and keep up, because something has shifted. There's a learning that goes on between semesters; you hit certain turning points and, after that, each new class is working in an altered context. It's a nuisance to keep changing things, but when you resist, the students get bored, energy drops, and it's just not sustainable. It’s better to adapt and meet them where they are—they’ll often take you to places you haven’t been yourself.</p>
<p>Over time, I began distinguishing two levels of fields: the class field and the course field. The class field is the living energy of the people present that day—like the cambium, the living outer edge of a tree, just under the bark. The course field is much older and broader; it's an arc of learning contributed to by every student who've ever taken the course with a particular professor. Initially, the class field may be stronger, but after decades of teaching, the course field becomes powerful. So you've got three systems: the individual student, affected by the class field, which in turn is affected by the broader course field. This organic relationship between universal mind and individual mind is mediated by these intermediate fields. When they're strong and skillfully focused, they animate and empower individual learning.</p>
<p>If you were a coach, you'd talk about performance fields; if a physician, healing fields. As a teacher, they're learning fields—fields that are old and new, present and past. I learned you can work with these fields. I start before the class begins, with certain practices, because to me, the field is the unregistered student in the room—a tangible force. When selecting books for the next semester, I try to tune in to the emerging field to guide my choices. I do spiritual practices to clear old karma; I don’t want negative energy—bad vibes—in the classroom. As a believer in reincarnation, I assume I may have past-life connections with some students, for better or worse. There's no time for leftover pain, so I do practices for cutting karmic ties, like the Hawaiian ho‘oponopono or the Tibetan chöd. Before class, when I receive the roster, I perform these rituals for each student.</p>
<p>I often wonder what my colleagues would think if they saw me with a bell, chanting a Tibetan prayer for students I've never met. But once you understand fields, this is simply being efficient—working with the energy before the people are present. When class actually begins, you see the embodied energy and can work with the fields behind the scenes or directly, using things like visualization or group conversations to empower them.</p>
<p>Closing the field at the semester's end is important—not to dissolve it, but to mark a beginning, middle, and end. If you empower fields, you have to help students detach, reclaim their individuality, and move on to new groups and fields. If you don’t close the field, students may get stuck—still attached to the class energy with nowhere to channel it. So you need both shamanic and pedagogic strategies: a final exam, a farewell gathering, or discussion about next steps all serve to mark the transition, reinforce the lineage of learning, and affirm that our time together is finite.</p>
<p>Waking up in the classroom—if we're talking about spiritual awakening—simply means realizing that nobody holds their being independently; our beginnings and endings lie beyond ourselves. It's waking up to how deeply intertwined our lives are, how woven together. When you can feel that weave, the tension of self relaxes, the wind moves through the leaves, and everything dances. It's waking up to something that has always been there—Shunyata, or emptiness. My favorite translation is “transparency”—being here, but transparent to the ground of being, to the true condition of things. People wake up in all sorts of circumstances, and aside from my psychedelic work, the classroom has been a powerful place for this for me. Sometimes it feels as if something uses my mind, a wind blowing between me and the students, and I just relax and let something bigger than myself happen. There’s no self in it—it’s inherently transpersonal. Appreciating the transpersonal nature of this exchange opens up a deep joy.</p>
<p>There’s a profound moment when you realize that the life within you, the aliveness of the room, is the life of all things—yours, the students’, and everything’s. Even when I forget, life itself doesn’t forget; the transparency is always there. You can wake up in any circumstance, and it’s lovely to experience that awakening while working, especially as a teacher.</p>
<p>The Circle of Learning—I've experienced this many times. You learn something, and soon after, someone asks a question you couldn't have answered two weeks earlier. But now, because you learned, you're able to share, and it matters to them. At first, I thought this meant the universe was using what I learned to help someone else. But in time, I saw it's more complex: often, I learned something in the first place because there was a need-to-know coming toward me, a kind of reciprocal learning. When you realize this, you have to let go even more deeply—you don't even own your own ideas or academic passions. Your passions are intertwined with your students’ from the beginning. You can either clutch tightly, or let go and recognize that our beginnings and endings aren't simply our own—our wants and needs are interwoven with others’, and we're constantly processing this dance at many levels.</p>
<p>I kept doing the psychedelic work, going deeper into areas I haven't yet written about. <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> covers the first ten years, but then there was a second decade—deep experiences, some of which many of you may have touched: experiencing reincarnation, not at the individual soul level, but at the collective, aggregate level. I experienced what it was like to be part of a species reincarnating, each person as if sloughing cells from a single vast organism—the learning of the species mind, moving through generations, pulled into humanity's evolutionary crisis and the crescendo we're now reaching, gestating the next form of humanity through history.</p>
<p>Eventually, I entered what I call the domain of diamond luminosity, or what Buddhists call the sambhogakaya. The intimacy with the divine became so deep it was painful to leave. I couldn't share this territory with my undergraduate students—they weren’t prepared, and it simply couldn't be done. I'm a natural sharer, so holding back became almost physically painful. I lost control of my voice at times; there was tension, as I'd want to share knowledge that I knew couldn't be received. This coincided with a tumultuous time in my life—my marriage ended, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> was published, and I became Director of Education at IONS in California. I hoped it would be a new platform, working with more advanced students, but after two years it didn’t work out, so I returned to Ohio and resumed teaching—a hard transition.</p>
<p>I knew I didn't belong at Youngstown State anymore, but I needed to stay until my youngest graduated. I had stopped the intense psychedelic work, but still felt ungrounded, struggling with an over-attachment to marijuana—a way of avoiding fully coming down from those mountaintop experiences. Eventually, I realized I had to come all the way down, and that took time.</p>
<p>It was five to ten years after stopping the deep work before my system recalibrated to a new baseline. As soon as my daughter graduated, I resigned. Then the question became: how do I share what I know now? Through writing. That’s how I can contribute to the resurgence of the psychedelic renaissance, help my discipline realize the potential of psychedelics for philosophy, and help others explore cosmological depths while avoiding some of the risks and mistakes I made. </p>
<p>It’s about knowing when to pull back, knowing when the students you love aren't your students anymore, shifting from teaching to writing, and seeing what unfolds. The book I’m working on now is <em>Stealing Diamonds from Heaven</em>, about this whole story. Next, I want to write <em>The Birth of the Diamond Soul</em>, which explores my sense of what’s happening in history and nature.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
I’ll say something. I think you can see why I was so delighted to write the foreword to Chris’s book and how easy it was. Thank you! For any of you interested in continuing this conversation with Chris, with me, with various aspects of what you’re doing, I’d be happy to participate—maybe even while we’re here, if we can figure that out. Anyone who wants to leave at any time, please do. I’m very moved, as you can tell, and if you read the foreword, you’ll see it was an easy affirmation to make.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Now, what most of you don’t know is that I was Robert’s sitter in a Holotropic Breathwork session down at the Big House, and he was my sitter too. We got down together. Okay, the floor is open. Let’s talk.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
Maybe I'll begin with a little explanation as to why I jumped up here. You said you did Jungian work for thirty years—thirty-three, actually. I had a very similar experience for twenty years at Baruch College. I taught all first-generation students. I never had fewer than forty students, never taught the same student twice, and I taught forty students three times a year, three times a day, every semester for twenty years. So, it's a little something. Then I came to Paradise, not as a faculty member initially, but I've been here as faculty for fourteen years, all the time looking for the kind of experience that you described. And, well, I’m the brick that you said you were, too—all those things. I also didn’t have a psychedelic practice. We can fix that.</p>
<p>There's no shortage of people in this room to get me, to help me do that. That said, I want to note, in this psychedelic-inspired community, no one has ever pressured me—not once. That’s how it should always be in life. But it is true. I'm always looking for what I call the etheric body to be experienced and shared, with language, with examples, and so on. I'm not saying it doesn’t happen, or hasn’t happened, but it certainly hasn’t happened at the level you described in "The Living Classroom," which I think is quite an amazing document. If you haven’t read it, it’s an amazing document.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say I jumped up here very spontaneously. I actually had a pretty hard trip, if you remember—in fact, everybody else was out of the room. I don't know why I'm talking about this. Stan relieved you. And when I came out of this experience, I insisted to Chris that it had been about ten minutes—it was actually three hours. I recall Stan’s hand on my face, something like a baseball glove—this giant of a man with exquisite, gentle, compassionate quality. I almost spoke about that at the conference—I almost said that—but thought, no, it’s not really what it's about, even though it’s in my mind because we just had this great experience with Stan. So, anyway, we had that together. I sat with you. It was a very bonding experience. The other dive I did was at my house on Ashbury Street, with Will—keep it at that.</p>
<p>Audience: 
Well, he's good. You're in cherry hands—good hands.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
I went to the mountain twice, yes. But anyway, returning to you and your work and your relationship to our students—it’s quite intense, considering you don't teach that often. I hear, “get him here, keep him here”—that kind of thing, which I listen to, remember, and try to emulate. But keep it up, keep it up.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Let me mention something about the etheric field. This comes at the very end of "The Living Classroom." The book was published in 2008, written in 2006–2007, and I stopped the heavy-duty psychedelic work in '99. Over time, this energetic resonance calmed down; it didn't go away entirely, but instead of being like a lightning rod, where things happened around me without my effort, I had to cooperate with it—I had to let it happen. Not that I could control it, but there was a sense that it was subtler. That teaches us something about the etheric level: the practice empowers the system, you open up, you bring in heavy-duty energy, you move from 110 volts to 240 volts—naturally, you activate these inherent circuits. But then if things calm down, it’s not like the circuits go away—the network is there, but there’s less energy driving it. There's wisdom in the pace of evolution. There is a certain—not a risk, exactly, but if you drive the system hard, things happen; then you calm down and things settle. So I don’t have that transparency today that I did at the peak described in "The Living Classroom." Now it’s much subtler than it was then.</p>
<p>Audience: 
Rules are rules. The period of the greatest transparency—as you described—was that whole era of the Uranus-Neptune conjunction, which was indeed a collective field that dissolved boundaries, created transparent fields; a perfect expression of it in a creative way. That really started coming in during the mid-to-late '80s, was totally “cooking” all through the '90s, and by 2001, it reached the 15-degree mark. That pulse—PCC was born under it, and many others. Now we have Uranus-Pluto, a whole different kind of driving intensity. What you described about "The Living Classroom" and the morphic field—the course fields, class fields—the perception and capacity to cultivate and name it, articulate it, is an expression of that larger Uranus-Neptune field. The privilege we all had of participating during those years.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Where are we going? Chris, Richard.</p>
<p>Audience: 
Chris, I just want to express my deepest gratitude. For those of us who have experienced you in the classroom and seen the living embodiment of your written word in person—it’s unbelievable. Every time I leave your class, I feel just a little more dignified and connected to a larger purpose. On a personal note—five or six weeks ago, I started teaching poetry to sixth- and seventh-graders. I was terrified in front of those kids; I felt like I didn’t even know how to speak to them. If it weren’t for your book, I think I would have fallen apart. I had this distinct feeling—with the help of your book—that not all the responsibility lay on my shoulders, and I could actually allow the field to create the class. And sure enough, it happened—I saw it in living action. </p>
<p>So I do have a question. What cosmological implications do you see from the field experience you've had in your life—that the whole universe seems to relate in that same potential to create fields everywhere we look? Is a galaxy a kind of field? Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
The nice thing is, whatever is going on, it’s been happening for billions of years before we even began to understand what was going on. The fact that we're starting to understand these dynamics, and maybe participate more consciously—some of my colleagues worry it undermines individuality, all this ego-fear stuff. But really, we’re just beginning to play with something that's been playing with us for a long time. I don’t know how it all works; I don’t know the full ramifications. But when we work together, synchronize ourselves with guided intention, do these exercises—what do you know? There’s a little bit of bleed-through, a little reinforcement that happens. </p>
<p>Then you think, there’s a field around the Pentagon, a field around shopping malls, the New York Times—fields are everywhere. They’re not good or bad in any moral sense. There’s a field around the Ku Klux Klan, around the NRA and all its chapters. It’s been going on for a long time; it’s just the connective tissue of consciousness. Once you understand that, you start to get a little more sensitive to your own psychic hygiene. There are some psychic fields you won’t want to put yourself into. I used to take my kids to karate matches, and little Lance would be like, “Ooh…” But going to art museums, that’s a nice field.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
Why did you say, as I think you did, that they’re not good or bad, when you’ve just indicated that some fields really are pretty negative and difficult?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
By good or bad, I mean that nature doesn’t seem to reinforce “morally good” fields and undermine negative ones—at least, not in the way I see it. As an evolving consciousness, I choose to cultivate certain energy in my life. By choosing the energy I want to experience, I detach from the ones I don’t. So I make moral distinctions; I want to be in fields of compassion, intelligence, creativity—not in corrosive or vitriolic fields. But it’s like the ocean: it has currents, it has riptides, it moves this way and that. We either drown or float, but the currents themselves aren’t moral.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
So, two differences in our worldview have surfaced. For me, this entire discussion takes place within the comprehensive evolution of consciousness. If you remember Rick’s talk and how articulate he is about the uniqueness of modern Western consciousness, he and I have both been influenced by Owen Barfield—"Saving the Appearances" and other books. That influence leads me to respond to your comment that something like the etheric was immediately evident before the separation came about in the modern West. Now we have to learn—by love—to reconnect with our own etheric and the etheric around us. We try to discern etheric fields—perhaps synonymous or tautological—that are working against love, and we must know that and do what we can to transform them.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I’ll go even further—I agree. The universe, as Jung said, tilts toward growth. I think there are ways and levels at which the universe is actually encouraging compassion and tilting things toward growth. When I say the fields themselves are a natural phenomenon—not inherently good or bad—that doesn’t mean other dynamics aren’t at play, encouraging or strengthening subtle fields of compassion, oneness, growth, and not giving support to fields that are divisive or destructive of the unified fabric of life.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
I think I’d want to revise your language just a bit. I don’t often talk about anything as “inherently;” it’s really a matter of multiple relationships, yes. So I don’t think fields are negative by themselves—they’re negative in relation to what the universe needs to accomplish.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
That’s interesting language. I have to sit with that for a bit.</p>
<p>Audience: 
Let me sit with that for a bit—in relationship to what needs to be accomplished.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
Let me sit with that for a bit as well. Jung senses growth or talks about the universe trying to evolve toward love and freedom. I actually think it’s toward freedom; freedom is the condition that makes love possible.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
To me, love is an expression of the inherent oneness of life. It fosters and expresses that oneness—that’s why it’s so powerful. It is the experience of the unified nature of reality.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
Exactly. And therefore, those fields that are emphasizing or militating on behalf of disunity and fear, hatred, and delusion—I consider those to be negative, and it’s part of my life’s work to transform those fields, which are also active within myself.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I certainly agree. Just a little side note—one reason I learned that was from Youngstown. My soul’s choice was to do the work with the ocean of suffering I ended up confronting in the psychedelic work. San Francisco isn’t a great environment for working through negative fields; Youngstown is. It’s made the cover of Time magazine twice as Mobtown, USA; it had the highest murder per capita rate in the country for years. Mafia dominated the politics; there were gangland executions. Even back to Native Americans—there were terrible massacres. There’s a huge psychic field, a lot of Eastern European immigration, patriarchy, abuse of women. It’s a place where bad karma comes to work itself out. So I believe in working to lift those energies out of the collective psyche—I affirm that deeply. When I say the fields themselves—meaning the aggregation of that negativity—is a natural phenomenon, I don’t mean to say it’s “natural, therefore good.” It’s just an aggregation of energy—</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
—natural. How about intelligible?</p>
<p>Audience: 
Intelligible, okay.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
How’d you like a job?</p>
<p>Audience: 
To be into somersault from now on—yeah.</p>
<p>Audience: 
Thank you, Chris, for coming and sharing with us. It was beautiful to see you express yourself so freely and articulate everything so well. My curiosity about working with fields relates to the form of the atom—the way the electron jumps from ring to ring instantly. As a model for how the universe is structured, I wonder what you would have to say about the evolution of consciousness in a relational field and quantum leaps in that field.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I don’t know. We know about emergence; things happen in jumps, we hit tipping points. We think we’re coming to an evolutionary tipping point. When people have near-death experiences, they go through exponential increases in awareness in a very short time. More than one author has suggested that the human race is coming to a collective near-death experience—a potential jumping point. If fields can tip in small groups—if we hit that at large scale, in darkness or early dawn—I’d say we have a long way to go and little time to get there. The only way we could possibly make that kind of evolutionary progress is by understanding field dynamics, because then we’re not trying to change seven billion minds—we only need to change one mind, and the seven billion experiences are being processed at an integral level. If we understand nonlinear systems, and hypothesize the human collective unconscious as such a system, then when it’s thrown into far-from-equilibrium conditions, things can happen fast; there can be jumps. I really think that some dynamic like that underlies humanity’s potential for quantum change. It’s not simply an aggregate of individuals—there’s a deeper summation coming from all those individuals.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
Following on Brian again—okay, I’ll let others talk, but I remember what I was thinking. Sama, your job.</p>
<p>Audience: 
I was just telling Sami it’d be really cool if you somersaulted, but I could tell you didn’t understand—I felt bad! He thinks I didn’t like his somersaulting. I loved it. That’s fantastic. Okay, great, great. I actually didn’t want the microphone, but Robert does, so here we are.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: 
Jesse’s all the way back—and Aaron, Lydia, thanks.</p>
<p>Audience: 
I have a question about working with fields. I actually have two questions, though they might have a similar answer. First, I can see how working with fields could be applicable in almost any relational situation. So I’m inquiring if you could share something specific about a practice for working with fields. Second, a lot of us do work in relationship to the current crisis—the destruction and chaos people are experiencing. Whether it’s a person we’re trying to support or simply being present and wanting to be strong and good while also being aware, perhaps carrying fear, anger, delusion. Do you have a specific practice to share—or is there something for us to digest?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Compassion practices. That’s what comes to mind first. But first of all, you’re already doing what you describe—each of you has made a choice to radically insert yourself into an evolutionary process to bring about a shift or improvement in the condition of the planet. You’ve traveled across the country, aligned with a distinctive institution, and many of you are following pure gut instinct toward something you can’t see, because it’s not a traditional track. You’re already plugged into the dynamics that are building—you’re already taking in massive amounts of information, watching a process unfold, reaching for the embodiment of the solution. So everything you’re talking about, you’re already doing.</p>
<p>How can you do it better—just a little bit better? It’s important to take care of yourself, because there’s a lot of wear and tear and burnout; this isn’t going to be fixed soon. You’re going to die and still be in process. Your children will die and still be in process. It’s a marathon. How do you keep yourself replenished over the long term? How do you stay attuned to opportunities? Several things come to mind, but the most important are compassion practices. Every tradition has them—exchanging self for other, or practices where you voluntarily expand your heart into deep beauty, into deep pain, broad horizons, and then bring it back, returning to your individual day’s work. Compassion is the recognition of the inherent oneness of life. If we’re talking about revitalized contact between the highly refined, evolved, historically beautiful individuality and the larger field of life, compassion expresses and encourages that oneness. There are clarity and antidote practices, but compassion practices seem to most deeply address what you’re describing.</p>
<p>Audience: 
Thank you so much for this, Chris. My question is about coming down off the mountain. I was struck by that part. Could you speak a bit more about your decision—in terms of your use of sacred medicine? For me, I wrestled with an attachment to marijuana; for years it kept me connected to the numinous and the archetypal realm, and I’ve had to find my own relationship with it in order to live my truth and do my work as I want to. This is also alive and true for many of my friends. Could you speak more about that, and also about intimacy with the Divine—how the veil shifted, slowed down, or calmed down for you? And why it’s felt important to move in that direction at this point?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thank you for the very heartfelt question. I'll do my best to speak from the same depth it was asked. I'm Neptune first house square sun in the tenth house. Addiction is the shadow of Neptune, right? Neptune is what allows me to open up into deep fields with relative ease and gives me sensitivity to collective dynamics. But the shadow side is taking the lower form of unity rather than the higher form. That’s been an issue for me—addiction, not alcohol or death, but marijuana has been an issue, and I really had to learn and grow with it, and know when to let it go. I…</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I stopped the high-dose work for two reasons. One was that I was running into a lot of physical and subtle energy system complications. I kept thinking these complications would stop if I just went through enough dying experiences, but eventually I realized they were happening precisely because I’d gone through so many. They were only going to get worse if I kept plunging myself into these huge fires. Despite doing a lot of purification—yoga, Tibetan deity practices, things to support myself—I was still running so much energy that my body was telling me to let that energy calm down and soothe out.</p>
<p>But there was another reason—a cautionary note. I speak deeply and positively about psychedelics, but it’s a tricky path, even when you work carefully and intentionally. The main reason I stopped was because I literally could not take coming back anymore. The intimacy with the divine—the places I eventually learned how to enter—became so beautiful and extraordinary, so profoundly ‘home,’ that returning was incredibly painful. There are beings who can live in those places, and all honor to the great mahasiddhas. I’m not one of them, not yet. Going in and out of that condition—it’s not enlightenment per se, but something akin to what that lineage points to—coming back out was just too painful. Eventually, I asked the universe never to bring me back into this reality until I wouldn’t have to leave again. I couldn’t take it anymore. I learned it’s possible to have too much God—more than is healthy if you want to keep your feet on the earth. You can open yourself too deeply.</p>
<p>When I stopped that deep work, I entered a sadness that was excruciating, because I knew that leaving meant I would never, in this lifetime, return to that territory again. It’s like Olympic training; you can’t just drop a huge amount of acid and get back there—it would take years of dedicated work to build the momentum again. I knew I was leaving that forever—until I die. I do believe that when I die, I’ll return, that the universe wouldn’t be so cruel as to deny me that. If I can get there, it’s an even deal.</p>
<p>Coming back down, marijuana allowed me—because of all this prior work—when I would smoke, I’d open up pretty big, skipping over intermediate stuff and opening right up to the sun. It was a way of not fully landing on the ground, of staying just a little ‘off.’ But I began to realize I couldn’t finish my life’s work in that state. I had to get all the way down, into my body. So I continue to do my practice—Vajrayana, Dzogchen, sitting with teachers, taking teachings—but that diamond luminosity domain is not the same as the state of transparency, the state of shunyata. It’s a different reality. There are beings who can live there—I know that—but I’m just not one of them yet. Thank you.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Thanks, Chris. I have two questions. First, I’d love to hear more about the human that we’re moving towards as a species, and about the diamond soul. Also, you mentioned reaching a moment when your students are no longer your students—a transition that doesn’t seem to happen here. How might we relate to that in a place where we’re always invited back in as continuing learners? Are we not closing the fields, or are we doing it in some partial way? How is that working?</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: That’s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I think your full-time faculty probably have a better answer than I can offer, but from what I see, I don’t observe a failure to close the field. Maybe it could always be refined, but from my outsider perspective and from what I saw of Christina, who was program coordinator for a while and wrote poems for graduation—graduation here is a tremendous celebration of accomplishment. You seem to graduate well, to honor your dissertations and master’s theses, and there’s real closure built into your community. Bringing graduates back in doesn’t mean that those fields haven’t been well closed. If there’s any fine-tuning to do, that’s something to consider, but I don’t think simply having an extended community means the closures aren’t happening. You are an unusual community—really, you see much more than most people do outside, so it’s natural to seek nourishment from your community as you re-enter the world.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: Extremely good answer, Chris. Thanks for the question—a great one.</p>
<p>The way I tend to think about us—PCC faculty, students, alumni—is less in terms of ‘fields,’ though it’s a useful concept. I think of it more as individual and somewhat temporary, karmic joining of will, mind, and feeling. For some people, that joining has great longevity; for others, it doesn’t. That seems perfectly fine. Some come into this community with heart, mind, and will in a truly transformative way—both for the person and the community—while others are here more lightly, and are held in a way proportionate to that commitment. Some of our alums haven’t really left, no matter where they are, and others move on. There’s a huge range, and that seems right. It’s fine for each person to be involved as deeply or lightly as is authentic for them at that time in their life, given their karmic task and opportunity.</p>
<p>I don’t think of a single field. It’s a community of many levels—some trying to operate on all, some with other commitments, influential in some respects but not all, and for some, it’s massively transformative. I think, in the way we talk to each other, we know who we are on this spectrum. When Chris comes in with his profound, fascinating, and to me mysterious and inspiring biography, he touches deep places in our community psyche; but I don’t for a moment expect that he touches every member. Many are working on different problems or have already moved on. One of the reasons I’m so impressed by PCC is our capacity to sustain and encourage a variety of ways to participate—a robust plurality. ‘Field’ is, for me, a little too singular for who we are. We’re different from each other, and it’s great we can come together so creatively and deeply despite that. This is not a psychological or philosophical boot camp; it’s a place to come through and go out, with something deep or not-so-deep having happened. I hope people leave with gratitude and ways to continue participating. The community is constantly evolving, thanks to the many unique individuals who come and stir it up, lifting it toward new possibilities. That’s how I think about it.</p>
<p>At some point we probably should—well, I’m not in charge—</p>
<p>Chris Bache: How about if I answer your second question? Maybe that’s a good place to stop. The hot tubs are waiting for you all—not for us.</p>
<p>Robert McDermott: Unfortunately, I have a really low-level—one day, gone from... I think of Plato, who wrote the Symposium and the Republic, and then he wrote the Laws, three times as long as the Republic. What I’m about to say has to do with law. I’m glad we live in a country of law, but it’s also sometimes sort of a minimum standard. So, you heard Rick mention—we’re not only here in this culture, but part of a wider legal culture, and we have to observe institutional expectations. There are three groups here: faculty—including adjuncts—students, and alumni. We could make three sets of suggestions, but I’ll suggest we make two: faculty time and student time.</p>
<p>Try to remember: faculty time in the lower tubs is to in the morning—students and alumni are not invited at that time. The upper tub—some of you may not know about it—is a square, handicap-accessible tub; sometimes very quiet. There, two times when you can’t go: to a.m., and also 10 to 11 p.m. So, right now, you shouldn’t go to the upper tub—choose one of the others.</p>
<p>Is that clear? Can you remember? Thank you—it spares us from talking about it more. I’m glad you have 23 hours—just one hour reserved.</p>
<p>The rest of us have been here 25 or 30 years, don’t worry—you’re here, it’s special for you. We want you to have as much as possible. We also want to thank Chris for his wonderful, inspiring, profoundly transformative work, his writings, and this conversation—especially disclosing and meaningful. So, thank you, Chris, and applause.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: You’re wonderful. Truly, I can’t tell you how much it means to come here, spend time with you, mix it up, listen to what you say and do. You’re an extraordinary group of people. My heart is deeply touched.</p>
<p>Interviewer: About the question—</p>
<p>Chris Bache: This has been a recurring and deepening theme in my psychedelic work, spanning many years. I wrote a big part of it in the “Great Awakening” chapter of <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, but the work kept going after that. In the last three sessions—I didn’t know it was the end, but it was—the universe gave me three final installments, and one was the capstone of a series around the evolutionary project and the future human. It’ll be in my new book, and maybe I’ll make this particular session available to your group—I’ll give it to Rick or Robert to share. It was absolutely, profoundly disorienting: death, dismemberment—not just reality ripped apart, but total shattering, even by the seventieth session, when you’d think nothing could surprise you. But this installment finished the teaching on what’s coming forward.</p>
<p>This is taking place at the deep level of the collective psyche. We all live our lives, die and are reborn, over and over, inside a kind of cradle—the archetype of the human species, as it stands at this moment in history. What’s happening is that this cradle is about to shift. The fundamental underlying structure of the human psyche is about to change, and the entire baseline of what we die into and are reborn into is about to change.</p>
<p>When we make this transition—and we all will, in some form—we’ll feel it, we’ll participate. It’ll unfold over multiple generations, but we’ll each partake. As this exquisite new being comes from our historical womb and walks the earth, we’ll look back on all the pain of our past—from Homo erectus through all our history—all the suffering, all the loneliness, all the terrible things we’ve done to each other, and we’ll say: it was worth it. This being is the most exquisite, beautiful being.</p>
<p>Picture humanity with its heart completely healed, whole again in a way it has never been, with a mind radiantly strong, not fragmented, not torn by conflict. Completely transparent—of the earth, green to its roots, yet in easy communion with the intelligence of the universe. Heaven on earth, for such a species.</p>
<p>Of all the blessings that this work brought me, to glimpse what history is in the process of creating is among the greatest. The sessions told me: you have to write more about the future human. When it gets dark, if you don’t have a vision of what’s coming, of what’s being born through all this pain, you’ll get lost in the pain. Humanity may get lost in it. But if you have a vision, a deep sense—even one you carried into this incarnation—it’s essential to hold onto that. Deep in your bones, know that everything you’re investing in is part of bringing this forward with the universe, and it will happen. The old has to die for this magnificent being to be born.</p>
<p>This is a species of Buddhas, Christs, Prophets. This is when the feminine is fully healed and reconciled with the masculine, giving unprecedented access to the blessings of cosmic intelligence—absolutely embodied. No more ‘up and out’ cosmology, no escapist theologies, no Bardo. The Bardo is in the process of emptying itself—it’s a temporary condition in the evolutionary saga, and as we become more integrated, we no longer need that buffer. This is, admittedly, one person’s limited view, but I think we all feel some part of it. It’s much bigger than any one person can see.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

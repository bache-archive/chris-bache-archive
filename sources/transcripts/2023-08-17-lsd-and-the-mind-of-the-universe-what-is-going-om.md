**Abstract**

Veteran broadcaster **Sandie Sedgebeer** welcomes philosopher and

transpersonal scholar **Christopher M. Bache** to discuss his book *LSD

and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*. Bache recounts a

20-year journey through 73 high-dose LSD sessions inspired by Stanislav

Grof’s protocols. He explains how the work evolved from personal healing

into a collective purification, opening him to vast fields of suffering

and ecstatic revelation, culminating in encounters with the

“diamond luminosity” and visions of humanity’s evolutionary future.

Bache describes the birth of the “diamond soul,” a coming planetary

crisis that will catalyze a species-wide rebirth, and the role that

carefully guided psychedelics can play in individual and collective

transformation. The conversation explores reincarnation, the Bardo,

ecological collapse, and the emergence of a spiritually awakened human

species.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** Welcome to *What Is Going OM*, where we explore new

thought from the edge of OM. Today’s guest is Christopher M. Bache,

professor emeritus of philosophy and religious studies and author of

*LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*.

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** Thank you, Sandie. It’s a pleasure to be here.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** In 1979 you began a 20-year exploration of your

mind using high-dose LSD. Had you known it would involve such intense

pain, bliss, and decades of integration, would you still have done it?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** I might have taken a gentler path—balancing LSD

with psilocybin or ayahuasca—but I would still have answered the call.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** You followed Grof’s high-dose protocol. How did you

choose 350-500 µg as your range?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** Grof’s research at Spring Grove showed that

range could trigger near-death–like experiences. I wanted efficiency,

believing I was clearing personal karma faster. I later realized the

work was far bigger than personal healing.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** When did you see it wasn’t just about you?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** After two-and-a-half years I was plunged into

oceans of collective suffering—thousands of lives over millennia. It

became clear the sessions were purifying the species psyche, not merely

my own.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** You stopped for six years, then resumed and picked

up at the same depth. What did that reveal?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** The intelligence guiding the work never left.

My first session back resumed the collective suffering exactly where it

had paused.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** The pain sounded unbearable. Why keep returning?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** For the joy beyond the pain. Suffering was the

gateway to revelatory communion with the universe. *Italic brackets*

mark it for clarity.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** One pivotal session shattered your male identity

by immersing you in lives of many women. Purpose?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** It broke my gender fixation so I could enter

states where male and female are irrelevant.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** You taught philosophy but stayed silent about these

experiences. How did that affect you?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** Eventually the split choked my voice; I would

literally bark when I suppressed answers drawn from my sessions.

*italic brackets*

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** Let’s talk Bardo. Your journey went far beyond

classic maps.

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** I confirmed multiple Bardo layers where souls

process lives, yet I also touched domains outside the Bardo—the diamond

luminosity: a blindingly clear light that dissolves karma instantly.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** You reached it only four times in 26 late

sessions. Why so rarely?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** Each contact triggered a year of further

purification before I was ready to return.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** You received visions of a planetary crisis and the

“future human.” Describe that.

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** Humanity faces a species-level death-rebirth

catalyzed by cascading ecological collapse. On the far side emerges the

diamond soul—a spiritually awake species incapable of harming any being.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** Will psychedelics aid that transition?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** Used wisely, they accelerate healing and

revelation. The current psychedelic renaissance must pair science with

indigenous wisdom.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** Have you fully integrated your 73 sessions?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** No. The universe told me, “Twenty years in,

twenty years out.” Integration may span lifetimes.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** What’s humanity’s most urgent task?

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** Own our shadow, restore communion with the

living universe, and nurture the birth of the future human.

**SANDIE SEDGEBEER:** Chris, thank you for sharing this extraordinary

journey.

**CHRISTOPHER M. BACHE:** Thank you, Sandie. *italic brackets*

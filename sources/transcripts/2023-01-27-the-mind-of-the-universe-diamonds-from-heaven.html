<p>Aviv Shahar: 
Central to the Portals project is the inquiry about the future and the evolutionary change underway. We seek to perceive what is emerging at the edge of the human experience, to decode and integrate insights about how we humans are evolving through this liminal transition. Chris Bache is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years, and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. Chris is the author of The Living Classroom: Teaching and Collective Consciousness; Dark Night, Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind; and his third book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven, where he describes his 20 years of intensive work through 73 LSD sessions.</p>
<p>In the interest of transparency, I have never touched LSD, any psychedelic, or any mushroom. My own 42-year journey to unlock universal human potential was centered on the premise that the human brain, when we are open to the blessing realms, is the most advanced chemistry and pharmaceutical production unit in the universe. I’ve applied my spiritual and developmental search in ways that promote naturally arising states and inner conductivity. We are not here to recommend that you should do anything. I’ve invited you, Chris, because of your rigor and focused inquiry, and your account, where you frame insights and perspectives that are of great interest as we seek to appreciate what is emerging at the edge of human consciousness. Chris, welcome.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thank you, Aviv. It’s a real pleasure to be here with you today.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
You have already lived several lifetimes in this one life. You’ve had a full academic career, you’ve published three books, you’ve raised a family and three children, and alongside all of this, you’ve done this intense 20-year research work. Let me first ask: what is the portal you are in right now? What is the inquiry you’re working on at this time?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
When I published LSD and the Mind of the Universe—or, as I prefer to call it, Diamonds from Heaven; that’s its name for me—I felt I had accomplished my life’s work. After a long career teaching as a philosopher of religion, this was my most important gift to the history of philosophical inquiry into the deep structure of existence. It brought a tremendous sense of closure and relaxation. Since the book came out about three years ago, I’ve been content to follow it into the world and engage the conversations people want to have around the issues it raises. I don’t have an agenda or a felt need to achieve anything.</p>
<p>I moved to North Carolina in the last three years, so I’ve been doing a lot of yard work—hands in the soil and all those basic things. I have children and grandchildren I love to stay in touch with, though they live farther away, so that takes some work. I’m growing old in a comfortable place. I am cultivating a form of spiritual practice that builds upon the systematic remembering of the experiences I had on the 73 days covered in my book. Those are living memories for me, and I’m experimenting with how to use them to more deeply absorb and integrate the realities I touched very intimately on those session days.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
We’ll pick up this thread, which is fascinating. You’re describing a condition where a memory is not frozen in time; it’s a living stream of intelligence that continues to inform you in the here and now. In his foreword to your book, Irwin Laszlo writes, “This is one of the most insightful and significant books I have ever read. But to understand its significance, one must be willing to entertain three premises: A, there is an intelligence behind the things that exist in the universe; B, there is purpose exhibited by this intelligence; and C, it is humanly possible to access some elements of this intelligence and learn some aspects of its purpose.” Given where you are now, how is this deliberation unfolding for you in terms of your belief and feeling about these premises—that the universe is an intelligent place, that there is an inherent or latent purpose, and that we as humans have the capacity to unpack, connect, or decode?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Those premises are absolutely foundational to my lived reality these days. The worldview I was educated in during graduate school—the early 20th-century scientific worldview—sees the world as a fantastic machine with no innate intelligence. Intelligence is a lucky accident that sprung up somewhere along the way. Our existence is accidental, not purposive, and when we die—when our brain ceases to function—our consciousness disappears. There is no existential meaning or significance to our lives.</p>
<p>All of those assumptions were overturned in my psychedelic work. By dissolving into the deeper levels of my own mind, I opened beyond my personal existence into the mind of the universe itself. Repeatedly, over many years, I came into communion with an intelligence that was profound—extraordinarily brilliant and vast beyond imagination, and compassionate beyond measure. Returning to that intelligence, drinking from it, being willing to undergo very challenging processes of initiation, and always being rewarded with deeper intimacy—this is the reality I live in now. The universe is saturated with intelligence at all levels I can see and at levels I can’t. Intellectually and emotionally, I live in a world of genius unfolding itself systematically over vast epochs of time.</p>
<p>It’s also a world in which humanity’s participation in this creative endeavor is not limited to a single lifetime, but continues lifetime after lifetime through what we classically know as reincarnation. Larger still, our entire species, the development of this planet, this solar system, this galaxy—are all part of an exquisite, purposeful, systematic unfolding of the creative power of this intelligence. I hesitate to call it God or the divine, because I know how those words have been used and constrained across cultures. While there is much that is good and beautiful in those terms, many aspects are limiting. I prefer to speak of the creative intelligence of the universe—the intelligence behind existence and the intelligence inside existence, expressing itself in the complexity of life.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
In many ways, you’ve just given us the condensed preview of everything we are about to unfold, which is beautiful—exactly what I hoped we could do: give people a sense on the front end of what we’re about to explore. You described three layers: first, making contact with this intelligence; then appreciating it through communion—a fuller, whole-person experience; and then, deeper inside, discovering compassion and intimacy. You say the universe is interested in our experience of it. Why do you believe that is the case?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Part of my experience reflects a classic teaching in some Eastern traditions: the essence of the individual is the same as the essence of the totality—Atman is Brahman. Our nature is the nature of the divine, which is the nature of reality itself. So it’s not completely accurate to frame this as a duality between me and It. At a deeper level, my being is a fractal manifestation of Its reality. Our relationship is deeply essential and mutually participating from the start. But functionally, in terms of Chris Bache, I am so small and It is so vast that there’s a relative duality involved. And between my small bit and the totality are layers upon layers. It’s a very complex, organic system of massive scale.</p>
<p>To your question: as I went through my practice—psychedelic initiations and cycles of death and rebirth, which we can talk about later—I would spend hours absorbed in communion and dialogue with this intelligence. As I began to get smaller and return to normal shape and size—there was a window that would open and stay open for hours, and then close—I repeatedly had the sense that this intelligence was so pleased to have the opportunity to share, to commune, to convey—not just with me, but with humanity as a whole. After 13.7 billion years, we are just getting able to begin to embrace the scale of the universe’s intelligence. For all that time, this intelligence has been creating this magnificent garden and holding it while we evolve slowly to the point where we can begin to become aware of what it has been doing. It seems pleased to share consciously what it has previously been constructing unconsciously.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
The idea of seeing ourselves as a fractal of the whole inside a nested, interpenetrating reality carries powerful propositions. It says that as I change in myself, as you change in yourself, because we are a fractal of the whole, we in some way facilitate and catalyze a bigger change. We are participants in this unfolding, gigantic story you describe.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Absolutely. We are participants. We are an expression and continuance of the creative process, and we are learning to be more and more conscious generators of that process.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
Would it be right to say that when we contemplate the universe being interested in humanity, it’s a form of the universe’s interest in itself—its own evolution—that it comes to experience through its beloved human “I”?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think so. That’s a widely held insight in many mystical traditions: a deep collaboration. This intelligence is interested in its expansion, and we are, in some ways at this point in time, one of the cutting edges of its expansion—its learning.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
Let’s begin to explore the journey. You describe in Session Six the “vast community of explorers.” You write, “I experienced explorers in different fields of learning as part of a vast cooperative enterprise.” What do you believe about—and how did you experience, then and now—this community of explorers? I get the visual sense of people in different domains at the cutting edge of discovery.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I was first trained as a historian and then in philosophy of religion. I spent years studying great thinkers in these fields, so I had a real sense of great beings who have contributed to the tapestry of learning I inherited. This session helped liberate me from a felt sense of responsibility to the intellectual lineages I had been educated into. It was as if I was above the Earth, watching these beings through history make great contributions to art, literature, science, philosophy, and theology. Normally I would be intimidated by genius, but here I felt myself as a young learner entering the company of older learners—the fellowship of learning.</p>
<p>Then I was given a survey of all the knowledge I had acquired through college and graduate school, and a series of lessons that taught me the incompleteness of that knowledge. I was shown a new way of doing philosophy opening in my life with this work. I believe psychedelics represent a revolution in the way of doing philosophy—not just in insights into consciousness, but in method.</p>
<p>The new way is to systematically expand the boundaries of experience and enter non-ordinary states of consciousness—something humanity has done for thousands of years through meditation, yoga, and transcendence, and also psychedelics. In my case, psychedelics. Pay very careful, critical attention to what happens; come back and record the experiences precisely within 24 hours; reflect on and integrate them; connect them with bodies of knowledge in other disciplines; and compare them with the experiences others are having in these states. By systematically expanding and contracting consciousness in this way—not just having interesting experiences, but intellectually digesting and internalizing them—we can begin to think about, understand, and talk about things that previously most human beings could not. Only the most sophisticated mystics in esoteric traditions had access to some of these domains. With psychedelics, handled responsibly and conscientiously, even a person of modest means can access these realities and begin to understand some of the workings of the universe revealed through these states. As our mind changes its sensitivity, we can experience different aspects of the cosmos—like sliding along the color spectrum to reveal a different world of color.</p>
<p>This session gave me intellectual permission not to try to prove everything to the satisfaction of my peers, but to begin a new methodology in philosophy that might not be recognized for generations and would take the rest of my life to carry out. That’s why I did 20 years of psychedelic exploration and then spent another 20 years digesting those experiences before publishing Diamonds from Heaven.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
Would it be correct to say that in any pathway to altered states—however we frame what we contact—it still depends on the frame of reference cultivated before? In your case, your studies and work in philosophy and religion provided inner scaffolds for translating the experience. If someone else arrived through an adjacent experience but with different scaffolds—different inner topography—they might interpret their experience differently. How would you restate what I’m sensing there?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Good point, and important. It’s not just whether they would interpret their experiences differently, but whether they would have different experiences because their conditioning was different going in. This is a discussion I’ve had with Ken Ring, one of the founders of near-death research and author of several books. He and I published our dialogue around this in an article called “Are deep psychedelic experiences trustable?” Do they simply reflect the conditioning of the personal or collective psyche, or do they actually go beyond one’s conditioning and give us access to something truly veridical about the universe?</p>
<p>I want to honor both sides. I subscribe to what some call a participatory model of spiritual experience. These experiences are not like apples hanging on a cosmic tree that anyone can pluck. It’s a more complex dynamic. My conditioning was shattered again and again as I took this journey. For people who work systematically with these states, in the beginning conditioning strongly colors and shapes the process. But after several years, you reach a point where you move beyond conditioning—even from birth forward. Your entire physical existence collapses, and in that collapse one moves beyond territory you’ve ever known intellectually.</p>
<p>My academic background helped me understand what I was experiencing, but it did not structure it. I often wished I had PhDs in physics and astrophysics to better conceptualize some of what I was being shown. Instead of picking an apple from a tree, I think of it like this: the mind of the cosmos is an infinite lake of potential, capable of giving us infinite varieties of experience. Our mind acts like a seed catalyst we drop into this infinite potential, catalyzing a certain response that reflects that seed. As we internalize the experiences, we undergo purification and transformation that changes our individual consciousness. Later, when we return to the lake, the seed we drop has been changed and it precipitates a different set of experiences out of its infinite potential. That’s a participatory cosmology. Our consciousness doesn’t dictate what emerges, but there is a complicated feedback process. The more we do this, the more new frontiers open far beyond anything we could imagine and even against many things we’ve been taught. Then comes the task of making sense of what we experienced. These experiences are sequential—like exploring new territory—one leading to another in a complex, overlapping manner. In the end, you have to examine the structure of the whole trajectory, like assembling a giant jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
You describe the foundation of teaching that finds you in Session 16, which you call “self-generating fields of experience.” You write, “We are self-generating fields of energy in a living universe. We generate energy by making choices, and the universe responds to this energy.” That’s what you were describing with the lake. “We are always creating our own experience,” and, “We control the flow of energy out from and back into our lives. What comes to us from without originates from within. The more one moves toward one’s center and engages the deeper levels of one’s conditioning, the more one becomes conscious of being the source of one’s experience.” I suppose that insight continues to evolve with you. It’s a powerful synthesis of the human journey whether you do psychedelics or not, because it’s true in day-to-day consciousness. You don’t need an altered state to realize you’re the catalyst of what the universe brings to you.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Absolutely. I hope what I’ve shared in this book is useful to people who never take a psychedelic. In the end, psychedelics are not critical. My understanding is that psychedelics—particularly LSD, which I used—are amplifiers of consciousness. They don’t give you specific experiences. It’s not a hallucinogen in the sense of giving false visions; it amplifies consciousness. How you use that amplified consciousness—how you caretake it, protect it, isolate it, internalize it, meditate with it, and engage your mind during those hours of hypersensitivity—determines the quality of the perception that emerges from that dialogue.</p>
<p>Many people have written to me saying, “I’ve never taken a psychedelic in my life. I’ve been meditating for 40 years. I understand what you’re writing about. It parallels my experience.” Yes—because it’s not about psychedelics. We’re exploring the nature of consciousness to reveal deeper truths of its own being and of the universe. The idea that we are self-generating fields of experience is ancient. It’s at the core of karma and rebirth: we are a learning system. We are born in circumstances of our choosing, of our destiny. We make choices in response to those circumstances; we learn; and in that process we are changed. When we die, that process continues. What I experienced was an escalated, intensified vision of that ancient teaching.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
You then describe a “cosmic tour.” You say that for several hours, the consciousness that accompanied you took you on a tour of the universe to show you its work, and that it brought an overwhelming sense of homecoming. What did you discover about the universe through this tour, and what was the sense of homecoming?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
This was my 19th session. By this time, I had been several years into the work. I had gone through ego death and entered what I describe in the book as the ocean of suffering—the hell realms of the collective psyche, where it stores its most torturous memories of the species’ history. I had navigated that, and as grace for having volunteered to participate in healing some aspect of the collective psyche, the universe gave me many gifts. One was this cosmic tour.</p>
<p>I wish I had degrees in physics to better conceptualize what was shown, but over and over again, I was taken to see aspects of our cosmic reality and was overwhelmed by the genius, intelligence, and intentionality of it. I was taught a lot about reincarnation—patterns not just of individuals but of the dynamics of collective reincarnation. I was shown formation structures of galaxies. I would go through a succession of death-and-rebirth processes internal to this tour, moving into deeper levels of ontological simplicity. I experienced progressively deeper quiet—quiet beyond any I had imagined—suffused with homecoming.</p>
<p>At one transition I entered an extraordinary peace, an extraordinary homecoming, and was overwhelmed by sadness that we had lost contact with this innate quality of our own being at this cosmic level. I asked what had happened, and the consciousness accompanying me said, “We left time. We never intended so many to get caught in time.” It was as if linear time was simply one of the universe’s experiments. Moving deeper into home also meant moving beyond the conditions of space and time. This was not only a tour of the physical universe, but of the levels of reality behind the universe that give birth to space and time. We come from these realities; our substance is made from them. We participate inside the divine creation of space and time as spiritual beings rooted in spiritual realities.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
We’ll get further into both the divine reality and the cycles of death and rebirth. But just to pick up where you started—the sense of suffering you described—stepping back, what do you understand to be the significance of suffering in the evolutionary process? Why is suffering part of evolution?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
That really is a core question, isn’t it? It’s deep, and hard to answer without preparing the ground, so I’ll take shortcuts and ask your listeners’ indulgence. During the same period of the cosmic tour—when I was being given a crash course in Cosmology 101—I was taken back to what appeared to be the beginning of creation itself, the beginning of time and space, and I experienced an overwhelming love saturating me. It was a cosmic love. Then I witnessed the birth of space and time and all of evolution taking place inside this love, held and guided by it.</p>
<p>Because of earlier experiences, I knew evolution involved tremendous suffering—not only for humanity but up and down the evolutionary line. Focusing on the human race, I knew history and how much harm we had done to each other, how much the planet had done to us, and how much suffering was involved. In this experience, I encountered all that suffering as something humanity had taken on by free choice—free choice motivated by the divine love behind creation—so that the suffering inevitable in an evolutionary project stretched across billions of years was not something being done to us. It was not a punishment, not inflicted, not the work of demonic forces. It was a burden we had consciously chosen in order to participate in this creative project.</p>
<p>Why is there so much suffering? There are layers of response. One is that we make choices—good and bad—and we inherit their consequences. But I think the answer goes deeper. To understand why human beings suffer, we need some understanding of what a human being is and, more importantly, what a human being is becoming. We are not finished as a species. We’re just beginning. We only developed sufficient consciousness to reach our minds down to the source of our own mind about 5,000 years ago. We’re going to be evolving for millions and billions of years; we’re just getting started. Much of the suffering inherent in human existence has to do with the unfinished nature of our evolutionary process.</p>
<p>There will come a time, I’m sure, when we have sufficient consciousness and self-control to wash disease out of our bodies through complete control of our minds—but we’re not there yet. We will be capable of so many things we are not capable of now. What we’re going through is not only a learning exercise; it’s the building of a more advanced human being, just as Homo sapiens is more advanced than Homo erectus and our ancient primate ancestors. So the deepest answer to your question—what is the role of suffering in evolution?—is that it’s a burden we take on voluntarily to participate in the joy of creating the universe, of creating our species within it, and that in the end it benefits us. It’s like the suffering a woman takes on when she gives birth. She knows it’s coming. She does it voluntarily. It’s terrible—truly horrendous—but when she holds her child, it’s worth it. I think that’s true for evolution too. There will come a time when we will have evolved to a point where we look back on the entire history of pain—not diluting it or denying it—and say it was worth it in order to become what we have become.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
So a central ethos is recognizing we’re involved in an unfinished project—evolution. The universe is an evolving, unfinished project. You make potent points about the cost of existence and of the physical universe, and the appreciation that the visible universe contains only a small part of the whole. Scientists describe some of those dimensions as dark energy and dark matter—which, I intuit, will prove a crude, primitive definition compared to what will be discovered once we reintegrate the greater realities of consciousness and human possibility and escape the idea that the universe is a machine that just reproduces the same. You’re making a crucial point: the universe is not a trap, not a punishment we’ve fallen into, and there is purpose inherent in the totality of life—the continual transformation and growth. Given that, and whether through psychedelics or other altered states, what else must we understand about the relationship between the universe at large—the physical universe—and us as agents at the leading edge of this process?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
You’re asking good questions. Let me step back and put this in context. All the religions of the last 5,000 years—the Axial Age—came into existence when we first began to get beneath individual consciousness and tap into spiritual consciousness, the consciousness of the universe or the Divine. The religions of this era, both Western and Eastern, are examples of what I would call an up-and-out cosmology. I understand their intention: when you experientially touch your divine essence, it is so ecstatic and blissful—so much more satisfying than physical existence—that how could you not think you belong there more than here? So the theologies born in this period are theologies of return. They basically say we don’t belong on Earth; we belong in heaven. Somehow, through misfortune or punishment, we’re here, but what we should do is get out of here and go back there—whether through Western concepts of salvation or Eastern concepts of reincarnation leading to moksha, escape back to spiritual paradise.</p>
<p>The whole agenda of the Axial Age religions is to achieve catharsis that allows you to abandon time and space and return home. But that leaves open the fundamental question: what is the purpose of time and space, of the entire created order? When we thought the universe might be only 6,000 years old, you might justify an up-and-out cosmology. But now that we know how big, old, brilliant, and filled with genius our universe is, the idea that spiritual fruition should result in leaving the physical universe doesn’t ring as true or as powerful.</p>
<p>I think we’re growing up enough to recognize that first vision as incomplete. The next step after waking up to one’s divine nature is recognizing the co-participation, the co-existence, of divinity and physicality—physicality itself as an aspect of divinity. That opens the possibility of waking up and then bringing heaven to earth: bringing the ecstatic experience of heavenly consciousness into time-space reality, shaping the physical world to be a reflection and embodiment of spiritual paradise. That’s where emergent, embodied spirituality becomes important. It’s not escapist; it’s embodied. And psychedelics, if they give us sensitivity, are not about getting up and out; they’re about going more deeply within, to bring it in, deeper and deeper. If that speaks truth, the question becomes: how do we do this? Now we’re talking practicalities.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
Before we transition, this Axial vision of two worlds shows up in different religious texts. You’re narrating, in your experience, an updating of that theological-cosmological view when you describe two cosmic beings—one with the nature of a he, one with the nature of a she. You describe the feminine cosmic being as devoting itself to the creation of time and space and physical manifestation, and its partnering intelligence holding the other part of that compassionate communion of love. Describe that insight and how it builds on what you just narrated—that the next phase of evolution is those two parts of the cosmic process integrating and interpenetrating, liberating each other from their loneliness.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I want to be careful and remind us that a finite mind does its best to give cognitive structure to transcendent experiences. What I’m about to describe is a heuristic: a splitting of the divine principle into two halves—a “male” half that stays outside time and space in a transcendent position, and a “female” half that manifests time and space and the physical cosmos. I don’t literally think in male/female terms, but this is the best my mind could do. The principle is what matters: not all creative intelligence manifests as physical reality. Some holds position outside physical reality. There is a spiritual reality that gives birth to physical reality.</p>
<p>My experience was that, as we are growing up through thousands of years, millions of years of evolution, we’ve reached a point where physical reality is sufficiently conscious to return to transcendent reality and enter into communion—not merger, but a consummating return. This return doesn’t lead to an up-and-out exit; it leads to the divine wedding—the deeper infusion of the transcendent divine and the immanent divine. I think of the transcendent divine as white light and the immanent divine as green energy. When the white and green fuse, we have awakened, resplendent physical existence with a consciousness that far transcends what we’ve known so far. We see this in the great mystics: absolutely grounded physical lives lived simultaneously with profound spiritual lives. From that perspective, the Buddhists say Nirvana is samsara—samsara being the world of form and Nirvana the world of transcendence—not two separate realities but coexistent in our lives. That is embodied spirituality.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
One way to describe this is that we’re engaged in the project of spiritualizing this world. We don’t need to go to another world to gain the spiritual experience; we’re in physical form to help spiritualize this one. Part of your report from these journeys is the validation that we’ve entered a time when you don’t need to be a high lama or special priest—this is an invitation for humanity at large, each in our own way, to participate in the fellowship of learning and become involved in the evolutionary project. I’d like you to describe the relationship between personal awakening and collective awakening—how you went through cycles of death and rebirth, their significance, and how they facilitate collective awakening.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
First, what I’m going to describe is my variation on an ancient Buddhist teaching. When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired. In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.</p>
<p>In my psychedelic practice, I began thinking this was personal transformation: purification, death-rebirth, personal healing and liberation. But after about two years—after a lot of personal cleansing, reliving my birth, and having my earth identity shattered—I entered a new cycle of intense purification that wasn’t personal; it was collective. It systematically got larger for two years until it included the experiences of hundreds of millions of human beings over thousands of years—periods of intense agony, suffering, and violence. At first I thought it was a deeper ego death, but it went on so long and involved so many beings that I eventually came to a new, challenging conclusion: in these sessions I was not working to heal or transform my individual being. I was being used cooperatively to heal and transform my human family. The pain I was engaging was not personal or even reincarnational soul pain; it was the pain of humanity’s history lodged in the collective psyche, just as personal pain is lodged in a personal psyche. Somehow, by becoming as large as these sessions allowed, I could take on this suffering and digest it—just as earlier I had taken on and digested my personal suffering.</p>
<p>As a result of making this choice and allowing it to happen, the universe not only took me deeper into its pain—which lasted about two years and reached a crescendo before ending—it then took me deeply into a spiritual awakening process that was again not personal but collective. It began to take me into the future, into what I came to call deep time, not as an individual but as a field of energy encompassing large swaths of the collective psyche. Repeatedly I experienced that there is no ultimate membrane between the individual and the collective, between the individual and the species. Everything the individual is becomes a distillation of something going on in the species, and the species is the collection of what’s happening in its individuals. Pick any issue a person is working on; they wouldn’t have it if it weren’t part of a pattern touching many lives in the human family.</p>
<p>So the work of spiritual transformation of the individual and the work of spiritual transformation of the collective are intertwined. There are relative boundaries, but no absolute ones. In my book Dark Night, Early Dawn, I describe this in terms of the dark night of the soul—traditionally an intense purification before the mystic awakens. I was pointing to the dark night of our collective soul: humanity as a whole going through profound purification, which I think is leading up to a profound spiritual awakening for humanity. Many have said this: we are past the age of the individual’s enlightenment. We either awaken as a species or we’re going to lose this planet. My work has been about collective transformation more than personal.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
Implicit in this insight is that anyone can choose to work on their individual struggle or healing and, devotionally or by frame of mind, recognize that this work is a contribution to the whole. If you make that internal inclusion, you become part of the fellowship of learning and healing—you opt in to the evolutionary project.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
You are in the evolutionary project whether or not you recognize it. You’re hardwired into it. But if you recognize it, you can consciously participate, and that deepens and enriches the process.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
As the journey continued, you moved from the personal to the collective to the archetypal and higher-archetypal dimensions. Describe those realms and these cycles of death and rebirth in that discovery.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
After two years of working in what I called the ocean of suffering—and receiving blessings and insights I described as an initiation into the universe, Cosmology 101—the suffering reached a culmination, a kind of collective breakthrough. Then it spun me into a level of reality that was stunningly old—ancient—and for the next year and a half it kept bringing me back, progressively. Every time I entered that reality, what was stunning was how ancient and more real than physical time-space it was. That’s very disorienting—to experience a reality more real than physical reality. It shattered me, and I had no choice but to yield to it.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
Part of your struggle must have been: how do you stabilize these insights and awarenesses when you need to come back to teach in the classroom and be a family man?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Wherever I was on Saturday in my inner work, on Monday I was back in the classroom teaching. That was grounding, and it’s crucial: if you’re going to go deep, you have to be grounded—a lifestyle committed to grounded practice. For me, that grounding was my family and my students. But it is difficult.</p>
<p>Every time you break through to a new level of reality, it’s cognitively confusing. You don’t understand what you’re experiencing at first, and when you write up your description, it has gaps and fragments. If you return again and again, your mind adapts and you become more capable of coherent experiences there. Early write-ups may have holes, but with repetition those are filled in, and you get a more complete picture. This is part of cultivating the philosophical discipline required for coherent, sustained experiences of deeper levels of reality.</p>
<p>The second part is that deeper levels of reality function at higher levels of energy. When I transitioned into archetypal reality, I went through huge purification—dissolved into white-hot lava, plunged into burning suns—tremendous fields of energy burning more and more out of me. If I hadn’t gone through that, I wouldn’t have been able to maintain coherent consciousness. You literally have to become a being that can live at that level for hours at a time, even temporarily, to have coherent cognition there.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
The principle you’re describing applies not just in psychedelic experience but in any developmental journey. To embrace larger, more potent realms, several processes must take place. You’re rewired on the inside—different circuitries in the brain and energy field activate. Then, engaging higher potency, purification is needed—releasing residues of the previous infrastructure. The universe is a compassionate, loving actuality, but not a socialistic environment; it’s a gradient with levels and dimensions. They can interpenetrate, but there are containers whose sanctity and fidelity must be retained. If we are to enter these realms, our systems need rewiring and updating to manage that. And 51% of the work is stabilizing what you were exposed to. That’s how I’d translate what you shared through my lens of a non-psychedelic but cutting-edge spiritual and developmental journey.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Absolutely. This is a variation of a universal pattern: if you want to open to deeper truths and a deeper participatory relationship with the universe, you have to empty yourself of everything keeping you small—old ways of thinking and feeling—and those patterns have biological correlates. You go through detoxification—physical as well as mental and emotional. In Tibetan Buddhism, before receiving higher teachings capable of generating awakening, one must first do what’s called NDR, the preparatory practices—five practices you do 100,000 times each. One is full-body prostrations while reciting mantras. You’re going to the ground, lying down, getting up, praying—retuning your mind with mantras, your heart with devotion, and working your body to purify it while purifying mind and heart. That’s how it is for all spiritual practice. If psychedelics push you quickly into a higher state, you then have to purify after you’ve been in that state.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
You either need to pay on the front end, during, or after.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Pay now or pay me later, but you have to pay.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar: 
One distinction I’d make, and I’m interested in your comment, is that some of those Buddhist practices emerged in ancient times. Humanity has now entered a universal environment where you may be able to go through an accelerated journey—not just the way you’ve done it—because, in metaphoric or actual terms, the universe has drawn nearer to the human realm. That’s part of the epochal shift we’re experiencing. Because we’ve entered the phase of collective awakening, in one lifetime we may be able to go through an accelerated journey, especially when we engage not through the lens of the individual but as part of humanity’s evolutionary project.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
If you open your individual life—whether through spiritual practice, psychological transformation, or even engaging disease in your physical body—to this larger collective landscape, then you participate in this evolutionary project in a new and intense fashion. If you’re engaged in social transformation—working for social justice, for true equality in healthcare delivery systems, and so on—with a conscious understanding that this is the time we must change our culture, change our historical practices, let go of the divisions of the past, and lay a foundation for a future that works for all its citizens, not just some, then that too, even if you’re not meditating or doing inner practices, is part of this larger deep transformation.</p>
<p>I think you’re right: many spiritual practitioners and visionaries across different lineages are coming to the same conclusion that everything is speeding up, that our evolution is accelerating, and humanity is approaching a critical pivot point, a bifurcation point, a point of critical instability. We either grow up or we probably go extinct. We cannot continue to manage the planet with the lower level of consciousness we’ve operated from in the past. We have to achieve a breakthrough of depth and breadth to grow into the species that’s been gestating inside us for thousands of years.</p>
<p>I understand this in terms of reincarnation. We’ve been reincarnating and learning bits and pieces over many lives. As the world tries to become an integrated whole, we’re dealing with problems whose magnitude can’t be solved locally; they must be solved globally. Likewise, intrapsychically, we’re bringing together all the lives and karma from our previous incarnations. We have lived in every race, every religion, every nationality. All those lives are inside us. Where the world has torn itself apart—nation against nation, race against race—those divisions also live within us. As we become whole, we fuse that history into one integrated being. In that process, we support humanity as it fuses its past into one integrated being, giving birth to what I call the diamond soul—fully awakened soul consciousness.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar 
Before we get to the diamond revelation and experience, what bridging will you offer? You’ve framed a way to view the meta-crisis unfolding in every aspect of life on the planet as a living, initiatory crucible of this evolutionary project—forcing us to realize we can’t do it on our own and must come together. What else—what other scaffolds—do you want to put there before we explore the sense of diamond luminosity?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
What I share doesn’t come from an intellectual basis or books I’ve read—I wish I could give you footnotes and the documentation academics love. I have to speak only out of my spiritual experiences, my psychedelic experiences. Over the course of a long journey, I was plunged into a series of initiatory visionary experiences. What I shared just now is what was given to me, shown with consistency: that humanity is entering a critical time, a critically unstable bifurcation point; that the world is entering a global crisis driven by cascading ecological crises; that these crises would hit again and again, causing profound breakdown. Many wise people see it coming and fear an extinction event—that we won’t survive what’s ahead.</p>
<p>My experience as a visionary in the psychedelic condition is that this is not what will happen. We are entering a time of acute suffering and dismantling, a surrendering of the past, but in that process we will give birth to something extraordinary—not just a new civilization or culture, not just new economics or green production. We are literally giving birth to the next form of the human being, the future human. I couldn’t have made this up. This vision began in the early ’90s and culminated in 1995. It was given not merely as a vision of what will be, but—after great work—by being taken into what I call deep time, into the future, into whole time, where I experienced humanity’s transformation as what has happened. Not only what will happen, but also what has happened.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar 
Where time is nonlinear, you could be in those different positions and experiences concurrently.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
For me, that’s the basis for saying this is an initiatory event, not an extinction event. We will go through it. We can go through it clumsily, awkwardly, dragging our heels; or we can go through it cooperatively, with vision and foresight, and accelerate our way through it. Or we can fight it and make it worse. That’s our choice: we either get dragged through or we walk through with elegance. Do we go forward with vision, or do we try to hold on to the past, to a time when things were easier and made sense? Or do we forge ahead into a new future?</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar 
This must have been, as you’ve described, a profound realization—one you had to stabilize and contain to operate in daily life. You communicate it with power and passion while also conveying that it’s not about jumping on rooftops and screaming. It’s about containing and giving birth to the realization of these extraordinary, shape-shifting events unfolding on the global stage—these theaters of experience through which the individual, the collective, the archetypal consciousness represented by the human experience can be transformed to become participatory in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Exactly. When I had the culminating breakthrough—after years of visions—and experienced the death and rebirth of humanity, it took me about a year to recover. It was so powerful. As I say in the book, it was like walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb was dropped. I felt profound compassion and deep respect for every person I saw, because my understanding was that each of us chose to incarnate at this time, knowing what we were getting into—knowing it would be very difficult. There are no victims here; there are only saints, only volunteers who have chosen to participate. Every person—regardless of political differences or anything else—deserves my complete respect because they are a soul who has chosen to participate in this historic transformation.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar 
And then you were led into the diamond luminosity and its discovery. Describe that transition, please.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I have to back up a little. I went into archetypal reality—let’s skip over the details—and then through another death-and-rebirth process into what I came to call causal mind, a condition where everything is one: all the diversity of life pulsing as a single totality. It was an overwhelming, absorbing experience of fundamental oneness. My boundaries dissolved completely—not only personal boundaries. From this perspective, there were no boundaries anywhere in the universe; we are all aspects of this fundamental oneness. I experienced what the Buddhists call shunyata—emptiness, transparency. In another session I was taken into the cosmic, fertile void out of which the universe emerged, an experience of overwhelming cosmic love. That went on for a year—extraordinary blessings—and I was completely satisfied, philosophically and spiritually.</p>
<p>Then I went through yet another very intense death-rebirth. When I came through it, I was taken into a consciousness of clear light. I had known light many times before—light had appeared in many death-rebirth processes—but this was different: an exceptionally hyper-clear luminosity. I came to call it the diamond light, the diamond luminosity. In the Buddhist literature I know best, I believe this is Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality—a light so clear it eventually becomes invisible, crystalline in its clarity. In that clarity is an ecstasy that goes beyond bliss, beyond any ecstasy associated with form, because this is pure formlessness.</p>
<p>Once I touched this, the only thing I wanted was to return. After that, everything else becomes insignificant. Over the next four years and 26 sessions, I returned to the diamond luminosity only four times—about once a year. Between those visits were sessions of intense purification. In the middle of that cycle I had the experience of the Great Awakening—the death and rebirth of humanity. So the diamond luminosity work began, then came the experience of the future awakening of humanity, and then two more years with two more initiations into the diamond luminosity. In the first two, I went deeper and deeper into it. In the last two, the diamond luminosity pressed deeper into my physical body and mind. I experienced it remaking me—almost at a cellular level. I don’t understand the process, but it was infused into my body. Eventually it changed not only how I think and feel; in my last session it gave me a brief glimpse of a change in my vision. For about ten minutes I saw a hundred times clearer, more refined than ever in ordinary consciousness. It wasn’t a hallucination; it was what I came to call diamond vision. Then it disappeared, and I was back to ordinary clear vision.</p>
<p>That’s when I began to understand that the future human we’re giving birth to is not only a human with a healed and expansive heart, and an open mind in deeper communion with the universe, but a human who lives physically differently. Our senses are not simply biomechanical processes; they are functions of the level of consciousness we hold in the body. Our vision is capable of much more refinement—so are our hearing, taste, and touch. When we talk about bringing heaven to earth, it’s not merely a pleasant social harmony. We’re talking about weaving and activating divine consciousness inside the body so that the body becomes profoundly satisfying, capable of far more refined sensory experience—not just emotional or mental.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar 
What you’re describing, building on everything you said earlier, is that the universe is interested not just in altered human consciousness. It wants that consciousness to permeate all levels of physical reality so the universe can experience through us—the sensory portal, the mental portal, the embodied experience—at a richer, higher-fidelity, higher-quality level.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Yes. I would add that it’s not only so it can experience through us—though I’m sure that’s true—but that it’s sharing with us the gift of its capacity. It’s literally cloning itself, sharing how it experiences life with us, growing us so we can incarnate and embody its experience at deeper levels. It’s an act of generosity.</p>
<p>Aviv Shahar 
Chris, this has been a fascinating exploration. I appreciate that you’re able to narrate your experience, integrate it with your teaching and spiritual practice, and speak to it from the extemporaneous experience of this moment—being a conscious being on this tormented planet as humanity passes through very difficult transitional events. What makes the difference, as Viktor Frankl taught, is that in the most difficult circumstances, if you carry a different logotherapy—a different reason, purpose, awareness, recognition, and insight about what you are undergoing, whether it’s illness or pain or the greater planetary situation—there is a difference. Do we experience what we experience merely personally, or do we experience the personal dimension while merged inside the greater actuality? That search, inquiry, and struggle is part of the spiritual work of this time, which you discovered through psychedelics. My experience is that it’s accessible in the day-to-day tasking of life—being a parent, a spouse, a teacher, a leader—and asking: How can I make the higher choices? How can I be a better version of myself? How can I find resources to transcend a moment of conflict, to metabolize and transmute being triggered—using it as a trampoline to engage a higher, cosmic, universal dimension of life? That’s the invitation I hear in your narrative.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Absolutely. Psychedelics are incidental—they’re simply how I encountered these principles. One can encounter them in many forms and contexts. As we enter the dark night of our collective soul—which I think has begun and will get worse—we’re going to hear all sorts of interpretations: that we’re being punished, that it’s the end of time, that we’re plagued by demons, or that this is a deserved punishment. It’s important to hold a deep vision of what is being produced in history—a vision of the future human we are giving birth to inside ourselves and collectively.</p>
<p>Imagine a woman giving birth who doesn’t know she’s pregnant and doesn’t know anything about labor—what a horrible day it would be. If she understands she’s giving birth to new life, it all coheres. To see the intelligence and compassion of the universe, you have to look very deeply. On the surface, the universe doesn’t appear compassionate or even intelligent; it can seem brutal. To see that compassion, you have to understand existence at a very deep level. As we enter this time—particularly this century—we have to be capable of looking very deeply. When we do, we cooperate with the process of transformation. It doesn’t require psychedelics. When we participate and cooperate with the challenges in our immediate life and find our way to the highest choices—the greatest good for the greatest number—we feed into a good outcome for the delivery of the future human, both in our lives and in the lives of our children, grandchildren, and future generations.</p>

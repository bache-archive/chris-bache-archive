<p>Jessica DiRuzza: 
Welcome, everybody. I'm Jessica DiRuzza from Trust Psyche, and it is such a pleasure to spend this Sunday together. This is our free monthly Trust Psyche livestream that we host every first Sunday of the month. All are welcome, so please invite your friends. We feature a variety of speakers on a myriad of topics, and you can find out more about us at trustpsyche.com. You can sign up for these livestreams at trustpsyche.com backslash live stream to participate live and ask your questions. If you value what we do, the best way to support us is by subscribing to our YouTube channel, liking this video, and sharing it with your friends.</p>
<p>I’m very honored and excited to present our guest speaker today, Chris Bache, who’s going to be presenting on his forthcoming book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven, released this November 26. You can pre-order your copy today through Amazon.</p>
<p>Up until the 1700s, humans believed that the edge of our universe ended at the planet Saturn, the last visible planet we can see with the unaided eye. With the invention of the telescope, we turned it to the heavens and, to our great surprise, discovered the planet Uranus, twice as far out as Saturn. Our universe doubled in size. Then in the 1800s, with the discovery of Neptune, our universe again doubled in size. Then in 1931, with the discovery of Pluto, our universe doubled yet again—and now, less than 400 years after the discovery of Uranus, the Hubble Deep Space Telescope shows us there are trillions upon trillions of galaxies in our universe.</p>
<p>For me, this is analogous to the work Chris has done in his deep exploration of consciousness—radically breaking open our cosmology, philosophy, and metaphysics through the 73 high-dose LSD sessions he undertook over 20 years, which he began to share in his work Dark Night, Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind. Now, with LSD and the Mind of the Universe, Chris takes us further into diamond luminosity and brings back the diamonds from heaven that he so graciously shares with all of us today. There couldn’t be a more important time for Chris to share his work—both in the greater understanding and acceptance of psychedelics today, and because of the psycho-spiritual death and rebirth our collective human species seems to be undergoing right now. Please help me give a very warm and loving welcome to our beloved friend, Chris Bache. When Chris is done speaking, you’ll have an opportunity to ask your questions, so please have those ready—that’s our favorite and most special part of these livestreams. Thank you so much for being with us today.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Hi everyone. Thank you, Jessica—and thank you, Travis. Thank you for this opportunity to share my work with the participants in trustpsyche.com. It’s truly an honor. It’s also an overwhelming task, because this book covers so many dimensions of consciousness and so many years of work. When I talk about it, I naturally get absorbed into the experiences I’m describing, and that makes compressing 20 years of work and 20 years of thinking and writing into a short presentation really challenging. To me, a talk is the most effective way to get to questions and answers. I’ll try to keep this contained and as brief as I can, then save a good half hour at the end for Q&amp;A—maybe even more.</p>
<p>A little background. For those who know me—and for those who don’t—I’m the last person you’d expect to have written a book on psychedelics. I was raised in the Deep South, in Mississippi, in a middle-class Catholic family. I wanted to be a seminarian priest early in my life and was in the seminary for three years in high school. I studied theology at Notre Dame, New Testament criticism at Cambridge, and philosophy of religion at Brown. By the time I finished graduate school, I was an atheistically inclined agnostic, and the ’60s had completely passed me by. I was not psychedelic-involved in college or graduate school at all. I was psychedelically naive and philosophically agnostic. And then came LSD.</p>
<p>Shortly after beginning my career, I met the work of Stan Grof, and that set my life on the course I’m still harvesting today. I’ll use a few slides for about 10 minutes and then shift in and out of them. This is what the book will look like, and I’ll tell you a secret: this is the publisher’s title, LSD in the Mind of the Universe. My title is Diamonds from Heaven, because Diamonds from Heaven is a story of a journey. The publisher wanted a more marketable title, and that’s LSD in the Mind of the Universe.</p>
<p>The beginning of this book goes back over 40 years. In 1978, when I began graduate school, I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work. His book Realms of the Human Unconscious turned my life around, followed quickly by LSD Psychotherapy. He gave me the method and the confidence to explore my consciousness and, through that exploration, to come to know the deep psyche—the deep universe—better. I want to emphasize I did this work as a philosopher. I was not a therapist. I wasn’t primarily seeking healing—though healing did come—but seeking to understand our universe as deeply as I could by exploring my consciousness as deeply as I could.</p>
<p>A few observations on method. Many are aware of the distinction between low-dose psychedelic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy that Stan developed. Low-dose therapy peels the mind gradually, layer by layer, in very intense therapeutic encounters. High-dose therapy is a different protocol. In the early days, it was used to try to trigger a near-death experience for people with terminal cancer—not to heal them, but to open them to the world they were about to enter.</p>
<p>When I began my own work, I chose high doses of LSD, partly because it was difficult to arrange a full day of inner journeying in a dual-career marriage, and I wanted to make the most of each day I could put into this. I thought of myself as doing an extended regimen of psychedelic therapy—just for longer. Originally, psychedelic therapy was limited to a maximum of three sessions. I thought, if you can do three sessions safely, you can do more safely. Looking back, I came to appreciate that what happened in my work was different enough from standard psychedelic therapy that it needed a new language. I chose the term psychedelic exploration. The protocol is the same—isolation, headphones, music, total protection with a sitter—the difference is the number of sessions involved. In my case, 73 high-dose sessions between 1979 and 1999. I worked for four years, stopped for six years for reasons I describe in the book, then resumed for a very intense 10-year process. I did this between ages 30 and 50. I’m now 70, and I’ve taken a long time to present this work candidly to the world—partly for legal reasons and partly because it took a long time to map and understand the dynamics that unfolded.</p>
<p>I want to say at the outset this is not a methodology I would recommend today. If I were doing it over, I’d be gentler on myself. I’d take a slower process, balancing high-dose work with low-dose sessions. I’d also balance LSD with psilocybin and ayahuasca—more body-grounded psychedelics—for a variety of reasons I discuss in the book.</p>
<p>I tried to do this work as systematically and rigorously as I could. As a philosopher, it was a high priority to make a complete and phenomenologically accurate record of my sessions within 24 hours, then study the dynamics across sessions and compare my experiences with those reported by other psychedelic journeyers. Here’s a snapshot of my journal—about 400 pages of psychedelic notes that, for me, are my personal Bible. They are the record of my deepest experiences of the universe and therefore, in my life, they come before all other discursive thinking and analysis. I kept detailed records all the way through. I also studied the astrological transits of my sessions. I was aware of Rick and Stan’s thinking about the relationship between the outer planets and global transits and how they affect one’s work in deep non-ordinary states. I wanted to test this hypothesis and see how my sessions mapped against the solar system’s rhythms during those years.</p>
<p>The story I’m telling in LSD in the Mind of the Universe is not primarily a personal story. In one sense it is, but in another sense it’s not. Imagine a series of sessions: after the first 15 or so, insights and help for my personal life tended to come at the beginning and end of sessions, as I was leaving and returning to time-space reality—small circles. During the peak hours—large circles—I was usually operating beyond my personal reality, beyond Chris’s reality—not entirely, but largely. The story I’m telling is what unfolded in those peak hours. It’s primarily a cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. The personal details matter in a therapeutic narrative, not so much in a cosmological one.</p>
<p>In this work, what unfolded was a multiple series of deaths and rebirths. The line represents the border of time-space; the drop below the line is egoic reality—our individual time-space consciousness. The first death and rebirth, the one most discussed in the literature, is ego death when we transition from ordinary consciousness into early transpersonal consciousness. But if you keep pressing the limits, there are other deaths at other levels of consciousness. I follow Stan Grof in using the vocabulary of psychic, subtle, and causal reality to describe some of these deeper levels. I don’t have a vested interest in how many levels there are or how many times the circle turns. What’s important is the principle: if one pushes deeper and does this work systematically, a series of deaths and rebirths opens.</p>
<p>These circles oversimplify, of course, but they mark a progressive deepening into causal-level reality—circles within circles, deaths within deaths. Looking over the entirety of my work, I identified five fundamental death-rebirth processes—levels of consciousness where death and rebirth were operating. First, the death of self: the death of our time-space identity and sense of who and what we are, moving into collective mind. There are three chapters dealing with the dynamics of collective mind—the ocean of suffering and deep time. Then archetypal mind—experiences at the high archetypal level and at the lower archetypal level—followed by immersion in causal oneness. Oneness surfaces earlier in the sequence, of course, but there is something distinctive about causal-level oneness. Finally, the diamond luminosity work: after everything that had taken place, emerging into the diamond light that Buddhism calls Dharmakaya. I call it the diamond luminosity.</p>
<p>Let me quickly list the chapters: there’s a methodology chapter, and then, in terms of content, Crossing the Boundary of Birth and Death; The Ocean of Suffering; Deep Time and the Soul; Initiation into the Universe; The Greater Real of Archetypal Reality; A Benediction of Blessings; The Birth of the Future Human; Diamond Luminosity and Final Vision; and the last chapter, Coming Off the Mountain. It took me a year to write that last chapter, reflecting on what has been happening in my life in the 20 years after I stopped my psychedelic work. I’ll touch a few points in each chapter and then open it up for questions.</p>
<p>First, Crossing the Boundary of Life and Death—the most familiar, thoroughly described in Stan Grof’s literature. This took about two and a half years and 10 sessions to navigate. My work became saturated with confrontations with death—fetal sensations, severe perinatal seizures, purging—eventually culminating in ego death. For me, ego death involved a complete reversal of everything I knew myself to be. I was a white male academic, a philosopher passionately concerned with the meaning of life. I became the complete opposite: I became women—women of color, women not interested in philosophical reflection at all. It was a terrifying experience, but when I let go and allowed myself to become all these women who were so different from me, I entered the world of women and was given the experience of hundreds and hundreds of women under the arm of the Great Mother. It was truly life-changing. I wish every man could have that experience.</p>
<p>When I went through that death and rebirth process and continued to work, I entered into a domain of suffering and pain and agony—collective pain and suffering—so severe I came to call it the ocean of suffering. Working at these levels, every session had two phases: first, a purification phase; then an ecstatic phase. The purification phase would be some type of profound, cathartic engagement. If allowed to continue to its culmination, there would be a crescendo, a breakthrough, and then the session would pivot to an ecstatic portion for the remainder. The ocean of suffering describes the purification phase of the next two years of work—tremendous suffering. At first, I thought this was a deepening of ego death, that pieces of my ego were still in play. But eventually, because it continued so long and was so severe, I came to a different conclusion: somewhere along the line, these ordeals weren’t really aimed at my personal transformation at all. The focus had become the purification and healing of some aspect of the collective psyche—pain and suffering lodged in the collective unconscious that, by engaging consciously, could be lifted out, lightening the karmic burden our species carries.</p>
<p>I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn primarily to understand how death could become as large as it became in my sessions. By integrating Rupert Sheldrake’s concept of morphic fields into Stan Grof’s paradigm, the way opened to viewing these experiences as part of a larger transformational practice aimed at the collective psyche.</p>
<p>In the ecstatic portion of these two years of sessions, I entered what I call deep time in the soul. I began to have experiences of my life as a completed whole—from start to finish—with all the moments, themes, people, and circumstances simultaneously present. I was given a profound crash course in Chris Bache’s life—what it was about, who the people were, what it was going to be about. The first time I entered this reality, it was the most powerful and transformative experience of my life, and yet I couldn’t remember it afterward. I couldn’t hold onto transtemporal experiences of this magnitude because there was no reference point in ordinary consciousness to anchor them. But going back again and again, I found I could hold onto them more effectively. I was able to remember and bring more back.</p>
<p>This is important: if you want to enter these states and cultivate systematic recall, you have to work with discipline—engage them conscientiously, record them conscientiously. If you hold the position well, you literally learn how to stay conscious in states where previously you couldn’t. This pattern repeated: every time I broke through to a new level, there was a period of disorientation and memory loss; but by returning over and over, cognition, perception, understanding, and recall improved.</p>
<p>The ocean of suffering lasted two years and 14 sessions, divided into one year of work, then a six-year break, then a resumption. After the break, the ocean of suffering picked up exactly where it had left off—six years later, with completely different life circumstances and astrological conditions. Nevertheless, my sessions began exactly where they had stopped, an indication of the intentionality of the intelligence guiding our work. After the break, the ecstatic portions began at a completely different place: what I came to call initiation into the universe. I was taken systematically by an intelligence that never adopted any form, but was intent on teaching me how the universe functions. It was cosmology 101.</p>
<p>I give every session a name that reflects its pith content and break it down in bullet points. The sessions discussed in this chapter include: You and I Creating—a crash course in cosmology; The Cosmic Tour—an extraordinary tour of the universe; The Council of Elders—a training session in maintaining coherent consciousness as deeper levels opened; Dying into Oneness—an extraordinary immersion into oneness; The Master Plan—the beginning of visions that appeared to reveal the plan the creative intelligence had for the evolution of the human species at this point in history; and Healing the Collective Wound—the culmination of the ocean of suffering, an almost indescribable magnitude of suffering that, when it reached its crescendo, spun me into archetypal reality. The ocean of suffering never returned in future sessions. There was suffering, but never again that collective suffering reflecting the history of our species.</p>
<p>After the initiation into the universe, I entered archetypal reality. This lasted about a year and a half and 11 sessions. This reality was immediately recognized as more real than physical reality. Every time I entered, I had the sensation I was entering a reality more existentially real than time and space. It became disorienting to realize how diluted and watered down reality is inside time and space.</p>
<p>As I entered this work, my human identity began to fall away. We have a sense of being human that is deeper than our sense of being any individual human; ego death is the death of our individual experience of being human. Entering archetypal reality required letting go of human experience at a deeper level. Eventually, I could no longer fit myself back into any cognitive frame of reference related to Homo sapiens. I entered a level beyond human consciousness and was systematically worked with, given lessons on how reality operates.</p>
<p>These experiences broke down at two levels. At the high Platonic, high subtle level, I encountered beings beyond my ability to conceptualize. My mind imaged them like galaxies—vast beings that were the creators of time and space, the creators of life on this planet, the guardians of existence, the massive constitutional forces that create everything we know as time and space. At a lower, more Jungian level, I was given many experiences of the collective consciousness—our collective psyche, our collective unconscious—and even a kind of collective body that our bodies are cells within. I was given exercises in the nuts and bolts of how reality works—how our individual minds are selves within a larger mind, and how our individual bodies are cells within some fundamental core archetype of the human body—so that when we heal diseases in our individual body, we simultaneously impact the health of the human family’s larger body. The list of the sessions that I address in this chapter,</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The 28th session was an extraordinarily positive, ecstatic session in which I broke through and touched causal-level reality for the first time—an extremely clear, lucid, hard-to-describe state of hyper-clarity. Then I was quite surprised to go through three sessions of gut-wrenching cleansing—an ordeal of physical-psychological purification with absolutely no cognitive content. In time, I realized there’s a cycle I came to call the cycle of purification: every step into a deeper level of consciousness is a step into a higher level of energy. When I first broke into causal-level reality in the 28th session, the purity of that reality triggered a purification process in my being that lasted three sessions, extending over six months. I found this pattern repeated as I continued to go deeper. Every time I broke into a new level of consciousness and had that ecstatic experience of waking up in a deeper level of reality, the following sessions were very difficult—full of cleansing, carrying out the garbage—so much so that I began to dread the sessions that immediately followed major breakthroughs.</p>
<p>I should mention that one of the things that opened at this level was experiencing reincarnation as a collective phenomenon. Those who know my book on reincarnation, Life Cycles, know the story I tell there is of our individual evolution over many lifetimes, reflecting our individual choices and learning. But now I began to have experiences of the entire planet entering into a reincarnation process. I experienced millions of people over time—century after century—incarnating in ways that were integrated (not uniform), so that our individual karma, soul aspirations, and challenges were all part of the collective karma, collective challenges, and our collective development as a species. It was magnificently beautiful to witness this interplay between individual and collective reincarnation, taking place at the subtle level of reality when one is gauging the deeper architecture of the universe.</p>
<p>After spending about 11 months exploring archetypal reality—11 sessions, very quickly—I entered what I came to call the Benediction of Blessings, a period of extraordinary grace: one massive blessing after another. The four sessions I discuss in that chapter were: the first, an experience of śūnyatā—emptiness of self, no-self in me, no-self anywhere around me—radical transparency; The Birth of the Diamond Soul (I’ll come back to it); Singing the Universe Away, which culminated in the experience of satchitananda—consciousness, being, and bliss—eventually moving into the complete, fertile void that undergirds the physical universe; and Jesus’ Blood, an experience of extraordinary, cosmic love—love like I’d never known, soul-saturating.</p>
<p>I want to highlight The Birth of the Diamond Soul because it comes up later. In that session, I began to experience all of my former lives coming into me very fast, very quickly. Eleven years before, I had experienced my entire present life from beginning to end. Now, all my lives were coming in like wrapping kite string around a spool. At some point the spool ignited—as if we hit critical mass—and all these lives fused into a singularity. When they fused, an extraordinary light broke out of my chest—my first contact with what I later called diamond light. I think I was being shown how reincarnation works and where it’s taking humanity. Accumulating more and more lives is not just improving us one life at a time; eventually all of our knowledge and experience—everything we’ve ever done, everyone we’ve ever known—fuses, and we are catapulted into a higher operational status: a different relationship to the universe, greater transparency to it, and a different relationship with everyone around us because we’ve been connected for so many lifetimes. We’ve been fathers, mothers, enemies, friends, partners. When we become whole within ourselves, it opens a depth of compassion for all beings—human and more-than-human—on our planet.</p>
<p>After the Benediction of Blessings, the work went into Diamond Luminosity. I was completely existentially satisfied after the Benediction—asked to give something in the ocean of suffering, then repaid beyond anything I could have imagined. But then the Diamond Luminosity work opened. Before I get into that, I want to backstep and talk about the birth of the future human, a recurring theme in my sessions from the 22nd session all the way to the end: what is happening to the human race? Where are we in our evolutionary journey? In the book, I brought together in one place all the session material related to the birth of the future human. I gathered scattered experiences into two segments. First, the Visions of Awakening—six themes of our awakening—given piecemeal about where we are and where we’re going. What struck me was how dramatic this process is and how we are poised to make an evolutionary jump that would propel us into a higher order of functioning, not only as individuals but as a species. We are poised on the edge of a profound Great Awakening. In all of these visions—pointing to an awakening of the entire human species—the consciousness of our universe was trying to awaken us collectively. I was not shown how or even how it was possible.</p>
<p>Then, about a year and a half after the last of the Visions of Awakening, right in the middle of the Diamond Luminosity work, I was taken into the deep time of our species. I had entered Diamond Luminosity in sessions 45 and 50, and would again in sessions 60 and 66. In the middle, I was taken into the center of the Great Awakening we are coming into. There, I experienced this transformation not as an individual human being—my boundaries had been blown open so many times—but as our species. Inside the collective psyche, I was given an experience of what will be happening from the perspective of the collective unconscious. My experience was that for a Great Awakening of this magnitude, there must first be a great death, a great surrender. We must be purged and emptied of our old ways of thinking and feeling before the space is created for a higher order of knowing. So the time of Great Awakening is preceded by a time of great breakdown, loss of control—literally an unraveling of life as we know it. Just as in a psychedelic session, one must let go of everything and experience a profound death before great visions open. Likewise for our species: we must let go of everything that has dominated our past—the constrictions of mind and heart—in order to open to the new future that is coming.</p>
<p>There is a third segment on the birth of the future human that came later in the chapter on the final vision. My visions didn’t tell me how or when this would take place, nor details. They took me inside the collective psyche and gave me its experience of the transition, and an understanding of some of the mechanisms at the collective level that will help us make this huge transition in the little time we have. I discuss this in Dark Night, Early Dawn and again in LSD and the Mind of the Universe.</p>
<p>After the Benediction of Blessings, I had no idea where the work would go. I felt I had been drawn deep into the cosmic process, overwhelmed with cosmic love, taken into the fertile void beneath all physical existence. I didn’t know what was next, but there were still five years ahead. The Diamond Luminosity chapter gathers four years of work and 26 sessions—the most of any chapter. After yet one more intense death-and-rebirth, I was taken into what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality: a domain of consciousness of absolute, pure light. The most striking thing was how clear—clear beyond imagination—this domain was. Just touching it for a few minutes was life-transforming. It was beyond the species-mind, beyond archetypal reality, beyond any derivative of physical consciousness—into a hyper-clear, celestial state. Over the next four years, I entered this reality four times—only four out of 26 sessions took me deep into it. The session titles were Death State, Diamond Luminosity, The Universal Field of Light, and The Nature of Mind. In between, as you might imagine, there were many sessions of intense purification because this was a much more pure level of reality and required the purification of my physical and psychological system to stabilize consciousness there. Also scattered throughout, a great deal of personal healing took place—curious to me because I would have thought personal healing would have occurred earlier, but I came to understand why things unfolded in that order. The first two of these sessions took me deeper into Diamond Luminosity, peaking in the 50th session. The second two—60 and 66—saw Diamond Luminosity crunching deeper into my physical and psychological system, into my body.</p>
<p>Midway through—in the 50th session, the deepest transcendent experience I ever had—I was as far into the crystalline body of God as I had ever been or would ever be. Right in the middle, my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and I saw a reality far beyond even Diamond Luminosity. A ray of light came out of that distant reality and hit me, and it completely shattered me. In that experience, I realized there is no end to this journey. There is no destiny point one eventually reaches. The Divine is infinite, and even using a powerful method, I will never reach the absolute ends of that reality. This is important because many of us absorb the idea that there is an endpoint: you become one with God, or enter the meta-cosmic void, and you keep pushing until you reach that endpoint. I had experienced oneness with God, but discovered there are many permutations of oneness—levels and levels of it. I had experienced the formless void, but learned there are dimensions—depths—of formlessness. When Diamond Luminosity opened, it came with such a profound sense of homecoming that I thought I’d found my destination, my stopping point—the end of the journey. Session 50 showed me there are dimensions beyond even that, and I would never reach some final standpoint. The reason death kept returning in this work is that if you keep driving yourself, and you have a method sufficiently powerful to keep taking you past your limits, the universe will keep taking you deeper into yourself, into itself—and you will never reach the end. If I were doing this work again, I’d be gentler with myself. Now I understand the goal is not to get to some ultimate dimension. The goal is to open to transcendent realities and let as much of that spiritual reality into our hearts and minds as we can—to let it change us down to the heart and soul, to incorporate as much as possible, bring as much divinity into time and space as we can—and be patient with the rest. I’m more patient now than I was as a young man.</p>
<p>This brings me to the Final Vision chapter. I was put through a horrendously powerful strip-down, taken deeper into deep time than ever before, and given an extraordinarily powerful series of visions about human evolution. I was allowed to experience the future human we are becoming—the inner architecture of the deep psyche of the future human. This is a magnificent being. Just remembering the magnitude of this being brings tears to my eyes. It’s important to hold the vision of where we’re going and what is happening in the deep structure of history, because as the shadows of our travail deepen—as we enter the great unraveling, the purification we are coming into—it will be tempting to listen to voices speaking of Armageddon, apocalypse, extinction, the end of times. This is not the end of anything. This is the process of giving birth to a new and finer version of humanity. After this, the consciousness guiding my sessions wrapped it up. I didn’t know we were stopping, but it took me through two “goodbye” sessions, and at the end of the 73rd, I knew it was time to stop.</p>
<p>Very briefly, coming off the mountain: overall I think I did a good job integrating my sessions as I went. I paid attention to my body, took good care of it, did spiritual practice, wrote my sessions down carefully, tried to internalize them as deeply as I could. Because I’d been given so many gifts and blessings, I thought I could simply stop and step back and continue to be nourished by those experiences—and I was. But that’s not all that happened. In the years following the end of my work in 1999, I gradually entered a period of what I call the deep sadness—a profound existential sadness. I was suffering from a loss of communion with the Divine. I had entered so deeply into the luminous reality of supreme, super-cosmic divinity that I knew I would not enter that deeply again before I died. I had to stop my sessions for various reasons; it was important to stop. But not being able to return that deeply became an open heartache. Once you have known the joy of dissolving into Divine Light—into the boundaryless condition transcending time and space—life on Earth can feel dried up. I was losing interest in continuing to live in time and space. Eventually I realized I was just waiting to die—caring for my children, teaching and writing—but in my heart of hearts, waiting to return to my Beloved. Years passed. I realized this is not right; this is not the way it’s supposed to be. Everything in my life was screaming “failure to integrate.” Because I had tried to integrate each session so carefully, I didn’t understand where the failure lay. But I had to recognize something had gone wrong to leave me feeling so existentially adrift. I turned back to study my work to figure out what had happened and learned that integrating an entire journey is different from integrating individual sessions.</p>
<p>It’s hard to describe the process of, in a sense, having too much God. Surely more of God is always better. The entire physical universe is the body of God—I knew that. But even that knowledge didn’t save me from the consequences of entering full divine presence so many times. In time, I realized I had lost a balance in my sessions—between transcendence and immanence. I had entered so deeply into transcendent reality that I lost my foothold in space-time reality. Transcendence is magnificent—healing, sane-making. It teaches us why we’re here. But too much transcendence can be disorienting. It can make you lose contact with another great truth: our embodied existence. I made a strong commitment to reestablish my presence inside time and space. It took about 10 years. I did it through conscious exercises and a sheer commitment to live where and as I was for my remaining years on Earth. It took about a decade to get solidly grounded and operational. I’ve learned to manage my memories of transcendence and communion. They’re always there in the back of my mind and guide the larger trajectory of my life.</p>
<p>Jessica DiRuzza: Yes, hello, and thank you for sharing this amazing experience. I wanted to ask two questions. First, when you say “high dose,” what doses are you talking about? And second, what was the setting? I work a lot with plants and I’m interested in how you prepared and conducted the journeys: were you sitting or lying down, eyes closed, music or no music, indoors or in nature? Also, in daily life, what helped you stay grounded—spiritual practices, exercise, food?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Good questions, thank you. I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms, which is a very high dose of LSD. Low-dose psychedelic work may be around 200 micrograms. My setting was always complete privacy indoors, either in my home or my wife’s professional office. I was always lying down. If you look at Stan Grof’s book, LSD Psychotherapy, you’ll see the protocol in detail. Music was very carefully curated to pace the opening and closing of the session. I always wore eyeshades. The only way my sitter would be in communication with me was through the music. She took care of my body and the music. I was not in nature.</p>
<p>Grounding practices are really important. Grounding is a dynamic balance. My life was grounded in relationships: a long marriage—my first marriage was 24 years—and my roles and responsibilities as a father of three children. Wherever I was on Saturday, I was back in the classroom on Monday, and taking care of my children on Sunday morning. Teaching gave me a rhythmic, constant set of responsibilities that kept me on track. I was always doing spiritual practice—meditation of different types over the years—and I took care of my body with yoga and various physical practices. It’s important to stay in lively contact with the physical world while doing this work. Basically, we’re blowing consciousness out to its farthest limits, and then it spontaneously recongeals. I seemed to have a natural capacity to let go of boundaries and then recongeal back into time-space reality. Does that cover your questions?</p>
<p>Jessica DiRuzza: One more quick clarification: did you always make sure someone was present and available to assist you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes. I was never left alone. My wife—Carol, a clinical psychologist—was my sitter. She never left me and took complete responsibility for our world. We were always isolated and in private. There were no interruptions. When we closed the door and entered this world, nothing from outside would intrude. That’s really important: an absolutely clear container. I call it entering the kiva—like in the Southwest, when they’d crawl into the kiva, pull up the ladder, and be completely isolated from the world. If you’re going to go deep into the universe, it’s crucial to have a grounded, isolated, protected environment, so you know that whatever you’re confronting—even horrendously difficult experiences—is not coming from outside. It’s coming through your own consciousness, from the universe itself. No outside complications. I did not try to stay in contact with the outside world at all.</p>
<p>Jessica DiRuzza: I have three questions about integration. First, the astrological angle: how did your individual chart and transits function as a lens—both for accessing subconscious parts of yourself and the collective unconscious? As you entered less individuated states, how much of the chart’s patterning remained operative? Second, any notable transits that especially correlated with breakthroughs? And third, when you were in the ocean of suffering, did the healing you did internally show up in your waking life—perhaps reflected back by people around you or even in world events? Any potent moments where you felt that external reflection of your internal work?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Let's start on your last question and then work forward into the earlier ones. Yes, it did manifest. There were manifestations that emerged in the outer world. Let me mention my book The Living Classroom, which has a chapter on teaching in Dark Night, Early Dawn. I never talked to my students about my work. I made a firewall between my professional life and my inner shamanic work, and yet over time I found that various students were being activated by my inner work. The deeper I went, the more powerful the activation became, and it became such a prominent part of my teaching that I had to understand what was going on. I had to learn how to work with these forces.</p>
<p>For me, integration doesn't mean simply personal integration into my personal life; it also means helping take care of all the derivative social fallout of one's own experiences. While I was teaching and reaching for examples to explain a point, the examples I reached for—without my being aware of it—were landing with students. They would come up after class and say, it's interesting you used that example because that's exactly what happened to me this week. This happened over and over again. Some boundary had come down between my mind and my students' minds. Not only were these synchronistic touches triggering aha moments—“isn't that curious”—but the deeper I went, the more they began to trigger very deep healing experiences in the students. It was as if their souls were in communication with my soul, giving me bits and pieces of insight into where they were, what they needed, where they were suffering and hurting. This was happening without my being consciously aware of the process at all. I really had to study this and understand what was driving these processes.</p>
<p>After Dark Night, Early Dawn, I wrote an entire book on The Living Classroom, on the collective dynamics in the classroom. I don't mention psychedelics there, because this is not a psychedelic phenomenon; it's about the nature of consciousness. At one level we have private mind, but just beneath our private mind, mind does not have privacy. There are collective dimensions of mind. It's like throwing a rock into a lake—the ripples spread out. When you do deep, deep work, the ripples of that work spread out and touch the lives of people around you. The place where I experienced this most profoundly was in my classroom, because I was working in a collective context and could see these ripples coming back at me all the time.</p>
<p>On the issue of astrology and individual and global transits, this is a complicated question, and I'm not an astrologer, so I want to be careful. I tracked my sessions. I used astrology to plan my sessions after I learned from Rick Tarnas about correlations between outer planets and inner experience in psychedelic states. I planned my sessions by transits, and I tracked the patterns of my breakthroughs against the planets. I found a very complicated correlation. While there were correlations between my individual transits and global transits with the unfolding of my psychedelic experience, there were also differences I wasn't expecting—a failure to find correspondence. For example, my breakthroughs were not always paired with Uranus. My really intense, up-against-the-wall, death-in-your-face experiences were not marked by Saturn transits or Saturn global transits, or even Pluto transits.</p>
<p>When my work began to go off the edge of time and space—when I began to enter deeper and deeper into archetypal reality, and then beyond archetypal reality into Dharmakaya or the Diamond Luminosity—I felt a roll-off of astrological variables. My psychedelic dance did not map easily into the astrological dance. I began to think there might be a roll-off effect between one's solar dance and one's session experiences. This continues to be an area of active dialogue and consideration for me. There is an appendix in the book called “Pushing the Limits of Astrological Correspondence.” In that appendix I give the dates of all of my sessions. If one wanted to, one can look at my natal chart, look at the sessions, and examine the correlations or lack of correlations. I know there aren't enough sessions given to provide a definitive answer, but I wanted to support discussion about the relationship between astrology, astrological and global transits, and one's own psychedelic work. To me, that's an open question. I know there are correlations, particularly in the early stages of one's work. Whether those correlations continue to be as strong in the later stages, I'm not as convinced.</p>
<p>In terms of my own chart, that gets complicated. I have a lot of Neptune and a lot of water in my chart. I have a Sun square Neptune with Neptune in the first house, and other dynamics. I was destined to do this type of work. I also want to mention the ocean of suffering. This was not something forced on me. I didn't understand it at the time, and I don't think the universe forces any of us into this type of work. It was too hard, too demanding, too difficult to have been forced on me. What I learned over time is that this is something I voluntarily took on in this incarnation. It was part of the plan of my incarnation to do this work, and to do the ocean of suffering work in particular. I'm a volunteer, and I think when we get into this deep muck, we're volunteers for this work.</p>
<p>I did not go into specifically identifiable historical traumas like the Holocaust. What happened was that I was taken deeper and deeper into pain and fury and chaos and extraordinary suffering that kept getting larger and larger. It wasn't narrowly focused in any century, country, or place. It expanded to include hundreds of thousands, millions of people, and it expanded to include hundreds and thousands of years, until eventually my subjective experience was that it included all human beings and all the conflicts in the history of humanity—something of that scope. I have no doubt that trauma like the Holocaust, or the extinction of Native Americans, and other tribal conflicts were implicitly present in what I was working with, but it wasn't explicitly present.</p>
<p>Stan has this concept of a COEX system, a system of condensed experience. I think the collective psyche also has these massive aggregates—these balls of collective experience—I call them the meta-matrices. They are the meta-COEX systems of the collective psyche that fuse multiple historical periods, cultures, and peoples' experience. Late in the series it became very clear to me that what I was engaging was memory—the living memory of trauma embedded in the collective psyche.</p>
<p>Where I live in Youngstown, Ohio, we haven't had a Holocaust, but we have a long history of violence. It goes back to Native Americans; there were massacres here. There's a tremendous influx of Eastern Europeans—this is a town that made steel. There's a lot of old-world patriarchy, a lot of violence against women, a lot of old institutional violence, and the mafia took over our town. For decades there were gangland shootings in neighborhood parking lots. My sense is that because the ocean of suffering was on the agenda in my work, I was brought to a place where these poisons run close to the surface in the collective psyche. I'm sure that if I were working in Poland, it would have been more explicit, the historical trauma you're referring to.</p>
<p>Thank you. I completely agree with what you described. As we go deeper into this historical crisis, I think we're entering into a collective dark night of the soul. It seems there's a profound detoxification taking place—the poisons of history are coming out of our collective pores. We see it in the body politic, and it's coming up underneath us and flooding. If we're interested in purifying and transformational work, when we open—if we have a technique that's powerful enough, like Holotropic Breathwork—we open at an individual level and then at deeper levels.</p>
<p>I'm not a therapist, but if I were working with people entering these states, I would do just what you described: differentiate the levels of work that emerge, recognizing what is mine personally and what is mine collectively. It's important to have closure and be able to close these collective levels, winding those sessions down, and concretizing the collective work separate from one's individual work.</p>
<p>I went into this work voluntarily and stayed in it voluntarily, and I'm infinitely glad—for personal reasons, let alone collective reasons. The rewards were not simply karmic paying back. When one opens and embraces one's life as a member of the species—opens to the species and takes responsibility for the pain and suffering of the species—it sets in motion not only a healing of that species, but a tremendous infusion of light enters the collective psyche and your psyche as it enters the collective psyche. I've been deeply rewarded, more than amply compensated, for the work I did in the ocean of suffering and other levels. I think this is true for others too: when we give deeply and generously to those around us, sooner or later—though we don't know when, how, or where—there is a deep fruition that rises up underneath us and carries us individually where the universe is intent on carrying the human species collectively, into the birth of a profoundly new quality of consciousness that I'm calling the diamond soul, or the future human.</p>

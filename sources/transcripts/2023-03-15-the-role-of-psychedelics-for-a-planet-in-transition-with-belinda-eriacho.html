<h1>The Role of Psychedelics for a Planet in Transition — with Belinda Eriacho and Chris Bache</h1>
<p><em><em>Marc Caron: ** Hello everyone, and welcome to this episode of Spirit Plant Medicine Presents. My name is Mark Caron, and I'm thrilled to share that today we're having a meaningful conversation about Steven Gray's new book, </em>How Psychedelics Can Help Save the World.</em> Our focus today will address the question: what is the role of psychedelics for a planet in transition? </p>
<p>I'm excited to introduce our first guest, Steven Gray—a long-time friend and collaborator in the spirit plant medicine space. Steven has been traveling a profound spiritual and medicine path for over 50 years. He is a writer, educator, conference organizer, and a facilitator for cannabis ceremonies. He has authored three books, including the popular <em>Cannabis and Spirituality: An Explorer's Guide to the Ancient Plant Spirit Allies,</em> and just recently, as mentioned, <em>How Psychedelics Can Help Save the World: Visionary and Indigenous Voices Speak Out.</em> It's always a pleasure to see you, Steven.</p>
<p>**Steven Gray: ** Thanks, Mark! I'm looking forward to our conversation today.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Joining us as well is Belinda Eriacho. Belinda is of Navajo and Zuni descent and was born and raised on the Navajo reservation in Arizona. She is a wisdom carrier, healer, and the founder of Kalaji, focusing on cultural and traditional teachings that impact Native American communities. We're excited to have you here, Belinda.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Great to see you, Mark!</p>
<p><em><em>Marc Caron: ** And of course, we have Chris Bache, professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he has taught for 33 years. He is also on the faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. Chris has written several books, with his most recent being </em>LSD and the Minds of the Universe.</em> Welcome, Chris. How are you?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I'm great! Welcome, everybody. It’s an honor to be here today.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Likewise, it’s always a pleasure to connect and learn from all of you. This work has been a passion for me, and the insights I've gained from various conferences over the years have truly made a difference in my life. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. We're going to get started with a question for our panel, and they will each answer for about five minutes. As we focus on the book, I’ll start with you, Steven. In your view, what is the role of psychedelics for a planet in transition?</p>
<p>**Steven Gray: ** Thanks, Mark. To clarify, while I was the editor and a contributor to the book, there are 25 other contributors, so my role mainly involved gathering these voices. I’m excited about the outcomes presented in the book, as all the contributors speak in harmony about the themes.</p>
<p>As for the role of psychedelics during this transition, they are not silver bullets; they carry potential for misuse and misunderstanding. Not everyone should take them—some may not be suited for psychedelics due to mental health issues. There are those who regularly explore these medicines, while many in the middle might benefit from using them on special occasions. </p>
<p>Using a medical metaphor, strong medicines are called for when the patient is gravely ill. We are at a crucial nexus moment on the planet where healing and awakening are essential. For me, psychedelics are reality medicines. They are not about escape; they can open us to profound understandings of our true nature. They can serve as truth serums, helping us uncover our blocks and awaken to what my former teacher might call unconditioned reality.</p>
<p>Psychedelics can help us glimpse the awakened states that feel more real than our everyday existence. </p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Thank you, Steven. Before we continue, let’s pass it to Belinda. What do you feel is the role of psychedelics for our planet in transition?</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Thank you, Mark. Before I answer, I want to acknowledge the land of the Phoenix area, home to the Akimel O'Odham and Pee-Posh peoples. I'm here as an invited guest on these unceded territories, and it's vital to recognize that history.</p>
<p>Regarding psychedelics, I prefer to call them sacred medicines rather than drugs. This perspective shifts how we engage with these substances. Everything we do transforms energy; we must respect these medicines. To me, psychedelics awaken us to our inner selves. As we face numerous global challenges, our spiritual aspect is beginning to unfold. </p>
<p>My metaphor of "turning of the soil" reflects this awakening. We often get trapped in a material perspective, forgetting our true selves. Engaging with psychedelics can help us heal and create resonance within ourselves, our families, and our communities.</p>
<p>I also reference the cycles of life in my culture. There is a rhythm to our existence, and psychedelics can help us navigate these cycles, including the difficult experiences that provide crucial life lessons. The prophecies I share in my chapter highlight the importance of unity, as the North symbolizes the mind and the South represents the heart. When we come together, healing can begin.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Thank you so much for sharing that, Belinda. Just a reminder to our audience that you can catch Belinda's talk from our Spirit Plant Medicine Conference in 2022 titled “Turning of the Soil,” available on our YouTube channel and membership portal at spiritplantmedicine.com. I highly recommend checking it out!</p>
<p>Now, Chris, it’s your turn. What do you feel is the role of psychedelics for our planet in transition?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** First, I want to affirm everything Steven and Belinda have said. We are indeed living in a unique time in history, characterized by shifts in the collective psyche. The current cultural migrations echo deeper transformations within us as the karma of our past is surfacing, seeking resolution. </p>
<p>This collective purification process is crucial, and psychedelics can help accelerate this internal healing. We often separate ourselves from nature and our spiritual essence, making it necessary to heal not just on a personal level but also on a collective and spiritual plane. </p>
<p>Psychedelics can guide us back to our roots, allowing us to reconnect with the intelligence that has orchestrated life for billions of years. This journey is not just about individual healing; it's about developing a deeper understanding of our historical narrative and our roles in it. This could lead to a cultural and psycho-spiritual renaissance, enabling individuals to reconnect with a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** That’s fantastic, Chris. As we unpack this transition we're facing, Belinda, you mentioned something important about language—the way we refer to these substances. Many people call them drugs, which adds a layer of stigma. What are your thoughts on this perspective?</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** I think what's missing is the relationship between us and the plants. In my culture, we refer to Ayahuasca as "grandmother," and we view these plants as ancient teachers that offer wisdom if we’re open to it. It’s essential to not position ourselves above these plants but rather build a relationship with them as equal partners in our healing journeys.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Exactly. It’s crucial to shift our understanding from seeing these as mere drugs to recognizing their value as medicinal plants. </p>
<p>**Steven Gray: ** I appreciate the term "inner standing" as well. It highlights a deeper comprehension beyond intellectual understanding. </p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** As we move forward, what do you think this transition looks like for humanity, Steven? </p>
<p>**Steven Gray: ** We're witnessing a breakdown of the past stability, and change is occurring rapidly across various levels. If material hardships increase, so too can anxiety and depression among people. It’s vital to convey messages of hope that suggest that despite seeming insurmountable challenges, there are paths toward awakening and healing that can lead to a mature, planetary civilization.</p>
<p>We must engage in intelligent, creative solutions, starting with understanding ourselves. It's possible to awaken to our deep interconnectedness with one another and the world, which is a gift we must cherish. </p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** That resonates deeply, Steven. Belinda, what do you see as part of humanity's biggest transition today?</p>
<h3>The Role of Psychedelics for a Planet in Transition — with Belinda Eriacho and Chris Bache</h3>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Thank you so much for that question. I was revisiting Chris's chapter and reflecting on some of Steven's insights. I tend to view things from a different perspective, particularly when considering what is happening to us and to many Indigenous cultures worldwide. Our elders have told us that these are just cycles we’re going through. Everything is evolving, and challenges can ultimately turn into gifts. It is up to us, as a human species, to think with our hearts rather than just our minds. There's been too much emphasis on intellectual thinking, and that’s part of why we find ourselves in the situation we are in. We need to transition to the mindset of the heart. In my book, I share a story from an elder who said that the longest journey we ever travel is the one between our mind and our heart—only 18 inches apart. This resonates with me deeply. </p>
<p>I'm reminded of stories my grandparents and great-grandparents shared, passed down through oral traditions, about how we perceive and create our reality. I see the children being born in this time as wise souls. Chris refers to them in his work as "diamonds," and I believe they carry an innate understanding to revive the teachings and traditions that many of us have forgotten while we focused too heavily on materialism. I believe this period is an evolution, a shift we must embrace as humanity. We may see some faltering along the way, but our understanding of psychedelics and sacred plant medicines can guide us into different timelines beyond our current reality. </p>
<p>Psychedelics offer us insights that can heal our relationships—beyond the physical realm—allowing us to connect with deceased relatives and mend those vital ties. Some of this relates to the evolution of karma that Chris discusses. My prayer is that as we observe our world's geopolitical and climatic shifts, we begin to ask ourselves what part we own in these issues. There’s a tendency to consider problems as external, but if we believe in our interconnectedness, we must take responsibility. This is where real action begins.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Absolutely my pleasure. I love what you just said, and I've heard it before: the longest journey we’ll ever take is the one from our head to our heart. I want everyone to really reflect on that. Are you living from up here? As another quote I like to share goes, “When you're in your head, you're dead; when you're in your heart, you're smart.” When you drop into your heart, suddenly answers come in a seamless flow.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** I might borrow that, by the way.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Yeah, absolutely! Lots of trading going on here.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** This is one way psychedelics are facilitating change in the world, right? Learning from one another, inspiring each other, and then sharing those insights. Chris, what transition do you see for society today?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** My understanding of the future is limited, so I rely on the same sources as everyone else: scientists and ecologists. I'm grateful, Steven, that you mentioned Dwayne Elgin. He’s been tracking the scientific literature for decades, and it is clear we are entering a period of enormous suffering. It's hard to overestimate this potential suffering over the next several decades. When we look at environmental issues—the melting ice caps, expanding population, climate destabilization—the potential for future pandemics, it becomes evident that we could face the death of one-third to one-half of the human population. Our current trajectory is leading us towards unimaginable agony for future generations, which may provoke the motivation necessary for change that we currently lack.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I believe we are past the point where we can avert the impending crisis. We might soften its impact, but it will come, and it will hit our children and grandchildren very hard. I view this global crisis as a birth process—painful, but not an apocalypse. It resembles a near-death experience; through our struggles, we may awaken to higher levels of consciousness. I don’t believe this transformation stems from human intent but from the driving intelligence of nature. Our role is to remain responsive and cooperative with this intelligence, embracing the changes it dictates.</p>
<p>From a reincarnational perspective, the people confronting this crisis are not simply current human beings; they have histories that span tens of thousands of years. Our collective journey, while filled with steps forward and backward, has been one of growth. However, currently, our collective psychological maturity is still entrenched in ego. The world we are witnessing collapse is built from this ego perspective, which, although beautiful, is fundamentally severed from our deeper interconnectedness. </p>
<p>We've constructed a world that elevates some at the expense of others. This shallow view leads to global catastrophe. To survive as a species, we need to shift from an egoic to a soul-centered consciousness. I believe as we come together, our psyches will also unify, giving rise to a new culture that operates on a higher consciousness level—the birth of the diamond soul, where our collective history integrates into a single, transparent consciousness. This transition cannot happen on a small scale; it requires the entire species to evolve. As we move through this transition, we must be ready for a more spiritually informed humanity. </p>
<p>As the mother experiences labor pain, she welcomes the beauty of her child at the end. Similarly, we are birthing a new form of humanity—more enlightened, compassionate, and spiritually awakened. One day, we will look back at this century of suffering and recognize it was worth it for the beauty that emerged.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Mark, can I add a little icing on that cake?</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Absolutely, Steven.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** That was incredible, Chris. I want to emphasize that necessity is the mother of invention. The intelligence and capabilities of humanity are limitless, especially in these pressing circumstances. I believe this challenging period—the painful dissolution—can be tempered by our increasing creativity and intelligence. As the reality of our situation deepens, our capabilities will reveal themselves. </p>
<p>Moreover, it's crucial to offer actionable, hopeful visions so that people do not succumb to despair as conditions deteriorate. Music, which has often been undervalued, may play an essential role in our evolution, helping many realize its incredible potential for healing and connection.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Thank you for that addition, Stephen. Chris, your metaphor of a mother giving birth, where pain transforms into pleasure, resonates deeply. It reminds me that as we face great change, many resist it. I believe embracing change facilitates growth. Change may be painful, but it is often necessary. We should see it as an opportunity for metamorphosis.</p>
<p>Belinda, what are your thoughts on what actions people can take to help with this transition?</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** I believe it's crucial to remember the importance of spirituality in this discussion. In many Indigenous cultures, spirituality is a vital component of healing. As we advance, we must not overlook this aspect, especially in scientific circles where discussing spirituality can be challenging. For many, it is the key to healing and wholeness.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** That connects beautifully to our disconnection from nature.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I’d like to add a footnote to what Steven said. In my visionary experience, I received a message that the pace of the future will outstrip the relevance of the past. We are entering a stage where our collective psyche will hyper-stimulate, leading to substantial changes swiftly. Under pressure, our individual contributions will become increasingly influential in shaping this transition. Soon, we will enter a period where humanity will be connected through a shared heart, diminishing the hurt we inflict on one another.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** That’s another beautiful insight, Chris. To add another optimistic perspective, I recall a saying: “There is nothing as powerful as an idea whose time has come.” As the viability of our current, disconnected system diminishes, it creates space for new visions to emerge.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Thank you for that. Before we wrap up, I’d like to ask each of you for a tangible call to action. What can individuals do to support this transformative process?</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** The metaphor that resonates with me is “stay behind the medicine.” This means quieting your mind, being humble, and dropping into your heart. As you do this, follow the golden thread to uncover the path forward—relax, trust, and allow things to unfold naturally.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Fantastic. Belinda, what’s your call to action?</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** I suggest we all look within and do the work we are called to do. This inward journey resonates outward, affecting families and communities. Each act of sacred activism, no matter how small, contributes to positive change. </p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Very well said. Thank you for emphasizing the importance of community engagement. Chris, what about you?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Aside from individual work, I'd urge us to remember that we’ve chosen to be part of this historical process. Each of us has the resources around us to play our specific role. The question isn't what we need to do but whether we will have the courage to act on what is ours to do. If everyone acts on their unique contributions, we can navigate this transition together.</p>
<h2>The Role of Psychedelics for a Planet in Transition</h2>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** I really appreciate that courage to push through, Chris. It's spot on—so many people stand on the sidelines, just watching. What we need is more understanding and compassion. As we navigate through our trials and tribulations, it's essential to put others' best interests at heart and not focus on what we can get from them. We often don't know what others are going through, so who are we to judge or criticize? When we step back and approach each other with love and acceptance, it can truly make a difference. There are people out there who don’t hear kind words often, yet we have the power to impact them with our actions.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** I think you meant understanding, not understanding.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Yes, thank you for that, Belinda. It's a powerful distinction. I want to thank all of you for being part of our conversation today. I always learn so much and feel inspired. Steven, your book is out now, and there’s a book launch happening at St. James Hall in Vancouver. Can you share a bit about that?</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Absolutely! Anyone who can walk, drive, bicycle, train, boat, or fly to Vancouver, we’d love to have you on the evening of April 7. Interestingly, we didn’t realize when we set the date, but it happens to be Good Friday, which adds a special layer of meaning. We’re framing this not just as a book launch but as an empowering celebration. Dennis McKenna is coming to say a few words, and while I’d love for more contributors to join, they’re scattered far and wide. After a brief intro, we’ll share a cannabis-friendly ceremony that serves as a meditation experience. It’s important to note that you’re not required to partake in cannabis to feel its benefits in this setting. Following the ceremony, we’ll have some fantastic live music by Chene Edgar and Curtis Andrews—it's hard not to dance to their music!</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Shine and Curtis are incredible. I know Chris would agree. If you were there at the conference on Saturday night, you missed out on a special treat! For those interested in attending, you can register for tickets at spiritplantmedicine.com/events, where you’ll find details and some sample music. Until March 17, we’re offering a 30% discount on early bird tickets, so if you want to join us, now's the time to save! We’re looking forward to a night filled with community connection, ceremony, and great music. </p>
<p>If anyone has last words before we wrap up, I’d love to hear them.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Thank you for this conversation. It’s been really beautiful.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Likewise, thank you. Steven, thank you for your vision in bringing together all the voices in your book and for the community you and Marc foster around the awakening of our time in history.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** And I’d like to extend my thanks to Marc for your support and to Belinda and Chris for generously sharing your time. Your insights today have truly touched me.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Thank you for your kind words, everyone. I’m all about uplifting transformative ideas and using this platform to amplify visionary and indigenous voices. I’m honored to share this space and help everyone convey their messages. </p>
<p>With that said, let’s close with a little video about the event featuring a taste of the music. Thank you again, everyone.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Please do not underestimate how deep we can go, both individually and collectively, with this kind of work.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** That was a great teaser. If you want more, there’s a 10-minute version of the whole soundtrack available on the website. It's an epic experience. Until next time!</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Great day, everyone! Thank you again!</p>

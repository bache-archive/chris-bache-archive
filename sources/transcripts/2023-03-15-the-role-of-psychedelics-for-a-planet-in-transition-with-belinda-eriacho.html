      <p><em><em>Marc Caron: ** Hello everyone, and welcome to this episode of Spirit Plant Medicine Presents. My name is Marc Caron. I'm happy to share that today we're having a great conversation with a great group of guests in regards to Steven Gray's new book, </em>How Psychedelics Can Help Save the World,</em> and today, we're going to answer the question, what is the role of psychedelics for a planet in transition? So our first guest I'll introduce is my friend and cohort in the spirit plant medicine space, Mr. Steven Gray. Steven has been traveling a spiritual and medicine path for over 50 years. Now he's a writer, educator, conference organizer, speaker, and he's also a facilitator for cannabis ceremonies. Now, Steven is the author of three books, including the popular <em>Cannabis and Spirituality: An Explorer's Guide to the Ancient Plant Spirit Allies,</em> and just recently, as I already mentioned, <em>How Psychedelics Can Help Save the World: Visionary and Indigenous Voices Speak Out.</em> Steven, always a pleasure to see you.</p>
<p>**Steven Gray: ** Thanks, Marc, yeah, looking forward to our conversation today.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** And we also have joining us is Belinda Eriacho. I hope I pronounced your last name correctly. She's of Navajo and Zuni descent. Her maternal clan is the One Who Walks Around, and she was born for the Zuni Pueblo people. Belinda was born and raised on the Navajo reservation located in Arizona in the United States. She's a wisdom carrier, healer, and founder of Kalaji, and she's focused on culture and traditional teachings that impact topics such as Native American communities. She holds health degrees in technology and public health. Belinda is well-rounded in so many different areas, and she brings great wisdom to our community. So we're excited to have you here again today. Belinda, nice to see you.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Great to see you, awesome.</p>
<p><em><em>Marc Caron: ** And of course, we have Chris Bache. Chris Bache is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he's taught for 33 years. He's also a faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. He's an award-winning teacher with his work exploring the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness. Chris has written a number of books, and his most recent is </em>LSD and the Minds of the Universe.</em> Great read. If you haven't read it, go check out that book; it's fantastic. Welcome, Chris. How are you?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I'm great. Welcome everybody. It's a real honor to be here with you today.</p>
<p><em><em>Marc Caron: ** Yeah, likewise, it's always a pleasure to connect and learn from you folks, because for me, this work has really been a passion of learning, and the things that I've gleaned from all the talks over the conferences over the years have really made a difference in my life, and it's really exciting to be able to share that with people around the world. So thank you for taking the time out of your day to join us here, and we're going to get started. I'm going to start with Steven, and basically, what we're going to do today is I'm going to ask a question of our panel, and they're all each going to answer for about five minutes or so the answer to this one specific question. Because we're focusing on the book </em>How Psychedelics Can Help Save the World,</em> I'm going to start with Steven Gray, because he was the guy who put this work together. And we're going to start there. So if we're ready, gang, let's roll. The question is, in your view, Mr. Steven Gray, what is the role of psychedelics for a planet in transition?</p>
<p>**Steven Gray: ** Oh, thanks, Marc. Thanks for the intro and the lead-in. And just a quick clarification, by the way, although you implied it in your latest little statement there, I am merely the editor and one of the contributors to both the previous cannabis book and this one. In this case, there are 25 contributors. So I just wrote the intro and the outro, as it were, and a couple of other short things. So that's my role. Just wanted to clarify that, and the rest of it was cat herding for the other 25 people involved. But I'm delighted with the results. They're all remarkable people. And they are all speaking in different ways, but I would say in accord. I don't think there would be anything in the book that would provoke any one of those contributors to disagree with any of the other contributors. So obviously, that's a big question. And I actually think that I'm actually more interested in what Chris and Belinda have to say about it than what I have to say about it, to be honest. But so what could I say about that issue? Well, okay, I know I have an answer for you, but go ahead, Marc.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Yeah, what I was going to say is maybe you can let us know what inspired you to put this particular book together, and what that inspiration was for you.</p>
<p>**Steven Gray: ** Okay, well, I'm going to take that question and run down the field, maybe the opposite direction, but we'll see. Excuse me, so yeah. Well, the inspiration is the potential of psychedelics, which is answering your question anyway, I hope. And so here's one way of talking about it, the role of psychedelics for a planet in transition. They are not silver bullets or magic bullets. They are fraught with the potential for misuse, misappropriation, misunderstanding, and in some cases harm. They're not for everybody. And in fact, Jamie Wheal, who's spoken at our conference twice, had an interesting kind of template that he suggested. He said, don't take it too literally. But perhaps it might be like this: if you take a graph of 100% of the demographic of the people, perhaps there's 10% of those people at one end of the continuum who should never take psychedelics for a variety of reasons, you know, mental health fragility, etc. And then there are 10% of the other end who are the dedicated, serious psychonauts and explorers who are constantly learning from the medicines. And those people might be taking the medicines frequently over, you know, an accumulated number of years. And then there are 80% in the middle who, in Jamie's view, perhaps should only be taking the psychedelics for very special occasions, perhaps three or four times in their lives, you know, for like a graduation, a wedding, the birth of a first child, something like that. So that's just one way of looking at, you know, who might benefit or not from the psychedelics. Having said that, my other sort of favorite way to talk about them or put them into the context of our current situation is that, you know, there's an obvious notion that, using the more sort of a medical metaphor, when the patient is in an advanced state of illness, strong medicines are required. So as obviously all four of us here understand quite clearly, we are in a dire condition on the planet. As Chris Bache has made so clear in his books and talks and different things like that, we are heading into, sorry to steal your thunder here, Chris, but a death-rebirth cycle, which is most likely to become increasingly more difficult on the material level over the next decades. We don't know how long, so things are, we're in a crucial moment. We're in a crucial nexus moment. And so what we need, as I understand it, is we need tools that can almost, in a sense, shock the monkey or wake us up, do a lot of healing work, and, you know, awakening work. So in that regard, the way that I like to think of the psychedelics is as reality medicines. They're not about escaping into some alternative reality, particularly, although that's a fraught thing to say, I suppose. But ultimately, what they're capable of when they're done in the most skillful, intentional circumstances, I think, is they can open us up into understandings which are real, you know, about who we are, the nature of things. And that includes, well, another way that I like to talk about them as well is I think of psychedelics as having sort of two interwoven capabilities. One is that they are truth serums potentially, so they can show us things about ourselves so that we can see where we are blocked, where the obstacles are. We can see sometimes into our past and the places we've got stuck or turned away from ourselves, as Gabor Maté might say. And then the other side of that, it's part of the same function, of course, and as I say, interwoven, is that they can and ideally open us up to what my old Buddhist teacher, Chögyam Trungpa, would call unconditioned reality, the awakened state to some degree or another. And as people that take psychedelics often say, these states often feel more real than the ones that most people live through most of the time, so I think I'll stop there.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Well, thank you, Steven. So before we get into any kind of conversation, I'm going to pass it to Belinda from her perspective and her worldview to answer the same question: What do you feel is the role of psychedelics for our planet in transition?</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Thank you, Marc. Before I get started, I do want to do a land acknowledgement to the people of the Phoenix area, which are the Akimel O'odham (Pima) and the Hohokam people who live in this place that they refer to as Earth Doctor. I'm here as an invited guest in these unceded territories, and I share a common history with them, and I wanted to acknowledge them in that way before I answer that question. That's a loaded question, Marc. You know, in my chapter, chapter five, that talks about turning of the soil, I use that as a metaphor for what is unfolding in this time that we are in right now. To me, the way that I look at psychedelics, I view them more as sacred medicines, not necessarily psychedelics or entheogens or drugs, as many people refer to them. I think that really puts in perspective itself the language that we use when we refer to these sacred medicines. You know, everything that we do, we create energy or we transform energy, and it's really important that we clearly understand them and respect them, as my friend Steven indicated. But I think also, psychedelics are really an opportunity to awaken to ourselves. I was reading some literature the other day about the intellectual quotient and the spiritual quotient, just, you know, on a global level for humanity and kind of where we are, and it seems that we've outgrown our intellectual selves, and now the spiritual peace, the spiritual aspect of ourselves, is starting to unfold. And my metaphor that I talk about, the turning of the soil, what I believe is happening with the psychedelics, it's essentially turning ourselves inside out. You know, we're so used to being out in a material world from a Western perspective that we've forgotten how to even be with ourselves. And so by unfolding and taking these different medicines, it allows us to go into these places that we can eventually heal ourselves and then resonate that out into our families and our communities. I also believe that psychedelic medicines or sacred medicines meet different aspects in our lives. You know, my culture, we talk about the cycles of life. When we are born into this physicalness, we come in, in a spirit, physical form, and it is not until we make our first laugh that we embody the physicalness as human beings. And then we go through adolescence, adulthood, elderhood, and then we return back to source. I think through those experiences, we go through a path that I refer to as horizon, which means the balance of harmony in our lives. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that everything is nice and rosy, you know. Life is life, you know, and sometimes those difficult experiences that we go through allow us to unfold and to see things in a different perspective, but also give us some life lessons that we need to learn. And so with that, I think one of the things is that in my book, I also make reference to the prophecies of the Eagle and the Condor, and I give two examples. One is from the Hopi people, which are located here in Arizona, as well as the Andean traditions, and that the North, the people of the North are the people of the mind, and the people of the South are the people of the heart. When we can come together as one unified community, then we can start to heal the history that we all share. I think psychedelics allow us to get to that point, but also come to a lot of other realizations about our interconnectedness with one another. You know, the importance of ceremony and intention that come along with these sacred plant medicines. But also the realization of going to a much deeper level in our healing evolution, if you will. You know, I think a lot of times when we have an illness, we rely on Western medicine for that healing aspect, rather than going to that next level deeper within. So those are just some of my thoughts in the way that I view psychedelics and how it can save the world. Beautiful.</p>
<p><em><em>Marc Caron: ** Well, thank you so much for sharing that. I just wanted to let people know that if you want to catch Belinda's talk from our Spirit Plant Medicine Conference in 2022, which is titled </em>Turning of the Soil,</em> that's available on our YouTube channel, and it's also available for free in our membership portal as well at SpiritPlantMedicine.com. I highly recommend going and taking that in because it was just a fantastic presentation. And as we move forward, we're going to go to Mr. Chris Bache. Chris, again, the question is, in your view, what do you feel is the role of psychedelics for our planet in transition?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Well, first, Marc, I want to affirm everything that Steven and Belinda have said. One of the advantages of going last in the batting order is I get to play off of what has already been said. I certainly, absolutely agree with it. It seems that we are living in a different time in history, as particularly Belinda has pointed to. We are living in a time when the underlying structure of the collective psyche is shifting. We are shifting culturally. There are so many cultural migrations and integrations taking place, but kind of at a deeper level, the very nature of the collective psyche seems to be simmering, turning to the point of boiling. One of the ways I understand this is that we have entered a time when the karma of our many, many former lives, all of us collectively, is coming forward and pressing up inside us, seeking resolution. I think there's a tremendous collective purification taking place in the outer world and also in the inner world. So one of the uses of psychedelics that can be very helpful is to help accelerate and deepen and clarify this internal purification process. I think that's why so many people are involved in other spiritual practices besides psychedelic practice: yoga and meditation, so many different activities, because we need to keep the psyche open and clear, to let this negative conditioning come through us without re-traumatizing ourselves, to help our system clear itself and cleanse itself. Psychedelics, when used conscientiously in a ritual context and in a therapeutic context, can deepen and accelerate this healing process. One of the fundamental problems that we have been living with is our separation from nature and our separation from our spiritual nature, so that the surface of our nature is not as naturally in tune with our deeper nature as maybe it had been in earlier times, simpler times. Part of healing the psyche is also sort of healing the soul at a deeper level than just kind of personal therapeutic healing, helping the soul enter into deeper communion with its own deep history, and with the deep history of the planet, and with the deep history of the intelligence that has been orchestrating reality in manifesting reality for 13.7 billion years. So that in addition, taking the healing process deeper than just personal healing, even deeper than collective healing, it can be a process of reconnecting with that core intelligence that is manifesting life, manifesting nature, and manifesting history and learning from it, developing a deeper understanding from life itself about what is happening, what is taking place, and why this century is different from earlier centuries. What is the trajectory of our evolutionary project in this century? So healing facilitates a kind of cultural renaissance, but then also facilitates a deeper psycho-spiritual renaissance so that we can reconnect with this core sense and deeper understanding of what's actually taking place in history. So those are the points that I would just add to what's already been said.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** That's fantastic, and as we go through what transition we're facing. But I wanted to just take this moment as we go into the next question, so we can unpack this a little bit more. Belinda, you said something really important and profound that we all need to take a look at and understand. This is mostly my perception, and something that I've been picking up because you talked about the language and how we talk about psychedelics, entheogens, drugs, plant medicines, and things. I've had the opportunity to speak to a lot of people in terms of interviews, and in media and things, and everybody talks about them as drugs. I just want to share my thought on this because when we take a look at a natural plant and a plant medicine, whether it's cannabis, the mushroom, ayahuasca, and things of that nature, in my opinion, they're not drugs. They're plants, and plants as medicine. When we take a look at other plants that we consume on a regular basis, we don't call them drugs. Broccoli, we don't call a drug. Celery, we don't call a drug. You know, all those power foods and power greens, we don't call a drug, yet they have different plant properties. And when we look at the psychedelic nature of plants, they have different plant properties. That's why I think it's really important that we don't classify them in that stigma of being a drug, and that we use all plants as medicine. It's just my two cents on that because it comes up a lot where people will call them drugs, and in my opinion, they're really plants, right? Many of them have their own medicine, whether it's a vegetable or something with psychedelic properties.</p>
<p><em><em>Belinda Eriacho: ** I think there’s one thing that's missing from that, Marc. And, you know, I too have been talking with many people, and I think one of the things that seems to be missing is the relationship between us and the plants and the plant kingdom. From my culture, I refer to Ayahuasca as grandmother, which translates to grandmother Ayahuasca. These are ancient teachers that really have something to pass on to us if we're willing to listen and open up to those gems of wisdom. The same thing goes with the Mushroom Kingdom. You know, they're not called </em>santitos</em> for no reason at all. You know, the holy children. I think it really is important that for those of us that use psychedelics, whether it's in our healing or as therapeutic modalities, we really need to come to that innerstanding, not understanding. We're not putting ourselves over these plants; we're really internalizing that and making that relationship with them. I think it's really important as this whole field starts to develop. </p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Yeah, absolutely. I love that word innerstanding. I hope to use that in the future, if you don't mind.</p>
<p>**Steven Gray: ** Awesome, not copyrighted. </p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Fantastic, but it just makes sense, and innerstanding is very different from an intellectual understanding, right? So, beautifully said. Now the question is, what is the transition you think that we're facing? You know, there's a lot of change in the world right now. We're seeing it every day. Steven, what do you think is the biggest part of this transition that we're facing? </p>
<p><em><em>Steven Gray: ** Well, hmm, yeah. Well, again, not to belittle my own intelligence, but I think Chris Bache has been tapping into what I think, if I may say so, Chris, I think it's more or less the correct terminology that vast intelligences of the universe have been saying that, as Chris has said before numerous times, you know, we've reached this kind of nexus point. I think it's just really important now, okay, so yeah, here's a good way to talk about that, I think. If we think it will and seems to be, apparently, underway already, the stability of the past or the status quo, such as it is or was, is becoming less viable, less comfortable on the material level, and just in general. Change is happening very, very quickly on multiple levels. As that happens, especially if things become, well, either rapidly or not quite so rapidly, more difficult for many people on the material level, like if there become shortages of food or clean water, if international agreements break down, if the climate makes us put like a much greater percentage of our financial resources into climate change mitigation and on and on. If those things all make our lives more difficult and less stable and less certain, I guess you could say what I think is likely to happen—and I mean, I don't, I'm not an authority anymore than anyone else—but it seems to me that a lot of it's already happening in terms of its effect on the psychology or the mentality of people. You know, you keep hearing in the news about how there's more depression these days, there's more anxiety. I think what's likely to happen if this trajectory unfolds the way we envision it, way we think it will, or perhaps the way the spirits are telling some people that it is likely to—there will be more of those, you know, problematic mind states and more discouragement. So I think it's really important—and this is saying this partly because that's the mission of the book—to hopefully give people, as Dwayne Elgin, one of the contributors to the book, says, a believable story, a story that's if I had it in front of me. Actually, I could find it in a minute, but none. I don't want to make you wait. In his chapter in the book, he lays out, sort of, if the story is going to be functional for people, it has to have four elements, and I don't remember what they all are now, but one is that it has to be simple, easy to understand, functional, able to be, you know, put into place, manifested, plausible, etc. Dwayne has a really interesting view of this. From my point of view, he talks about how, in his book </em>Choosing Earth,</em> he actually goes through a possible, or even probable scenario for the next six, seven decades. This is super loose, and I haven't even read it for a while, so it's something vaguely like this: It looks like material conditions are likely to continue to deteriorate over the next several decades. But this is really key: if enough people get smart or however you want to say that, you know, wake up, do the healing work that they need to do so that we can participate in intelligent, creative solutions at multiple levels, you know, whatever level that is, through the arts, through government, through economics, whatever environmental work, etc., etc. But starting with that inner understanding, or that innerstanding that Belinda and now you are talking about, Marc, then there is the hope of, as Dwayne calls it, the birth or the arising of a mature planetary civilization. Chris, again, if I you don't mind my stealing your thunder, Chris has said that he wasn't given any timeline on this. Dwayne lays it out over the next six or seven decades as a possibility. So what I'm really trying to say, in a somewhat rambly way here, is that I feel strongly that people need to hear messages that things, if things look bad, it doesn't just mean we're heading toward doom and destruction. It means—and this is really a gross oversimplification, no doubt—but for the short term, for this situation here, it's connected to things like the prophecy of the eagle and the condor that Belinda was talking about or the thousands of years of accumulated karma that Chris is talking about coming to a head now. It's related to that. It's all about that notion that we've come to this point, and if we don't have something that shows us a potential for the light to come through, it's going to be much, much harder on people's psyches, you know? So I think that is—maybe I'm an idealist, you know? I'm a dreamer, I'm a visioner in that sense. I think we've been given this, I don't just think it. I sense that we've been given this absolutely incredible gift of life on this planet to wake up to our true, interwoven, embedded interrelationship and connection to everything and to appreciate it and to love it and to create within it. In this short time that each of us has on the planet, you know, my old Buddhist teacher, Trungpa, talked about learning to appreciate the redness of red and the blueness of blue. Just that really simple, like, in a sense, surrendering or opening oneself into things as they are, and relaxing into that, right? We just need, I think, more and more clear, plausible, actionable information and messages that there is this potential for the birth of individual and collective awakening. So I guess that's one way of talking about, you know, whatever this transition is that is no longer sustainable to keep being in the state of spiritual disconnection.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** I completely understand and agree with what you're saying there because there's so much going on in the world right now that we need these tools more than ever. So Belinda, I'm really curious about your take of what you see from your role in the world as an indigenous woman and what you see as being the biggest transition that we are facing as global humanity.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Right? Thank you so much for that question. I was looking at rereading Chris's chapter and then some of the things that Steven had talked about, but I look at things in a different way, because I think what's happening to us and many indigenous cultures around the globe. Our elders have told us that these are just cycles that we're going through. Everything is evolving to that, and that's the way that I look at things. And so these things that may appear as challenges to us can really turn out to be gifts in the end, and it's really up to us, as, you know, as a human species, to really think, not so much be in our mind, but think with our hearts. And I think there's been already too much thinking up here. That's why we're in a situation that we are in right now, and where we really need to start moving into is into the mind of the heart. And, you know, in my book, I share a little story about an elder that told us the longest journey that we will ever travel is between our mind and our heart. And that's only 18 inches away, you know. And so I think that that's kind of some of the things that are coming up for me, you know, I'm reminded of many stories that even my grandparents and great grandparents shared, and that were passed down through our oral traditions about how things evolve and the way that we look at and perceive things is really what we create. And so, you know, I think one of the things that I see for myself is that the children that are being born in this time, they're very I think, you know, I think Chris calls them. Tolle calls it the diamond. In his book makes reference to a diamond. And I think of these children as very wise souls that are coming in right now, they already have this knowing that is within them to carry on a lot of these teachings and cultures and traditions that we all have forgotten about because we've kind of been too focused on the materialistic aspects of our lives, and we've forgotten everything else. And so I think, you know, I'm a little bit more optimistic that it's just an evolution and a change and a shift that we are going through as humanity, there will definitely be those that will, I think, falter off on another path. I think one of the things I'm also reminded of in part of the chapter that Chris writes that reminds me of is that there are these different things that are evolving, and psychedelics, the sacred plant medicines, allows us to go into these places that are different timelines than this physical timeline that we are in. And we all have our own interpretation of what that is? You know, I mean, I've seen the future. I've seen the instruments for healing that have been shared by our star relatives. You know, in our cultures, they said that we are the star beings. We are from the stars. Our ancestors are from the stars. And we were remembering those things. But I've also seen the ancient ruins and the dwellings crafted on side of the walls. And many of my journeys, you know, and being able to travel into time, time frames, it's very hard to describe these timelines that you're able to tap into to have those connections with, you know, deceased relatives, and really, you know, heal those relationships that we have with one another so that we can continue to evolve. I think some of that is related to some of the things that Chris talks about, is about this evolution of karma. And so one of the things that I think that, and my prayer is that as each one of us sees what's happening and unfolding around us in the world, whether it's geopolitical or climate related, really start to begin to ask ourselves, you know, what part of that do I own? I think there's always this tendency to say that somebody else's issue, but we all have, if we really, truly believe that we are interrelated with one another, then we need to take ownership of that. That's really where the real action happens. So thank you for that question.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Absolutely my pleasure. And you know, I think it's I love what you said, and I've heard it before, that the longest journey we'll ever take is the one from our head to our heart. And I repeat that back, because I think it's really important, and I want everyone to, you know, really think about that for a moment and really recognize, like, are you living from up here? It's another quote that I have in my world. It's like, when you're in your head, you're dead, when you're in your heart, you're smart, you know. And it's just one of those things that when you drop into your heart all of a sudden, answers come, you know, undammed and flow really well. So thank you.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** For I might borrow that mark, by the way.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Yeah, absolutely. Lots of trading going on. Here. There you go. There you go. Well,</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** this, this is one of the ways that psychedelics are helping change the world, right? We learn, we support, we get inspired by each other, and then we can go share what we're doing, and all based on the topic of psychedelics. Anyways, Chris, again, that would be our question for you. You know, what is the transition you see that we are facing as a society today?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Well, I only have limited visionary, shamanic kind of experience of the future. When I want to turn to specifics, I have to go to the same sources that we all do, I have to go to the scientist. I have to go to the ecologist. I was very glad, Steven, that you mentioned the work of Dwayne Elgin, because he's been crunching the numbers for decades. He's been really tracking the scientific literature, and it seems clear, if we do that, we are entering a period of enormous suffering. It is hard to overestimate how much suffering is coming in the decades ahead, between now and say, just say, 50 years from now, 2070, 2075 when we look at the melting of the ice caps, when we look at the expanding population when we look at climate destabilization, destabilization of agriculture, likelihood of more pandemics, I mean, realistically, we could be looking at the death of 1/3 to one half of the human population of this planet, if our carrying capacity is somewhere around 2 billion and we're pushing 8 billion now, then the suffering of so many of our children and grandchildren around the world dying is just going to be an unspeakable agony that's going to bring us to our knees and give us a kind of intense incentive, a motivation to do things, to insist on changes that right now we do not have the political and social will to do. Some do a few do, a growing number of some do, but not enough to make these shifts happen. So I think we're coming into a pain of terrible, terrible suffering. I wish it weren't. So I wish we could, we could avoid it by having enough people come to their senses quickly enough. But I think we're past the point in history where we could avert this crisis that it's coming, we might be able to soften a touch, but it's coming, and it's going to hit us. It's going to hit our children and our grandchildren, our great grandchildren, very, very hard. Now my visionary experience is that this global crisis that we are entering is a birth process, that it is going to be horrendously painful, but it is not an apocalypse, in the sense of a destruction of everything that has come up to this point in time. It is, it is, in a sense, like a near-death experience, where we come very close to death and in that process of coming close to death, we break through into different orders of consciousness, I think, Nate. And this is not something human beings are doing, or human beings are in control of. Nature is in control of this process. Nature is driving this evolutionary crisis. This intelligence behind nature is driving this process. The best we can do is be responsive in communion with this intelligence. Responsive with this intelligence, and cooperate with it in order to facilitate a transition that it is not ours to have designed, but nature has designed this transition. Now, the way I understand the long scale of this is from within a reincarnational perspective, and from that perspective, the human beings who are entering this crisis are not human beings the way we ordinarily think of them. They're not 100 year old beings. They're 10s of 1000s, hundreds of 1000s of year old beings. They have layers and layers and layers of the history inside of each one of us, and this history comes from different cultures and different places around the world and different places in society, different colors, different religious traditions, all these aspects of our global complex picture are all woven into the fiber of our being. We have been growing for hundreds of 1000s of years as souls making some progress here, maybe making some step backwards there, but overall, we've been growing, but collectively the psychological level of our collective maturation is still basically egoic. It's still rooted in our individual consciousness. And the world that is falling apart around our ears is a world that was built by ego and as and I don't just disparage ego. Ego is beautiful. I mean it, it's just, it's an extraordinarily beautiful phenomenon, but it is still fundamentally cut off from the deeper fabric of life, from the deeper fabric of our interconnectedness, from the deeper fabric of our spiritual connectedness. And basically it's because of its limited awareness, it designs a world which works for some and doesn't work for others. It elevates the condition of life for some at the cost of disparaging the quality of life of other beings. And we can just we know how this happens. We know how this works. We know what's been happening. And basically this is a world that works for some and doesn't work for others, and it's a world the limitations of this view are basically leading to a global destruction, a global catastrophe of unmitigated suffering. I don't think we can survive as a species living out of the level of consciousness that we have been living out of up to this point in time. For all its beauty, the ego is still too small a consciousness to basically solve the global problems, to solve the social problems that are becoming paramount right now. We either need to, we will either grow up or we're going to die, and that makes this death process a tremendously powerful evolutionary accelerator. Now, what growing up means, I think, is shifting from an egoic perspective to a soul perspective. Basically, I think we are in a time when all of our former lives and all of this history and all of this work that each one of us has been doing, and collectively we've been doing. I think what's happening is just as the world is coming together as one, our psyches are coming together as one, the prophecies that Belinda refers to as East West culture, north south culture, but the psyche is coming together as one. And when this, when we reach critical mass, not only will the world give birth to a new culture, but the core of this culture, I think, is that it will be operating out of a different level of consciousness, out of a higher level of consciousness. And I think the most immediate way of understanding this is out of soul consciousness, and this is what, in my visions, comes through as the birth of the diamond soul, which is simply all of our history integrated into a single consciousness, which is transparent to each other at a very deep level and transparent to the Divine at a very deep level. And once we collectively make this transition, it's not going to work if only a few people here or there make this transition. Nature doesn't think small. Nature only thinks in large, large movements. The entire species is being taken through this transition. And I don't know how we're going to make this transition. I don't know whether it's going to come slowly or fast, or how we're going to do it, but the visions which have been poured into me in my years of psychedelic work is that we do make this transition. We do come out of this crisis a different kind of species, not only improved a little bit around the edges, but with a fundamental change taking place at the very core of the collective unconscious, so that every human being born after this transition takes place is operating out of a different foundation of consciousness, a different, more spiritually informed form of consciousness. And just as any mother, when she goes into labor is in a day filled with pain, but at the end of the day, when she gives birth to her child, that pain is worth it, because of the beauty of the child being born. I think it will be that way for us too. We are giving birth to a new form of humanity, a more enlightened form, a more compassionate form, a more spiritually awakened form of humanity, historically unprecedented. And as this transition takes place, we will look back at this century of crisis, and we will say it was worth it to give birth to something so beautiful. It was worth it.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Mark, can I add a little icing on that cake?</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Absolutely you can. Steven, thanks. Well,</p>
<p><em><em>Stephen Gray: ** that was incredible, Chris, by the way, mind blowing, really. And I just like to throw in one of my favorite sayings, necessity is the mother of invention. And I think that the intelligence, I don't think I'm sure the intelligence capabilities of humanity, often, as you've just implied, I think Chris in concert with each other are all but limitless. And so from my point of view, the optimistic side of this, what you're talking about, Chris, is a potentially extremely difficult, painful period of dissolution before there's enough of a gap for the new vision to come in is going to be in some way tempered by increasing intelligence. You know that it's like life is getting real on the planet, you know. And as things get real, our deeper capabilities start to come out more and more. So I think that's really important to understand, frankly, and goes along with what I was saying earlier about the need for sort of plausible, understandable, actionable visions and messages for people so that people don't, so that as many people as possible don't just fall into despair and hopelessness as material conditions deteriorate, if that's what's going to happen. So, yeah, I just wanted to add that, you know, let us not underestimate, and this is, I'm not saying this in contradiction to anything you've said, Chris, but let us not underestimate the almost unlimited potential for creativity that is going to become increasingly needed as time goes on and will come out, you know, as we move out of the sort of the, you know, Hermann Hesse's last book, </em>The Glass Bead Game</em>, Magister Ludy takes place about 500 years in the future, and he refers back to, or those people refer back to this time as the age of feyoton. And I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it correctly, but it means paper, like it's like plastic or insubstantial or something. So there's a kind of a frivolousness that dominates those parts of the world that can afford to be frivolous at this time, which I think is likely to crumble, and more and more people are going to get real. You know, I don't want to ramble too long, but I just want to say, as a music person myself, music has been treated in such shabby ways in recent history, and I think it's going to play an important role in the future, as this reality process deepens, and people will start to increasingly discover that there's incredible potential in music that a lot of people already know, but a lot of people have no idea, because of the fact that it's, you know, oftentimes people put it on they don't even barely listen to it, or it's piped into elevators and grocery stores and all that. And just treat it as a kind of a cheapo commodity to influence the mood of a situation, buy more or whatever. You know, we certainly know that with songs like the Peyote prayer. Songs and their capability, and the Icaros of the Ayahuasca world and their capability and such. Enough from me.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Thanks for adding that in, Steven. And Chris, you said something that I thought was so beautifully said, and it was really the metaphor of a mother giving birth and that pain that turns into, you know, great pleasure, right? And it just reminded me of something that, you know, it's one thing I always live by. And you know, we see great change coming, and one of our, you know, care ways of dealing with change is a lot of people resist change, you know, and I want to encourage everybody to embrace the change, because change is automatic growth, not necessarily, but when change can happen and we can grow and help others grow and transform through the pain, air quoting the Pain of change versus, you know, the ability to embrace it as an opportunity, because, you know, it's going to suck, it's going to hurt. It happens when change is happening. Metamorphic is, I got to believe, you know, isn't always, you know, isn't painless to the caterpillar in that sense. And that, you know, we do anything when change comes. You know, let's embrace the change and grow with it, based on some of the things that we've been talking about here. And Belinda, I just want to reach, you know, touch in with you. Is there something you wanted to add to what Chris and Steven may have said there?</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Yes, I think one of the things that's really important to me, and one of the things that I continue to see in this space is that we forget about the importance of spirituality in this space, you know, either because we don't understand it, and especially in circles of science, it's very difficult for them to talk about that when we're talking about healing. For many indigenous cultures, spirituality is actually the number one component that actually helps to bring healing and wholeness to an individual. So I think that's one of the things I also wanted to add. And as we start to move forward in this movement that we be mindful of that.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Yeah, it really goes hand in hand with our disconnection to nature, right?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** If I could add a footnote to what Steven had said, I think in my visionary experience, one of the messages has come through over and over and over again is the pace of the future is the pace of the past is irrelevant to the pace of the future, these things are going to happen much faster than we could possibly imagine, much faster, faster, faster. And one of the ways it was unfolded for me is a vision of the entire collective psyche, the species mind that underlies all of our individual minds is a field, is a unified field, and then under the pressure of this time in history, this field is going to become hyper stimulated, through all the angst and all the suffering and all the uncertainty, it's going to become hyper stimulated. And when it becomes hyper stimulated, it'll begin to function in what chaos thinkers would call a non-linear system, it'll become a non-linear system, or a far from equilibrium system. Non-linear systems are capable of doing things that linear systems cannot do, and one of the things they can do is change rapidly. Change quickly. Small fluctuations of input can produce dramatic outputs. The butterfly flaps its wings in China can produce a hurricane across the world. So that means that under the pressure of the future, the contribution of individuals, the influence of individuals, will not be diminishing, it'll be increasing, so that individuals can affect the outcome of this evolutionary transition more in the future than they were in the past, and it's just through this and through many other ways, the speed with which things can change the creativity and when non-linear systems evoke from deeper within its Nature, latent forms of creativity that are part of the natural fabric, but had not been actualized up to that point in time. So I think Steven's absolutely right. The creativity of the universe is going to be manifesting the collectivity, the interconnectivity of our beings, of our hearts and of our minds. I think we're entering into the time. One of the ways of thinking about where we're coming into is we're entering into the period of the one heart, where humanity will experience the one heart. And once we know the one heart in our essence, then we won't hurt each other, we won't satisfy we won't let anybody be diminished in their opportunities of life. And I think we are awakening into the one heart. And I think that you're talking about making the journey from mind to heart is a very powerful mentioning this.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** May I mark you? May Steven?</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Thank you. Oh, Chris, another beautiful statement. Thanks so much. Yeah, I want to add in another thing on the sort of optimism side you might say, excuse me. And this is another one of those little aphorisms which has come to me in a variety of ways, but this particular aphorism is there? I think it's Victor Hugo said that there is nothing as powerful as an idea whose time has come and Canucault Little Fish, a road man from the Native American church that I sat up in meetings with perhaps two dozen times or more over a 12 year period. Others have said this too, probably many actually. But what Ken said to me one time, or Canucault said to me one time, was that he and some others had been having a vision that as the stability, or, you know, believability, plausibility of the current, spiritually disconnected, as Chris says, egoic, dominated system becomes less and less plausible, less and less viable, then that will create a gap that is creating a gap, but the gap will widen or become big enough for this new vision to come in, and that new vision will make sense. You know, as Terence McKenna, who, I think, borrowed this from William Blake, or somebody ultimately, and reworded it for modern times, was, if the truth can be told so as to be understood, it will be believed, which is essentially what Dwayne is saying Elgin is saying in his chapter as well. So I think it's, again, from the sort of like giving people hope perspective, it's important to realize, again, that we're not just looking at destruction. It's the birth, it's the death-rebirth part of it, right? That's so important.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Yeah, great. Well, thank you for adding on to that, Steven. Now we are getting near a time we want to be mindful, because sometimes people don't like the long episodes of things. So if there's one thing I like to do is I always like to give people something tangible or a call to action. And I know we've talked about a lot of great ideas and things that people can do, but I'd like to ask each of you specifically that if there was one thing someone can do to help this transition along for humanity as a call to action as an individual, what would you suggest or think that might be the most, you know, bear the most fruit? What do you think the most important action for all of us to do is moving forward. Whoever wants to go first? Go.</p>
<p><em><em>Stephen Gray: ** Go ahead. Go first. I got to quote Canucault's Little Fish again, who said to us in the teepee a couple of times, relatives, stay behind the medicine. So it's a metaphor, essentially Steven Howard Bunner in his book </em>Plant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm</em>, used as the phrase following the golden thread, which you and I have been having fun with the last couple of years, Mark. So that's the getting in front of the medicine as a reality, in reality, but also as a metaphor, is the ego getting in the way and enforcing its agenda and its needs onto the situation, staying behind the medicine, as I understand it, is, has to do with quieting the mind, calming the mind, being humbling oneself, dropping down into the heart. As people have said so beautifully, Belinda and Chris today, dropping down into the heart and experiencing through that way and just following the golden thread, I think it's a very optimistic, in a sense, way of looking at our potential. So, or to put it into more sort of a fun way, excuse me, the wonderful novelist Tom Robbins in his book <em>Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates</em> told a story about a friend of his who had a like a parakeet or some large, you know, bird. That was the first thing any visitor to the place always saw when the person walked in the door. Here's this thing sitting on a stand, and it said to everybody, the parrot's name was Sailor. By the way, Sailor the parrot, and everyone who came in through the store, it said, "People of Sea World, relax." So if there's one sort of simple message, it's like, relax, pay attention and trust and stay behind the medicine. And then I think, you know, at least I'd like to believe that things unfold in and of themselves, and we then know the next intelligent, skillful step to take, Mark before we go, are you going to is one of us going to say something about the book launch? Oh, not there yet. Okay, okay. Didn't mean to jump the gun.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Always jump in the gun. Oh yes, always just one more thing. Okay. Anyway, Steven, that's fantastic. I completely can relate to what you're saying. And Belinda, what do you think, you know for people to do one thing, leave here from this conversation and do one thing that can make a difference in this world. What yeah that to be.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Thank you for that question, Mark. You know, one of the things at the very end of my chapter, I end with a prayer for healing of humanity. And I think one of the best things that we each can do is look internal to ourselves and do the work that we are being called to. Because with that, then it resonates out into our families, our communities, and then globally, just like, you know, Chris had talked a little bit about, it's just like that pebble in the pond to really get out there and do something, you know, get involved, look for practice sacred activism. You know, look for those opportunities where you can help your neighbors, you can help your community. I think with all of that said and done, you know, it helps to for us to evolve into a better place.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Very well said. And I like that you talked about, you know that the contribution and volunteerism, because I think that that's just a powerful way that people can get outside of themselves, and, you know, serve the greater good. So thank you for bringing that to the surface, Belinda. I think it's really important. And Chris, you're up.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Alright. Well, in addition to doing our inner work that Belinda referred to in addressing the shadow and taking responsibility for our own shadow, I'd like to sort of broaden the perspective. Now. I think Steven's right that music is going to play a very important role in the time that we're coming into and not just musicians, but artists, politicians, scientists, every it's going to take all of us working in concert to bring about this social transformation, and it's to help us make this shift. So I would just invite us to remember that before we were born and before our children were born, every one of us knew what we were getting into before we were born. We all made a conscious choice to be born in this time and to this place in this particular form, in this particular sex, in this particular culture we were born, and we chose to become an active participant in this historical process. And no matter what I might recommend in terms of the good thing for someone to do or a core thing for someone to do, inevitably, I would reflect my own limitations, of my own spot in the world. And I think what's important is for each one of us to remember that we have already buried around us, all the help that we need, all the information we need, all the resources that we need to do our particular piece in contributing to this transformation that we are a part of. The question is not, what do we need to do? The question is, I think, will we have the courage to do what is ours to do? You will know what is ours to do. Will we have the courage to do it? If everybody has the courage to do their particular part, then we're going to make it through this thing.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** I really like that courage to push through that, Chris, I think it's, you know, so spot on as so many people kind of stand on the sidelines, never playing the game. They're just watching it right? And I think it's really important. And if there's one thing I wanted to add in terms of just a call to action from my perspective, and I think about a conversation I had with Donnie Blakey, who I know Steven knows quite well. I don't know Belinda, if you knew Donnie before he passed, but he was just a brilliant guy. And he said something to me, and without the huge story of where he, you know, what it was, but the most important thing he said was it was about having or others, you know, having your best interest at heart, not our interest, kind of like what Steven was saying about being behind the medicine and put other people's best interest in your heart as well, not what you can get out of them or do and really, respect, appreciate, understand the other person's world, because so many people are going through, you know, trials and tribulations of life right now, and what we need is more understanding, you know, compassion, non-judgment, where we can actually put other people's best interest at heart and not our own. And I think that, you know, that has a huge potential to change the way people interact in this world and where they're at. So, you know, that's really, you know, you don't know where other people are at. So who are we to? You know, judge, complain, criticize, condemn, any of those things. And when we step back in a position of love, acceptance, appreciation of where we are all at on our journey, it can really make a difference. Because I know there's people out there that don't hear kind words very often, and we have the ability to impact people with our words and our actions.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** So, and I think Mark, you meant understanding, not understanding.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Yes, yes. Thank you. Belinda, that's a good one. I'm going to have to get used to using that one, because it's super powerful. Well, I want to thank you, all three of you, for being part of our conversation today. It's always an honor. I learned so much, and I get inspired as well. And I know that, you know, Steven's book is out, it's available, and we're actually having a book launch here at St. James Hall in Vancouver, so maybe Steven, you can talk a little bit about that. We're pretty excited. We're getting close.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Sure. So anyone who can walk, drive, bicycle, train, boat or fly to Vancouver, we'd love to have you with us on the evening of April 7, which is, by the way, we didn't know this when we set this date with St. James Hall, but it happens to be Good Friday, which is an interesting coincidence, you might say, or perhaps synchronicity. So at the very least it's going to be a small 'g' Good Friday. Good Friday. Excuse me, and we've been Mark you and I have been talking about it, not book launch, almost sounds a little bit, I don't know, academic or library like or dry or something like that. But really, we're painting it as an empowering celebration that Ian, you know, in my highest ideal, idealized vision of what this could be, we bring people together. We talk. We don't talk a lot. Dennis McKenna has volunteered to come in and say a few words. I've been trying to talk Belinda into coming up, but it's a long way, and she's got other things to do. And, you know, I'd love to have some more of the contributors around, but they're all far flung, so Dennis is our more local person who has consented. But we're not going to talk long, and then we're going to go directly into one of our frequently done in the past, cannabis friendly, well, call it a cannabis ceremony, but we like to call it a cannabis friendly ceremony, because you're certainly not required to, you know, imbibe any cannabis, and the ceremony itself will be equally, maybe not equally, but, you know, quite decently powerful and effective as a meditation ceremony, whether you, you know, imbibe any cannabis or not. And then we will follow that. Well, I'll hang out in a corner and sign some books if people want me to. But other than that, our wonderful world musician Chene Edgar and his incredibly talented multi-instrumental percussionist Curtis Andrews are going to do an hour or so of dance music, which, you know, it's almost impossible not to dance to the shines music. You really have to be stuck in your chair to get to not want to dance to shine. So what I'm hoping to do cannabis in that way, you know, and we haven't talked about cannabis as part of this discussion particularly, but you know, if we had more time in another context, I would want to talk about how cannabis has an important role to play in all this because of its sort of gentle ubiquity. And when understood properly, it can be considered the sacrament of peace, but it allows people to have visions and deepening of experience in a way that's quite functional in a situation like 150 people at St. James Hall. You know, you don't want to be handing out two dried grams of mushrooms to 150 people in that kind of circumstance, right? But cannabis, you can do quite safely, especially with the kind of guidance that we give them in the container that we hold for them. So my vision, my hope, is that that is an empowering thing as well as a celebratory thing. So we highly and strongly encourage people to come and join us for that. And so there's some Mark. You want to talk about how they can get info and details? Absolutely.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** But I just want to add to that is like, shine and Curtis are incredible. And I know Chris Bache, you know that. And Belinda, if you were there on Saturday night at the conference, Oh, you missed out on a special treat. I'll get you some music for it there, but oh my God, incredible, incredible experience. So just grateful for that. And yeah, you can get, if you go to spiritplantmedicine.com/events, you'll see a link there where you can get register your tickets, because all sorts of information. There's a couple of little videos and music you can sample on and right now until April, what is its 14 March 17. Till March 17. March 17, we're offering a 30% discount for anybody who wants to join us in early bird ticket, and that's going for another few days. So if you're watching live or after the fact, now is the time to save on that. And we look forward to really having a great evening of, you know, community connection ceremony, some medicine for those who are interested, and, of course, some epic music and dance with curves and shine. It's just really incredible. So if there's any last words anybody would like to share before we wrap it up, because I'm going to play a little video, a little video of the event that's a minute as we close off. But Belinda and Chris, if there's anything you'd like to add, we'd love to just have you send us off. No.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Thank you. Thank you for this conversation. It's been really beautiful. Thank you.</p>
<p>**Panelist: ** And likewise. Thank you and Steven, thank you for your vision to bring together all the voices that you brought together in the book, and for everything that you do, and you and Mark do to facilitate community around the awakening of our time in history. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Okay, well, and I would like to thank, well, Mark for, you know, Mark for you being so supportive of all this, you know, for one thing, and Belinda and Chris for being so generous and giving your time for this as well. And really, I'm not exaggerating both of both of you, the things that you've said today have just really touched me. They've been really brilliant. So thanks a lot for that, and.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** Thank you for your kind words, everyone. And Steven, you know, it's just one way of me just sharing the message I'm all about. How do we transform our lives? What are the tools? What works? And the medicine brought me to this, and so I'm just here to help you know, these great, visionary and indigenous voices speak out. It's what I want to be part of supporting for a change in the world, and this is one of the vehicles that I believe is very powerful to do that. So I'm just honored to be able to share space, share time, and help everybody share their message. So thank you so much. And with that being said, I'm going to play a little video here as we sign off, just a little bit about the event and what's going on, and you'll get to sample a little bit of music. So here we go. Thanks again, everyone.</p>
<p>**Stephen Gray: ** Please do not underestimate how deep we can go individually and collectively with this. And I say that from experience.</p>
<p>**Marc Caron: ** This all awesome. Well, thank you all for joining us. That's just a little teaser and a taste, but if you go to the website and take a look, there's a 10-minute version of that whole soundtrack that shine and Curtis were playing that you can go enjoy, because it's really quite epic. So thanks again, everyone until next.</p>
<p>**Belinda Eriacho: ** Great day. Everyone bye. Thank you again.</p>

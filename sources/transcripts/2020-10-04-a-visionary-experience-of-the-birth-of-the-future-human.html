<p>Chris Bache: 
We are a planet in crisis. This is very clear. Everyone knows the list of challenges we’re facing: expanding world population, unchecked industrial pollution, escalating climate disruptions, increasing drought with the associated forest fires, warmer oceans with stronger hurricanes, rising sea levels, collapsing water tables, species extinction, fished-out oceans, extreme economic inequality, unprecedented refugee migrations, unstable, interlocked national economies, cities and nations going bankrupt, stockpiled weapons we dare not use—and no end in sight. It’s not an extreme statement to say that we are a planet on fire. Subtract a few from this list or add a few, and cumulatively the list is overwhelming. What I’d like to do today is share a perspective on the world crisis we are entering—and that will continue to deepen in the years ahead—based on the teachings I received during my psychedelic experiences, which I report in LSD in the Mind of the Universe. But first, a little background to set the stage for the visions I’m going to share.</p>
<p>The visions I’m sharing today come from my work—Diamonds from Heaven, or LSD in the Mind of the Universe. My psychedelic lineage is squarely in the tradition of Stan Grof. His early books published in ’76 and ’80 were the foundation of my work and determined the methodology I used. Those who know Stan’s work know he differentiates clearly between two modes of working with psychedelics: low-dose psycholytic therapy, designed to uncover layers of the unconscious slowly and gradually with a therapeutic focus; and psychedelic therapy, a very different method using high doses to trigger near-death experiences in terminal patients, giving them a sense of where they were going when they died and relieving death anxiety. I chose to work with very high doses. I saw that if this could be done safely a few times, it could be done safely more than a few times. I did 73 high-dose LSD sessions over 20 years, between 1979 and 1999. At the end of my journey, I realized I had gone places and had experiences not covered in early descriptions of psychedelic therapy, so I coined the term “psychedelic exploration” to describe this protocol: working therapeutically—in complete isolation with eyeshades, headphones, a sitter, carefully protected and totally isolated—and then going very, very deep. The difference between psychedelic therapy and psychedelic exploration is the number of sessions—the high number of sessions.</p>
<p>Though the method was extreme—500 to 600 micrograms is a very high dose of LSD—and I do not recommend this protocol today, there were circumstances in my world that allowed the work to be very grounded. For all 20 years, I followed the same protocol: the exact same set and setting, the same sitter, the same substance at the same dose level, even the same location in Northeast Ohio, and the same recording process. Stabilizing all these variables created a very strong platform that allowed particularly clear access to the deep consciousness of the universe. Entering deeper and deeper states of consciousness and digesting them as carefully as I could, I kept track of all my sessions, noting dates, and making a detailed record within 24 hours after each session.</p>
<p>When you work in a sustained fashion with powerful psychedelics at high doses of LSD, you don’t go through one death and rebirth; you go through a series of deaths and rebirths. Our time-space identity—our ego—dies, and one enters spiritual reality. Repeating this surrender leads to deeper encounters with the structures of existence. I follow Stan in adopting his vocabulary to describe these states as the psychic level of transpersonal experience, the subtle level, and the causal level. LSD is sometimes likened to a nuclear bomb of the psyche—developed in the same decade as the nuclear bomb. A sustained, very intense psychotherapeutic process sets in motion a catalytic energy sustained over years. Sessions get deeper and deeper in a sustained fashion. It’s not unlike a nuclear explosion revealing deeper levels of the atmosphere: they were always there, but previously invisible, and now the force brings them into awareness. This is just an analogy, but in sustained psychedelic work, you don’t simply start over at the beginning of every session; one session starts where the previous left off. You go deeper and eventually enter discrete levels of consciousness with their own rules. You acclimate and learn to become consciously aware at these depths. We’re not talking about nuclear bombs—we’re talking about entering the mind of the universe, the great expanse of consciousness. Some would call it God or the Divine; I prefer the mind of the universe, the mind of the cosmos. In my journey into this vast consciousness that holds all existence, I went through multiple layers, experiencing deaths and rebirths along the way.</p>
<p>I differentiate five core levels of reality that I was working with in my sessions: the personal mind (one’s personal unconscious), the species mind, the archetypal mind, causal oneness, and what I call the diamond luminosity—the source of the name Diamonds from Heaven. Briefly correlating chapters of the book with this model: at the level of personal mind, “Crossing the Boundary of Birth and Death” (what Stan calls the perinatal level) describes entering a complex domain where birth and death intertwine, leading to ego death and entry into spiritual reality. At the level of species mind, there are three chapters: “The Ocean of Suffering,” “Deep Time in the Soul,” and “Initiation into the Universe.” I skip the introductory methodology and a typical session day; these chapters deal with visionary content.</p>
<p>When I entered the ocean of suffering, I engaged vast stores of suffering for two years. I experienced myself as thousands of human beings spread over thousands of years, experiencing great rage, violence, and abuse on a collective scale. I came to conclude this work was not about healing my personal psyche or deepening my personal ego death; the intelligence of the universe was using my sessions to bring therapeutic release to the collective unconscious of my species—to the collective unconscious of my family. “Deep Time in the Soul” was my first entry into what I call deep time, which lies outside linear time and space. It’s not eternity or timelessness; it’s a different modality of temporal consciousness. For a year and seven sessions, I experienced my complete life, start to finish, as a simultaneous whole. It was both ahead of me—yet to be lived—and already lived, visible in its entirety. Deep time deepened in “Initiation into the Universe,” where I was taken far beyond personal concerns into instructions and initiations into the functioning of the universe. It’s here the story I’m telling today began, in the middle of this work.</p>
<p>Entering the level of archetypal mind is described in “The Greater Real of Archetypal Reality,” a domain beyond the species mind, engaging archetypal forces responsible for creating time and space and for the emergence of forms within them. Then a level of causal oneness, where the world ceases to operate in parts—even the very large parts of archetypal reality. The parts dissolve, and the universe is experienced as a single organic whole, a single consciousness, dissolving all boundaries between beings and levels. I experienced the universe as a single, living, pulsing, throbbing singularity—a oneness that underlies all differentiation. The diamond luminosity story is told in chapter 10. It reflects four years of work and 26 sessions, during which I entered the state of diamond luminosity only four times. The remaining sessions in that period were spent in very intense cleansing as my system acclimated to the enormously powerful energies present in these very pure states—what I call the diamond luminosity, what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. After that came the final year of visions—a final vision over four sessions. But the missing chapter here—the one I want to talk about today—is “The Birth of the Future Human.”</p>
<p>This story completely surprised me. When I began, I thought the work was about personal healing or enlightenment—some type of personal transformation—yet my work seems to have been profoundly connected to the work our species is doing in history: collective purification and collective transformation. In “The Birth of the Future Human,” I summarize teachings given to me over about 15 years. It started in session 22, in the “Initiation into the Universe” material. It continued through “The Greater Real of Archetypal Reality” and “The Benediction of Blessings,” and into the final vision material. Session 70 gave me one final installment in the vision of what is happening in our time. In that chapter, I discuss two bodies of visions. The first I call the “visions of awakening,” a series I received between 1991 and 1994 over about a dozen sessions, divided into six themes: divine love, all humanity, a guiding intelligence, our species as a single being, collective purification, and the future human. The second is one session from 1995 that I call “The Great Awakening,” when I was taken deep into the future and experienced the death and rebirth of humanity.</p>
<p>What I’d like to do is share these visions with you in a more experientially oriented way. I could talk about them, but I’d like to try to share them in a way that invites you to hear them at a deeper level than simply my talking about them—reading a condensed version as I recorded them. The spoken word has an initiatory power that description alone doesn’t have. I’m not going to put them in much context, except to remind you there was a great price paid for receiving these visions, and that when I say “visions,” I don’t mean things I saw from a distance. At this level, one learns by becoming; you become the reality you are seeing in order to know it deeply. I know these visions may sound extreme or exotic; they are statements that come out of years of sustained psychedelic work.</p>
<p>First: divine love. In the early “Initiation into the Universe” material, I was taken back to the beginning of creation and experienced creation as an act of supreme love. I was overwhelmed by extraordinary cosmic love coming at me from every direction—unlike anything I’d ever known. To awaken to this love was to remember a primordial decision I had somehow participated in: all of us had voluntarily chosen to be part of the evolutionary process of creation, which was motivated and driven by cosmic love. I then experienced all the suffering humanity had endured throughout history as taking place inside this love. I realized that all the suffering inherent in evolution was noble beyond words—part of a cosmic plan we had entered into freely, however unconscious of this fact we have become. The nobility of great suffering, voluntarily shouldered in the name of divine love—suffering stretching across millions of years, suffering so inscrutable it would be used as evidence that the universe was devoid of compassion—this was the nobility of humanity’s gift to the creative intelligence of our universe. This vision set the context for all that followed: no matter how hard the times we are entering, it is all taking place in the context of the divine love that inspired creation—and our free choice to participate in response to that love.</p>
<p>Second: all humanity. Out of the seething desires of history, the violent conflicts and the schemings of individuals and nations, a new awareness was driving forward in human consciousness. Its birth in us is no less difficult or violent than the birth of a new continent. It drives upward from the floor of our being, requiring a transposition of everything that has gone before to make room for its new organizational patterns. The difficulty is describing the enormity of what is being birthed. The true focus of this creative process is not individuals, but all humanity. It is trying to awaken the entire species. What is emerging is a consciousness of unprecedented proportions: the entire human family integrated in a unified field of awareness, the species reconnected with its fundamental nature, our thoughts tuned to Source consciousness. The scale took my breath away. This jarred my horizon, because coming out of traditions focused on the awakening of individuals, this showed me that underneath that, a deeper process was taking place: the creative intelligence of the universe was working to awaken the entire species.</p>
<p>Third: a guiding intelligence. I saw humanity climbing out of a steep valley, and just ahead on the other side of the mountain was a brilliant, sun-drenched world about to break over us. The timeframe was enormous. After millions of years of struggle and ascent, we were poised on the brink of a sunrise that would forever change the conditions of life on this planet. All current structures would quickly become irrelevant. All truths would quickly be rendered passé—a truly new epoch was dawning. The lives of everyone living in this pivotal time in history were helping to bring this global shift about. Though we did not know the deep future at a personal level, there was a more encompassing level of consciousness that could see it very clearly. Individually, we humans could not see what was coming, and so did not understand why things are the way they are. Isolated from the future, the present makes absolutely no sense. To be ignorant of what is being built is to be functionally blind. And our species is not blind. There is an intelligence within it guiding it—an intelligence that knows the future and is preparing us for it as systematically as we prepare our homes for the change of seasons.</p>
<p>Fourth: our species as a single being. I was taken deeper into the unified field of existence and experienced the dynamics of humanity’s awakening as movements being initiated and orchestrated by a single integrating intelligence. I experienced the evolution of our species as the systematic growth of a single organism—a unified being that all of us are part of. The subtlety of the cooperation of the parts with the whole was extraordinary. Experiencing the incredible diversity of our species as a single unified field made many events clearer. New patterns sprang into view, and the patterns made transparent sense. Nothing in our theological or philosophical systems does justice to these facts. The unified field of humanity was moving decisively and precipitously to become more aware of itself. Previously it had existed as an extended fabric, largely unconscious of itself; now it was waking itself up. Visually, this took the form of energy coming together in swift, contractive spasms that created bright flashes of awareness. I repeatedly saw extended webs of energy suddenly contract and explode in brilliant flashes. In the past, these flashes had been swallowed by the inertia of the collective psyche and had not endured. Now, however, the flashes were beginning to hold their own and to connect with other flashes occurring around the planet. As I trace the Black Lives Matter movement, I think of this vision—the contraction and the explosion of light throwing illumination on these dark shadows in our culture.</p>
<p>Fifth: collective purification. When an organism is called from within to become more conscious, it must first cleanse itself of the psychological byproducts of living at its lower level of awareness. It must bring forward the residue of its past and purge that residue in order to lay the foundation for a more refined level of operation. Our species was doing this wholesale and with great determination—by crystallizing within itself generations that embody our toxic legacy. It was the coordinated exercise of the self-evolution of the species as a whole. The poisons of humanity’s past were being brought to the surface in us, and by transforming these poisons in our individual lives, we were making it possible for divine awareness to enter more deeply into future generations. We had volunteered for this role, for both our personal good and the collective good. I saw that this century formed a watershed into which the karmic streams of history were flowing and, as this process came to fruition, the future condition of our species would be beyond anything we might project from our current state of fragmentation. The present form of humanity is transitional. We are cells in a super-organism intent on rapid change. Our very constitution—the form of our species—is a stage in a longer evolutionary journey.</p>
<p>Sixth: the future human. At one point, I was given a brief experience of the future human we are becoming. I was carried deep into the distant future and allowed to experience what will be the abiding state of humanity at that time. What a magnificent being. Just touching it filled me with rapture, calm, and sheer delight. It felt clear, warm, and whole. There was an abiding sense of oneness that went deeper than the feeling of being interconnected; it was a feeling of being truly one underneath the diversity of life. Such expansiveness, such breadth of being—fully embodied spiritual realization, the tantric awakening of our entire species, spirit and matter in perfect balance. This penetrating glimpse transfixed me. Its beauty, grandeur, and simplicity pierced my heart.</p>
<p>For four years, in the background of many sessions, these messages kept presenting themselves, filling in the blanks, helping me understand what was taking place in history at a deeper level: that we were on the cusp of a profound spiritual awakening, that we had entered into this voluntarily, and that everything happening to us was part of a larger cosmic plan rooted in the love the creative intelligence shared with us in the act of creation itself. They gave me a sense of what was happening—why things were unfolding as they were, why the ocean of suffering and these collective purification processes. They focused me on the question: how can the entire species be awakened? What will it actually take for humanity to make this quantum jump in awareness? The visions of awakening showed me this was the project of history, but nowhere did they show me how nature—how the creative intelligence of the universe—was going to pull this off.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my psychedelic journey continued. After “The Benediction of Blessings,” I entered the diamond luminosity work. I had entered diamond luminosity twice, with two more to come. About once a year, I was entering the ecstatic bliss of diamond luminosity. Then, right in the middle of that sequence—when I expected to be taken again into diamond luminosity—I was taken instead into the death and rebirth of the human species. There was nothing personal about the state I was in, not even the residual personal of individual ecstatic awakening. There was a wholeness about it that was species-wide. As often happens in these sessions, experience preceded understanding; I began to experience new things, and only slowly did I get my bearings. This is the Great Awakening session that took place in 1995. After a long personal cleansing process and a long introduction, I dissolved into the species mind completely and had the following experience.</p>
<p>In a field of relative calm, a small anxiety began to grow. Slowly, people were looking up and becoming alarmed. Humanity was waking up in alarm to events that had overtaken it. Conditions got worse and worse. People became more and more frightened as the danger increased, forcing them to let go of their assumptions. At deeper levels, there was less and less for people to hold on to—fewer givens they could assume: how they would live, where they would live, what they would do for a living, how society was organized, what could be possessed. The world as they knew it was falling apart. Decades were compressed into minutes, and I felt people’s fear deepen as they lost more and more of what they considered the normal and necessary structures of their world. Step by step, events were forcing a rapid reassessment of everything in their lives. The events that had overtaken Earth were of such scope that no one could insulate themselves. The level of alarm grew in the species field until eventually everyone was forced into the melting pot of mere survival. We were all in this together. Families were torn apart—parents from their children, children from each other. Life as we had known it was shattered at the core. We were reduced to simply trying to survive. For a time, it looked as though we would all be killed, but just when the storm was at its peak, the worst of it passed and the danger slowly subsided. Though many had died, many were still alive.</p>
<p>As the survivors began to find each other, new social units began to form—parents and children from different families joined to form new types of families. Everywhere, new social institutions sprang into being that reflected our new reality—new ways of thinking, new values we had discovered within ourselves during the crisis. Every aspect of life was marked by new priorities, new perceptions of the good, new truths. These new social forms reflected new states of awareness that seemed to spread throughout humanity like a positive contagion. These new social forms then fed back into the system to elicit still newer states of awareness in the people, and the cycle of creativity between the individual and the group spiraled. The whole system was becoming alive at new levels, expressing itself in previously impossible ways. It was as if the eco-crisis had triggered the myelination of nerve cells in our species brain, allowing new and deeper levels of self-awareness to spring into being. Repeatedly, there was the message: these things will happen faster than anyone could anticipate. Because of the hyperarousal of the species mind, thousands of fractal images drove this lesson home again and again: faster than anyone can anticipate. The pace of the past was irrelevant to the pace of the future.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes, there were other components that were shown to me over the course of my long journey. Many sessions were spent exploring the dynamics of reincarnation and what I came to call the birth of the diamond soul—where all of our former lives eventually come together and fuse into a singularity. In that fusion, there is a release, an explosion of diamond light inside us, opening us to a completely expanded sense of identity. Ego yields to soul; the small world of the present body-mind yields to the much, much larger world of the soul that travels in and out of time effortlessly.</p>
<p>So to summarize, the core vision that came from my sessions—what helped me personally understand what's happening in history now under our feet—is that humanity is coming into a time of profound transformation: a shift in the collective unconscious of our species, a shift in the archetypal blueprint of humanity, and a profound awakening into oneness. But for there to be this great awakening, there must first be a great death. We must be emptied of the old before the new can emerge. We must surrender our smallness, surrender the ego’s constant self-cherishing, with all the divisions it brings between races, religions, classes, nations, and even species.</p>
<p>I believe we are entering the dark night of our collective soul. All mystics go through the dark night before awakening into the bliss of oneness. They endure a time of intense purification. And now I think humanity as a whole is entering the dark night of its collective soul—a time of emptying, of intense anguish, of loss of control and breakdown, a global purification unto death that will last generations. But through this hard labor, we will give birth to something truly extraordinary: more than just a new civilization. What is emerging is nothing less than a new order of human beings. Through the global systems crisis, our planet is giving birth to the future human. A higher form of humanity—the diamond soul—is being born in history, and we are all part of its birth.</p>
<p>I believe that each one of us, before we incarnated, knew what we were getting into and consciously chose to come at this time and place in order to participate in and contribute to the spiritual awakening of humanity. Thank you very much. I think we have a few minutes, if we can, to handle some questions. I’ll turn this back over to Jason and Jeanette.</p>
<p>Jeannet Weurman: 
Hi—gosh, I’m all choked up. Chris, that was beautiful. Thank you. Let’s have a look at the questions. There’s one from Katie Carr. I’ll read it: She’s intrigued by the centrality of the human species in these visions. It seems anthropocentric, given that we invented the concept of species. What is the place of non-human life in this expanded consciousness?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Let me take this first one, and then you can ask the second. This is a really important question. I have friends who have spent a great deal of time at the interface of the human species and animal species, even immersing themselves into various animal species with various insights. My work has not been like that. It has been really focused on the human species, and I don’t know why, except for one thing: I think the human species is the most dangerous species on the planet right now. It is the imbalances of the human psyche that are placing the lives and well-being of other species in peril. If we can heal and make whole the human species, then the other species will be saved and safe on our planet.</p>
<p>My best understanding is that my work focuses on the human species not because it denies the importance of other species, but because it’s trying to get at the problem where it lives. Right now the problem lives inside the human heart and our insensitivity to the larger, deeper rhythms of life that we share with all other life forms on our planet.</p>
<p>Jeannet Weurman: 
I hear that—the biggest potential for purification is right here with us.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Essentially, if the human species can be fixed—if it can be awakened—everyone will be safe on the planet. If we don’t save ourselves and wake ourselves up, then all life forms will continue to be in danger.</p>
<p>Jeannet Weurman: 
Thank you. The second question was: after this incredible gift of realization—big question—what have you been doing with your life for the last 20 years?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Good question. I spent 20 years really thinking about these sessions and trying to understand them. It takes a long time to integrate experiences this deep. Much to my surprise, coming down the mountain of these visions was almost as difficult as going up the mountain. The last chapter of the book is called “Coming Off the Mountain,” where I describe some of the challenges I faced coming away from the visionary state and re-entering a fully grounded condition.</p>
<p>I continued to teach for a number of years, but I couldn’t talk about my psychedelic practice openly until I had retired from the university. I love teaching, and if I had let people know what I was doing, it would have terminated my academic career. I continued to take care of my children, to shepherd them as best one can into their adult lives. I’ve tried to deepen my spiritual practice. I’ve always been a meditator, always done some form of spiritual practice, which I think is really important if you’re going to enter what I would call the path of temporary immersion—working with psychedelics. It’s important to have a stable daily spiritual practice that takes care of your body and mind and helps you integrate these extreme swings of energy and the extreme ideas that pour into us during a psychedelic session.</p>
<p>So I’ve been digesting my work and finishing out my life process. In the middle part of my life, I retired from the university. I did a little more teaching, but basically wrapped all that up by about 2015. It took me five years to write this book, even though I had all the sessions beforehand. It took me a long time just to get myself into the psychological space where I would be willing to share these experiences, because they are so personal and intimate, about my relationship with the divine. It took me a long time before I was willing to let anyone have access to such deep places within my own life history. But Spirit kept telling me, “No, you don’t have the luxury of being private right now. It’s all oars in the water. Things are speeding up. People will be able to use your work to strengthen and support their own life’s journey as we go into this time in history.”</p>
<p>Right after I’d finished my sessions, Spirit said to me in my meditation, “20 years in, 20 years out,” which meant it would take 20 years for me to digest all the gifts I had been given in that 20-year journey. And it just so happens that Diamonds from Heaven was published 20 years after I stopped my last journey.</p>
<p>Jeannet Weurman: 
Thank you. I’m really, really grateful that you started so young and have shared with us.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thank you. Katie, yes, I did start young. I did this work when I was 30 to 50, and I’m now 71.</p>
<p>Jeannet Weurman: 
Thank you. Okay, is it okay to move to the next question? The next one is from Jamie Mills. Jamie asks: As someone with children, trying to hold this aspect in awareness, I often struggle with the normalcy of life alongside an awareness of what is to come. Do you anticipate seeing these changes in your lifetime?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I want to emphasize that in my visionary work, I was never given any particulars of how or when it was going to manifest. It appeared to be a global crisis triggered by global climate change—ecologically driven—that impacted the political, economic, and social processes. But in terms of when or how, specifically, no content whatsoever. I was shown that it was happening, that it would be happening. I was shown some of the mechanisms of the process, and specifically the role the collective psyche would play in catalyzing this change under our feet as quickly as needed for us to survive our foolishness.</p>
<p>I have children, like many of us here, and I’ve been surprised, frankly, with COVID-19, how quickly we escalated into a sense of global crisis—how quickly the rug was pulled out from under many of our feet and we had to rearrange our lives dramatically. To me, the pandemic feels like an overture to a symphony. It starts the process. It touches some of the themes of the process we’re getting into, but it is not itself the key crisis. It is the beginning of a series of punctuated crises that will move and deepen in the years ahead.</p>
<p>We’re not powerless. How we respond in the next 10 years will be very important for how deep this crisis will be. I think we’re beyond the point of being able to stop it, but we’re not beyond the point of being able to influence it. During my lifetime, I expect to watch it begin, but I don’t think I’ll watch it finish. I think that work will fall to our children and our children’s children. I suspect this will last generations, because we’re talking about the pivoting of an entire planet, and that will take time.</p>
<p>One author who has laid out the escalating scale of the crises we’re facing is Duane Elgin. His latest book, Choosing Earth, is data-driven, not visionary-driven. He’s been monitoring international forecasts for decades, crunches the numbers, and lays out the next five decades, decade by decade, showing how these crises are likely to compound. The whole last part of the book is “What can we do?” We don’t have to take this lying down—nor should we. We need to get up and mobilize at two levels: inwardly, doing our spiritual homework and confronting the shadow we’ve carried into this time in history; and outwardly, supporting the healing of the collective psyche and confronting the shadow it has brought into this time. There’s plenty of work to be done. Thank you.</p>
<p>Jeannet Weurman: 
We’ve got a couple of minutes. Do you want to take one more question, Chris?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yeah, one more is fine.</p>
<p>Jeannet Weurman: 
From a Christian perspective: could your vision of the “future human” refer to something like heaven? What you describe sounds a lot like Christian descriptions of heaven, though you situate it on Earth. Is there a way to integrate your insights with Christian teachings, and has Christianity played a role in your explorations?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Certainly Christianity played a role in my exploration. I was raised in the Deep South—in Mississippi—and I was raised Catholic. I got a good shake from the Catholic Church; I have no complaints about my experience. In fact, my first vocation in life was to be a Catholic priest. I was in the seminary for three years in high school and one year in college. I left that behind to choose a different course—a course with children, a course with marriage.</p>
<p>My life has been deeply influenced by all the spiritual traditions of the world—I taught world religions for years, and I consider them all dear friends—but the two that have influenced me most deeply are Christianity and Buddhism. I think you’re absolutely right: what we’re looking at is heaven on Earth. That is the vision moving forward—an embodiment of heavenly states of consciousness in our physical existence.</p>
<p>Stepping back, all the religions of the last 5,000 years have been what I would call “up-and-out” cosmologies: you achieve salvation or awakening, and once you achieve that state, you leave. The Hindu word for enlightenment was moksha—escape—escaping time and space. I think those cosmologies got half the message, but lost half the message. They represent incomplete visions of history because they leave unanswered the question: What is the purpose of time and space? What is the purpose of this magnificent universe? It’s been called a veil of suffering, a place to get out of as quickly as we can to return to divine bliss. I understand that, given the historical period when we began to have experiential access to deep divine truths. Naturally we would feel drawn to being there, and if we could not realize those truths here, we would want to be there.</p>
<p>But deeper truths are coming into our awareness today. The more we understand the extreme age of the universe—how much intelligence and effort have been invested in unfolding it for 13.8 billion years, and will continue for billions more—the more we begin to see a different vision for humanity. Our goal is not to awaken and leave; our goal is to awaken and incarnate divine consciousness here, in our body, on this planet, and in this process cooperate with taking creation to a new developmental level. Truly heaven on Earth: fully awakened spiritual consciousness in our physical bodies—our egoic mind-body consciousness exploded into the larger consciousness of the soul, another Christian theme—a soul textured with all of its former life history, a tremendous expansion of the human heart through countless relationships across centuries, and an expansion of the human mind as we open more easily and naturally into the divine consciousness that nurtures all.</p>
<p>I think it’s very compatible with the Christian vision, once we understand and make a couple of small adjustments. Thank you.</p></body></html>

      <p>Andrew Holecek 
Everybody, Andrew Holecek here, and I simply cannot contain my excitement about my guest today, Dr. Christopher Bache. With a brief introduction, we’re going to launch into what I believe will be a revelatory, provocative conversation. Chris, PhD, is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Medical Studies, an emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory board of Grof Legacy Training. Chris’s passion has been the study of the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. An award-winning teacher and international speaker, he has written four books: Life Cycles, a study of reincarnation in light of contemporary consciousness research; Dark Night, Early Dawn, a pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness; The Living Classroom, an exploration of collective fields of consciousness and teaching; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe, the story of his 20-year journey with LSD. Chris is a father of three and lives in Weaverville, North Carolina, with his wife, Christina Hardy.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, Chris, where do we start? First, thank you, my dear friend, for taking time out of your busy schedule to talk with us. I’ve been looking forward to this one for a while. Just a few preparatory comments before we launch in. I’ve read a fair amount over the years—I love to devour books—and I have to say, I have never read anything like your last book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe. Out of all your books, this is the one I want to focus on, because it stretched my mind open and challenged me; it created both tremendous resonance with my own path and also some dissonance. That’s a great way to make modern music, right? Maybe we can create a symphony of sanity with some questions—of which there is no shortage. One preparatory comment: the eco-philosopher Timothy Morton talks about “hyperobjects,” like climate change—things so enormous they defy description and bend the mind. It’s no exaggeration that your book and your journey are a hyperobject to me. To give our listeners a rough idea of what we’re going to be talking about, perhaps give us a long elevator pitch. Okay, we have a thousand floors to ascend, right? Share a bit about this book before we get into the weeds and I start exploring particular topics with you.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Well, I know it’s a radical book, and I think we are at a pivot point in history. Psychedelics represent a major transition—a true historical before-and-after point—with respect to philosophy, not just psychology. They generate not only a new therapeutic protocol for healing the personal psyche, but, literally, a new way of doing philosophy. It’s not really new; it goes back to the Eleusinian mysteries and the Ayahuasca traditions in Brazil. I got involved right out of graduate school. I had just finished my PhD from Brown University and went to work in Ohio at Youngstown State. I was looking for where to continue my research. I was a deeply convinced agnostic at the time and encountered realms of the human unconscious in Stan Grof’s first book, quickly followed by his methodology book, LSD Psychotherapy. This was 1978 when I began graduate school, and I saw the significance of his work for philosophy, for my tradition—philosophy of religion. I knew I needed to do this work, that the people making the most substantive contributions to my discipline in the future would be people writing out of an experiential basis, not simply an intellectual basis.</p>
<p>So I began to work privately. I split my life in two. In my day job I was a traditional academic—teaching courses, grading papers, going to meetings. In my private life, I began a 20-year journey following Stan Grof’s protocol. I ended up working with high doses of LSD for reasons I describe in the book. It’s a very aggressive protocol; it’s not one I would recommend today at the end of the journey. I did 73 high-dose LSD sessions. Each session was completely isolated. I was separated from the world, in what I call the psychedelic kiva—a very protected environment—lying down with a sitter. My sitter was a clinical psychologist who also happened to be my wife through all of my sessions. I wore eye shades and headphones, listening to carefully selected music to support the deepening of the process.</p>
<p>I worked for four years, stopped for six years—again for reasons given in the book—and then resumed for another 10 years. As a philosophical method, the psychedelic method involves systematically expanding the boundaries of one’s consciousness. Psychedelics in general, and LSD in particular, are amplifiers of consciousness. They don’t give you specific experiences; they make you hypersensitive for a number of hours. How you use that hypersensitivity influences what emerges over time. If you go to a concert or sit and chat with friends, you’ll have a certain level of experience. But if you approach these hours in a contemplative manner—totally internalized, isolating yourself from the world—a journey begins. It has many levels. A hypersensitive mind throws up all the fears, the things we’re ashamed of, unhappy about. Those early confrontations lead to healing. If you keep going, it goes deeper and deeper. I always recorded my sessions within 24 hours—that’s really important. The more careful you are in recording and pondering them, the clearer and deeper your next session is likely to be. So there’s a circle of learning.</p>
<p>For 20 years, I kept up this systematic practice, and then I stopped. I worked from ’79 to ’99 and didn’t publish LSD and the Mind of the Universe until 2019. I spent many years analyzing my experiences and sorting them out before I was ready to publicly release this hidden side of my life. My students never learned about my psychedelic work. I kept a firewall between my public and private life in this regard, and only after I retired from the university have I been willing to go public on this side of my life.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Even there, there’s so much to talk about. Let me ping one question. I’m a musician—my first degree is in classical piano. Briefly, why music? What was its role, and how did it help you? How did you choose it?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
There’s early research on how music influences psychedelic sessions; I reference those sources in my work. Basically, music creates a field and ambiance that supports letting go of your current physical reality—relaxing and yielding to the uprushing material from the unconscious. There are about five stages in a psychedelic session as the energy builds, peaks, and comes down. It’s eight hours of the day, and you choose music to support each stage: aggressive, long chordal sequences with powerful crescendos in the early stages; long, expansive passages in the middle; gradually tapering off into quieter and quieter music at the end. After only a year or so, I stopped using classical music, which is more commonly used. I shifted to indigenous music because I found it more powerfully evocative. It helped me let go of my conventional reality and enter unusual reality.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
That’s really interesting, Chris, because in the inner yogas of tantric Buddhism—which I know you’re a student of—the subtle body is literally in resonance with sound. When we’re touched by music, it’s the subtle body that’s touched. I appreciated your frequent allusions to Jung and, implicitly, to individuation—bringing unconscious processes into the light of conscious awareness as a vector of awakening. The subtle body is also connected to the unconscious mind. So when you work with this kind of music, it’s almost as if you’re creating an invitational harmonic in external auditory mediums that evokes correlative inner qualities, helping bring these processes into the light of consciousness. Is it fair to say that?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I think that’s fair. The subtle body is very actively involved in the psychedelic process. When you open into deeper states of consciousness, deeper states are higher levels of energy. It places enormous demands on your physical body, particularly the subtle energy body. You’re moving into highly stimulated states that are not only psychologically stimulating but energetically and physically stimulating.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
That makes so much sense. I want to put an exclamation point on something you intimated and later touch on in your book: using these agents to heighten awareness and amplify the mind. I was a student of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, and I always took his statement “LSD is super samsara” to be pejorative. Your twist was fantastically alchemical—tantric. In a beautiful way, super samsara gives you the opportunity to bring unconscious processes into awareness and confront them—an inner jihad, if you will—as a way to transform super samsara into nirvana through proper relationship. Is that one way to talk about what you experienced?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It is. Two points. First, it depends on how you meet super samsara. Samsara is addictive, distracting, alluring. If you increase your sensitivity to samsara, it can take you on a journey that just distracts you and leads you into more samsara. But if you use this opportunity in a true contemplative fashion to look deeply at the samsara that’s there, it will fall apart when you take the samsaric tendencies to their roots. Uproot them and you begin to move into deeper levels—eventually into the levels that go beyond samsara, into the bardo, and then into extra-samsaric levels of reality.</p>
<p>Second, people use psychedelics for many purposes—recreation, hyper-stimulating creativity—but three basic purposes are: therapeutic healing, which is dominant today; spiritual realization, to accelerate awakening; and, a third, cosmological exploration. The second is what got me started, like many people in the late ’70s. But very quickly that agenda fell away in my practice, partly because of the powerful protocol I adopted. Personal enlightenment wasn’t the primary modality. Collective awakening became very important—working on behalf of the human family. The bodhisattva vow came through strongly. Eventually my work settled into cosmological exploration: a long journey into what I think of as the consciousness of the universe, the creative intelligence behind and within the universe. You don’t need to explore those deep pathways to awaken spiritually; you don’t need to go into archetypal reality or back to the birth of the universe to awaken to your essential nature. So I wanted to differentiate cosmological exploration from the project of spiritual awakening. If we hold cosmological exploration to the criteria of spiritual awakening, we’ll miss what’s actually taking place.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Let’s unpack this, because it’s super important. It begs questions about the relationship between the individual and the collective, the individual and the cosmos—deep questions about the nature of mind and reality. Is it the mind that’s in the universe or the universe that’s in the mind? What exactly is the relationship between the individual and the cosmic? Part of my potential dissonance is a subtle cosmological dualism, intimating a difference between the individual and the cosmic, a sense of separation implied there. Help me tease that apart. In one of your footnotes, you say if pinned into a corner philosophically, you’d define yourself as a monist. How does monism play into this if you’re intimating a subtle dualism?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It’s only a functional dualism, which all monist traditions recognize. I’m a monist at heart, and that’s not a philosophical position—it’s experiential.</p>
<p>The deeper one goes into one’s own consciousness, eventually you come to the point where—let me back up. Contemporary scientific thought tends to see the physical world as the only world that exists, operating by mechanistic processes; consciousness isn’t in atomic or chemical processes, and somehow pops into existence at some point in evolution. There are lots of philosophical reasons to challenge that, and I align with panpsychists who believe that consciousness—or a core, originary consciousness—is present in physical or energetic reality from the start, and that consciousness isn’t added later but is part of the emerging universe from the Big Bang forward.</p>
<p>Experientially, when one shatters the personal mind—when your personal history can no longer contain what’s happening—and you excavate through the personal unconscious, you drop into a larger field of consciousness. Part of that is the species mind—the collective psyche Jung pointed to. If you keep dropping, you enter larger and larger levels until you’re in territory familiar to mystics talking about God-consciousness or all-as-one. The experience, over and over, is that the entire universe—both its physical manifestation and the mind that underlies it—is fundamentally a single organism. All life takes place within this singularity; all life is an emergence of this singularity in diversity.</p>
<p>When we first began to discover this underlying reality—the mother universe that underlies the daughter universe of the physical world—during the Axial Age, as meditation techniques or early psychedelic techniques like Soma allowed us to drop into it, it was so intoxicating and ecstasy-filled that we developed an interpretation of life saying the purpose was to get back to that. There’s nothing worth holding on to in physical reality or individuality; take the drop and put it back into the ocean. Dissolve ego back into oneness. I understand that, but I think it’s a fundamentally flawed cosmology. Now that we understand how old, big, and intelligent the universe is—how long it’s been working to bring forward evolved forms of life—to think that after 13.7 billion years of evolution, when just a few thousand years ago we became self-conscious enough to penetrate individual consciousness and discover underlying cosmic consciousness, the moment we discover that we want to dissolve and disappear altogether? Makes no sense.</p>
<p>What I learned—what I was taught in my sessions—is that the universe wants to support individuality. Not individuality imprisoned in solitary egoic awareness, but a robust individuality of what we might call the soul: open, porous, in constant exchange with the larger rhythms of life. This is the both/and position: when one awakens spiritually, one becomes more—more of an individual than before awakening. When we go deep we discover the oneness—and that oneness is the essence of our individual being. Classic Atman is Brahman: the essence of the individual is the essence of the totality. And Brahman delights in manifesting Atman, in growing Atman, and in Atman waking up to its true nature. That waking up is a stage in a larger evolutionary process of empowerment, learning to become more and more a conscious synthesis of individuality and spiritual totality.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Talk about diamonds from heaven. Let me press into something that challenges me as a practicing Buddhist. You write about feeling, from day one, a larger intelligence guiding your journey—you felt held by the Beloved. In the Buddhist tradition, a central teaching is emptiness and non-theism. How do you reconcile non-theism and emptiness with what you’re talking about? To be more pointed: how do you reconcile the Buddhist critique of theism with this notion of universal intelligence—which almost intimates a creator principle, a God, a divine transhuman intelligence that is holding, guiding, nurturing you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It’s really not difficult when you move into it. Let’s focus on the Buddhist teaching of anatta—no self—and shunyata—emptiness, which can also be translated as transparency. I endorse Buddhism’s radical agnosticism. It’s an anti-theism in the sense that it critiques every theism proposed as structurally flawed. In its place, Buddhism proposes a pure process understanding of reality: everything is dynamic, constantly changing, fluid, in process. There is no thing that holds existence by itself; you only exist in the interplay of the whole ocean of causality—karmic forces, cosmic down to species down to individual. It’s all an open system. When you wake up to your essential nature, you don’t wake up to a separate thing; you wake up to a fluid process.</p>
<p>That resonates with my experience. I experienced myself as constantly being guided and tutored in my sessions, but the nature of that consciousness that held me, broke me down, opened me, and broke me down some more never revealed itself as a being, a person, a personality. The very structure of what I was engaging kept expanding and changing. In psychedelic states you learn by becoming what you’re trying to learn about. You don’t take the ego there and have an experience of something; you shatter, dissolve, and become it. When I began to become aware of this other that was holding and guiding me, and I asked, “Who are you? What are you?” I experienced a death that dissolved me into a deeper level of reality where I discovered this was myself—a deeper level of “myself,” not my personal self. This repeated over and over for hours in one session, until it brought me into the realization that it’s an endless progression—a seamless consciousness within a vast consciousness. We are an individual consciousness confronting an infinite consciousness. How we experience ourselves at the moment of contact, as we dissolve into it, influences what arises from it. Fifteen years into the journey I discovered I would never reach the end of it. It was an infinite progression; no matter how many years I did this work, there was always more to discover.</p>
<p>That resonates with Buddhism’s critique of theism—gods with forms, gods coming out of human history—partial approximations that are partially adequate and radically inadequate at the same time. When you move beyond individual consciousness into the collective psyche, you engage the stories we’ve been telling for tens of thousands of years and the values embedded in them. There comes a point where you die out of the collective psyche, just as you earlier died out of your personal psyche. Then you move into awareness far beyond the entire human history—radically beyond, clearer than any states within the collective psyche. You realize all the stories of our religions are part of the collective psyche’s story, and there are realities far, far beyond. I think Buddhism is pointing to that phenomenon when it’s fundamentally agnostic: don’t restrict yourself to any limiting belief about God. However, we can experience the reality it’s pointing to—while our understanding of it will always be partial and fragmented.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek
Oh my goodness. Every one of these little snippets could spin off for hours. A couple of things really stood out for me, Chris—these are seed syllables for massive arenas of conversation. One is what you talk about so beautifully in your book. I haven’t read Living Classroom yet, but I just got it in the mail. It’s this radical, revolutionary pedagogical approach you describe, and I love it: the transition from a kind of Newtonian, atomistic pedagogy—individuality separate from others—to a quantum-entangled pedagogy where the connective tissue of consciousness is the mixing metaphor. You’re learning by becoming—what a fantastic thing to say. It resonates with both the Hindu and Buddhist traditions through what I call a Gnostic pedagogical arc: hearing, contemplating, meditating—ingest, digest, metabolize—until the teachings are purified, filtered from conceptual defilements into full somatic empowerment and embodiment. That’s where true knowing comes from. I love that your journey introduces a pedagogy completely resonant with the classic wisdom traditions. You experienced this through your journey.</p>
<p>I also want to come back to something that’s key to me. During my three-year retreat I experienced what you’re referring to for the first time in my life, and I wrestled with it because it was dissonant with my limited understanding of emptiness and non-theism. I felt I was being held and loved by something bigger than me. It created a rut for me: wait a second, I thought there was no externality; it’s mind-only. How can there be an external agency without capitulating to the God principle?</p>
<p>What I want to share—your book was such an inspiration—is that when I was doing guru yoga and devotional practices properly, my mind broke. I died to a limited self-sense. There was tremendous hardship and pain before that breakthrough, and the minute it happened I felt a complete container, a mandala, a holding environment of love and, dare I say—in quotations—an external agency that was holding me. Then, in the third year of my retreat, I lost something. I lost some of those initial qualities. At first it was like, where did the magical nature of mind go? I entered a kind of dark night of the soul. A female lama said something that floored me: the dakinis can bestow awakening, and they can take it away. I said, “What? What?” It felt like something had been taken away.</p>
<p>It took me decades to understand the brutal, painful, powerful lesson developing in my retreat. You mention this in the very last chapter of your book, which I thought was genius: I was getting stuck in a kind of spiritual bypassing or transcendentalism in the negative sense, dissolving into completely formless realms where I became the universe. When this agency—my term—took it away, the command in my thought bubble was: you will find me in form, or you will not find me at all. Don’t get stuck in the formless. Come back to the earth, to the immanent, into the body. That turned out to be one of the most radically challenging lessons. Over twenty years I’ve tried to incorporate that revelatory experience: it’s not about ascent into some fundamental Godhead. That’s half the journey. The other half—the evolutionary half—is riveting and molding it back into the earth.</p>
<p>I want to return to this, if you don’t mind, to help me—and many of my listeners who are Buddhists working in non-theism and emptiness—further understand this so-called agency, the Beloved, that can embrace us, that we can call on and work with, that shows we’re not alone. We can take refuge in these greater forces to help us along the path. Sorry for the long-winded interjection, but this is a big deal in my own practice life.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
Maybe as a footnote to bridge into this new wing: I think Sri Aurobindo’s critique of Buddhism is correct in that he criticizes Buddhism for not sufficiently confronting the fact of existence—the extraordinary power and majesty of existence. In rejecting anything static and anything in form—in its agnosticism and anti-theism—all of that is well and good. But he says we have to come to terms with the magnitude and genius and majesty of the universe of which we are a part. Buddhism may say, “Thank you very much, we don’t need that; what we really need is freedom from suffering. I’ll take the freedom from suffering and I’m not going to engage in metaphysical speculation.” Aurobindo’s response is: it’s not an either/or. It’s a kind of capitulation not to confront the magnitude and breadth of life. Now, moving more toward what you were describing:</p>
<p>When we do the work—purification, facing our shortcomings, letting go, immersing deeper and deeper—and we have melting experiences where we are embraced and held by orders of genius and love beyond anything we’ve ever known, one can go deeper and deeper into that. I’ve learned there are many levels of oneness, even levels of the void—the fertile void—though that seems like a contradiction. Initially, it feels like an external other because it wasn’t there before, or we didn’t experience it before. It clearly feels outside us because it’s holding us. But the more you go back and forth into that condition and out again, the more you realize you’re waking up to your own nature. Our essential nature and the universal nature are the same nature. The love that floods us from outside is also welling up from within.</p>
<p>The challenge is stabilizing those insights and bringing them into daily experience. This challenges all spiritual practice. We go on long retreats, enter subtle territories, then return to honking horns, and it’s so difficult to hold and integrate day to day. This is particularly the case in psychedelic practice—whether using psychedelics as a spiritual practice or, as I did, aiming at cosmological exploration. I pushed myself far deeper into the consciousness of the universe than I could ever internalize and stabilize in this lifetime. After I came off the mountain—after I stopped my work—I realized I had created an unwitting imbalance. I thought that because I had integrated each session thoroughly and conscientiously, I could take all these blessings with me. I learned that I had leaned so heavily into transcendence that I lost my foothold in immanence. I knew from experience that the entire universe is the body of the divine, the body of infinite consciousness. I knew I was never outside divine reality inside physical reality, but I could not hold that awareness within physical reality. Great beings can; they are our guides in these things.</p>
<p>I was kicked off the mountain by the sessions themselves. I didn’t know I was ending them; they were being ended. In my last sessions I was shown it was time to stop. One thing I learned in the process of ending is that I had to not expand or alter my consciousness in any way if those states were ever going to awaken fully inside my historical existence. I had to sit with the shell of my historical existence to fully integrate these vast bliss domains of ecstatic presence. I think I went farther than was good for me, and I’ve been in a completely different but equally important process since I stopped. As my meditation put it: there is the dying of discovering, and then the dying of keeping. I had done the dying of discovery; now I had to do the dying of keeping. That’s a different process.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek
You’re stopping my mind with every one of these. So much of this is mental yoga, stretching almost to the breaking point. A couple of questions. First, the integrity of your being—your presence, the clarity of your writing, the elegance of your scholasticism and academic predispositions—has been incredibly important for me to substantiate the veracity of your journey. It’s the real deal. But it is such a mind stretch. Along this beautiful challenge of stretching into what you call psychedelic practice—I’ve never heard that before—talk to us about this revolutionary notion. The skids have been greased by Michael Pollan, James Kingsland, Stan Grof—the amazing predecessors upon whose shoulders you now stand—so you can calmly but radically proclaim the validity of entheogens, psychedelics, as path. How do we work with psychedelics as practice?</p>
<p>And parenthetically, the importance of integration and the danger of disintegration. Were you ever afraid of going insane—that you’d be stretched beyond your capacity and snap instead of stretch? So two big noodles: first, psychedelics as practice and path; then integration versus disintegration, sanity versus insanity.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
In different interviews, I make the point that I’ve never tripped. People say, “You’ve done 73 trips.” I say, “No, I’ve never tripped. I’ve done sessions.” These are therapeutically focused sessions. In my mind I think of the Japanese term sesshin—a meditation retreat, a period set aside for intense spiritual practice. When I talk about LSD sessions, I could be talking about LSD sesshin: a period set aside for therapeutic work, spiritual work, cosmological work. Just as in a sesshin, your daily life changes—schedule, eating, sleeping, rhythms—to focus and intensify practice. The same is true in the psychedelic process.</p>
<p>The underbelly of using psychedelics as an organized practice of transformation is that it’s temporary. You only have these states for a few hours at a time, even if you use them diligently. That’s a major reason I stopped. It became too painful to keep coming back from these states. Eventually, I made a deal with my Beloved—my name for this intelligence, whatever it is—that it would not bring me back into these dimensions again until I could stay. It was just too painful to come and go.</p>
<p>Before you get to that point, you can do a lot of cleaning and healing, and you can do a lot of good for other people. After about two and a half years, I went through what Stan calls the perinatal process: reliving birth, confronting the fears of death, the fundamental existential crisis of whether there is any meaning in existence, leading to a complete shattering of individual egoic reality—an ego death. I thought, great, things will open up now. Not what happened. Everything cranked up again. The suffering got worse and expanded over two years of practice into larger and larger levels—thousands, hundreds of thousands of people, thousands of years. I had entered the hell realms. At first I thought it was a deeper level of ego death. Eventually I came to understand it wasn’t about me at all. It wasn’t fundamentally about my personal transformation or healing. It was about trying to heal some aspect of the collective psyche.</p>
<p>There is an organizational structure—a species consciousness—and the unresolved wounds of history remain not only at an individual soul level but at the species level. All the wars, the terrible things we’ve done to each other—the trauma, to the extent it’s not healed, resides as unfinished business in the collective psyche. Every spiritual practitioner who goes deeply enough, whatever their method, is often given an invitation, if they choose, to lift some of that suffering—not just from their personal life but from the collective psyche. For reasons I think are soul-choice, that became a large part of my work. There’s nothing special here. Any mother who sees a child suffering will try to alleviate it. Any father worth his salt will try to help a suffering child. If we’re given the opportunity, we try to help others in pain. That’s the normal working of life.</p>
<p>In fact, it became a mystery to me why the collective suffering stopped—why I wasn’t allowed to stay there anymore, when clearly there’s continuing collective suffering in the human psyche. I was taken into deeper levels beyond that, very difficult and challenging, but not involved with collective pain. I’m losing the second part of your question.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek
Happy to throw it back. We’ve circumambulated it but haven’t directly addressed it: fear and the place of integration versus disintegration. Did you ever fear for your sanity, especially coming back to the so-called real world? I’ve come to see psychedelics as a type of Tantra—this has been a radical change from my more conservative, traditionalist nature. There’s tremendous genius in tradition, but there are near enemies—ossification, redefining the tradition, losing tributaries of new information. I used to be disdainful of psychedelic approaches as chemical mysticism—cheap fixes. I’ve changed my tune. In Tantra, body is as important as mind; here we’re talking very subtle body—chemical body, neurochemistry. Within psychedelics as practice and path, it can fit an expanded rubric of Tantra, where chemistry is as important as the mind it evokes, in a kind of neuro-phenomenological way—using the neuro end to bring about phenomenal states. So, the role of fear and integration versus disintegration, and your ability to contain this information?</p>
<p>Chris Bache
To go through a death–rebirth cycle is always an ordeal. It always involves surrender to the unknown and yielding to the fear that’s holding your system locked in place. At advanced stages I truly did fear for my sanity, or at least I knew I was going someplace completely beyond anything I could hold on to. I couldn’t hold on to sanity as I had known it. It was like going over a waterfall. But once you go over and experience that death, you wake up in a new reality as a new kind of being—not just a new-and-improved you, but a different kind of being—where, for hours at a time, you can experience the universe as it experiences itself, completely beyond any human frame of reference.</p>
<p>One of the great gifts I got from Stan Grof was the conviction that if you let these experiences take you wherever they want—even though you don’t understand why and it’s extremely painful—if you surrender completely, they will always take you through a crisis and catch you on the other side. There’s a blessing waiting on the other side. Coming back from a session, I have no trauma from any of my psychedelic history. I can listen to the music I used, even for the most horrifying aspects, and I love it. I can talk about the difficult portions without any traumatic resonance, because when you take it all the way through, you complete the cycle. Things get bad, they get worse, very bad—and if you surrender, you move to completion, into ecstasy. What you bring back is the entire cycle: the knowledge that things get bad, and things get great. That’s the rhythm, the spiral of death and rebirth.</p>
<p>That said, you can go so far into the ecstasy, so deep into transcendence, that learning how to live with your memories becomes a major challenge. As a spiritual practice, this differs from classical practices, which emphasize smaller, more incremental expansions you can hold. I have an understanding of how the universe works, but I don’t live within that reality 24/7. Great beings do. I’m speaking out of memory—and it’s good to have memories of these realities; they changed my life—but it’s different from speaking out of an immediate, present, living experience. You can internalize so many profound memories that it becomes challenging to live with them. They haunt you for the rest of your life—in a good way. You’re haunted by the beauty of the universe. So you try to live it and embody it as best you can.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek
One of the things that struck me—what you just paraphrased—I struggled with that part of the book: the pain, the hardship, the death, the unbelievably wrenching section about dying children. It was almost too much. I hung in there, and I’m glad I did—metaphoric of your hanging in there. Is it possible the invitation was to develop a one-taste relationship to both heaven and hell—no preference whatsoever—discovering the inseparability of samsara and nirvana? At the highest stages, before the 11th bhumi, they say there is no preference. Do you think the agency was eliciting the lesson of great equanimity—relating to agony the same way you relate to ecstasy—to realize there’s fundamentally no preference for either? Does that resonate?</p>
<p>Chris Bache
I understand the teaching, and it reflects certain aspects of the journey. I’m not sure it reflects this particular aspect in a satisfying way. I have a different understanding when it comes to what I call the ocean of suffering. I don’t think everyone has to go into it. I don’t think everyone has to enter the hell realms or spend as long there as I did. People don’t need to be afraid that what I went through is a necessary part of any spiritual journey or cosmological exploration. I think my soul chose to do this before I was born. It manifested so quickly in my sessions after a couple of years, and it was such a tenacious, sustained part of my journey that I came to understand it as a soul’s choice. I say this without pride, because many beings today have made the same choice.</p>
<p>We are living in a critical time. The sins of the fathers are pouring out of us—not to put this all on men, but the limitations of our evolutionary standard up to now are pouring out, because we’re being challenged to move into our next evolutionary step—not only as individuals but as a species. The creative intelligence of the universe is trying to awaken not only individual practitioners; the game is collective now. It’s desperately trying to awaken the entire human species. The hell realms are literally manifesting on Earth as part of this collective detoxification.</p>
<p>Many beings have taken the Bodhisattva vow into their lives and are working to alleviate suffering—collectively, socially, politically, and psycho-spiritually. This century is different from earlier centuries because a boiling is taking place, a deep turning. I assume I knew what I was getting into and volunteered for this work. It’s a hard chapter to read—even though I cut it to the minimum—but I’ve had many people write me saying, “I know exactly what you’re talking about. I’ve been going through this for years,” or “I went through it and didn’t understand it; you’ve helped me.”</p>
<p>It’s not unusual once we understand the collective dynamic. We as individuals may start something, but the universe uses our initiative to accomplish its purpose—its agenda is to heal the human species, to clear out the dross holding us back, to make room for the infusion of grace, energy, awareness coming to carry humanity through this crisis. We literally cannot afford to be a planet run by egos anymore; we’re killing the planet. We need to be a planet run by awakened souls—beings with a conscious awareness of their history, who know they are not simply egos, separate private selves, but spiritual beings in dynamic relationship with other spiritual beings, including nonhuman beings in the animal kingdom. When we wake up in that way—discover how old we are, how many generations we’ve been doing this, the breadth of our relationships—naturally we make different choices. More inclusive choices. Choices for the long term, for the good of all. And right now we desperately need to be making choices that are inclusive and serve the good of all.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Yeah, that's really beautiful. With your permission—and if you don't want to go here, that's fine—I want to turn to the scientific and academic elephant in the room. How do we know if any of this is actually true? How do we address replicability? How do we know whether what you're seeing is idiosyncratic to your own biochemistry—again, in the best sense of the word, not pejorative; this is your trip. If a thousand other people did exactly what you did, could they even come close to replicating your insights, or would they have their own biological, historical, phenomenological matrix and write a different journey, a different book? The issue is the problem of proof and universality. What would happen if a thousand people did exactly what you did and came up with a thousand different visions? How certain are you that what you're experiencing is actually true, and not simply your enculturation, your unique biochemistry, and the histories that shape the narrative you’re sharing with us? Are you okay going in this direction?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Absolutely. That's a really important, foundational question. If these are only echoes from my personal psyche, or even from the collective psyche, they have a certain epistemic value, but not necessarily one that warrants broader attention.</p>
<p>I discussed this back in the first chapter of Dark Night, Early Dawn, where I outlined a psychedelic philosophy and a section on the epistemic warrant of psychedelic experience—what’s at stake in determining whether these experiences have genuine epistemic value. Ken Ring and I also had a dialogue about this. Ken is a good friend and a wonderful near-death researcher—I used his books for years in my classes. He challenged me with the same questions, and we published our dialogue online. It’s quite an essay: are deep psychedelic experiences trustworthy?</p>
<p>If it were just my experiences, that would be one thing. But here's the great value of Stan Grof’s work. He collected psychedelic reports from hundreds, if not thousands, of people over decades and integrated them into a model of what tends to happen at different stages of the journey. My experiences fit squarely within the broader phenomenology he has outlined. He provides a broad epistemic warrant for taking seriously my experiences—perhaps unusually intense or deep—but not fundamentally novel when you consider the full breadth of reports in his many books, culminating in The Way of the Psychonaut. There’s deep overlap.</p>
<p>Another point: I’m thinking of Michael sabhm, a cardiologist in the early days of the near-death episode movement. He was upset that people were returning from cardiac arrest talking about spiritual realities. He didn’t believe it and set out to disprove it. He eventually wrote a book concluding that this stuff is real, differentiating between the local event and the transcendent event. When someone is in surgery or has a cardiac arrest, they may experience leaving their body and accurately perceive what’s happening in the surgical theater, the waiting room, the hospital, even the parking lot. Then they go into the light, leaving physical reality for a transcendental reality. He said we can’t evaluate the transcendent experience directly, but we can evaluate the accuracy of the local one. He provided evidence that the local perceptions could be verified. That doesn’t prove the transcendent is true, but it boosts its credibility. The same thing happens in psychedelic work: some experiences yield verifiable information—around conditions or circumstances of birth, for example—that we can reasonably exclude having been learned through ordinary means, yet they check out.</p>
<p>The other part is cross-validation—other people having similar experiences.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Communal confirmation. Exactly.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
When people start working with psychedelics, if you took a hundred people from a hundred different socio-cultural backgrounds and trainings, they would have very different experiences because psychedelics—LSD in particular—are amplifiers. They don’t take you to a specific experience; they amplify your mind, and we each contact different strata of experience given our different histories.</p>
<p>However, Stan reports that when people go through the perinatal death-rebirth process, experiences become very concentrated and standardized. We begin to deal with universal existential issues, not idiosyncratic ones. People who navigate the death-rebirth process come back with an understanding of spiritual reality that is fundamentally compatible across individuals: there is a spiritual world that receives us. From there, it’s about evaluating our individual explorations of that spiritual world.</p>
<p>In Dark Night, Early Dawn, I brought together three areas of inquiry: psychedelic research, near-death episode research, and out-of-body research—particularly Robert Monroe’s work, founder of the Monroe Institute of Applied Science and author of three books exploring the out-of-body state. I asked whether the cosmologies emerging from these independent explorations are diverging or converging. Look closely, and they are clearly converging.</p>
<p>In my dialogue with Ken Ring, I present other reasons for trustworthiness. For every time my cultural expectations were fulfilled—given my education in world religions and comparative spirituality—I had more experiences that shattered my expectations. I learned things I was not anticipating: an understanding of reincarnation—how it works and where it’s taking us—that I wasn’t expecting at all; nothing in my conditioning suggested the birth of the future human or that humanity was approaching a crossroads. So many things were shown to me, consistently, far beyond my personal expectations, that one can reasonably conclude this is a confrontation with a reality that is not simply echoing back my expectations.</p>
<p>When you study others who push deeply into these states, you find fundamental convergence—not identical visions, but meaningful overlap and coherence. We’re at the early stages. What matters is not any one person’s experience, but developing standardized protocols, taking hundreds or thousands of people from diverse backgrounds through the same rigorous regimen of introspective work, gathering all their testimonies, and then analyzing what is consistent and what is idiosyncratic. We’re not there yet. Some elements may prove idiosyncratic to me, but I believe that when we reach that point, we’ll find much more consistency and overlap than divergence.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Oh my goodness—so many things here. What a beautiful answer. You crystallized the difference between correspondence epistemology and coherence epistemology—the truth that’s born of coherence is the kind of knowing you’re alluding to. This begs the question of aspirations. Pardon the tongue-in-cheek reference, but where do you see yourself in twenty years? Are you a shaman for our age? Not the Church of LDS, but the Church of LSD—Latter-day Saints versus LSD, right? Do you see yourself founding a church—a mandala-like container that allows future psychonauts to embrace this as a path? Otherwise, where does this go? Are you a unique and interesting blip, or are you portending a tradition of psychonauts using rigorous methodologies and frameworks? Someone comes to you and says, “Chris, I’m blown away by your book. I want to take psychedelics as a practice, as a path. What do I do? Where do I go?”</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
The first thing I always tell that person is: please don’t do what I did. Be gentler. Be more careful.</p>
<p>I think I’m a symptom of a cultural pivot. I don’t think I’m important, and as we pivot I’ll disappear under the wave of history as an early explorer. We did about twenty-five years of serious work, and then in 1969–70 it was all made illegal. We went into a long dry period until 2014, when Scientific American ran a front-page editorial essentially saying it’s time to let scientists—not politicians—determine whether psychedelics have therapeutic value. Now there’s a renaissance. Universities worldwide are establishing centers to study psychedelics. We’re starting, as in the 1950s, with therapeutic applications under controlled scientific conditions: PTSD, addiction, death anxiety, depression. That’s where we ought to be—rigorous protocols, documentation, brainwave pictures, and so forth.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, we’ll discover what serious researchers like Stan Grof and that early generation—Ralph Meister and others—found: these substances have philosophical value, not just psychotherapeutic value. They offer deep insights into the structure of the psyche and even the cosmos—into the cosmology of mind. People with PhDs in physics or astronomy can literally come back with deeper insights into the realities they’re trained to understand. I often wished I had PhDs in astronomy and physics so I could have understood more, given my humanities background.</p>
<p>As psychotherapists develop creative protocols to harness therapeutic potential, it’s only a matter of time before we develop philosophical protocols for systematically exploring these states: going in rigorously, coming back, recording, evaluating in a social context, seeking validation, and correlating with other bodies of knowledge—quantum physics, super string theory, for example. This is not about me. In twenty years I’ll be gone—hell, I don’t think I’ll be around nearly that long. It took me a long time even to be willing to share these experiences because I knew how upsetting or controversial they are. I literally thought of writing the book and having it published posthumously because I didn’t want to deal with the fallout.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Like Wolfgang Pauli in his conversations with Carl Jung—he didn’t want any of that revealed until after he died. Sorry, I didn’t mean to cut you off.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes. But the mother told me, “No, you can’t do that. We need all oars in the water. You didn’t give yourself these visions—we gave you those visions—and they were never for your private edification. You were holding them in trust.” She wanted me to share them, not because they’re “my” visions, but because they would support other people in their spiritual practice and social work to help us through this very intense time in history. All hands on deck.</p>
<p>So I did the book. I have no agenda. What’s important is the social pivot taking place—the work in graduate programs and medical schools across the country. I may be a little ahead of the curve philosophically only because of the intensity of my methodology, but not by much. For example, Bill Barnard, a professor at Southern Methodist University, a fine academic who has written on William James and Henri Bergson, is publishing a book with Columbia University Press called Liquid Light—philosophical reflections on his extended ayahuasca experiences and living with the Sante Daime community in Brazil. It’s a beautiful book and symptomatic of more academics willing to go public—not just recording experiences, but evaluating them critically and offering them to an ongoing historical discussion. We’re making this pivot. It’s happening.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
And it’s radically brave. I want to acknowledge your bravery. This is a stretch for me; in the last couple of years I’ve discovered how conservative I am. I thought of myself as a far-out guy, but I realize I have my conservative streaks that are now being challenged—stretched open. One is the generous courage of writing a book like this. You know the traditional admonition: “He who knows does not speak; he who speaks does not know.” And here you are, speaking all over the place. I used to question that, and then the beautiful book by me. Je Rinpoche—In Love with the World: a monk’s journey through the bardo, life and death—an amazing, intimate sharing that is profoundly inspiring. Your book, in a certain sense, violates the code of secrecy, but I think we’re living in unusual times that require unusual, even extreme, measures. I applaud your courage. You are stretching boundaries in pedagogy, radical innovations in path, and courageous sharing.</p>
<p>The other tradition—to Kuhn Rinpoche said—sharing experiences inappropriately is like being in a dark cave with a candle and giving your candle away: you’re left in the dark; opportunity becomes obstacle. So this is both applause and an invitation for commentary in terms of encouraging more sharing so people can recognize a chorus of sanity emerging—radical, innovative ways of learning.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I had to face resistance around that too. In Buddhism, traditionally, you don’t talk about your experiences; it can become an encumbrance. But I’m a teacher. I love to teach. I was designed to teach—I’m a yacker. That’s what I love to do.</p>
<p>As I said in the “Coming Off the Mountain” chapter, it wasn’t simply the imbalance toward transcendence that made me sick; it was the silence I had to live with. As a philosopher of religion, I’d had the most powerful philosophical experiences of my life, and I wasn’t allowed to talk about them or do my job as an academic because of our phobia and our laws around psychedelics. Holding that information literally makes you sick inside. Writing the book was part of my self-healing, and beginning to speak about it is part of my self-healing.</p>
<p>At the same time, I have no agenda. I’m not trying to persuade anybody. I have no axe to grind, nothing to sell. I’m an old man—72 years old. The end of the diving board is getting close. This being that I am is ephemeral, short-lived. I have no attachment to using it as a model of anything. But I love to teach, and I hope the experiences are useful to others even if they never take psychedelics. I hope the vision of the universe—and its intelligence—resonates with people’s inner lives and their cognitive lives as science pushes its boundaries. We’re coming out of a period where we believed there’s no intelligence to the universe, that it’s all an accident, a mechanistic throw of the genetic dice. That’s being exploded. A veil is lifting: reincarnation as a fundamental fact of nature; emergent intelligence everywhere we look—solar systems, galaxies, the genetic code—orders upon orders of intelligence. This work accelerates our immersion into that intelligence. We’re at a pivot point, and it couldn’t come a minute too soon; we’re courting extinction if we don’t change.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
It really reminds me of what ecology scientists call punctuated equilibrium—things simmer and then suddenly flip. As you said beautifully in the book: gestation takes a long time; birth happens quickly. From the 50,000-foot view, I see what you’re intimating: as the Taoists say, correlative with the dark is the emergence of light; in direct proportion to the insanity, voices of sanity arise. If we relate properly—as Tantra says, hell is paradise; the greater the obstacle, the greater the opportunity—voices like yours become part of a chorus of sanity in this dark Kali Yuga. It’s about right view, isn’t it? If we hold that view, what you’re saying adds to it.</p>
<p>I don’t want to take too much of your time, but with your permission, a few more things. One is philosophical but relevant. When we say “that’s just theoretical,” it may be so because it’s not your experience yet. When it becomes your experience, it’s no longer theory; it’s your reality. One of the things you talk about challenges both Hindu and Buddhist approaches to teleology and purpose. On one level, the Tibetans talk about lila—divine play, rolpa—play and dance without directionality or purpose. Is it a matter of stepping out of binary thinking—either/or—and moving toward holding different views concurrently, what they call dioletheism? Jung talked about this too. So talk to us about the emerging human, which implies purpose, teleology, ends—the Omega Point. Does that fit into your experience and your understanding of what you went through?</p>
<p>Chris Bache
When the great masters talk about life as lila—life as play, creation as a dance—I don’t think they mean it frivolously. They’re not denying the intelligence and purpose in life; they’re saying life isn’t generated out of compulsion or necessity. It comes from the fullness, the excess of being, not a deficit. There’s an exuberance to life, and we express that with the metaphor of dance, because dance isn’t compelled. We dance out of joy, out of surplus, not necessity.</p>
<p>The theme of the “future human,” the emergence of the future human, was completely unexpected in my work, yet it became one of its most consistent threads and the context within which everything else took place—even the context in which I understood my entire incarnation. It first appeared in the 23rd session and recurred as late as the 70th. I’d suspend any theistic notions of mechanistic or manipulative intent; I don’t think in those terms. I hold an emergent cosmology, with an innate quality that unfolds through punctuated equilibriums, crisis points. There’s a genius at work in this that I don’t begin to understand.</p>
<p>What I can report is that when I dissolved into a larger intelligence—which existentially I was part of, but cosmologically was far larger than anything I could relate to personally—it told me a story, over and over, systematically and without contradiction for years: humanity is approaching a true turning point in its evolutionary journey, a before-and-after time. The karma of millennia is rushing into a valley, multiple rivers pouring into a canyon—nowhere to go except up. This critical time has in some way been foreseen by the great seers, saints, spiritual geniuses, prophets, awakened ones throughout history. It’s a vision shared by many indigenous traditions: we’re coming into this time.</p>
<p>About 55 sessions—roughly 15 years—into the work, time became porous for me. I was taken beyond linear time, many times, into what I call deep time. Deep time is not eternity or timelessness; it’s experiencing different spans of time from a different frame of reference. I was taken into it not as “Chris Bache”—that had dissolved long before—but into the human species mind. Whether because of the work I’d done in the ocean of suffering or for other reasons, I was taken into the future and experienced what felt like the death and rebirth of humanity: a cataclysm in which we lost control and were put through a crushing historical process. The assumptions of the past broke down; we were brought to our knees and reduced to mere survival. It was excruciating.</p>
<p>But when it was at its worst—like a hurricane passing over a Pacific island—things began to get better. Many had died, many survived; the storm passed; we picked ourselves up and reconnected. And we discovered that we had been changed at our core. The crisis opened our hearts, making us more compassionate, and opened our minds, making us more intelligent—able to integrate and access information from the intelligence of the universe itself. As we reconnected there was a snowballing effect: an acceleration of creativity, of the actualization of the values discovered in the heart of crisis. Everything felt new: a new set of values, ideas, and political and social realities emerged.</p>
<p>Later I was given more instruction on some of the mechanisms involved. This is a shift taking place at the center of the collective psyche—not just politics, society, or economics. It’s a change in the core substructure, the architecture, of the collective psyche. Just as we collect and integrate experiences over many incarnations at the soul level, the human species has been collecting and integrating its experiences at the collective level. We are poised to pivot, and after this pivot all human beings born will operate within a different collective psyche. I think we see prototypes of this psyche in Christ, Buddha, Muhammad—awakened beings with expanded hearts and compassion and deeper insights into the universe. They speak and act differently. I think we are becoming a different kind of being. That’s the consistent message that came through my work.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek
It’s literally breathtaking, Chris. With your permission, I have to bring you back at some point. We haven’t even gotten to the goodies—though this has been so rich. Your chapter on the Diamond Luminosity blew my socks off, and “Coming Down from the Mountain” brought me to tears. I don’t want to dilute the impact of what you’re saying by trying to do a shotgun distillation of 20 years of unbelievable insight into two hours. So I’ve tried to concentrate on a few heart-essence points—add a little water so we can understand them—without capitulating to my frenetic predisposition to say, “I have to ask you about this!”</p>
<p>One thing your journey seems to imply is a type of attainment—you’re alluding to extraordinary states. I’m not contesting that, but I wonder about the languaging, the branding. First, this whole “LSD thing” probably needs to be rebranded—the term is so contaminated historically. Call it entheogenic practice, or whatever. But second, perhaps the notion of attainment itself needs rebranding. There’s an intimation that you’ve left conventional reality and attained extraordinary states. But is it just as viable, if not more so, to say this is the extraordinary state—samsara—and what you’re doing is opening, receiving, surrendering? Not so much a journey of ascent as a waking down, where when you relax properly and open sufficiently, what you’re reporting is completely ordinary—you’re not going anywhere, you’re relaxing into the right here and now.</p>
<p>I say this because it can be intimidating: “I could never do that; I could never attain that.” If we look at it differently—curious if this lands with you—it empowers the immediacy of what you’re pointing to. Fundamentally, this is the nature of mind, the human and even trans-human condition. So talk to us about the false note of “path.” Even the notion of path implies going somewhere else, and in the striving you ironically leave what you’re trying to realize. “Attain enlightenment” is an oxymoron—you cannot attain enlightenment. Also, you use the phrase “coming and going,” entering and leaving states—that implies returning to a source. What about the relationship between source and essence, and the centrality of recognition? If you simply open mind and heart—meditative, pharmacological, whatever—and recognize, do you need a 20-year journey? Provisionally, maybe yes; absolutely, no. It’s right here, right now. You just need to open your divine eyes—it’s been here all along.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
I absolutely agree. There’s a lot there, so let me back up. In the early stages, as one moves into psychic and subtle levels of reality, there’s a subjective sense of opening—becoming larger. That’s why psychedelics were called “mind opening.” Later, at a more advanced stage—what Stan would call causal-level reality—everything reversed. I found myself in very large, high-energy states of consciousness, but instead of going “out,” everything converged back to right here, right now. My sessions became harder to describe because they were taking place inside ordinary reality. I wasn’t being taken outside; everything was converging. I began to think, have we misclassified these substances? They’re not mind openers; they’re mind concentrators.</p>
<p>At different levels the subjective experience can shift from opening to concentration. Or perhaps the consciousness orchestrating my journey was bringing me into a more classical spiritual awakening. But at core, a sashin is: you turn your mind, focus on the present, eliminate the outside, and go right here, right now. Purification happens, and where you end up is where you began—just with fewer distortions. Yes, Eliot. You’re cleaning the makyo, the distortions. There’s no place to go except where you already are, and nothing to become except what you already are and always have been. Reality doesn’t begin or end—no turning on or off—only relaxing into what has always been right here, right now.</p>
<p>Nothing I’m describing is original. Everything in my book can be found in the spiritual literature of the mystical and contemplative traditions. The cosmology that emerges in psychedelic research is not new; it’s old—new only in context. In the end I say the only thing of value to me in the psychedelic work is purification, purification, and purification, because it brings us into a more intimate experience of what already is. By some silly nonsense we keep ourselves out of the joy of this profound reality that is living us. So yes—it’s just purifying. That’s all.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek
This resonates deeply—acknowledging the hubris of saying “my path betokens the truth, therefore yours is true because it relates to mine.” But with that caveat, there are many resonances, especially the notion of purification. As we start to close for today, one section that really spoke to me was your interjection of the Vajrayana path, and how it might create a holding environment to support, augment, and transition—more organic, phenomenological means versus purely neurological ones. For people listening who want something to take home: what has been, and continues to be, the role of meditation and Vajrayana in augmenting, supporting, enhancing, stabilizing what you’ve gone through?</p>
<p>Chris Bache
One gift of my psychedelic experiences was a deepened appreciation for the power and effectiveness of classic contemplative practices, including Vajrayana. By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence. It taught me these practices are much more powerful than I’d appreciated working from ordinary time-space consciousness.</p>
<p>I also came to appreciate how these practices are empowered by the morphic field generated by thousands of beings doing them for hundreds of years. Transmission—the lung—isn’t just formal purity; there is an energetic transmission. The power of a practice draws on the cumulative force set in motion by countless practitioners.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’d describe myself as a Vajrayana practitioner today. I do practice and meditate, but the focus is different. In some ways, my practice is speaking. When I speak about these things, I remember them; when I remember, they become actualized within me; when they’re actualized, mind and body shift. This kind of dialogue is a spiritual practice for me. Your questions give me an opportunity to open in ways I otherwise wouldn’t today. In that context, as part of my ongoing effort simply to be useful to the universe, I practice—but not with the intention of accomplishing something beautiful, or changing what will happen when I die.</p>
<p>This may sound arrogant, but I have a sense of what will open when I die because I’ve been there—in different ways—and the universe has made promises to me. I don’t think they’re false; they’re matter-of-fact. I don’t practice to change death; I practice to change how I am right now and to be more useful to people right now—to clear my system and remember. I use my psychedelic memories in my Vajrayana practice. In Vajrayana there’s the samaya sattva and the chinana sattva—the being of practice that attracts the being of reality. We do visualizations, exercises, mudras to create an approximation of an eternal principle, by virtue of which we draw that principle into our being. I use my memories as samaya sattva to open the channels to the jnana sattva of these principles in reality. For me that’s a natural process. I do the practices, but with my own twist—and it’s understandably hard to find a teacher comfortable with someone who owns a psychedelic history the way I do.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek
Maybe that needs to change and adapt—though who are we to say? Traditions even warn against originality, which I find fascinating: on one level it preserves the elegance and irreducibility of awakened mind that’s already been discovered; on another, if we don’t evolve, we go extinct. If wisdom traditions don’t bring new tributaries of upaya—skillful means and cultural adaptations—into perennial teachings, they risk becoming dusty disciplines in stale churches.</p>
<p>Just a couple more things before we close. We started with hyperobjects—topics so large they’re hard to wrap your mind around. This has been mental yoga. Is it too ostentatious to say you’re also pointing toward hyper pedagogy? There’s tremendous power you’re releasing and serving as a shaman to. Speaking as practice, dialogue as path—that’s beautiful. But are you also intimating possibilities for accelerated learning? I resonate with this through nocturnal meditations—dream yoga, for example—which I see as a revolution in pedagogy, using the mind in the nocturnal arena to accelerate learning. Based on your experience, are there hyper-pedagogical approaches that can accelerate our evolution—held within right view, set, setting, container, safety, and a Bodhisattva ideal? The faster you go—the classic Vajrayana metaphor—jets can crash, cars are safer but slower. Is it fair to say that, related to properly, you’re pointing not only to hyperobjects but to hyper pedagogies?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think so. In The Living Classroom, I don't mention psychedelics at all. I wanted that book to be about fields of consciousness and their effects on learning—the accelerating impact of focused intentionality and energetic transmission that takes place in a classroom or any group context. The backstory is that while I was doing my private psychedelic practice—opening into the ocean of suffering, moving into very deep collective states and eventually deeper transcendent states—I never talked to my students about it. But my students began to be impacted in very precise ways. When I crossed certain thresholds, they began to cross corresponding spiritual thresholds—while I was simply lecturing on world religions.</p>
<p>It started with little things. I’d be searching for an example to make a point, and it felt like a door opened in the back of my mind, a slip of paper came through with an idea. I’d try it, and the energy in the room would shift—everything became more animated. I began to work consciously with these subtle suggestions that popped in from seemingly nowhere. A few years in, students would come up after class and say, “It’s strange you said that today or used that example, because it’s exactly what happened to me this week,” or to their mother. At first I dismissed it, but it kept happening, and the deeper my psychedelic practice went, the more it happened—and it touched deeper areas of their lives. It was as if their soul slipped messages to my soul, which slipped them to me, leading me to say things that gave them information or touched intimate places I had no way of knowing—areas needing healing or the next step in their learning. It became a characteristic part of my teaching: people being moved beyond my conscious intention, often beyond my awareness in the moment.</p>
<p>A pivot came when, lecturing one day, I looked up and saw half a dozen, maybe ten people with tears quietly rolling down their faces. I realized I had to understand what was happening. The entire book Living Classroom was downloaded in ten minutes in one session—the title dropped right in. I’d been wrestling with this, but what came helped me clarify two basic points, both hinging on the fundamental reality that consciousness has an atomic quality—separate, individual—and a quantum quality. Individual awareness is true: I know things they don’t, they come to get what I know, we test to see if they’ve got it. But there’s also a quantum reality: my individual experience is grounded in an expansive field of consciousness, as is theirs, and that activates potentials which are entirely natural. It’s like throwing a stone into a lake and the ripples spread out. When one person does deep clarifying work, it triggers clarification in the consciousness of people to whom they have karmic connection. Simple, natural.</p>
<p>So I asked: what would it be like to teach consciously in a transpersonal or integral pedagogy—one that recognizes the innate interconnectivity of consciousness? Not abandoning individual strategies that work, but incorporating focused intentionality and conscious engagement that goes beyond classical teaching. For example, ChÃ¶d is a Vajrayana purification practice. I learned ChÃ¶d for my own spiritual work. Before a class began, when I received the roster, I started incorporating those students into my ChÃ¶d practice. I would literally pray for them throughout the course—for their well-being. Not presuming I know what’s right for them, just praying for their well-being.</p>
<p>The more we activate these latent group potentials, the more we accelerate learning. I found there’s not only a collective field in the room, but a class field, and deeper still a course field—a learning and empowerment that builds over years. The individual mind is situated within a class mind, situated within a course mind. Once you see it, you begin to recognize it everywhere. If there is a hyperobject, it’s simply the connective tissue of mind. We are always inherently connected; we can become conscious of that and responsible to it in whatever we’re doing.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
And again, it’s back to making unconscious processes conscious. If you can do that, you increase levels of communication and evocation, and heighten what’s already there. So why not engage it, bring it into awareness, pay allegiance to it, surrender to it—and therefore enhance and accelerate it.</p>
<p>Chris, I want to pay homage to your time. A few last things—famous last words, it’ll be midnight. I could talk to you all day. But to wrap for now: what you’re releasing is a Pandora’s box of both wisdom and potential neurosis. Do you worry about what you’ve released? I can imagine listeners saying, “This is for me. This is my path. I want to do this,” and seeing it as a quick fix, a lazy man’s approach. Your book shows this is not for the feeble-minded or feeble-hearted; this is jihad—inner Dharma combat. So what would you say as a Dharma surgeon general’s warning—hazardous to one’s egoic health?</p>
<p>I also hear, “I don’t need to do retreat; I can just pop these pills and attain these states. The silver bullet!” People glom onto these things and run with wrong motivation and intent. And related to my experience: people go to ayahuasca retreats, have mind-blowing experiences, and then leave unsupported—no follow-up, left to their own devices. “What do I do with that?” As we close, talk to us about advisors, responsibility, shadow sides of doing this without proper set and setting. We have to throw caveats out there for those who think this is the long-awaited spiritual bullet.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Boy—no silver bullet. There are no shortcuts. There are intensifications of practice, but no getting around the fundamental laws of spiritual reality. The early idea that psychedelics were an easy path turned out to be facile and untrue. In fact, my concern is the opposite: even used conscientiously, they can be so intense that the path is too demanding. You have to be very wise in handling them.</p>
<p>I was concerned in sharing this material because it would break my heart if someone read my book, jumped into psychedelics, and injured themselves. It’s easy to injure yourself; you can open so deeply, so quickly, that you can’t handle what comes, and you can disrupt a healthy psyche in ways that can be permanently crippling. I did a lot of spiritual practice around that issue.</p>
<p>Breaking the boundaries of the personal psyche and going into deeper states is really not that difficult. We’re starting to see more attention given to integration—what constitutes a healthy practice. I offer myself as an example of a practice that was not entirely healthy. I went too deep, and it has caused me years of having to manage the joy that I knew on a temporary basis. One reason I didn’t blunt the suffering in the book—despite advice to leave it out—was because it was true, and because it shows how these substances work. They are amplifiers. They bring up our garbage; we have to confront that. Even when we do that well, we still have to manage integration wisely.</p>
<p>There’s a recent book from Inner Traditions Press, Psychedelics and Psychotherapy, focused on integration. I have an essay in there: “The Challenge of Integrating an Extreme Psychedelic Journey”—not just a single session, but an extreme journey. We need more essays and discussion about what healthy psychedelic practice looks like: symptoms of imbalance, of too much, people chasing new experiences before integrating prior ones. I’ve seen many students who have literally fried themselves—energy crispy, having gone back to the well too many times, plugged into the universe at too high a level without staying grounded. Some people have paid a price of dysphoria and psychological imbalance from entering these states.</p>
<p>Our culture lacks wisdom in the use of psychedelics. Some indigenous shamanic cultures have it; we have to learn from them. Right now, we’re using these practices in a therapeutic arena and drawing on therapeutic wisdom for integration. But as we go deeper, we have to go beyond therapeutic wisdom—into shamanic wisdom and the wisdom of the sage traditions—to learn how to integrate well. Having deep experiences turns out not to be that difficult, and not necessarily very beneficial or lasting. Julian of Norwich had one near-death experience of the love of Christ and the feminine God and spent the rest of her life unpacking it in Revelations of Divine Love. It can take years to unpack the full potential of even one experience.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will be wiser this century than in the 1960s, when we had many experiences and breakthroughs, some casualties—not as many as the popular press suggests—but did we change lives profoundly and permanently? Some, yes; not as many as we thought we would. We need to be wise and grounded in reappropriating psychedelics.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Do you worry about what you’ve released? One analogy: I’ve spent time in the Himalayas, trekked above Everest base camp. I’ve seen high-altitude sickness. You have to acclimatize; those who don’t get cerebral or pulmonary edema, and their lust for the summit can kill them. You stop, go back down, then slowly work up. So do you worry, again, about what you release?</p>
<p>This ties to what we said at the outset: this is a form of Tantra. I just wrote “Is the West Ready for Tantra?” There are prescription-strength practices—tummo, dark retreat—not designed for public consumption because they’re too powerful. You’re dealing with thermonuclear power in the subtle body. What you’re describing carries the same danger as inner yoga, where the condensed impact of your entire cosmic history is ensconced in body and subtle body. If you can’t ride that wind, you’ll be blown away. Done without proper motivation and set and setting, they won’t light you up, they’ll burn you up. This is especially important in the impatient West, where people think, “I’m just going to run with this.”</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I do worry about it. I’m glad we’re talking about it and hope for more opportunities to do so. The relationship between high-potency psychedelics as a spiritual—also initiatory—practice and the initiatory practices you’re referencing needs discussion. They can burn you up. I got rather well singed and have had to manage that.</p>
<p>There’s another side. The Mother said to me, “We did not give you these visions for you. We gave them for the people. Let them see me through your eyes—as you have seen me.” I am not important. What’s important is what was shown, and I hope that sharing it cleanly and honestly helps people in their own spiritual development. That’s my fundamental motivation as a philosopher. I trust my students to deal with information I make available, even when it jars their system or upsets their agricultural worldview. I work with them to ensure they aren’t pushed too hard and that they integrate.</p>
<p>This is a little different. I’ve said something; I haven’t set it in motion. It’s happening all around me. I’m one voice in a psychedelic revolution, trying to bring clarity to a certain set of issues. I also chose long ago not to function as a therapist or clinician, but as an explorer. I don’t work with people in sessions. That’s a different skill set and training, which I don’t have. I work with people who are training to be those clinicians, and there are many places training psychedelic elders and therapists. I’m in conversation with some of these groups—doing one this coming weekend, in fact. My role is to explore, report back, and support those doing clinical work to help people use this material wisely.</p>
<p>We’re learning wisdom in the therapeutic context, and we need to integrate it with shamanic wisdom and the wisdom of the sage traditions—different levels of depth. I trust we will find that wisdom. I hope there aren’t too many casualties along the way. Psychedelics are here; they’re not going away. They didn’t during forty years of prohibition. We need to accelerate and deepen our understanding: what they are, how they work, how to work with them well, what they do and don’t give us. In my book, I emphasize the underbelly: they are temporary. My chapter on methodology is the path of temporary immersion; that’s not the same as the path of contemplative immersion. You have to understand and work with those limitations to be safe. They are powerful. I don’t recommend that people work with high doses of LSD as consistently and methodically as I did. I wouldn’t do it that way again. I’d be gentler: smaller windows, gentler substances, lower doses—precisely because of the challenge of sustaining the impact, not only in the days following a session but in the years that follow.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Earlier you offered a wonderful translation of shunyata—emptiness as translucency, transparency—and on one level you’re an exemplar of that transparency; there’s no difference between inner and outer. I also have to share a little magic I’m feeling even in this conversation: some of these questions aren’t coming from me. I can tell when they’re coming through me. So I hope it’s okay to ask this about the Beloved, the Mother: do you ever feel you were brought into this world on her behalf, to act as her child luminosity, her voice? Do you see your trajectory as a kind of avatar of the Mother? Purpose, divine purpose, teleology—does that speak to you? Or is it more serendipitous? Using your language: do you think the Beloved sent her child into this world?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Before the specific, the general: I believe many of us knew what we were getting into before we incarnated. We have choices and choose our incarnation—its form, timing, place. If we’re kindergarteners, we don’t choose our curriculum, but by high school, college, graduate school, we do. I think that’s true of reincarnation. We knew, at a time when we knew more than we know now, and we said yes.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m an Ishtar for the Mother, but I’ve always considered myself in her service. It’s in my astrological and constitutional chart. My first vocation was to be a priest; at five or six years old, raised Catholic, that’s how it expressed itself. That fell away, but the desire to know and to serve remained—as it does for many of us. I also learned, not in psychedelic work but in hypnotic past-life therapy, that I have history with psychedelics—Native American history—which made me comfortable with this mode of practice. I believe I was born to do what I did. That’s not inflationary; it’s simple. I love to teach. It just took a twist.</p>
<p>There’s been great benefit, and also challenge. I learned I’ve had lives where I paid a price for speaking—tortured and killed—and I internalized that resistance in this lifetime. From the first time I wrote on reincarnation, I had to overcome great resistance. But by doing so and speaking the truth as best I understood it, it always worked out well; I was richly rewarded. There’s been learning in rising to the challenge of writing about psychedelics in our culture, and the friendships and opportunities it’s given me have been very rewarding.</p>
<p>There are many people like me—and like you—with deep spiritual hunger and drive. As they get into it, they’re not holding this just for themselves. They are truly bodhisattvas. The first thing you do in practice is awaken bodhicitta; the last thing you do is distribute the merit. This is the nature of reality, the simple process of waking up to our true shared existence.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Breathtaking. How can people learn more about you? What are you working on, and how can we support you? My aspiration is cross-pollination—strengthening the connective tissue so we can support each other.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thank you. I just finished teaching a seven-week course at The Shift Network built around LSD and the Mind of the Universe. It’s available now—people can download it. Each session has an hour lecture and half-hour Q&amp;A, with readings. My website, chrisbache.com, is unfinished but there; you can access some talks and writings. I don’t do a bulletin. I’m still absorbing feedback from the Shift course and will probably do more teaching with them. I’ll likely have conversations like this—flowing out of critical psychedelic practice with a spiritual twist. When COVID allows, I hope to do retreats. I live outside Asheville, with many retreat centers nearby, and I hope there’ll be a time we can gather for long weekends or weeklong retreats to go deeper. No immediate plans; I live in a responsorial mode. You wanted this conversation, and I’m delighted to have it. I tend to wait for what comes and take it from there.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: Beautiful, beautiful. Well, Chris, just like with your book, I'm left with this perfume, this sense of awe and wonder. It’s really the magic and mystery of the entire affair—the surrender to some, whatever you want to pin: hyperobject, then, and necessarily not a silly word, but a shrink-wrap word for the ineffability; the elegance, the beauty, the magic of this world. And your presence really embodies this to me, and that’s why I so much wanted to do this not merely with auditory means, but also visual means. You’re doing something right, and your mere presence conveys the kind of authenticity, if I may be so presumptuous, of what you’ve done and what you’ve elected to be as your path. And we are the beneficiaries of the diamonds that you’re throwing across this planet. So, on behalf of my community, thank you for taking time out of your busy life to spend some time with us. I’m left somewhat breathless. Breathtaking—the insights that you shared are truly, deeply inspiring. And I don’t pivot these words out lightly. It’s mind-bending, mind-blowing. What a tremendous gift your courage and your beauty have brought to this world. So deep, deep thanks, my friend—until next time.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I’m really touched, Andrew. Thank you very much, and thank you for your work. Thank you for the goodness that you’re spreading, for the ideas that you’re seeding. And it’s really been an honor to be in conversation with you today.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: Thank you. My words, and maybe we can do it again in this dimension or another. So all the best—until next time, my friend. Sounds good. Okay. Much love to you.</p>

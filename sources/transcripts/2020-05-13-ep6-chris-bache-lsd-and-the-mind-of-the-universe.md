**Abstract**

In this episode of *The Naked Guru Experience*, host Ryan Kemp speaks with philosopher Chris Bache about his twenty-year
journey working with high-dose LSD, as detailed in his book *LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*.
Bache describes his methodical practice of 73 sessions at 500–600 micrograms, supported by his then-wife as sitter, and
reflects on the profound experiences of death-rebirth, collective suffering, archetypal realms, and diamond luminosity.
He situates these insights within the broader frameworks of Jung, Stanislav Grof, reincarnation studies, and world
religions. The conversation addresses the careful use of music, the ordeal of “hell realms,” the surrender to a guiding
intelligence he calls “the Beloved,” and visions of humanity’s future awakening through crisis. Bache shares lessons in
integration, his choice to stop after two decades, and his eventual liberation in speaking openly about his work.

**RYAN KEMP:** Okay, welcome everybody to *The Naked Guru Experience*. I'm Ryan Kemp. This discussion is part of a
series in tribute to Terence McKenna, sponsored by the Psychedelic Society. Today’s guest is Christopher M. Bache, author
of *LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*. Chris, welcome, and thank you for agreeing to this
discussion.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Hi, Ryan. It's a pleasure to be here with you today.

**RYAN KEMP:** Your book has been profound for many people I know, including myself. Could you begin with a little of
your background and influences?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I grew up in Mississippi, studied theology at Notre Dame, and trained at Cambridge in New Testament
criticism. My PhD at Brown was in philosophy of religion. Early in my career I encountered Stanislav Grof and Ian
Stevenson, whose work on psychedelics and reincarnation changed my trajectory. Privately, I undertook deep exploration
using Grof’s protocols, always with careful set and setting. Over time, my sessions shifted from personal shadow material
to encounters with the consciousness of the universe itself.

**RYAN KEMP:** For people who may see this as just “a drug discussion,” how should we frame LSD?

**CHRIS BACHE:** LSD is a non-specific amplifier of consciousness. It doesn’t dictate experiences but heightens awareness.
In protected, silent settings—with eyeshades, music, and a trusted sitter—it becomes a tool for exploring psyche’s deep
architecture. The early stages bring shadow work and fear, climaxing in death-rebirth, and eventually opening into ecstatic
dialogue with the cosmos.

**RYAN KEMP:** Would you link that to Jung’s collective unconscious?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes, though deeper levels appear beyond the collective psyche—archetypal realms, causal oneness, even
states of non-duality. Our minds are fractal expressions of the cosmic mind.

**RYAN KEMP:** You’ve written about music’s role.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes, building on Helen Bonny’s research. Different music supports each stage of a session. I preferred
indigenous music—African, Tibetan, Indonesian, South American—because its unfamiliarity helped me surrender more fully.
But I rotated pieces often; after three uses, a track became encoded with past experiences.

**RYAN KEMP:** You describe repeated deaths and rebirths. How do you see them?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Each deeper level requires letting go of what came before. Ego death gives way to collective ordeals,
archetypal landscapes, and eventually union with what I called “the Beloved”—the universe’s guiding intelligence.

**RYAN KEMP:** The path wasn’t only bliss. Could you describe the “hell realms”?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. For years I was immersed in oceans of collective anguish, the unresolved trauma of history. It wasn’t
about my healing, but serving a species-level purification. Eventually, that phase ended and opened into archetypal reality.

**RYAN KEMP:** What allowed you to endure?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Trust. Grof taught me the universe can be trusted. Complete surrender, even to suffering, eventually
opens into breakthrough. Later, ecstasy itself became harder to manage than pain—because I couldn’t remain in it.

**RYAN KEMP:** This seems to resonate with religions.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. Teaching world religions helped me see parallels—Buddhist Dharmakaya, Christian heaven, Hindu
Atman. But I was also shown that all historic religions are incomplete, noble beginnings but partial glimpses of the larger
cosmic project.

**RYAN KEMP:** You’ve written about individuation.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Individuality is not illusion; it is one of creation’s gifts. Over lifetimes, our experiences integrate
into a diamond soul—an awakened identity within time and space, transparent to the universe.

**RYAN KEMP:** Did you encounter entities?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Occasionally. But LSD mostly dissolved me into patterns of being, rather than discrete entities. DMT more
commonly brings entity encounters.

**RYAN KEMP:** And your visions of humanity’s future?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Beginning around session 23, I was repeatedly shown humanity entering a collective dark night—ecological
and cultural breakdown, near extinction. Yet survivors birthed a healed humanity: expansive hearts, enlightened minds, a
species grounded in oneness. I believe we are now in labor, giving birth to the future human.

**RYAN KEMP:** What about the frustration of temporary knowledge?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Even temporary glimpses act as attractors, pulling us forward. But integration takes time. After my
sessions ended, I endured loneliness, waiting to return. Writing and sharing openly became healing, bringing my two lives
together.

**RYAN KEMP:** Have you found peace?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. I feel content, grateful, and unafraid of death. If I could give one gift, it would be freedom from
the fear of dying. We are going home.

**RYAN KEMP:** Chris, thank you for sharing. Your rigorous record shows these landscapes are real and meaningful.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, Ryan. It’s a joy to share, and a privilege to speak openly now. Love and blessings.

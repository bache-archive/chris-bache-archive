<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> One of the last great visions that the universe gave me in one of my sessions took me deep into deep time. It took me deep into the future, and it gave me my last experience of the Future Human. It was as if it took me into the future and allowed me to try on for size the fundamental blueprint of the human psyche at that point in the future. This was the most extraordinary being. I can't describe to you quickly what an extraordinary being this is. Just picture the highest, finest qualities we've imagined. Picture the highest spiritual capacities we can imagine—a mind completely open to the universe, a heart completely open to each other, just an extraordinarily magnificent being. That's what's at stake here. That's what we're trying to become.</p>

**Abstract**

In this conversation, CHRIS BACHE outlines his path of “cosmological exploration” using

Grof-style high-dose LSD sessions to investigate the deep structure of consciousness. He

contrasts spiritual awakening with cosmological inquiry, explains why longer windows of

psychedelic action can enable deeper purification, and describes his protocol

(eye-shades, curated music, full-day internalization, detailed next-day notes).

Bache discusses guidance as a vast, formless intelligence, the appearance of deities as

collective thought-forms, and his progression through perinatal, collective, archetypal,

causal oneness, and “diamond luminosity” states. A pivotal vision shattered his belief in

an endpoint, revealing an infinite ascent. He shares visions of a species-level crisis as an

initiation toward a “future human,” reflects on meaning in a materialist culture, and

suggests balancing careful psychedelic work with sustained contemplative practice. The

dialogue closes with practical counsel on healing, service, and orienting attention toward

the living universe as an act of devotion.

**CHRIS BACHE:** And all of a sudden my visual field pivoted 90 degrees. I saw reality far in the distance,

like galaxies. Out of that reality, a beam of light hit me and absolutely shattered me.

It was more powerful than the diamond luminosity that had been my ultimate reality

50 high-dose sessions in. In one second it completely changed my understanding of reality.

**LUKE:** Thank you, Chris. Thank you for being willing to hop on with me.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Glad to be here today, Luke.

**LUKE:** Cool. Everyone, this is CHRIS BACHE. He’s a PhD and professor emeritus in the Department

of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years.

An award-winning teacher and international speaker, Chris explores the philosophical implications

of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. Today we’ll focus on ideas

from his book *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, the story of 20 years and 73 high-dose LSD sessions.

Welcome, Chris.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, Luke. It’s good to be here with you.

**LUKE:** Awesome. I thought we’d trace a path many people follow with psychedelics. Often it starts

with microdosing for productivity, then moves into therapy, then spiritual awakening. You took a step

beyond awakening. Could you tell us about that?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I call that step “cosmological exploration.” It overlaps with healing and awakening,

but it’s different. Spiritual awakening cleans the system so we can abide more transparently in our

essential nature—what Buddhists call Buddha-nature, others call divine nature. Cosmological exploration

seeks the deep structure of consciousness and the universe: how reality works, why things are the way

they are, and what the deep cosmic architectures are.

**LUKE:** I’d love to ask about those layers of reality, but first the path and protocol you followed.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In 1978, fresh out of graduate school, I read Stan Grof’s *Realms of the Human Unconscious*

\(1976\) and immediately recognized its significance for philosophy of religion. I’m not a therapist; I’ve

always been drawn to the philosophical implications. Answering that call, I began a 20-year project:

four years of intense work, a six-year pause, then ten more years.

I chose high-dose LSD—typically 500–600 micrograms. I don’t recommend that approach today.

If I were doing it over, I’d be gentler, use lower doses, and include a wider spectrum of medicines.

Back then, this was pre-ayahuasca for most Westerners, and I trusted Grof’s LSD research.

My early assumption was: if karma is finite, then bigger doses would clear more in fewer sessions.

That turned out to be wrong. The work quickly opened into collective dimensions, and communion with

the universe at large presented itself.

Protocol-wise, I followed Grof’s *LSD Psychotherapy*: total isolation with a trusted sitter; lying down

with eye-shades and headphones; carefully curated music; staying inward from morning through evening;

then making detailed records the following day.

**LUKE:** You’ve since experienced psilocybin and ayahuasca. In the book you noted LSD’s long window lets

you “buff the diamond” more. Ibogaine runs 24–48 hours, while 5-MeO-DMT can be 15–20 minutes.

Would ibogaine’s long window be better for awakening? And what might a 5-MeO protocol look like?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I haven’t used ibogaine, so I can’t compare beyond the window. Each medicine amplifies mind

with its own texture and spectrum. Regarding window length, Rick Strassman’s *DMT: The Spirit Molecule*

showed that powerful DMT experiences didn’t necessarily produce deep lasting change. My take is that a longer

window gives big mind more time to interact with and purify small mind—allowing deeper transformation.

Short windows can grant rapid access to very deep states, but there’s less time for integration in situ.

5-MeO-DMT is remarkable and can open very deep realities quickly, but I’m not comfortable rating its

transformative potential against LSD beyond saying that window length matters. Many variables are at play.

**LUKE:** One thing I appreciated in the book is how close you stayed to the phenomenology, not over-interpreting.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That was intentional. Presenting 20 years of dramatic experiences is a challenge. I chose to stay

close to the raw experience because, for me, the phenomenology was more valuable than any interpretation.

**LUKE:** You don’t recommend people do what you did. Yet many will still use psychedelics for awakening.

What slower, safer structure would you suggest that also harmonizes with “slow-burn” traditions?

**CHRIS BACHE:** With the caveat that I don’t guide others clinically: for awakening, I’d emphasize low doses,

because awakening dissolves the glue of egoic patterning. Pair low-dose work with sustained meditation,

occasionally going deeper to challenge boundaries. The goal is steady unbinding, not fireworks.

**LUKE:** Many people report “just the right experience at the right time,” as if guided. Did you feel guided?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Always. I engaged—and was engaged by—a larger intelligence. It never crystallized into a personified

form and changed quality as I went deeper. I think our mind acts as a seed-crystal that catalyzes certain

expressions from an infinite consciousness. As our mind transforms through repeated encounters and integration,

the intersection changes, and so does what arises. The guidance was palpable yet formless.

Beyond the collective psyche and even beyond human history, interpretive frameworks fall away.

Images of gods, angels, and religious concepts dissolve. You enter terrains past Jung’s archetypes, where

no historical category applies. Guidance remains, but without form.

**LUKE:** On forms: entity encounters are a popular topic. Someone told me they met Ganesh. What’s the meaning

of encountering a particular deity?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I don’t consider my experiences normative; medicine, method, and personality all vary. Still,

when we touch infinite compassion, intelligence, or creativity, the mind may clothe those qualities in forms

we know—Jesus, Mary, Ganesh—or in forms from traditions we’ve never studied. I understand these as spiritual

principles wearing the garments of collective thought-forms, built by millennia of devotion, imagery, ritual,

and prayer. Those forms are powerful. Sometimes we meet the principle itself through that garment; other times

we meet the garment directly.

It’s also possible to go beyond all such forms. In my DMT-like encounters, entities appeared at certain strata,

but as work deepened, granularity diminished. Populations of beings give way to vast, less-segmented fields

of consciousness.

**LUKE:** Early on you shifted from “about me” to “about the collective,” and reincarnation became obvious.

What levels did you move through, and how did experience change?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Two thinkers shaped me at the outset: Grof and Ian Stevenson. Stevenson’s careful cases of children

with verifiable past-life memories convinced me of reincarnation before my psychedelic work, and my sessions

greatly deepened that understanding.

As for levels: working at high dose, it took roughly ten sessions to move through the perinatal layer—the

interface between personal and transpersonal consciousness. There you encounter death-rebirth, relive birth,

face existential dread, and undergo ego death. I expected easier access to spiritual reality afterward, but

the cycle repeated at a different altitude. Intense collective anguish rose for another year or two.

At first I misread it as “deeper personal ego death,” but the content was irreducibly collective. The patient

wasn’t me; it was, in some fashion, the human family. Vast collective coex systems—what I called meta-matrices—

held the species’ suffering. After a culminating “ocean of suffering,” that quality ceased, and I was spun into

archetypal reality. Another death-rebirth cycle followed from there.

**LUKE:** For listeners: a coex system in Grof’s terms is a system of condensed experience.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes—an aggregate of memories and affects around a theme. Meta-matrices are the same dynamic at the

collective level.

**LUKE:** Is that like ancestral healing?

**CHRIS BACHE:** They rhyme. Ancestral work stays within a biographical lineage. My work broadened quickly into soul-level

and species-level process. I haven’t focused on ancestors per se, but there’s clearly overlap.

**LUKE:** Where do animals fit in?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Many people encounter species minds and totems. My focus was drawn to human consciousness—humanity is the

greatest danger to life here. Heal humanity and the rest benefits. Others’ work with nonhuman intelligences is

essential; it just wasn’t my assignment.

**LUKE:** You describe a jump into archetypal reality that made everyday life feel “less real.” Did your sense of

reality change in jumps?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Repeatedly. Retrospectively, I sketched five overlapping cores: personal mind, collective mind,

archetypal mind, causal oneness, and diamond luminosity. Moving from personal to collective is a step up in

organization. Archetypal reality was a quantum step: I often sensed I was in a domain more real than time and

space. Plato’s archetypes are a useful pointer, but I experienced them as living intelligences moving on vast

timescales—too immense for full cognitive grasp. At a “lower” archetypal tier, I repeatedly experienced our

species as a single organism, with networks linking us like neural and psychic connective tissue. We are

hard- and soft-wired into species mind. Healing oneself contributes to collective healing.

From archetypal depths I moved into what I called causal oneness, where the universe is a single organism.

There are differentiations, but no separate selves. Experiences of emptiness (śūnyatā), the void, cosmic love,

and the birth of what I later called the “diamond soul” all unfolded there.

**LUKE:** Then came the diamond luminosity.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes—hyper-clear states of light, far beyond previous clarity. Over four years I entered that reality

only four times; between them were demanding purification processes to sustain clear cognition in higher energy

fields. After two deep entries, something changed: instead of going farther “out,” the diamond luminosity began

pressing farther “in”—into body, mind, heart.

A pivotal moment came in my 50th session—only my second time in that light. My field pivoted 90 degrees and I

saw a distant reality, galaxy-like. A beam from it shattered me. It was even more powerful than the diamond light

I had taken as ultimate. In an instant I understood: there is no endpoint. I let go of the finish-line myth and

focused on absorbing what I was being given as deeply as possible.

**LUKE:** Later you saw a vision of humanity’s future. What happened?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Beginning in the mid-1990s, I received a series of initiations into the human story—visions of an

historical process trying to awaken the species, not just individuals. In 1995, after deep work in the diamond

light, I dissolved into species mind and deep time. I experienced, as our species, a global systems crisis

driven by cascading ecological failures. Details were not given—only the fact and feel of it. At the peak,

we crossed a threshold. On the far side, picking ourselves up over years and decades, we were permanently changed.

Our hearts opened to one another, our minds opened to the universe, and synergies around new values, insights,

and capacities began compounding.

In a later session I was shown a further arc: we are gestating the next evolutionary form of the human. Reincarnation

is key. Across lifetimes we expand to soul, contract to ego, repeat. Eventually, soul consciousness ignites within

historical identity. In one session, a critical mass of former lives fused, catapulting individuality into a new

order. I believe humanity is nearing that collective threshold. Birth is short and often traumatic. I think we will

make it through—and grow up.

**LUKE:** That reframed meaning for me. In materialist culture we face a meaning crisis. Did your sense of mental

illness and transpersonal access change?

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s a big question, and clinicians can speak more precisely. Joseph Campbell paraphrased: the mystic

swims in waters in which the psychotic drowns. Opening to larger realities can injure if we’re unprepared.

Hence the importance of carefully screened, well-supported settings. I’m less focused on pathology categories

and more on differentiating destabilizing confusion from clarifying initiation. Done well, these are not delusions

but profound educations in the fabric of reality.

**LUKE:** Could you walk us up the five levels briefly?

**CHRIS BACHE:** From personal to collective, archetypal, causal oneness, then diamond luminosity—each involves dying to

assumptions and being reborn into a greater real. In causal oneness you dissolve into the universe as it experiences

itself. In diamond luminosity, clarity surpasses imagination.

**LUKE:** Your paragraph “Beyond the Diamond Luminosity” changed everything for me.

**CHRIS BACHE:** For me too. Fifteen years in, I thought there was a goal—union with God, the primal void. I’d had many such

unions. Then that beam shattered the endpoint myth. The universe is too vast. From then on, I released striving for

“the end” and received what was given.

**LUKE:** Coming down the mountain, you also described how to worship—how to orient attention. How has your view of

God and religion changed?

**CHRIS BACHE:** *\[Laughter\]* I need water for that one.

I trained as a theologian and philosopher of religion and largely studied my way out of traditional theology.

Psychedelic work then initiated me into the living realities behind doctrines. It affirmed an infinite intelligence

and compassion manifesting as this universe, yet eclipsed any single tradition. I don’t feel devotionally bound to

one lineage. I prefer “mind of the universe” to theological labels. I honor the cathedral of galaxies—Hubble and

JWST images are profound meditations—and I honor the hidden drivers behind visible nature.

**LUKE:** The West’s meaning crisis is acute. Not everyone will walk a psychedelic path. How can people prepare for

what’s coming?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Psychedelics can “pop” the bubble of flat materialism and reveal a living, meaningful cosmos. Reincarnation

research helps people sense purpose woven through a life. But concepts must be held lightly—humility is essential.

Live with integrity, serve the purpose of your incarnation, and let outcomes unfold. My understanding is that we

choose our incarnations. If so, doing our best where we are is enough.

**LUKE:** Practices: process-oriented versus goal-oriented?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Think verbs over nouns—reality as process. Orient not to a fixed summit, but to continual deepening and

alignment.

**LUKE:** Scriptures can be exclusivist—“worship no other.” What do you make of that?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Historically, religions were place-bound and identity-forming, often in contrast with neighbors.

That made sense then. Steamships, planes, and now the internet changed the game. The wisdom now is planetary:

seeing patterns across traditions and, at depth, moving beyond all of them into the larger landscape that deep

experience reveals.

**LUKE:** Thank you, Chris.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, Luke. These conversations help me digest the work, and I hope they serve others too.

**Abstract**

Host Andrew speaks with philosopher and psychedelic pioneer **CHRIS BACHE** about his

twenty-year series of 73 high-dose LSD sessions, recounted in *LSD and the Mind of the

Universe*. They discuss why he considers psychedelics a rigorous contemplative method,

how carefully selected music shapes the inner journey, and why deep states amplify both

consciousness and subtle-body energy. Bache distinguishes therapeutic healing, spiritual

awakening, and cosmological exploration, arguing that psychedelics can open a third

path that maps the architecture of mind and the universe. The dialogue explores

monism versus functional dualism, Buddhist emptiness and “the Beloved,” individuation,

and the ethical pivot from personal enlightenment to collective service. Andrew shares

resonances from retreat practice, and Bache reflects on integration, the discipline of

recording sessions, and the long arc of bringing transcendence back into immanence.

Throughout, both return to humility, safety, and the responsibility of sharing powerful

experiences without glamorizing risk.

# Part 1

**ANDREW:** *\[Music\]* Everybody, Andrew here, and I simply cannot contain my excitement about

my guest today, Dr. Chris Bache. With a brief introduction, we’ll launch into what I hope

will be a revelatory and provocative conversation.

**ANDREW:** Chris, PhD, is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious

Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct

faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an emeritus fellow at the Institute

of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory board of Grof Legacy Training.

**ANDREW:** Chris’s passion is the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of

consciousness, especially psychedelic states. An award-winning teacher and international

speaker, he’s written four books: *Life Cycles*; *Dark Night, Early Dawn*; *The Living

Classroom*; and *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, the story of his 20-year journey with

LSD. Chris is a father of three, a Vajrayana practitioner, and lives in Weaverville, North

Carolina, with his wife, Christina Hardy. Oh my gosh, Chris—where do we start? Thank you,

my dear friend, for taking time to talk with us.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s a pleasure. I’ve been looking forward to this.

**ANDREW:** A quick preface before we dive in. I’ve read a lot over the years, but I’ve never

read anything like *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. Of your books, that’s the one I want

to focus on. It stretched my mind open, challenged me, resonated deeply, and sometimes

created dissonance—modern music needs both. To give listeners a frame, could you offer a

long elevator pitch? Let’s say we have a thousand floors.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I know it’s a radical book. I think we’re at a pivot point in history, and

psychedelics mark a true before-and-after in philosophy, not just psychology. They offer not

only new therapeutic protocols for healing the personal psyche, but a disciplined way of

doing philosophy experientially—something with roots in the Eleusinian mysteries and the

ayahuasca traditions.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I finished my PhD at Brown, took a position in Ohio, and was a convinced

agnostic. Then I encountered Stan Grof’s *Realms of the Human Unconscious*, followed by

*LSD Psychotherapy*. This was 1978. I saw the implications for philosophy of religion and

realized that the most substantive future contributions would come from people writing out

of lived experience, not just intellect.

**CHRIS BACHE:** So I split my life in two. By day I was a conventional academic. Privately,

I began a 20-year journey, following Grof’s protocol with high doses of LSD. It’s an

aggressive method I would not recommend in the same way today, but I completed 73 high-dose

sessions.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Each session was completely isolated—what I call a psychedelic kiva. I’d lie

down in a protected space with a sitter—my wife, a clinical psychologist—wear eye shades,

and listen to carefully curated music through headphones. I worked for four years, paused

six, then continued ten more. The method, as a philosophical practice, systematically

expands consciousness. LSD is an amplifier; it doesn’t give you specific content. It makes

you hypersensitive for hours. How you use that sensitivity shapes what emerges over time.

**CHRIS BACHE:** If you treat the session as contemplative—turn inward, isolate from the

world—a journey unfolds. It begins by confronting fear, shame, and pain—the early

purifications. If you persist, it opens deeper and deeper. I always recorded every session

within 24 hours. Careful documentation and reflection make subsequent sessions clearer.

Over 20 years I kept that discipline, then stopped in 1999. I didn’t publish until 2019. I

needed time to analyze, ponder, and integrate before going public. I kept a firewall

between my public and private life; only after retiring did I share this side of my work.

**ANDREW:** Amazing. Before we go further, one brief musician’s question. My first degree is

in classical piano. Why music? What role did it play, and how did you choose it?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Early research shows music’s influence on psychedelic sessions. It creates an

ambience that supports letting go of ordinary reality and yielding to the uprush of

unconscious material. A session has phases—build, peak, descent—over about eight hours. The

music should support each phase: powerful crescendos early, expansive passages in the

middle, gentler tones at the end.

**CHRIS BACHE:** After a year or so, I moved away from classical to more indigenous music. I

found it more evocative; it helped me release conventional reality and enter unusual

realities more readily.

**ANDREW:** That resonates with Vajrayana inner yogas. The subtle body is tuned to frequency,

so sound touches that level directly. When you work with music, it’s like an external

tuning fork that evokes correlative inner harmonics, helping bring unconscious processes

into awareness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I think that’s fair. The subtle body is very engaged in psychedelic work.

Deeper consciousness equals higher energy. It places demands on the physical and subtle

bodies. You enter highly stimulated states—psychologically, energetically, physically.

**ANDREW:** You also reframe Chögyam Trungpa’s “super-samsara.” I first heard it as a

critique, but you treat it alchemically: super-samsara can become the fuel for awakening if

met properly. Could you unpack that?

**CHRIS BACHE:** It depends on how you meet it. Samsara is alluring and distracting; amplifying

it can just lead to more samsara. But if you meet the amplified material contemplatively,

you take tendencies to their roots. They uproot. Then you move into deeper layers and,

eventually, beyond samsara into bardic and extrasamsaric realities.

**CHRIS BACHE:** People use psychedelics for many purposes. Three primary ones are:

therapeutic healing of personal wounds; spiritual realization—accelerating awakening; and,

third, cosmological exploration. I started with awakening, like many in the ’70s, but that

agenda fell away. Collective work—bodhisattva-style—rose in importance. Eventually my work

settled into cosmological exploration: a long journey into the consciousness of the

universe, the creative intelligence within and behind it.

**CHRIS BACHE:** You don’t have to plumb archetypal realities or the birth of the universe to

awaken spiritually. So I distinguish cosmological exploration from awakening. If we judge

the former by the success criteria of the latter, we’ll miss what’s actually taking place.

**ANDREW:** Beautiful—and deep water. Let’s touch the relation between individual and cosmic,

mind and world. Is it the mind in the universe, or the universe in the mind? I noticed you

tag yourself philosophically as a monist if cornered, yet your language can imply a subtle

dualism between the personal and cosmic. How do you reconcile that?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The dualism is functional, not ultimate. At core, I’m a monist by experience,

not by theory. Contemporary thought often treats the physical as all there is, consciousness

emerging late. I align with panpsychists: a primordial consciousness is present from the

start. Experientially, when the personal mind shatters—after excavating the personal and

collective unconscious—you drop into larger and larger fields until the mystic’s territory:

God-consciousness, all-as-one.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The universe—its physical manifestation and its underlying mind—is a single

organism. Early encounters with this “mother” reality were so intoxicating that many came to

see the purpose of life as dissolving the individual drop back into the ocean. I think that

cosmology is flawed. Given the age, scale, and genius of evolution, it makes little sense

that on the cusp of self-recognition we should simply disappear.

**CHRIS BACHE:** What I learned is that the universe supports individuality—not the prison of

egoic isolation, but a robust, porous soulhood in exchange with larger life. Brahman delights

in manifesting and growing Atman—an ever more conscious synthesis of individuality and

totality.

**ANDREW:** That touches my own retreat experience. I felt held by something vast—what I

called an external agency. As a Buddhist, I wrestled with emptiness and non-theism. How do

you reconcile emptiness with your language of the Beloved?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Buddhism’s radical agnosticism is invaluable. Its critique is not of reality

but of inadequate theisms. It proposes a process view: everything is dynamic, interdependent.

When I was guided and “held,” the intelligence never revealed itself as a person. In

psychedelic states you learn by becoming. Each time I asked, “Who are you?” I died and

awoke into a deeper layer—eventually realizing an open-ended, infinite progression.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That coheres with the Buddhist refusal to reify “God.” As you move beyond the

collective psyche—beyond the stories of religions—you encounter realities far outside those

frames. We can experience this; our concepts will always be partial.

**ANDREW:** Another big theme in your book is pedagogy—learning by becoming. It resonates

with gnostic learning: hear, contemplate, meditate; ingest, digest, metabolize until the

teaching embodies. I also want to name a painful arc you share: leaning so far into

transcendence that coming back was hard. Could you speak to integration?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Coming off the mountain, I realized I’d created an unwitting imbalance. I had

integrated each session conscientiously, yet I’d leaned so heavily into transcendence that

I’d lost some foothold in immanence. The sessions themselves ended me; they let me know it

was time to stop. I had to learn the “dying of keeping,” not just the “dying of discovering”:

to alter nothing and let vast states awaken within historical life.

**ANDREW:** Let’s talk about fear and sanity. Did you ever worry about snapping rather than

stretching?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Death-rebirth is always an ordeal. At advanced points I feared for my sanity

as I went over the waterfall. But if you surrender fully, the cycle completes. It gets bad,

worse, very bad—and then completes into ecstasy. The gift was learning the rhythm of the

spiral: crisis, surrender, blessing. I carry no trauma from the work; the music I used brings

love, not fear. The bigger challenge is living with memories so beautiful they haunt you in a

good way.

**ANDREW:** You spent a harrowing stretch in the “ocean of suffering.” Is that a training in

great equanimity—no preference for heaven or hell?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I understand that teaching, but I read my passage differently. I don’t think

everyone must do what I did. I believe my soul chose that work before birth, and many souls

have made similar vows now. We’re in a critical time; the unhealed residues of history are

pouring out. Deep practitioners are often invited to lift some of that suffering from the

collective psyche.

**ANDREW:** How do we know any of this is true? What about proof, replication, coherence?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I unpack this in *Dark Night, Early Dawn* and in a dialogue with Ken Ring.

Grof’s decades of collated data provide a broad phenomenology; my experiences fit within it.

As with near-death research, veridical “local” perceptions increase the credibility of

transcendent ones. Cross-validation matters: after perinatal death-rebirth, people report

convergent spiritual realities. Comparing psychedelic, NDE, and out-of-body literatures,

their cosmologies converge more than diverge. Also, my sessions repeatedly shattered my

expectations; I learned things I wasn’t primed to see. Ultimately, we need standardized,

rigorous protocols across diverse cohorts and then compare the overlaps.

**ANDREW:** Where is this headed culturally? Do you imagine a church of LSD—kidding but not

kidding—or a tradition of disciplined psychonauts?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’m a symptom of a social pivot. The renaissance rightly begins with careful

therapeutic research. In time, we’ll remember what early researchers learned: psychedelics

also have philosophical value. As psychotherapists develop clinical protocols, philosophers

and scientists will develop rigorous exploratory protocols, record carefully, and test

experiences against other knowledge domains. I don’t have an agenda; I shared because the

Mother said, “Let them see me through your eyes.” Not for my sake, but to support others in

a difficult time.

**ANDREW:** Thank you for that courage. Tradition warns against indiscriminate sharing, yet

these times may require it. You also say that speaking is practice for you.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It is. Speaking rekindles memory; memory re-actualizes being; being shifts

mind and body. Silence made me sick. Sharing has been part of my healing. And I’m not trying

to persuade anyone—only to be useful.

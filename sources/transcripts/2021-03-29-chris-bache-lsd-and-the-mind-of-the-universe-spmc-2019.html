At the end of Chris’s talk, during the break, he’ll be signing his new book. I don’t know if he was going to tell you this or not, so I will: the book is called LSD and the Mind of the Universe. It’s based on his experiential work with LSD. The publisher was going to release it in December, but Chris got them to do an advance printing for this conference—so this weekend is the debut. I don’t know if there will be enough copies for everyone who’ll want one. I’ve read it—Chris asked me to write an endorsement because I’m so enamored of his work—and it’s a mind blower. I’m not kidding. Please give a warm welcome to Chris Bache.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
Give me just a second to hook up my technology… okay, great. Is the mic working? Good. It’s wonderful to be here with you again. This is such a wonderful community. When I was here last year, I spoke about a book I was finishing, which I was calling Diamonds from Heaven. It describes a 20-year journey using high doses of LSD—73 sessions over two decades—to explore the structure of the universe. That book is now here. The publisher changed the title, but in my heart it will always be Diamonds from Heaven.</p>
<p>I want to say up front that I’m not sure what I did was wise. I pushed myself extremely hard—harder than was probably good for me—but I’ve come through it reasonably intact, and I’m looking forward to sharing where this journey took me. It’s not because I think my experiences are unique or special; they’re simply a particularly well-focused exploration of the universe’s structure. I did this work not as a therapist and not really seeking therapy. All honor to the psychedelic therapists here—this was a different agenda. Trained as a philosopher of religion, I was seeking an understanding of our universe as deeply as I could by sinking into my own consciousness and, in those deep states, exploring the universe’s deep structure.</p>
<p>We have so many people here working in different psychedelic mediums, with different substances, forms, and agendas. All honor to the psychedelic community and our collective work. What I bring today is one particular journey, one method and format, which does not negate any other dimension we’re exploring. It’s simply one voice in our collective expression.</p>
<p>This is my psychedelic lineage. It grounds in Stan Grof’s work. At 29, fresh out of graduate school and beginning my academic career in Ohio, I met Stan’s work—Realms of the Human Unconscious and LSD Psychotherapy, the fundamental manual for working psychedelic sessions. It changed my life and has become my life’s work.</p>
<p>As to structuring sessions: I’ve never “tripped” recreationally—no concerts, no all-nighters with friends. Every time I took LSD, I worked in a very carefully controlled environment, isolated, at home or in my wife’s office, completely protected from the world. I always worked solo, with a sitter. There are advantages to groups and to solo work; mine was always solo, which let me follow exactly where the experience was taking me and push in that direction.</p>
<p>In Stan’s work, there are two therapeutic modalities: psycholytic (low dose) and psychedelic (high dose). Psycholytic—maybe around 200 micrograms—peels the psyche layer by layer across many sessions, up to about 100. Psychedelic therapy is very concentrated and intense. The goal isn’t to work through all layers of the personal unconscious, but to blow through the psychodynamic level and trigger transcendence—near-death-type experiences—especially with terminally ill patients facing death. At Spring Grove Hospital, they limited this to three sessions.</p>
<p>I came along and thought, if it can be done safely three times, it can be done safely more than three times. It can, but it’s much more demanding than I anticipated, and it took all my resources to manage what unfolded. This is not a therapeutic journey; it’s cosmological exploration. It requires an explorer’s constitution and preparation, and a position in life that allows pushing this far beyond the maps most people use. When I finished and looked back, I realized I had to give it a different name. I call it psychedelic exploration. The method uses the protocol of psychedelic therapy—total isolation, always a sitter, carefully selected music, and so on—but the difference is the number of sessions. I did 73. Three sessions at the psychodynamic level—about 200 micrograms—and after that, all at 500–600 micrograms. This is not a protocol I recommend. I wouldn’t do it this way again. I would balance plant medicines with synthetics and only push periodically with high doses rather than so relentlessly. I have worked with psilocybin, ayahuasca, and salvia divinorum—mostly after I stopped the LSD work—but LSD and the Mind of the Universe focuses on what happened in the high-dose journey.</p>
<p>The circumstances were unusually stable, concentrated, and focused: the same sitter for years, same set and setting, intention, location (Northeast Ohio), substance, dose level, and the same recording process—always recording each session as completely as possible within 24 hours. When you stabilize your work—eliminate variables, use the same methodology consistently—it stabilizes the conversation between you and the creative intelligence of the universe. It stabilizes the communion so that one session leads to the next in a coherent, intelligent manner. You may not understand the continuity as it unfolds, but over time you see patterns and feel you’re engaging a single creative intelligence. I say that carefully—there are many layers and forms of intelligence—but across sessions the continuity is unmistakable.</p>
<p>I kept detailed records: about 400 pages of session notes recorded within 24 hours. I tracked dates, and later plotted astrological variables. Late in the work, I used astrology to choose session dates. I averaged about five sessions a year. I worked four years, stopped for six (reasons in the book), and then another ten years of intense work. When I became aware of Rick Tarnas and Stan Grof’s hypothesis about outer planet transits and psychedelic sessions, I studied those variables; there’s an appendix on this in LSD and the Mind of the Universe—I keep wanting to say Diamonds from Heaven; I have to retrain myself.</p>
<p>The story I tell is not primarily personal. There was personal healing and insight, but those components tended to manifest at the beginning and end of sessions—leaving and returning to space-time. Sometimes a whole session was personal healing, but in general, after about the first 15 sessions, when I was at the peak hours of a session, I was far beyond personal reality. From a philosophical perspective, the large story is the more important story.</p>
<p>A lot of medical and therapeutic work focuses on ego dissolution—transcending the physical body’s limitations, entering mystical communion. I found it wasn’t just one cycle of death-rebirth. Imagine the drop at the bottom of a circle as egoic awareness—time-space awareness. Everything below the line is physical reality; above the line is transpersonal or spiritual reality. Much discussion focuses on the first circle—death-rebirth of ego—an important, fundamental transition. But you actually go through multiple levels of death and rebirth. It’s not the ego dying over and over; these processes take place at different levels of the universe, at different levels of the creative intelligence. The later deaths and rebirths are different from the initial one where you shed your time-space identity. They’re harder to describe. You move beyond the species mind, beyond the collective psyche, into archetypal reality—each requires a different pattern of dying and being reborn.</p>
<p>I use Stan Grof’s categories—psychic (high/low), subtle (high/low), causal. They’re convenient but necessarily rough; how can six categories capture the full spectrum of divine experience? They’re useful to mark transitions on this journey. These cycles are like tori: you break through, expand into a new level, gather in, blow through to another level, stabilize competencies in that state, gather again, and then, if you follow the process, another death-rebirth into a deeper level.</p>
<p>One way I image this is with a nuclear explosion—not to dwell on the horror it represents, but to make a point: deep death-rebirth shatters everything you’ve known and drops you deeper into the universe, revealing levels previously outside awareness. In an explosion, deeper atmospheric layers become visible; likewise, deep psychedelic work brings levels into awareness that were always there. Dissolve the dualism in that image: you’re not separate from the strata you enter; you dissolve into that field. We’re not talking about bombs; we’re talking about the cosmos exploring itself.</p>
<p>At the end of my work, tallying all the deaths, purifications, and purgations, I counted five core, fundamental levels: 
- Death of self—transcending time-space identity, egoic reality.
- Species consciousness—transcending the individual mind, at the level of the collective mind.
- Archetypal mind—the archetypal dimension.
- Causal oneness—oneness appears at many levels, including early ego death, but causal oneness is distinctive: there is no outside to reality. You are not experiencing oneness; you are the condition in which the universe experiences itself as fundamentally unified, with no divisions at any level.
- Diamond Luminosity—what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the pure light of absolute reality.</p>
<p>Let me show how these lay out in the book’s chapters, then offer brief observations. There’s a methodology chapter—long, because I wanted to be very clear about how I worked—and a “session day” narrative of a typical day. At the death-of-self level: a chapter on crossing the boundary of birth and death.</p>
<p>My wife is taking care of me, by the way. I forgot to mention: my wife, Christina, is a professional astrologer. Working with astrology and psychedelic sessions yields really interesting insights, and she helped me understand some of the archetypal dynamics in the material.</p>
<p>For the collective mind, there are three chapters: The Ocean of Suffering (the challenging, purifying work of the species mind), Deep Time in the Soul (an initiation into the universe), and then, moving on, a chapter on archetypal reality—The Greater Real; a chapter on causal oneness—A Benediction of Blessings; and Diamond Luminosity. Before Diamond Luminosity, there’s The Birth of the Future Human, describing a series of visionary experiences that began with the initiation into the universe and continued through session 70—one of the most consistent themes from session 22 onward: what’s happening to humanity, where we’re going, our historical moment, what’s shifting at a deep structural level. Then Diamond Luminosity, a final vision—the last of the great visions—and the goodbye wrap-up sessions. Let me offer a few observations on each level.</p>
<p>First, crossing the boundary of death and birth. Those familiar with Stanislav Grof’s work know this as the perinatal level—the boundary between space-time consciousness and the first transpersonal reality. I felt like a poster child for this level: intense physical purifications, fetal sensations, reliving aspects of birth, tremendous existential angst, confronting life’s meaninglessness, and then ego death—a complete shattering of egoic reality. The ego is a tough son of a bitch, but in the final analysis it’s not that hard to take apart; it’s harder to heal than to shatter. After two and a half years and ten sessions, the last two snapped me like a twig. I started the day as a white male, highly educated academic obsessed with the meaning of life. The experience inverted all those variables—turning me into women, women of color, women at the laundromat with no prospects, women with no interest in philosophy or the meaning of life. Of course, women weren’t the “problem,” nor was lack of education; the problem was the social identity I had internalized and accepted as what I am. The universe forced me to become the opposite. When I surrendered, I entered the world of women under the arm of the Great Mother and was taken through hundreds of women’s lives—an extraordinary transformation. I wish every man could experience so deeply the inner essence and experience of the so-called opposite sex.</p>
<p>I believe in reincarnation and have written a book on it; we’ve all lived lives as men and women. But this wasn’t reclaiming former lives as women. It was saying: where you are going, gender does not exist. Let go. I did, and entered spiritual reality.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, things didn’t get easier—they got harder. After a transmission experience that expanded my compassion to the world’s suffering, I entered a domain of collective suffering, anguish, and pain that deepened systematically session by session for two years—14 sessions. There was a year of the ocean of suffering before I stopped for six years. When I started again, in a different time of life with different expectations and transits, the ocean of suffering resumed exactly where it had stopped—evidence, I think, of the intelligence directing the work.</p>
<p>At first I thought this represented a deepening of ego death, consistent with Stan’s theory: collective ordeals drawn in through resonance to ego death. But it went on so long, was so extreme, involved so many millions of beings, that I concluded this could not be correct. These experiences weren’t aimed at purifying or transforming me; they were aimed at transforming the collective psyche of our planet—healing the entire planet in some way. Somewhere in very intense states, there is a flip: what begins as personal transformation is taken over by collective transformation.</p>
<p>No one did this to me. It wasn’t a trick. I accept responsibility—part of my karmic contract in this lifetime, and I think part of the karmic contract of many people in this room. The work you take on in deep sessions is often disproportionate to anything that makes sense in terms of your personal life story—even former lives. Many of us get into work so deep that we must open to a deeper understanding of what is taking place, especially now. Five hundred years ago, perhaps not. But at this time in history, the work of the hour is collective transformation. Our species is entering a near-extinction event. We do not have time to mess around. This is serious work.</p>
<p>If you are open and capable—and I’m not saying everyone should be, or that it’s necessarily healthy in many circumstances; it can be overwhelming and intimidating—if it is part of your karmic contract, the work we do in these deep sessions is for our collective transformation. I think there are more bodhisattvas on this planet than we might initially think.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In my experience, working at high doses, every session breaks down into two phases: a purification phase and an ecstatic phase. There’s the dark, hard, death-and-dying kind of phase, and then the ecstatic phase. In reference to this work, James’ excellent talk this morning about shadow work was on point. Working as I did in a non-therapeutic modality, one of the great gifts I learned from Stan Grof is to completely, absolutely surrender to whatever is taking place in your sessions and let it take you as far as it wants to take you.</p>
<p>These are not “tripping.” There’s no confusion in the outer world, nothing from outside getting into my inner space. I know that anything I am confronting is coming entirely from within or through within. In my experience, if you submit completely to whatever is taking place in that context, it will take you deeper and deeper—sometimes into unspeakable, inexplicable anguish, into chaos, into terrible suffering and confusion. But if you let it do that, eventually it will come to a crescendo; it peaks and then takes you through to something on the other side. You enter the ecstatic, teaching, cosmological phase of the session—even if in the next session you may loop back into suffering again.</p>
<p>If you go through this surrender, death-and-rebirth process and let it take you, there is a deeper underlying dynamic that may not be clear at the time, which unfolds over time. Often you cannot understand what’s happening in the pain part of a session until you’ve moved on, because it’s not until you’re looking from a higher state of consciousness that you can understand what you were engaging at a lower state. It’s really important to follow this all the way through. If you follow the pain all the way through, you go from suffering to resolution to peace, and what you internalize is the entire cycle. That prevents the suffering from being lodged in your system as unintegrated trauma. I have gone through terrible suffering. I don’t have negative ramifications or aftereffects, because you internalize the cycle—suffering, resolution, peace—and you learn to trust the cycle and the intelligence behind this dynamic process.</p>
<p>When I came out of the ocean of suffering in that first year’s work, I was spun into what I call deep time. For one year—seven sessions—over and over again, consistently and methodically, I experienced the whole of my life from beginning to end as a simultaneous now. I called it whole time at first, then deep time. Deep time is not eternity or timelessness; it’s moving into a state of awareness where you can experience different spans of time as simultaneously present. I experienced all the moments of my life as simultaneously present, like a tree: the deepest themes of my life were the big branches receiving most of the energy; my most recent experiences—before I died—were the leaves at the edges of the tree. When I first entered this state in the 11th session, when I came out I couldn’t remember it. It had been the most meaningful experience of my life hours before, but afterward I could barely reconstruct the edges. It took months to recover the pieces.</p>
<p>What I found is that if you go back again and again to your living edge in your sessions, you understand more and you’re able to remember more. Things that didn’t make sense begin to make sense; fragments cohere; gestalts form. This is an important epistemological point: when you break through to a new level of consciousness, you often get fragmented because you’re in a totally different cognitive reality. But if you go back with clear focus and intent and a clear setting, you learn to be aware in levels of consciousness that initially just swallowed you. I learned how to stay conscious in deep time. This repeated itself whenever I broke through to deeper levels—initial fragmentation, then, over time, details coalescing into complete patterns of understanding. My life from beginning to end was saturated with insights of karma and the deeper intentionality that binds us into time and space. I wrote Life Cycles—without mentioning psychedelic work—about reincarnation and the web of life. For me, reincarnation is a fundamental axiom. If you don’t understand reincarnation, you don’t understand what the hell is going on in this world; you have to see the deeper patterns.</p>
<p>I took a six-year break—had two more children, wrote a book, got promoted. Six years later I started again. The ocean of suffering picked up exactly where it had stopped before, but in the ecstatic portion of the sessions, a totally different world opened. I was taken completely beyond personal reality. I was given a series of seven initiations into the universe. It was the creative intelligence—some creative intelligence—taking me through a course in Cosmology 101, giving me experiences that deepened my understanding of what’s going on in the universe.</p>
<p>I name each session to hold them all in my mind at the same time, giving a name that reflects the pith of the session, and I break sessions into bullet points as well. The chapter “Initiation into the Universe” covers sessions I called You and I Creating—an exploration of the co-creation of the universe; The Cosmic Tour—an extraordinary tour where this intelligence showed me how things work; Council of Elders—a training teaching me to keep my cognition coherent across levels of reality, which is crucial when a substance lets you break through multiple levels; Dying into Oneness—repeatedly dying into deeper oneness; The Master Plan; and Healing the Collective Wound—basically an orgy of pain and suffering. Then I was spun deep into archetypal reality, and the ocean of suffering never returned. It’s not that the world isn’t suffering, but my work with the ocean of suffering was time-limited. You don’t abandon your species when you go beyond the species’ pain—you become more useful to it. In the beginning you’re sucking pain out of the collective psyche; later you’re pouring grace and joy and insight into the collective psyche from higher levels of consciousness.</p>
<p>Entering archetypal reality, my identity as a human being began to fall away. We have a deep, visceral identity that’s deeper than our individual egoic identity, and to die as a human being is deeper than to die as an individual human being. To go into archetypal reality, I had to cease functioning cognitively in human terms and acclimate to flows of reality profoundly beyond not only my individual existence but beyond human existence. I moved outside the human field to levels of archetypal reality: a high, Platonic level—something like what Plato points to, except Plato’s archetypes are eternal forms in the mind of an unchanging God, and I experienced them as vast, living beings, overwhelmingly beyond my capacity to comprehend; I could touch pieces, but they were far too large. At a lower subtle level, I entered deep into the collective unconscious of humanity—the species mind—experiencing the human species as a single being, with networks of intelligence weaving our individual efforts, minds, and karma into larger patterns by which the species as a whole lives and breathes. I think I was being given a crash course in how our species works as a single organism to prepare for what came next.</p>
<p>Notice how much cleansing takes place at this level. The 28th session was extraordinarily positive—my first contact with causal-level reality after a tremendous ordeal—then clarity, beauty, and gorgeousness. The next three sessions were grueling ordeals of purification, hours and hours over six months. Eventually I came to understand that deeper states of consciousness are higher states of energy. When you shift deeper, you enter a higher energy level and have to acclimate, and that takes time and work. You go through purification and cleansing processes—not personal ones; you have to purify whatever you are at the time in order to stabilize consciousness at that level. This repeats so much that I came to dread the session after a breakthrough; it was usually a turgid, “carrying out the garbage” kind of session. But you go clean it up until you can come back and maintain coherent cognition at that level.</p>
<p>I began to experience reincarnation as a collective process—the human species as a single organism evolving itself by incarnating all its billions of precious beings simultaneously. I began to understand reincarnation as an evolutionary driver at the collective level, operating simultaneously with the personal. At that point, the wall between personal karma and collective karma came down completely. I realized there is no such thing as private karma; personal and collective karma are deeply intertwined. I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn to answer why my suffering went as deep and as long as it did. The answer is that at deep levels of consciousness, the boundary between the individual and the collective becomes very porous, and if you’re willing, you become an agent of collective transformation.</p>
<p>After a year and a half—11 sessions—at the archetypal level, I entered a year of extraordinary blessings: causal oneness. It was non-stop joy. Four sessions I describe are The Forest; The Birth of the Diamond Soul; Singing the Universe Away; and Jesus’ Blood. The first was oneness—śūnyatā, emptiness, no self in me, no self anywhere. Singing the Universe Away was entering the primal void—what Stan calls the metacosmic void—the domain of the formless out of which the light emerges that gives birth to the physical universe. Jesus’ Blood was extraordinary cosmic love—being loved like I’ve never been loved before. The Birth of the Diamond Soul is important. Eleven years earlier, I had experienced my life as a totality; now my former lives were coming together fast, like wrapping a filament of white light around a kite spool. At a certain point they hit critical mass, fused, and exploded into a diamond light—my first contact with what I came to call diamond light. It showed me how reincarnation is taking humanity forward. Reincarnation isn’t simply incremental improvements lifetime by lifetime—though we do that. At a larger level, if we keep this up—die and remember who we are, are born and forget and learn, die and remember, born and forget and learn—sooner or later the soul, the larger consciousness that holds all our lives, wakes up inside time and space, not just in the spiritual reality we return to when we die. I call this the birth of the diamond soul, just to put language to it. Others have spoken about it. In a sense it is spiritual awakening in the deepest sense—an emergence in history of a fully integrated being, integrated across hundreds of thousands of years of experience, jumped to a higher level of awareness and functionality, with tremendous compassion, because we’ve had so many lifetimes with each other, and a profound transparency to the universal creative intelligence. It’s a turning point in the evolutionary story.</p>
<p>I’m being pushed on time, and this is the most important chapter: the birth of the future human. When I started this work in 1979, I didn’t think much about the future of our species. I didn’t really understand much about the ego crisis we were going into. Yet this became one of the most consistent themes—a series of visionary experiences showing me, over and over: humanity is coming to a turning point, a profound revision of its foundation, a time of great awakening—a before-and-after moment in history. “Visions of Awakening” is a collection of six visions pulled from different sessions, grouped to tell the story coherently. But I hadn’t been shown how the universe was going to pull this off. A year and a half later, in session 55—the Great Awakening session—I was taken deep into deep time, not personal deep time but collective deep time. I went into the future and experienced the death and rebirth of our species. I wasn’t a human being; I had merged into the field of the collective psyche and experienced the crisis as the species will experience it: a crisis that brings us to our knees, a profound unraveling, a shattering of life as we’ve known it, a frightening time. Out of this process was born an extraordinary being—a transformed humanity, a shift in the fundamental blueprint of the human psyche—done not at the surface but at the deep level of the collective unconscious.</p>
<p>I was also given initiations into how this would be pulled off—no time to go into it here; I’ll cover it in a workshop. It has to do with the dynamics of the collective psyche and understanding nonlinear systems—how systems function when driven into nonlinear states. The human unconscious is a unified psychic field. My sense is that the great suffering we are entering will energize the collective psyche as never before. When energized by such terrible suffering, it will be capable of transforming itself in an historically unprecedented manner and will give birth to the future human. I believe the future human will be the diamond soul. Our future is already encoded in our past—nature has been preparing us for this event for hundreds of thousands of years. Gestation is long; birth is relatively fast. Reincarnation has been gestating the future human for generations. We are coming into the time of birth. It’s hard, scary—a near-death-experience kind of time—but it is giving birth to an extraordinary creature.</p>
<p>Will you give me five minutes of your break? Okay? When I finished the greater reel of archetypal work—when I finished the benediction of blessings—I felt completely satisfied. I felt I had given something in the ocean-of-suffering work, and I had been rewarded beyond imagination. I had known oneness; I had been drenched in cosmic love. What more could you ask for? But there were still five years of work to go. After another very intense death-and-rebirth process at a cosmological level, I was spun into the domain of absolute, transcendent clarity—light as I had never known: absolutely clear. The Buddhists are right: just touching it once can undo centuries of wandering lost in saṃsāra. Extraordinary purity—dissolving into the crystalline body of the Divine, becoming light—your mind completely dissolved into the primal light before existence manifests.</p>
<p>Out of 26 sessions over four years, I entered this reality only four times. In between those four, there was more purification, more purgation—tremendous cleansing—and, interestingly, personal healing, which surprised me; I would have thought personal healing would have come sooner. It took me a while to understand why things unfolded in this order, but there was a logic and an intention to it. I entered the diamond luminosity twice, going deeper and deeper. The last two diamond luminosity experiences weren’t about going deeper into the universe; they were about the diamond luminosity crunching itself into my physical body—into my psyche, my awareness—literally going into my body and changing the physiological structure of my cells. That’s what it felt like.</p>
<p>The pivot came in the 50th session—the deepest I ever went anywhere in the universe. I was in an incredibly beautiful, blissed-out place when everything pivoted 90 degrees. I saw a reality extremely far in the distance—whole worlds—and a light hit me from that reality. I call it the absolute light, just to differentiate it. It hit me and absolutely shattered me. That’s when I understood: this is an endless journey. I had believed you do this to get somewhere—to get home: oneness with God or the primal void. At this session I let go of that idea. The Infinite is much larger than any of our spiritual traditions have grappled with. It’s an infinite process. If I were doing this work again, I would be much gentler with myself.</p>
<p>I’ve learned the process is not to try to get to the end of the line. It’s to open up and let as much of the creative intelligence of the universe into you as you possibly can—let it transform you, let it break and open your heart—and then be patient with the slower pace of our organic transformation.</p>
<p>The final vision was the capstone of the entire 20-year journey. It put me through a terrible strip-down, took me deeper into time than I had ever been, and gave me an intimate experience of the future human. It gave me several lessons and an experience of the universe as a diamond maker. I experienced a swamp—a very dark kind of mud representing the topsoil of reincarnation—where all individual life forms were dissolving and reconstituting, dissolving and reincarnating. Then there were sparks of bright light shooting off into the universe. These were diamond souls—fully integrated souls moving into the universe, centers of integration capable of integrating levels of consciousness the ego alone could never integrate. The universe is a diamond maker. The universe is growing sparks of diamond luminosity, and it makes no difference to it—or it makes a difference, but it makes no difference—whether it takes a million years or a million years for this process to come to fruition. It is a very patient process. It has created the cauldron of creativity and is taking us deep into places we can only imagine.</p>
<p>The last chapter is “Coming Off the Mountain.” I learned that coming down was as hard as going up—walking away from such intimacy with the divine, from such profound immersion in divine reality. Once you’ve known the joy of dissolving into light, time and space can feel dried up, not very interesting. It took me ten years to really get back into time and space, to be grounded and comfortable being who I am for the remaining years of my life here. I don’t know whether I would have made it back fully if it hadn’t been for the love of my wife, Christina.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me share this story with you. It’s a joy to bring it to this community. We’re doing a workshop Friday and Saturday; I hope we’ll have more time to go into it. One thing I want to experiment with is whether we can use guided visualization to open these universal places that lie in everyone’s heart and experience. In addition to conversations about psychedelics, protocols, methodology, and the different experiences people have, we’re going to explore guided imagery and deep relaxation to activate some of these deep places that live inside each of our hearts. Thank you very much.</p></body></html>

Sandy Sedgbeer
Hello and welcome. Today we're going to be talking about life after death, heaven and hell, and reincarnation. Christopher Bache is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the Advisory Council of Grof Legacy Training. An award-winning teacher and international speaker, he is the author of four books, including one that I rate as one of my favorites of all time, LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven, which chronicles his 20-year psychedelic journey exploring consciousness. The other book we’re discussing today is Life Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life, which combines scientists’ testimonies about reincarnation with findings from consciousness research and near-death studies. Christopher Bache, welcome back to the show.

Chris Bache
Hi Sandy. It's a pleasure to be with you today.

Sandy Sedgbeer
You too. So Life Cycles has been hailed as the first book to both describe the dynamics of rebirth and explore the ramifications of adopting a reincarnationist perspective. Now, this was published, what, about 35 years ago?

Chris Bache
Thereabouts. I started my psychedelic work after my first year as an academic. I worked for four years, then stopped for six. During that six-year interval, I did three years of past-life therapy, uncovering and working with my own former lives, and I wrote Life Cycles. By then my psychedelic work had gone deep enough to give me personal insights into karma—the deeper cause-and-effect that underlies our lives. I hadn’t yet had former-life experiences in a psychedelic context, though I had in hypnotherapy. The real foundation for Life Cycles was studying Ian Stevenson and later other pioneers documenting children and adults with validated past-life memories.

Sandy Sedgbeer
You shared a few of those stories I’ve read before—absolutely fascinating. One that really struck me was the case Dr. Helen Wambach described: a five-year-old girl who rejected human contact and withdrew into autism, yet somehow demonstrated mathematical and reading skills she hadn’t been taught. She wouldn’t communicate, but over time she showed Dr. Wambach how she felt—force-feeding her with a baby bottle because she herself felt treated like a helpless infant. When the doctor understood, the child began to come into herself—but she lost the reading and mathematics. Stories like that—what do you make of them?

Chris Bache
That our individual lives are much longer and more continuous than we tend to think. They don’t simply begin and end; there are overlaps. Once you understand the larger life of the soul, continuity of qualities—knowledge, learning, attitudes, traumas, virtues—can blend from one life into the start of another. We don’t start as a tabula rasa. We start with a specific history, which becomes clear when we look at children with fresh eyes.

Sandy Sedgbeer
Why does it always seem to be the last life they talk about?

Chris Bache
It isn’t always the last life. Stevenson’s research focuses on children who have active recall of their most immediate former life, but that’s a very unusual population—children with spontaneous memories who also tend to reincarnate very quickly, on average two and a half years, and often very near the circumstances of the previous life. Studies of broader populations who don’t have spontaneous recall indicate longer intervals between lifetimes and a much wider geographic radius.

In therapy, people come because of pain. Sometimes that pain is rooted in the most recent past life, but not always; it can reach back several lives. I think of our former lives like a deck of cards. We may have had 52 lives, but only a handful are “active” this time. Those few cards can come from different centuries, and only certain elements of them weave into the composite that makes up the present life. It’s not a simple linear progression. We return to the soul, which holds all our former lives, and the soul decides which combination to incarnate as the next life.

Sandy Sedgbeer
You mention the word soul, but in the book you distinguish between soul and oversoul. What’s the difference?

Chris Bache
For Westerners used to thinking of the soul as the spiritual essence of this lifetime, we need a larger concept that includes all our lifetimes. I use “oversoul” for that, borrowing the term. By the end of the book I dissolve the distinction because it gets cumbersome. I tend to use Soul with a capital S to mean the oversoul—the consciousness that holds all our lifetimes—and soul with a small s for the consciousness integrating this incarnation.

Sandy Sedgbeer
So the oversoul is what some people would call the higher self—the part that continues forever?

Chris Bache
Yes, I think so.

Sandy Sedgbeer
I came across an article in Psychology Today by Dr. Alex Lickerman, a Buddhist who doesn’t believe in reincarnation. He said the real question at the heart of reincarnation isn’t evidence but identity.

Chris Bache
Good point. I haven’t read the article, but once you move into a reincarnational worldview, the concept of identity shifts and expands. I accept this body and personality as my current identity, and in deep mystical experiences I might accept a universal principle as my deeper identity. The soul is an intermediate position: individual—my soul and your soul reflect different histories—but if you ask about the essence of the soul, it returns to the same mystical insight: the essence of one is the essence of all—the essence of the Divine, the cosmic intelligence. Shifting to reincarnation doesn’t undermine the value of this identity; it recontextualizes it within the soul’s identity—the meta-consciousness that holds, say, 100,000 years of lifetimes.

Sandy Sedgbeer
It’s hard to believe you have a different identity—that you’re not this self you’ve lived with for so many years. It’s even harder to think the oversoul is infinite—has lived forever and will live forever.

Chris Bache
It’s hard at first, but it gets easier with practice—intellectual and, especially, experiential. You can be convinced by evidence that reincarnation operates, and life starts to make sense through that lens. But when you turn within and follow awareness deep enough to tap levels of self-awareness that predate your body, and you learn the stories that come from another life—experiences that feel distinctly “you” while also other than you—you know they are you. If you encounter several such lives and engage them, it causes a dilation not only in thinking but in the heart. It becomes easier to accept a transcendent, individuated dimension of identity. Eventually it becomes hard to think smaller than that—hard to take this as your only identity.

Sandy Sedgbeer
Let me ask some of the common questions that come up with this subject. First: why do we reincarnate?

Chris Bache
To learn, grow, and become more. That touches the basic question of the purpose of existence. If we only live once, then any purpose must be realizable in a few decades. If we live an open-ended number of lives, we can expand our understanding of what the universe is doing in us and with us over vast stretches of time. It invites an open-ended developmental possibility. Enlightenment is a noble goal, but it’s also a stage in a progression that extends beyond enlightenment. Imagine what we could become with a million—or a billion—more years.

Sandy Sedgbeer
I have a problem with this. If we are sparks of God—if we know everything when we die and our awareness expands—why do we need to learn more? Aren’t we complete when we’re there? And then we regress when we come here. I don’t understand the point of that.

Chris Bache
It’s like asking why the Infinite would manifest the physical universe at all. We may expand vastly in knowledge when we die—perhaps to what seems like infinity—but maybe there’s more than what we think of as infinite knowledge. The deeper question is: if the Creative Principle were to ask, “Will you help me grow this universe?”—would you bring as much knowledge as you can into your person and help evolve a higher physical manifestation of our spiritual nature? Not just what happens after death, but participating in creation here.

Who would turn down the invitation to participate in a process that produces deeper forms of humanity in history—so that, truly, we eventually make heaven on earth? We won’t always be “imprisoned” and forgetful when we incarnate. We will be increasingly aware, even enlightened, in physical form. That’s the trajectory—becoming more and dancing with creation.

Sandy Sedgbeer
I can follow that some of the way. But to come here and forget everything—to feel like you’re starting over—what happens to all that knowledge and wisdom you’ve gathered?

Chris Bache
We don’t forget everything. We may lose conscious recall, but what we’ve known is built into our unconscious—a bit like those children who don’t remember how they acquired their mathematical skill, but it’s there. There’s a history behind everything we are. We bring a great deal into our being and express it in our life. By the time we finish, we have incarnated more of that knowledge than when we began.

Sandy Sedgbeer
So many of us have seen mediums bring through loved ones. If someone has died—whether in the bardo, reincarnated, or elsewhere—how is it they can reconnect with that identity to give a loved one a message?

Chris Bache
In brief: when we die, we return to the soul. After a transitional period of life review—what went right, what went wrong—we assimilate the learning and naturally exchange our small identity for our larger one: our 100-year identity for our 100,000-year identity. “Chris Bache” is restored to the total knowledge of my soul.

Let’s say my father died when I was 18. When I die and want to see my dad, his soul can come to me. Manifesting at the “front” of that soul would be the being I knew as my father. So I would meet my father—but soon it becomes soul-to-soul, a deeper conversation than just “Chris” and “Dad.”

Mediums can contact the discarnate, but we should be careful inferring that the form encountered is the form of their ongoing post-death state. Our compulsion to communicate in the familiar persona reflects a limited understanding of what happens after death. I’m less interested in speaking to my father as I knew him when so much more is possible between our souls.

Sandy Sedgbeer
So, in a sense, the soul coming through is acting with compassion—stepping into that familiar presence?

Chris Bache
Yes—wearing the persona the loved one knew and communicating through it. But that persona isn’t necessarily who they truly are now.

Sandy Sedgbeer
Another common question: How can there be reincarnation when there are far more people on the planet now than a thousand years ago?

Chris Bache
Imagine a university with 6,000 students. You live on campus and notice the population growing each year. Where are the extra people coming from? From the town outside, which is far larger than the campus. Likewise, we have no reason to believe the number of souls available to incarnate is finite—or that all were present on Earth at some early point. There may be billions “in line,” waiting to enter the Earth school as positions open. The spiritual universe is many times larger than the physical. Robert Monroe emphasized that the physical universe is a small slice of reality; most of reality is spiritual.

Sandy Sedgbeer
But wasn’t it Robert Monroe who also said some humans evolved from higher animals?

Chris Bache
Yes—and that’s the common view in most reincarnation traditions. If you trace reincarnation back, it doesn’t begin with human consciousness; it begins earlier in our animal pedigree. Reincarnation seems correlated with the birth of individuality. Once individuated consciousness emerges in the animal kingdom, it explores, empowers, and expands itself—and that predates humans.

Sandy Sedgbeer
We’re actually getting reports from Dr. Linda Brackman, trained with Michael Newton, who said a time would come when many people would access lives not lived on this planet. She says it’s happening; her books are full of stories of experiences connected to lives elsewhere entirely.

Chris Bache
On a theoretical level—why not? Look at the universe through the Hubble images—life is burgeoning. Why shouldn’t there be evolved life elsewhere? And if reincarnation is possible, why should it be restricted to one star system? There may be interplanetary crossovers. I don’t have personal experience of that, but she does, and that’s interesting.

Sandy Sedgbeer
Christopher Bache, I’m rather attached to this personality. The thought that it might disappear—like an actor shedding a role, taking off the costume, never to be seen or heard from again in that form—I don’t like that idea. I’d like to know I could connect with her sometime, maybe even bring her back and be that character again. Is any of that possible?

Chris Bache
The essence and system of our lives is preserved beautifully intact. When we die, we take with us not only all our memories, but a living, vivid version of our earthly experiences—in technicolor and stereo, as near-death experiencers describe. Life review relives events in far more detail than we remembered. All of that is taken forward into the soul. The soul can crystallize its larger consciousness in any of its forms, or actualize their integration into a single form. For me, giving up a mere 100 years isn’t a sacrifice—it’s trading up. Why ride a bicycle when you can have a spaceship?

Sandy Sedgbeer
Sometimes I think I’m not very elevated in my consciousness. If I’ve been alive for millennia, I’m not doing a very good job—after all that time, I’d be further on. I tend to look at beings like spirit guides, angels, ascended masters as once having been as human as me, and having reached such an elevated state. Is it conceivable that I could be one of them one day?

Chris Bache
Well, yes, of course it’s conceivable, because your essential nature already is one of those beings. But let me flip this a little. I’ve been teaching this for years and had generations of students come through my courses. One thing I’ve learned is you can’t read a book by its cover—you can’t judge a person’s soul development by what they’re dealing with. It’s like at a university: someone may have developed a great deal of expertise in music, then decide to start developing expertise in art. They let go of their expertise in music to start a whole new course regimen in art. If you looked only at what they do in art, you might think, “Oh, this person is a freshman,” when really they’re a very sophisticated senior with all these other skills. I think it’s that way for the soul too. Look at what you do: you’re an enormous influencer, hosting one spiritual dialog after another, touching thousands and thousands of people’s lives. If your soul were in the Bardo, in a pre-incarnate state, and you were given the opportunity to bring down some aspiration, some capacity and enthusiasm for exploring spiritual knowledge—not in a monastic context, but on a platform that reaches out into the world at a time when the world needs this knowledge—how could you not take it? My basic sense is: don’t sell yourself short. I think there are many more Bodhisattvas in the world than we think.

Sandy Sedgbeer
Okay, another question: several spiritual teachers are of the opinion that we should not go toward the white light, as we will be trapped in cycles of reincarnation. They say you can bypass that and go somewhere else. What do you think?

Chris Bache
It doesn’t make any sense to me. To me, at a simple level, when we separate from our body, the white light is our homing beacon, taking us back to our essential nature—our deeper spirit, our deeper divine nature. The classic idea is that people instinctively move toward the light and go as far as they feel comfortable. At some point along the way, for various reasons, people may feel less comfortable or it feels more natural to stop and drop off. They’re at the level of spiritual development where they feel most at home, among the thousands and thousands of levels of the Bardo. From that level, they eventually go through a process in which they make the choice to incarnate again. The admonition in most spiritual traditions is to do a kind of training that allows you to be comfortable with the light, so that you can follow it all the way home—through all the levels of the Bardo—to the most intense form of that light, which resides within what the Buddhists call an extra-samsara reality, a reality outside the entire reincarnating universe. Whether our journey into the light takes us back to our own natural level of peak spiritual realization, or all the way beyond the intermediate levels to the highest level, it makes most sense to follow the light as far as you can.

Sandy Sedgbeer
You’ve seen that, haven’t you?

Chris Bache
I have, and it touched me in a way that has affected the rest of my life.

Sandy Sedgbeer
So why was reincarnation taken out of Christianity? For the first 500 years, it was a vital commitment, and then Justinian removed it.

Chris Bache
That’s a complex story. I was first a historian of early Christianity—that was my first academic love—in the search for the historical Jesus. I did my master’s at Cambridge in that field. It’s a complex process, and I don’t think the definitive story has yet been written. Did Jesus teach reincarnation? It’s present in some of the Gnostic Gospels, but do those Gospels reflect the actual teaching of the historical Jesus? If he did teach reincarnation, then we have to explain why it was filtered out—or, if he did, why it isn’t more thoroughly saturating the earliest strata of the scriptural tradition. However we answer those, it’s clear there were multiple variations of Christianity in the early centuries. Some taught reincarnation, and they also taught the empowerment of women—that women should have clerical capacities and responsibilities. Both of those elements were filtered out of the tradition.

Geddes McGregor, a Christian theologian who wrote numerous books on early Christian thought around reincarnation, was of the opinion that there is nothing inherently contradictory between belief in reincarnation and the essential teachings of Jesus. But it does give individuals too much autonomy for their spiritual welfare. In the historical context of the collapse of the Roman Empire and the emergence of a highly centralized Catholic authority, the Church saw this network of priests, bishops, cardinals, and the Pope as essential to the salvation of the Church and those it served. I’d give them the benefit of the doubt and say they thought they were doing a good thing by creating a system that made individuals contingent upon the clergy and the authority of the Church. From a reincarnation perspective, they didn’t do a good thing. It took us a long time to uncover this deeper teaching—that each of us is responsible for our relationship with the divine. The Church may help us, but in the end it is not essential to the maturing of our relationship to the divine.

Sandy Sedgbeer
You devoted a chapter to whether there’s room for reincarnation in Christian thought—35 years ago. I’d like to know in a minute if your view has changed, but before we do that, talk about the hidden phase of life—the time between lives—which you say is just as important to our development.

Chris Bache
That’s actually why I named the book Life Cycles. I wish I had named it a little differently, because it became acutely significant to me that if you look at the cycle of life as taking place only between birth and death, you’re missing half the cycle—what happens between death and birth. You have to look at the whole cycle to understand the rhythm of the soul, the rhythm of human consciousness. Just as there are standardized gradations of what happens when a child is born, there’s a standardized process of what happens when we die.

I think Michael Newton’s work is some of the best I’ve seen explaining what happens in the minutes, hours, and years—speaking metaphorically about time in a non-time universe—after we die: the integration, introspection, and review of our most recent life, looking at it deeply from a spiritual perspective, examining our relationships and challenges, integrating our successes and failures, and internalizing them. We enter the civilization of spiritual beings—the community of fellow soul travelers—enjoy the recess, the return to a more complete spiritual awareness of existence, and then, in time, gradually focus on the next challenge we set for ourselves. It’s like a university: you finish a semester, take your exams, digest and rest, then choose what you’ll take next semester. Newton shows these choices are made under the guidance and tutelage of our guides—more senior spiritual beings. We have options and some insight into the lives we’re choosing, and we make a choice: this particular set of challenges suits my needs at this point in my development, or it gives me an opportunity to be of service in new ways. Then we engage the incarnational process and wake up kicking and screaming as a newborn child. If you understand the whole cycle, you gain the beginnings of a much deeper understanding of what makes life tick in the human psyche than if you only pay attention from birth to death.

Sandy Sedgbeer
I was looking at some rough statistics: over 57% of people in the world believe in life after death; between 12% and 44%, depending on the country, believe in reincarnation; and 75% believe in heaven and hell. Which makes me wonder—if only 57% believe in life after death, where do the others think heaven and hell are? What do you have to say about heaven and hell?

Chris Bache
And 25% of American Protestants—and about the same percentage of American Catholics—believe in reincarnation. That’s one of the statistics that really blows my mind. On heaven and hell: I think the Buddhists get closest with their basic vision that when we die, we enter a stage where what we are is mirrored back to us in our experience. If we’ve done good—been generous, kind, thoughtful—then that is mirrored back to us in the experience of heaven or heavenly beings. If we’ve done harm—selfish or stingy things that hurt people—then that is mirrored back to us, not as punishment but to educate us. This is the experience of hell. From this perspective, hell is the experience of our shortcomings; heaven is the experience of our joys. Newton’s cosmology seems to integrate that. But this could be mistakenly interpreted as a cosmological absolute, when really it’s simply a stage in our debriefing.

I think the deeper reality is that there is a heaven of heavens—a reality of infinite love, infinite knowledge, infinite bliss—within which the entire human evolutionary saga is just a small piece and should not be taken as defining the limits of the universe. Is there, similarly, a hell of hells—an eternal hell? I absolutely do not believe there is. That has not been so in my experience; it’s a theological mistake. There is accountability—we are responsible for our actions, and nobody gets out scot-free—but that accountability does not include the loathsome idea of eternal damnation. No mother or father would do that to their child for making mistakes, and likewise the supreme intelligence of the universe would not do that to human beings.

Now, as you know from my book LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I spent many years entering hell realms—experiencing extreme torture that looks like a hell realm. My eventual understanding is this: just as my individual psyche retains all my memories, good and traumatic, there is a consciousness of the human species that retains all of its memories and processes them in a central meta-psychological condition—what Jung called the collective unconscious. That means all the terrible things human beings have done to each other—all the wars, horrors, injustices, rapes, pillaging—to the extent they have not been clarified or healed, become part of the collective torment, the collective shadow of humanity. You might say that within the human psyche there are clusters of memories with a hellish quality. But that doesn’t mean there is a cosmological state of eternal hell, because just as individuals can clear bad experiences from their system, the human species can clear terrible trauma from its system. I think that in the early Church, some who had contact with these collective hellish realms mistakenly interpreted them as a cosmological principle of eternal hell.

Sandy Sedgbeer
We’ve got less than four minutes left. Quickly, go back to whether there is room for reincarnation in Christian thought. You say it would only take a small—

Chris Bache
Of course, traditional Christianity would say there’s no room whatsoever—one life, eternal hell. But Christianity has also committed itself that if anything can be demonstrated as a fact, then we’ll find out how it works and integrate it into theology. If reincarnation is demonstrated as a fact—which I think it has been and is being—then Christianity will find out how it works and make room for it. All we have to do to incorporate reincarnation within a Christian framework is expand the notion of the age of the soul. We can even give Jesus a unique role in salvation history if we want to—we may also see him as part of a brotherhood and sisterhood of awakened beings helping humanity. But even if we want to make Jesus the unique savior in Christianity, all we have to do is open up the notion that the journey of the soul is a maturation that takes place over many lifetimes; it’s not finished in one. Then the inadequacies foisted on Christianity by the short-sighted assumption of only one lifetime fall away. If you live six days and die, there’s a consequence to that; or if you do something bad in the first ten years of your life, you could go to hell for the rest of your life—these are terrible consequences. The kindness of the universe, the compassion of Jesus, has much more room to grow in a world that understands he’s talking to souls, not simply personalities.

Sandy Sedgbeer
Last question, very quickly. You end the book by talking about the web of life—understanding life’s rhythms as an ongoing dialog, which you’ve kind of covered. Is there anything you want to add?

Chris Bache
I’ve lived in the reincarnational worldview so long—teaching it, listening to people’s stories and processes—that it’s natural to me to understand the uniqueness of every soul and every incarnation, and the complex background web between lives and circumstances. To see life the old way, in a silo, is completely unnatural—intellectually and spiritually untenable, and spiritually unnourishing. Reincarnation doesn’t answer all our questions, but it opens deeper and deeper questions and answers, bringing a richness and deep satisfaction to the life process. It takes out this terrible horror of a good God—

Sandy Sedgbeer
I’m going to have to cut you there—we’ve gone over time. I’m so sorry, but what can I say? Talking to you is always fascinating. Thank you so much for joining us today.

Chris Bache
Thank you, Sandy.

Sandy Sedgbeer
Life Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life is still available in paperback.

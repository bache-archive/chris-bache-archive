<p>**Chris Bache: ** I think that we have, for several thousand years, been on a journey that has been potentiating individuality. All the patriarchal religions, with their masculine focus, have been a decided potentiation of the individual, even to the extent of asserting the survival of the soul for reward. You know, the soul lives forever in heaven or hell based on the quality of choices that the individual makes. It's an enormous potentiation of individuals at the great cost, of course, of tearing the individual free from the matrix of life. </p>
<p>Now, we seem to be moving in a new direction, where we're recontextualizing the stupendous accomplishment of the fully empowered individual. We're recontextualizing that individual within the subtler matrix of what Buddhism sometimes refers to as the Buddha womb, or matrix consciousness, or Source consciousness. Previously, this was an unconscious relationship of embeddedness, but now it’s becoming a conscious relationship. The ego can get frightened because it thinks that its individuality requires separation and an unchanging self. Typically, these are the two concepts associated with the self—that it must be separate and unchanging. Neither of these is really true. </p>
<p>There is, in fact, a higher form of individuality that emerges and is compatible with interpenetration rather than separability, and with perpetual change, not unchanging. I believe that is fundamentally what Buddhism wanted to deny when it chose the concept of anatta, or no-self. What it was denying was separability and an unchanging self, rejecting those in favor of a dynamic concept of self that is interpenetrating. I think that is where we are evolving, to achieve a true self—reflective consciousness potentiated over countless incarnations. This self becomes increasingly self-directive, emergent, learning, and self-creating, but always contextualized within a matrix that supports and nourishes that process. </p>
<p>It truly is the mother matrix that births this individual genius and is nourished by the learning of that genius. </p>
<p>**Interviewer: ** Absolutely, that's great. And I think that the larger issue behind the fundamental challenge of the 21st century is pushing towards a global consciousness—or global citizenship—which mediates between all the various divisions, nationalism, factions, and religions of history. It leads us into a much more complex, if not boundaryless, condition that doesn't suffocate individuality but definitely recontextualizes it in a different way.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, I have a lot of energy around that question. It has far-reaching implications that span everything from think tanks and the dynamics of augmenting creativity to understanding a new context for social, cultural, and psycho-spiritual evolution. For example, when I think of an individual from a reincarnational perspective, I see them as a living, walking group. The more lifetimes a person has experienced, the more likely it is they will possess greater intelligence, empathy, understanding, and various skills. In a sense, they are a living community of themselves.</p>
<p>When a group of people comes together, whether for spiritual purposes, social discussion, or research, this suggests that if you can harmonize yourselves psychologically, socially, and even physiologically, you can stimulate and augment your individual functioning by enhancing the group consciousness—a group mind. This can have an uplifting, animating, and creativity-enhancing effect on the individual minds present. </p>
<p>This has significant implications for how we learn at a more basic level and how we create new knowledge collectively. It also has profound ramifications for understanding some social dynamics: if we find ourselves in a classroom or larger culture that is highly divisive, we lack that intelligence and empathy-enhancing effect of a unified field, which can draw us into a higher state of sensitivity and knowing. However, if we form a cohesive group with a solid social process, we can stimulate a more potent form of knowing and discovery. </p>
<p>The group mind acts like a powerful transceiver, connecting individuals to a larger divine mind. We are clearly at an evolutionary impasse; we need to break through certain intellectual barriers to solve major technological questions in science, which are critical for environmental purposes. If our planet remains fragmented—politically, racially, and even in terms of speciesism—this fragmentation will prevent the potentiation of our individual genius. Conversely, if we move toward greater integration, social cohesion, and inclusiveness, it would likely have the cumulative effect of amplifying our individual minds. </p>
<p>This enhancement would facilitate breakthroughs with profound implications for technology, the humanities, and the arts, particularly in the sciences, where we face serious barriers in solving technological problems crucial to addressing environmental issues. Understanding the non-local quality of mind has significant social implications. Once we grasp that our mind functions not only based on individual health but also on the health of our collective mind, we realize we have a vested interest in fostering a healthy society and culture. Serving this end can only have a direct, uplifting effect on our individual well-being—not a consequence of virtue, but a result of morphic resonance and the inherent nature of mind itself.</p>

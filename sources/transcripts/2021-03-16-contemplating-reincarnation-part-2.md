This dialogue between Chris Bache and Richard Rudd deepens their exploration of

reincarnation beyond evidence and into meaning, agency, and practice. They

contrast deterministic narratives with a universe alive to our responses, where

chance and intention both matter and where learning carries forward across

lifetimes. Drawing on Tibetan Bardo teachings, near-death life review research,

and Bache’s psychedelic work, they sketch an after-death journey of loving

debrief and iterative growth. Rudd introduces karmic “fields,” Termas

(treasures) and Tulkus (intentional rebirth), while Bache situates them within a

vast cosmology of collective evolution. They weave involution and evolution,

Aurobindo’s metaphysics, and contemporary physics speculations into a

both/and view of freedom and fate. Practical implications include living as a

soul, seeding memory across lifetimes, forming communities of return, and

cultivating “diamond awareness” amid a challenging historical transition.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Well, hello, Richard. It’s good to continue our discussion. In our previous talk,

we began with evidence for reincarnation, those extraordinary children around the world. We

started unpacking that evidence into rhythms of life and stages of human evolution that

reincarnation makes possible. We restored a sense of meaning in the challenges embedded in our

lives, and we saw how therapy can deepen when we address pain rooted in our deeper history.

Today let’s go farther. What are we? What does it mean that we are reincarnating beings in a

universe that supports, nurtures, and created this dynamic? That’s a huge difference. To live in a

universe with a maternal-paternal energy feels like being born into a very different framework.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I also want to say that thinkers sometimes drift into strict determinism, as if every

little detail is preordained. I don’t think we have to go there. Chance is one of the universe’s

powerful elements. We can affirm meaning and intentionality without forcing every detail through

that press. What’s important is understanding that the universe pays attention to how we respond

to chance events as well as intentional ones. Our learning and the quality of our response carry

forward and do us credit, regardless of the origin of our challenges.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Funnily enough, today I recorded a short meditation. I asked people to imagine the

universe criss-crossed by fields of karma, like ley lines rippling through time and space. Then I

invited them to send one beautiful thought from the depth of their soul into that ocean and watch

the universe respond, opening like synapses, sighing and expanding. The incalculable power of a

single pure thought dropped into time-space—that’s a potent contemplation.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Absolutely. That mirrors my psychedelic work. Nothing I did at deep levels was mine

alone. The pain came from a larger web and the healing spread through that web. Practices like

your meditation shift our tilt in the universe. Our senses suggest life happens to us and we’re

its victims. But when you send healing and love into the field and watch it respond—immediately

and indirectly—you experience life as a dynamic field. At subtle levels, you are co-creating your

universe. Karma from the past still moves through the system, but the balance tilts from passive

recipient to generator of the life you now inherit.

**RICHARD RUDD:** You’re no longer a victim; you’re a creator—an active participant. We received a

great question: what happens to us when we die? Many cultures map this. The Tibetans especially

have a living tradition—the Bardo teachings. Psychotherapists have explored this terrain too:

Joel Whitton’s *Life Between Life*, Michael Newton’s *Journey of Souls* and *Destiny of Souls* use

deep regression to chart the territory. We really have two halves of life: birth to death, and

death to birth. We’ve missed the second half, and you need the whole circle. Let’s jump in.

**RICHARD RUDD:** The Tibetans coined “Bardo” for the in-between, but it also names transformational

thresholds—birth and death being archetypal. We undergo many deaths and births within one life,

so it’s logical to see that pattern everywhere in the cosmos. You’ve experienced repeated

transformation in your journeys—constant rebirth, yes?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. I once thought there was a single ego death that launches you into the spiritual

universe. I found there are many layers. Being operational at one layer doesn’t grant access to

deeper ones. You undergo another metamorphosis—another death and surrender—to be reborn into the

next layer, and so on. That reflects the Tibetan idea: each Bardo is a discrete layer of

consciousness. We in the West sometimes use “Bardo” for the whole post-mortem journey, which is

fine, but the Tibetan usage maps stages—Hungry Ghost realms, heavenly realms, and more. The core

pattern matches what psychotherapy finds: after death we reunite with our soul and soul lineage.

We debrief the life we just lived in absolute love—love so deep it’s beyond forgiveness. We see

what we did well and where we fell short.

**RICHARD RUDD:** That echoes the “life flashing before your eyes,” a timeless replay. It’s natural to

have deep reflection at the end—just as we do in life.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In near-death accounts, the life review is a snapshot of the fuller process—reliving

every nuance, far beyond what we track in time. We see how our actions ripple into others’ lives.

We feel the hurt our harmful deeds caused and the help our good deeds gave. We experience the

seamless fabric of our life.

**RICHARD RUDD:** And we experience it without a physical body—through subtler bodies: astral, mental,

causal. Without physical buffering, the intensity can be huge. That may underlie ideas of eternal

damnation or eternal bliss—the sense of eternity outside time. Feeling the harm we caused and its

ripples could seem infinite in that state. I imagine we taste subtle dimensions of karmic

repercussions—very intense.

**CHRIS BACHE:** What locks that phenomenology of eternity into harsh metaphysics is the mistaken view

that we live only once. If there’s one chance and we failed, then punishment must be forever. But

no tradition that explores deeply finds that. We are accountable; we feel the pain we caused so we

can learn—and then return to do better, and better, and grow.

**RICHARD RUDD:** I come from a lineage of distillers. I picture a distillation or fermentation after

death. The grosser elements precipitate back to lower planes, carrying unresolved karma, while

the quintessence—what we truly learned—crystallizes and stays with the soul’s trajectory. Our

acts also seed the collective field; we co-create humanity’s karma. We return to pick up where we

left off, yet with an enhanced soul. Our lives trace an arc—perhaps a spiral or Kundalini wave.

If you can track that arc inwardly, you can remember where you’ve been and sense where you’re

going. Awareness can even help predict—or co-create—your next return.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’ve never cared much for family genealogy, but I care deeply for my soul’s genealogy—

deep remembering of who I am across time. You gain a felt trajectory of development. And you’re

right about the collective. Individual and collective evolve together—distinct yet intertwined.

Everything we do seeds the species, and what the species does seeds us. When I leave space-time,

even if I leave the system, my experiences—and yours—are held by the human psyche. Our love and

understanding become part of humanity’s storehouse and its generative matrix for birthing the

next generation.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Beautiful—like an Akashic field that remembers and grows. I love the Tibetan notion

of *Terma*—treasures of wisdom seeded in time, awaiting discovery by destined teachers. Stories

say Padmasambhāva emanated Termas into future epochs like depth charges. They go off at the right

time through emanations of his lineage. That model changed me. I had an opening, a wisdom memory

rushed through, and I’ve spent my life unpacking it. It shows how subtle layers survive

time-space. It also relates to involution, which we could dive into. What is involution, Chris?

**CHRIS BACHE:** First, let me celebrate your receiving the Terma of the Gene Keys. You didn’t make

them; you received and unpacked them—your half of a larger descent. Reincarnation has a bottom

half in matter and a top half in spirit. There is a community below and a community above—layers

of spiritual beings, angelic and enlightened, helping our gestation. Teachings also descend as

gems of empowerment. When a culture truly understands reincarnation, it tracks great beings and

great teachings through time—Tulkus and Termas—and recognizes patterned descents into minds at

specific moments. Beyond the details, the deeper fabric is the grandeur at which reincarnation

operates. It’s not “who was I in the 17th century?” It changes our dialogue with the universe and

thus our sense of self: a time-traveling being, many times in the spiritual world, incarnating

diamond teachings into body, heart, and mind. That opens the human playing field.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I teach at a university where the secular creed says the universe appeared by chance,

driven by random mutation, your life has no meaning, and when your brain stops, you’re gone. It’s

a crushing philosophy. Beginning from empirical evidence and deepening through spiritual

dynamics, reincarnation restores meaning. Involution is the downward flow of truth, beauty, and

purpose; evolution is our cultivation of it in circumstance.

**RICHARD RUDD:** I sometimes see involution as the future burrowing into the past and evolution as the

past spiraling toward the future. Aurobindo framed involution as spirit seeded in matter. A rock,

a mountain—sleeping consciousness awaiting time. Plants show more; animals even more, meeting your

gaze with emotion. In humans, spirit is obvious—we can do this. Everything is a gem; every atom

holds a spiritual seed awaiting its moment. Where evolution meets involution is the eternal now.

This also softens the free will versus determinism paradox. From involution, all is seeded; from

evolution, everything is created anew. Together they meet like a funnel. Aurobindo really nailed

that—though he’s not easy reading.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Our daily life shows both. Many aspects are highly conditioned, and yet we’re not

subservient to them. We have a cubic centimeter of free will we can expand to a cubic meter. We

can incubate choice. And that’s how I see Gene Keys—tell me if I’m wrong—helping people make

informed choices by sitting deeply with the karmic core and deciding how to engage its outcome.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Exactly. In Gene Keys there are three layers: Shadow, Gift, and Siddhi. The Shadow is

the seed, the Gift the flower, the Siddhi the fruit that contains the next seed. Our densest

places hold hidden heights. As we learn, forgive, and evolve, those heights emerge. Our role is

to enter density as intermediaries and unlock it. That’s a profound responsibility.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Over long time the shadow seeds evaporate through reflective awareness; creative seeds

grow. We become increasingly transparent to the universe’s intelligence. If that’s true

collectively, humanity can cook its seeds and move beyond historical limitations. Then the

greatness we glimpse in Tulkus and Termas becomes a species-wide aspiration—we become a people of

light more than shadow.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Especially as we better sense the universe’s parameters. You’ve got wonderful slides

as backdrop—care to share?

**CHRIS BACHE:** *\[slides shown\]* I collect NASA images and meditate on them—the distances, the billions

of stars, the life burgeoning on countless worlds. The universe’s profligate fertility and scale

give context to evolving life. If life were meaningless chance, we’d be cut off from this

greatness. If reincarnation is real and we’re not limited to one body’s span, then across

countless incarnations our minds become intimate with this generativity. This is our playground

without the physical body—and, holographically, perhaps even within it.

**RICHARD RUDD:** As above, so below—a truth many have touched. Our Hologenetic Profile maps inner

workings that fractally correspond far beyond one body. Taoist alchemy found galaxies within,

corresponding to glands and energies. Knowing correspondences lets awareness travel outward from

within. People touch this in dreams, astral projection, deep meditation, or psychedelics. Feel

free to share a taste.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’ve tried to do so carefully in *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. We’ve only been

conscious of the Mother Universe for a few millennia. Writing is about five thousand years old,

the Upanishadic breakthroughs three to four thousand. That’s nothing beside the billions of

years ahead. We’re just waking up. Practices that reinforce our hybrid nature—spirit and matter,

pure light and pure green—deepen those correspondences. As we internalize them, we become a more

conscious mortar and pestle, integrating above and below. Keep it up for tens of thousands or

millions of years and ask the only serious question: what do you want to be in a million years?

Because you’ll be here. So what is your deepest heart’s desire?

**RICHARD RUDD:** Recently I heard Roger Penrose. Against the heat-death narrative, he suggests the

extremes meet—ultimate slowing mirrors ultimate speed—and an elegant logic gives birth to another

universe from that limit. He even reads repeating shapes in the cosmic background as leftovers

from a previous aeon. That blew me away—coming from a physicist.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Ervin László notes the exquisite fine-tuning of our Big Bang—balances in the first

picoseconds. He asks: is this the first try? Perhaps expansions and contractions repeat. Maybe

this isn’t the first Big Bang but the thousandth, each learning from the last—the background

radiation preserving traces as the universe perfects itself.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Wide views are rich, but how does this help me today? It invites us to engage life as

an intelligent convocation of circumstances, not blind determinism. If we meet our challenges as

intentional—chosen for us by us when we knew more—and trust that our choices matter even when

effects are delayed, life changes. Hard things soften; barren soil grows.

**RICHARD RUDD:** It also gives a different backdrop for our world’s problems. Action from trust differs

from action from fear. Befriending our death and taking a long view—what if communities agree to

return together? That’s why these teachings appeared: to give a focal point for continuous

collective work across lives. Interconnected by the internet and shared resonance, we can

recognize the path again, even as children. Synchronicity guides us. Memory is the game. More of

us carrying memory through the Bardos opens those Bardos for others. As with Tulkus retrieving

objects, once you learn the wormholes, you can play more and bring awakening into the collective.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I think we’re shifting from ego-based lives to soul-based lives rooted in a much deeper

cosmic biography. In the Buddha’s enlightenment, one watch of the night was seeing all his former

lives. Remembering isn’t just facts; it gathers the entire treasury into the present soul. When

he did so, he shattered suffering—living small as if you are only this body. The soul is waking

inside time and space. Allies arrive because waking up is social and generative, never private.

This shift rivals the cognitive leap two hundred thousand years ago, but now awareness, not

anatomy, is changing.

**RICHARD RUDD:** And how that dovetails with a darkening historical period and the birth of the diamond

soul—what I call diamond awareness. Maintaining memory between lives excites people to be here

and to return. Instead of escaping, it’s a compassionate, even warrior stance: this place needs

us.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The creative genius that birthed galaxies also birthed reincarnation. Religions didn’t

invent it; nature did. I doubt it would cultivate us to the first inklings of our deep essence

only to have us depart. Awakening is part of transforming time and space itself. We are changing

the world—heaven on Earth.

**RICHARD RUDD:** And the prophecy. Let’s leave that as a seed for next time. Wonderful—thank you, Chris.

I wonder what our former-life history is that makes our dialogue so easeful and fruitful. I honor

that history, whatever it is. I will contemplate it.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Much love.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Great. Thank you.

<p>Jef Baker: 
Author and psychedelic explorer, Chris Bache meticulously documented the insights from 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years. Drawing on his training as a philosopher of religion and following protocols established by Stanislav Grof, Chris went on a life-changing journey to explore his mind. What he discovered drew him into deep communion with cosmic consciousness.</p>
<p>Chris is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He’s also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. An award-winning teacher, his work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. He has written four books: Life Cycles: A Study of Reincarnation in Light of Contemporary Consciousness Research; Dark Night, Early Dawn: A Pioneering Work in Psychedelic Philosophy and Collective Consciousness; The Living Classroom: Teaching and the Collective Field of Consciousness; and his new book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe, which, I must say, is absolutely brilliant and getting a wonderful reception. It’s a different form of, as you’ve said, the deepest states that LSD gives us access to.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It was quite an adventure—quite a long and interesting journey.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
How long did it take you to write? There are obviously years of notes.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I had years of notes from the 20 years I did the work. I digested that material for more years, condensed my sessions, took notes, and prepared. Once I actually started writing, it took five years. So it was a long project.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
It really highlights the importance of integration. Writing is your modality; for others, it’s art or music. It underscores the need to make sense of these experiences afterward. I remember reading that you’d write as soon as possible after a session, using the music you played as a mnemonic to trigger the emotions that can get lost in the intensity.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Let me mention something about the method, because that was important in solving a challenge with the work. I followed Stan Grof’s protocol: totally isolated, always with a sitter, eyeshades and music—totally internalized sessions. After three medium-dose sessions, I did the rest—73 sessions in total—as high-dose sessions, aiming at essentially 600 micrograms, between 500 and 600.</p>
<p>When you’re working with doses that high and going that deep in serial sessions over many years, recall becomes a serious issue. I found it important to record within 24 hours, and writing was often at the very edge of my comprehension because I was trying to describe experiences that were deeply mysterious to me at the time. Listening to the music from the session in exactly the order it was played helped. I’d play a piece over and over while recording that section, then move to the next piece, and so on. The day after a session you’re rough around the edges, but your verbal functions are back—you’re one foot in, one foot out. By listening to the music, I could get to a state I called “standing at the edge of the well,” close enough to get it down.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
Still a liminal stage. I remember you wrote that sometimes you’d find lines from during the session—“reality is…”—that felt profound in the moment, but later you’d have to sift through to find what could really be applied.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In general, I didn’t try to make notes during the session itself. I was so far removed I wasn’t even in touch with my body, let alone anything going on in the room.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
I’ve been thinking about recording in the moment, particularly with 5-MeO-DMT and toad medicine. People seem to be channeling—languages, vocalizations—things out of this world that are almost impossible to recollect afterward. There seems to be merit in capturing what comes through when the vessel is empty.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It may vary by substance and agenda, of course. The tricky part about 5-MeO is how fast it is—short and incredibly fast. The LSD experience is very long—an eight-hour window. Each poses distinct challenges for recall and integration.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
As with all psychedelic medicines, they each have their own unique challenges. Defining Grof’s protocol, the key question is: What made you decide to do such large doses, given that in his protocol—</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In Stan’s early work, he differentiates between psycholytic or low-dose therapy and psychedelic high-dose therapy. At Spring Grove Hospital, they developed a protocol for psychedelic therapy aiming to trigger a near-death experience in terminally ill patients, and it was limited to three sessions. I thought, if you could go into high-dose space three times safely, you could do it more times safely.</p>
<p>In the beginning I did high-dose work partly because it was hard to find time in a dual-career marriage—and soon there were children. To get a day we could give to this work, I still thought in terms of a personal therapeutic model. The Eastern sources I taught as a professor of religious studies said your karma is ultimately finite, even over many lifetimes. I thought I could work through mine faster by working with high doses. I knew the sessions would be hard, but if I stayed grounded and confronted the shadow, I thought I could move faster. Eventually that model shattered when I realized the sessions went far beyond my personal psyche and karma.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
Was that at the point of the “ocean of suffering,” when you experienced the collective human pain throughout history? That was honestly hard to read.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes. I had to think carefully about how much to expose, because it’s challenging material. But to finish that earlier point, even after I let go of the personal model, I found I liked where the high-dose work took me. It took me farther than I imagined, and I developed a taste for it. I don’t recommend that protocol. I’d do it differently now—be gentler, balance high-dose with low-dose work, and balance LSD with psilocybin, ayahuasca, more organic psychedelics. I started in ’79 and did the work between 1979 and 1999, from age 30 to 50. At the time, I pushed myself harder than I’d recommend. It’s not necessary.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
In the book you acknowledge that too, which is good.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I thought the goal was to get somewhere—to an end point like enlightenment or oneness with God or the primal void. Later—50 sessions in—I had experiences that convinced me the universe and the Divine are infinite. It’s not about reaching an end state. It’s about opening ourselves as deeply as we can to the intelligence of the universe or the Divine, letting as much of it into us as possible, and stabilizing it as deeply as possible.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
You would have known that, at least theoretically, from Eastern studies—that enlightenment isn’t a destination but a journey, cliché as that sounds. Did you go into the sessions with that in mind conceptually?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Conceptually, yes. But even the Eastern models I knew didn’t encapsulate the full scale of what opened in this journey. Yes, you can work through multiple layers of the bardo, the after-death states; you can go into extra-samsaric reality, spiritual dimensions beyond the bardo. But Buddhism, which was the tradition I was most at home with, tends to stop there and invoke the grand silence—when the Buddha was asked ultimate questions, he remained silent. I found realities opening at that dimension that were beyond that.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
Grand silence is often correlated with ineffability, a word thrown around in the psychedelic world, especially with large doses. I remember you addressing that in the book.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think ineffability is overrated as a category. It comes from William James describing qualities of mystical experience. Ultimately, our rational and verbal minds fall silent confronting the infinite, yes—but I work very hard to put language to things, pushing language as far as humanly possible, repeatedly, before surrendering to the ineffable. If we prioritize ineffability, it can sound like the Divine wants to be unknown. My experience is the Divine wants to be known.</p>
<p>Often ineffability is a symptom of hitting experiential limits. When we break into a new level of consciousness, we can’t bring all of it back—there are gaps in my notes. But if you go back to that level again and again, what was undigestible or ineffable becomes comprehensible with repetition and experience. So—this is a little harsh—if you can’t say where you went, you probably just got lost.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
It reminds me of McKenna’s line about bringing back a middle-sized fish—bring something back for the community. If you’ve been in extraordinary realms, bring back something useful. For me, that’s creative; art has a purity—you can create a painting or sculpture others can see and appreciate. It’s a real gift to articulate these experiences creatively. Writing certainly fits that.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It just takes time. I sat with my experiences for years to understand them. As a rule of thumb, I wouldn’t talk about an experience until five years after I’d had it. I had the narrative and notes all the way through, but I was still learning about the journey as I wrote it down.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
I’ve noticed that too—when you start writing, other pieces fall in; it creates space for otherwise forgotten aspects to drop back in. In some Amazonian shamanic traditions, sharing circles aren’t a thing because speaking about your experience the next morning dilutes it.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In Buddhism too, one speaks about spiritual experiences only to one’s teacher. I had to sit with that, because Buddhism is important to me, as are all the traditional paths. I really pondered whether I should even be talking about these experiences. In the end, my experience was that the universe wanted me to share what it had allowed me to experience. I didn’t program my sessions; something else was entirely in control. At the end, it made clear: you didn’t give yourself those experiences; we gave them to you. They were never meant only for you, but to be shared. No one person’s experiences are definitive, but when we share in the circle, we begin to deepen our understanding of this mysterious universe we’re exploring.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
And we can build a cultural picture that provides context. Going back to what you said earlier—if you were to do it again differently, using different plants and compounds like different tools for building a house—do you work with other plants now? Or did your experiences end with those 73 sessions, if that’s not too personal a question?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Not at all. I still use medicines from time to time, though much less than I used to. It’s somewhat a young person’s game. I’m 70 now—if I haven’t learned by now… After I stopped the LSD work in ’99, I occasionally did light sessions, or psilocybin sessions, and a few ayahuasca sessions, or salvia divinorum. I broadened my experience with those substances. But the LSD work was in a category unto itself.</p>
<p>One thing I found was that my body, my system, was storing energy over time. Doing multiple sessions, my system stored energy and used it periodically to trigger breakthroughs into new levels of consciousness. Even if I took a massive dose of LSD today, I wouldn’t get back to where I was working regularly when I finished in ’99. It would take years to develop the power to access those deeper dimensions. Over time I understood that every step into a deeper level of consciousness is a step into a higher energetic state.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
That line really stood out.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It takes a long time to develop the power to access these highly energized states of consciousness.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
In integration work with 5-MeO, I notice many people can be quite depersonalized or dissociated after very high-dose toad sessions. We advise embodiment—bringing the energy back into the body and grounding through the earth, not going into meditation, which takes you further into ethereal realms. Bring it back into the earthly realm, almost to discharge it. The body becomes a capacitor for this energy—an empty vessel to accept it. That’s a good point to jump into the two phases you spoke about: cleansing and ecstatic.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Working the way I did, my sessions basically had two phases. At the beginning of every phase there was an intense cleansing or purification. If I surrendered completely, it would reach a peak threshold, followed by some type of death–rebirth process. Then the rest of the session was spent in an ecstatic state—in some transcendent experience or another. That process repeated itself over and over through the years.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
Do you think that’s down to the nature of LSD—a kind of turnaround point halfway through?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
No. I think it’s a dynamic of consciousness. When you open to deeper levels, just entering them triggers spontaneous purification—of thoughts, emotions, even the body. Entering very pure states initiates detoxification. So many concepts, beliefs, and emotional complexes have to be undone if we’re to experience the universe at that depth.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
Ayahuasca makes that explicit with the purge, but as you point out, it applies across medicines: you remove psychological, emotional, energetic blockages to open to those levels. You extrapolated three factors from those two phases—</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
The depth of the ecstatic portion was influenced by several factors, as I came to understand it. First, the depth of cleansing in the first part of the session—usually, the deeper the cleansing, the deeper the ecstatic entry. Second, the depth of cleansing across all sessions up to that point. Naturally, you expect a deeper experience 50 sessions in than in the first few. Third, the quality of the massive amounts of energy involved.</p>
<p>Working in serial sessions—on average about five a year—I built energetic momentum. I worked four years, stopped six, then worked ten more, averaging five a year. Systematic work takes your body and mind into those states repeatedly; like an athlete in training, you build energy that carries you to new performance levels. The universe carries you into deeper levels of consciousness. Because the sessions were so intense and demanding psychologically and physically, I prepared for days beforehand—physically, with yoga and chiropractic, making sure my body was carefully aligned; and dietarily and spiritually, with certain practices before a session and others for integration afterward. It’s extremely intense work.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
You used the term “breadth” as well as depth—like bandwidth—which I hadn’t heard put that way.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In certain experiences, breadth is a useful metaphor for the ways we connect with humanity, other persons, nature—states of consciousness that are extremely wide, so to speak. Depth is different: entering contact with deeper levels of reality—other systems, other beings, archetypal realities, the void, the pure cosmic void. Different categories of experience.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
That might be a good point to talk about archetypes.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
When I got to the end of the journey, I looked back and asked how many fundamental platforms of consciousness I had entered. I boiled them down to five: work at the personal level; work at the collective mind—where the ocean of suffering arose and purification aimed at the collective more than the personal; then the archetypal dimension; then oneness or causal consciousness; and finally what I call the diamond luminosity—what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.</p>
<p>After death–rebirth at the personal level—about two years—and then two years at the collective level, including purification and successive initiations into the universe, I was spun into archetypal reality. Entering archetypal reality felt like entering a level more real than time and space—more real than our lives here. It took several sessions to stabilize there. The death required was different from ego death: I had to die as a human being to enter archetypal reality. There’s a layer of identity deeper than the personal—our humanness—that had to die to function beyond human consciousness and the collective psyche.</p>
<p>I spent about a year and a half there—just the tip of the iceberg—and experienced two levels of archetypal reality. One, more Platonic: vast beings and phenomena, forces of nature responsible for creating time and space and orchestrating events within them. Another at a lower level, what I’d call a Union level of consciousness: repeated experiences of the psyche of the human species—the collective unconscious—how the system works. Humanity lives as a single entity, psychologically and even physically; our minds are cells within the collective mind, our bodies cells within the collective body. Healing our individual diseases contributes to healing those conditions in the body of humanity as a whole. Over and over I was taken into the dynamics of wholeness.</p>
<p>I think these experiences were educating me—stabilizing at one level, then another—teaching me what I needed to receive later visions: where humanity is going, the birth of the future human, and the crisis we’re approaching in history.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
That really shows the fractal nature of reality—the different levels as parts of a whole. You mentioned entities, which we often associate with DMT, even though we know you have to die to open to those larger realms. I wanted to acknowledge something I noticed in my notes: were you aware of Kalin de E, a strong advocate for 30 grams of dried mushrooms and more, entering very deep psilocybin realms? He passed recently—last week.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
No.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: 
Did you have a teacher during all of this?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: No, I consider the universe my only teacher. One unusual feature of my experiences, compared to others I've spoken with, is that I didn’t have much contact with individual beings, which are so common in the DMT experience. Over time I pondered why. I kept being dissolved into levels of being, then dissolved into deeper levels, opening into vast expanses of consciousness and learning how the universe works—not by engaging discrete beings who live on those levels. The closest I came to “beings,” as such, was in archetypal reality, but those realities were so large that the best my mind could do was image them as galaxies—billions of light-years across. They were profoundly foreign.</p>
<p>I have had contact with beings with psilocybin or ayahuasca, but the LSD work kept dissolving me deeper and deeper into being itself. There was always an intelligence that guided, orchestrated, taught, and spoke to me—an ever-cascading deepening of intelligence—but I never had the sense of discrete intelligences. The universe, to me, is infinite potential. I experienced a dialogue, a rapport, a dissolving into deeper and deeper layers of this infinite ocean. The universe was always there, articulate at the other end, but the nature of the intelligence kept changing as it took me deeper.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: There’s a lot that’s different about LSD itself in relation to other compounds. I think there’s a kind of resonance between the form of the substance—whether a compound or a plant—and the experience. To me, LSD has always been very human-centric, from therapeutic levels of the individual self and cleansing, right through to our place in the largest cosmos we can imagine. As you noted, it’s not about beings from other realms or dimensions; it seems grounded in the human psyche and what it’s infinitely capable of. I’d love your thoughts on whether that has anything to do with its synthetic nature—discovered by Hofmann in a laboratory—rather than occurring in the deep jungles or bush.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: A lot of people have strong convictions about synthetic psychedelics versus organics. I don’t have a big investment in that distinction. I don’t have enough data points to draw hard conclusions. But I do have this observation: the longer humanity has worked with a substance, the more I think energetic fields—like Rupert Sheldrake’s morphogenetic fields—develop around it. When people encounter an ayahuasca deity or a psilocybin deity, I can’t help but think that humanity’s long use of those medicines creates a field around them. When I take such a substance, I’m not just putting a chemical into my body; I’m opening myself to the field of humanity’s experience with it.</p>
<p>LSD is comparatively new—only a few decades old. The ’60s and ’70s are nothing compared to the millennia human beings have worked with ayahuasca. I’ve always experienced LSD as a very clean substance in that sense, without a lot of cultural baggage, at least used the way I did. It repeatedly shattered me—dissolving my consciousness again and again into deeper levels—and took me into territory that felt fresh from an evolutionary perspective. There were places that didn’t feel like many human footprints had landed. I don’t have that experience with psilocybin or ayahuasca; those territories feel more frequently traveled.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: It’s interesting that you also note perceiving the universe as feminine.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: For two reasons I discuss in the book. First, the tremendous love the universe awakened in me—the deep heart-opening and passionate love that took me in—had a feminine quality. Second, a specific cosmology emerged in my sessions that surprised me; it wasn’t one I’d internalized from my reading. I was taken back to the beginning of creation—before the Big Bang—and experienced the universe emerging out of a primal oneness which becomes two, yin and yang. Out of that primal two, one consciousness remained outside time and space, intact, while the other entered time and space and manifested everything that has evolved since the Big Bang. The consciousness that stayed outside felt more “masculine,” and the consciousness that created felt more “feminine.” It was congruent with my repeated experience of the universe as more feminine than masculine. The Great Mother lineage is very strong in me; I’ve always felt deeply connected to it.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: As in many cultures around the world, the Earth is the Great Mother.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I consider my work always in service of the Great Mother.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: As I noted earlier, I’m just up to the point of deep time in your book. Perhaps you could give us a little insight into the nature of deep time.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Early on, after the ocean of suffering in the cleansing phase—really intense collective cleansing—when I came through each session, I’d be spun into a reality so foreign that, after my 11th session, I couldn’t remember it. It took months to begin to fully recall it. I had entered what I later called “deep time.” For a year and a total of seven sessions, I experienced my life as a completed whole—start to finish—with all the days of my life simultaneously present. Holding the totality of my life in a single now was hard for a mind trained to operate linearly. It literally took a year to learn to stabilize consciousness at that condition. I kept going back to the same state; the universe was teaching me how to be conscious there.</p>
<p>Later I entered more radical dimensions of time—evolutionary deep time. It wasn’t eternity or timelessness; it was different swaths of time. I experienced patterns within time on the scale of a hundred thousand years or a million years, either simultaneously present or in accelerated fashion—centuries passing in seconds—life seen as waves of generations rising and falling, in order to understand what lies beneath the evolutionary dance. I encountered so many variations that I called it “deep time,” a different modality of time-consciousness.</p>
<p>I do think the universe contains multiple envelopes or modalities of time. Linear time governs behavior within time-space, but as you move to the edges of space, you move to the edges of time. Between linear time and timelessness—outside time altogether—there are intermediate domains with multiple temporal modalities, and you can learn to stabilize consciousness there. It seemed the universe wanted to teach me certain things, and the only way was to teach me how to stay conscious in these unusual temporal modalities.</p>
<p>The last of what I consider the great visions took place in the 70th session, after one of the most extreme strip-downs I went through. It moved me into the most radical deep time in all my sessions. After this vision, the universe essentially wrapped things up over the next three sessions. That dominant vision took me far into humanity’s evolutionary future.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: What insights did that window of deep time give you about our future direction?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Starting around the 23rd session, and then in a punctuated way over the years, the universe kept giving me teachings about the human story—what you might call the master story. I don’t mean that arrogantly; it’s simply what kept coming. It emphasized we were approaching a crescendo—a true turning point, a before-and-after in our evolutionary journey. After thousands and hundreds of thousands of years of struggling—in a reincarnational framework, which I accept—the message was that humanity was coming to a decisive pivot in its larger story.</p>
<p>In the 55th session it showed me how: a profound opening in the human heart and psyche was emerging, but it hadn’t shown me the mechanism until then. It took me deep into the future, into the death and rebirth of our species, and gave me that experience—not as “Chris,” whose boundaries had long since shattered, but as the species as a whole. Just as individuals die and are reborn, as mystics pass through the dark night into spiritual reality, the entire human species would go through a death–rebirth process. It takes generations to actualize. Things get so bad—falling apart, loss of control, unraveling basic assumptions—that we break down, like dying in a psychedelic session. And just when it looks like extinction, the worst passes, and we begin to emerge. What emerges is a different humanity. Something shifts in the depths of the collective psyche—a pivot at the core of the collective unconscious. From then on, subsequent human beings are born within the matrix of this changed collective psyche. It is, literally, the enlightenment of our species.</p>
<p>Later I understood this as the birth of the diamond soul. In my view of reincarnation, when we die, our consciousness expands into deep spiritual reality; when we’re born, we get small—male/female, this/that. Then we die, we get big; we’re born, we get small—like choosing courses each semester, then expanding again between terms. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the larger consciousness—the soul that holds all our lifetimes—awakens inside time and space. That’s the diamond soul: waking up to our entire identity and history here, no longer tempted to think the present body and ego are our true identity. The soul wakes up on Earth. I think that’s what’s happening for the entire human race. The crises we’re entering—global systems and ecological—mark the ending of a world built by the ego. The ego is a magnificent achievement, but it’s cut off—from itself, from others, from other beings. To solve the problems we face, we must transcend egoic consciousness.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous evolutionary drive to awaken to soul consciousness within time and space. Imagine an entire species awake to its soul reality—now you’re talking about a turning point in history. I think we’re entering labor. Gestation lasts a long time; labor is fast, intense, painful. Humanity has gestated the capacity of soul for thousands of years; now comes the tremendous unraveling—the pain of history we’re entering and will continue to enter for decades. It’s not an apocalypse in the sense of ending existence. It’s giving birth to the future human. The future human is the diamond soul.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: Apocalypse means revelation—lifting the veil, revealing the hidden and the new. Do you get the feeling the time is now for this rebirth? Looking at the world, it feels like a dramatic catharsis. The forces of freedom and control seem to dominate the battle; we could go toward increasing control and totalitarianism or toward increasing freedom, autonomy, and sovereignty. I hear this story from many circles—the birthing of a new age, a new human. It would be beautiful if that is indeed the case: a painful birth to transition into a more functional, balanced species. Could you elaborate?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I explore this in a chapter called “The Birth of the Future Human,” and earlier in “The Great Awakening” in Dark Night, Early Dawn (2000). I was uncomfortable entering this territory at first—I’m not drawn to historical speculation. I began this work for individual healing and enlightenment, and that premise was blown away within a few years. The purification, the access to information and knowledge—everything seemed to be in service of the species as a whole. It’s not that our species is special in the universe, but the Divine’s focus here, now, seems species-wide.</p>
<p>This emphasis repeated so often and strongly that the gist of my 20-year journey became the collective story of death and rebirth. I have deep convictions that we’ve entered the dark night of our collective soul—a period of purification, confronting the sins of our fathers and mothers, which are our own through reincarnation. We’re facing our past choices and their consequences, purifying the toxins they left, to open into new dimensions of our being.</p>
<p>When we open to the soul, two things happen immediately. First, a vast expansion of compassion: our souls have deep histories with one another and with all beings. Waking as a soul unleashes enormous compassion for human and nonhuman life. Second, a deeper communion with cosmic intelligence: the ego operates under a cloud of obstruction; when the soul awakens, it’s easier to enter conscious rapport with the universe’s consciousness. There is an awakening to transcendent consciousness and to tremendous breadth of consciousness. That’s where I think we’re heading.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: Your description of the ocean of suffering—experiencing the pain of every woman who ever existed—exemplifies that. When you experience, empathetically and emotionally, all the beings you have been, it has to lead to something larger. So when did you write Dark Night, Early Dawn in relation to this book?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn in 1995–96. I stopped my work in ’99, when I had already entered the Diamond Luminosity years—the last five years centered on what I call the Diamond Luminosity work. When I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn, I deliberately restricted myself, for the most part, to analyzing sessions from the first half of my journey. I didn’t discuss what was happening in the second half; I needed more time to digest it. In LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I go back to the beginning: start with the first session and move straight through, chapter by chapter, layer by layer—where it started, where it went, where it ended. So Dark Night, Early Dawn was written about three-quarters of the way through the journey.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: I hadn’t read it, so I asked one of our team members, Andre, to throw some questions out about that book, which he had read. One that stands out is your take, as a teacher of comparative religion, on the problem of theodicy—reconciling a beneficent intelligence with radical examples of evil in history and today. Is there a solution to the destructive phenotype within human minds?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The problem is suffering—some call it evil, but that’s a theological interpretation of suffering and pain. Ramakrishna said, if you want to understand God, you must be willing to look suffering in the face, because it doesn’t come from a secondary or demonic source. You have to look deeply into the logic of the universe and creation to reconcile cosmic intelligence and compassion with the fact that existence hurts so much.</p>
<p>The key is understanding that creation—evolution, the manifestation of life—is radically incomplete. We’re building something evolving over billions of years. The universe as we find it now, the last ten thousand years, is a drop in the bucket compared to the billions before and after. There’s great suffering in life as it currently operates, but we are learning from our choices, gaining control over body and mind, and we’re going to keep at it—not for decades or centuries, but for millions and billions of years. So the logic of suffering can’t be judged only by what’s been accomplished up to now; we’re mid-construction. If you’re building a house with stud walls and trusses up but no roof, the rain gets in because you haven’t built the roof yet. Humanity hasn’t yet achieved capacities that would allow us to stop the suffering. It’s not because we’re bad, or manipulated by dark forces; it’s an incomplete process we’re trying to advance as fast as we can.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: Within a yin–yang model—perfect balance, dual forces—do you think suffering is balanced equally by pleasure and good? For every starving child, is there someone experiencing the beauty of a sunset? Does it exist in that kind of balance?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I don’t think so. If, in the long term, deepening joy required equal deepening of suffering, that doesn’t track with where I think we’re headed. I used to ask my classes: If I draw an evolutionary line on the board, how far along are we—90%? If so, certain conclusions follow. But what if we’re only 1% along, and everything we’ve developed is just a tiny fragment of the process? That opens up the picture and hope enormously. We used to think the universe was 6,000 years old; now we understand it’s 13.7 billion years old since this Big Bang—and there may have been others.</p>
<p>The challenge is to comprehend the scale of the project—or, in divine terms, the scale of the Divine’s agenda. We’re children: self-conscious only a few thousand years, and only a few millennia into discovering the universal dimensions of mind. We’re just waking up on a planet 4.5 billion years in the making. Suffering is the great challenge—the starving children, pervasive injustice. I’m not making light of any of it; we must address it. But philosophically, we’re just beginning to wake up to the scale of the universe that birthed us and continues to birth us. From that perspective, we have a lot of work to do—and a lot of hope. I think we’re becoming a species of Christs, a species of Buddhas, a species of prophets—an entirely higher order of species over time. This era’s work is extraordinarily important and very hard. But when we give birth to the future human, like a mother holding her child, we won’t forget the pain, but we’ll know it was worth it for what has been delivered.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: So if I’m to redirect the balance: the yin and yang of pain and joy is laid out on the scale of deep time, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: That touches my heart. I’ve noticed that with 5-MeO—when everything is stripped away and there is that zero-point singularity, when everything is fused into one point—the only thing left is love. The only thing that can exist, or the only thing left to exist, is this universal love. From a neuro-reductionist perspective you can say that’s because your serotonin receptors have been completely flooded. Yeah—it’s love.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Love is the experiential quality of oneness. Oneness and love are two sides of the same coin because when you dissolve into oneness, love is the experience the universe has of itself. There is no division in oneness, so oneness is all-embracing. We might experience this as compassion or love, but the logic of love is the logic of oneness. Everything short of oneness is fragmented.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: Would you agree with a perspective I see a lot in the psychedelic community—that the universe creates separation in order to experience itself, to experience the joy and the pain, because one cannot experience itself alone?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It really presses the question. When we’re asking, “Why existence? Why is there anything?” When there was the primal void—using God language, when the divine was whole and complete in perfect equanimity within itself—why did it manifest the universe, knowing what would be involved, knowing all the pain and suffering that would be involved? One proposal is that this is a way of the divine knowing itself, learning itself. Personally, I’ve never found that very persuasive. I understand it, and I think there is a truth to it, but to make creation an exercise in self-knowledge has never been very satisfying to me. Another aspect is that creation is a way for the divine to share its being. From my cosmology, all of us are sparks of light that emerge out of the primal light—little bitty pieces broken off out of the primal One—and those little pieces grow and grow. As they grow, they actualize their innate potential; they actualize their divinity. In the end, it is as if you have one light growing millions and billions of lights out of its own one light. It’s a sharing of its being, a cascading of the sharing of its being, which I’m sure is an inadequate model by itself, but I’ve asked the universe—</p>
<p>Jef Baker: I’m thinking of the simile of the universe as a diamond with infinite facets, each face being an individual human showing a piece of light that is part of the whole.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: And we always have to remind ourselves that what has emerged up to this point is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s just getting started. We have to imagine ourselves a million years from now—which is nothing in evolutionary time—envisioning the answer to this question: What is the purpose of creation? Why is this happening? A million years from now, we’ll have a much deeper answer to that question, and a million years after that, deeper still. So I caution closure on these questions. I’d rather be agnostic, open-ended. I do think it has to do with self-knowledge and self-expression. I think it has to do with sharing nature—opening opportunities for life to breed life, life to grow life.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: We’re seeing so much—particularly at the moment—people falling into the trap of certitude, of knowing that there’s some grand design behind it all, whether it be hidden sinister cabals. In this time of uncertainty, people seem to be really struggling and looking for answers that resolve some kind of strategy.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Good luck. When we dissolve into the universe—when we die and die and die and dissolve into the universe—many of us tap into a condition where we experience the intendedness of it. We experience the meaningfulness of existence and come away saying, “There is a plan, there is a purpose, there is a project here.” But when we try to describe exactly what the plan or purpose is, we very quickly reach limits. Those limits are built into our evolutionary condition at this moment for this species on this planet in this evolutionary period. I don’t think we have a brain big enough to begin to comprehend mystery at scale. We can feel it, affirm it, assert it—but closure is—</p>
<p>Jef Baker: It steps to our fingers, our nation, our drive to find the answers and pin them down. It’s rather futile. Perhaps that is what gets us into so much trouble.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Certainly one of the things.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: You mention in Dark Night, Early Dawn “Homo noeticus,” and the widespread use of entheogens as a condition for the evolution of humanity.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The concept of Homo noeticus is simply a way of putting language to what different people articulate in different ways—homo spiritualis, the future human, the diamond soul. These are different ways of expressing a very widespread collective intuition: humanity is growing into something new, an evolutionary development. We go from Homo habilis to Homo sapiens, and there’s something after what we are now. There’s something coming, and we generate different words for it. In psychedelic experience this is very strong—that we are an unfinished species, a developmental species. We’re not just getting smarter or more compassionate in incremental ways. There are major turning points where the rules change when we cross thresholds. We’re coming into a bifurcation point in history. We either make it across this threshold or we probably go extinct. I personally believe we will make this jump. And when we do—however long it takes, thousands of years or hundreds—that won’t be the endpoint. That will be the new platform. We’ll eventually reach the end of that platform and make another jump, because that’s the scale of what we’re involved in.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: How do you see psychedelics as a catalyst in this moment? There’s a huge push for them to be used only within the medicalized model as therapeutic tools for trauma. And then there’s the proposal of modern-day Mystery Schools, which I personally think is greatly under-focused. Where do you see psychedelics playing a role in this evolution?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I understand the very strong emphasis in the psychedelic community on demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness of psychedelics. It’s really important that we not blow this opportunity. We kind of blew it in the ’60s—it blew up in our faces. We lost the right to use these things and had to go underground. It’s important that with this new opportunity we document and demonstrate their effectiveness. Right now their effectiveness is being demonstrated in their therapeutic potential. But if we keep going, it’s only a matter of time before mainstream thinkers begin to understand why psychedelics are so therapeutically effective: because they open communion with the deeper dimensions of mind. In the early stages, this encounter with the deeper dimensions of our consciousness is very cleansing, very healing—therapeutically efficacious. That can be demonstrated. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. We go deeper, and deeper. It opens our relationship to each other, to the planet, to other life forms. It opens our relationship to spiritual reality. I was trained as a philosopher of religion, and it’s always been the philosophical import of psychedelics that has interested me. I’m not a clinician or therapist. I’m interested in the philosophical and cosmological opportunities. From that perspective, we’re coming to a critical moment in history. It’s not enough just to heal us at this moment. We have to heal not simply the personal unconscious—though that’s very important—we have to heal the soul, the fundamental human condition. That means recovering an understanding of what we are, who we are, where we are, what existence is about. Psychedelics are being rediscovered in Western industrial cultures—indigenous cultures have had them a long time—where we’ve lost contact with the deeper levels of our own psyche, with the consciousness of the Earth, with the consciousness of the creator of galaxies. Psychedelics can awaken us quickly, jar us into awareness of this deeper dimension at exactly the time we need it. We can’t get through this period of history with the limited understanding of ourselves that grew out of 19th-century science—this materialist, mechanistic, reductionistic understanding—which is an absolutely devastating worldview to try to live in. That we come into existence by accident, it’s all random, there’s no meaning to it—no meaning to our individual challenges, no meaning to history. That worldview leads to the kind of planet we’ve developed, where we try to eat it all alive and get as much experience as we can because when we die it’s all over and was an exercise in futility anyway. Psychedelics help us understand that’s not true. It’s a very different agenda.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: It’s almost like they are the perfect tools for the human condition at this point in time. They really are. It feels like there is a grander scheme playing out with the renaissance. How do we get psychedelics, or what’s a good pragmatic way to get psychedelics, into the field of philosophy more?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I think the therapists have to do their work. That’s what’s really going to open the door. They have to study the physiology of psychedelics and demonstrate their therapeutic efficacy. But the Mystery School aspect, the philosophical aspect—that’s there.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The key to opening this deeper dimension in mainstream society—because at the fringes we’re already open to Mystery School use—is that therapists lead the way. Once we see that therapeutic efficacy demonstrated, society will be more open to the more exotic qualities of psychedelics. But we have a lot of maturing to do. We have so many psychedelics which unleash so many different experiences—it’s an overwhelmingly complex maze. If you go from 5-MeO to salvia divinorum to psilocybin in Iowa—so many different experiences—it takes a huge expansion of our cosmology to even begin to understand how all these experiences can coexist within a meaningful framework of a deeper understanding of existence. Even to begin that understanding, we have to be highly motivated. I think the therapists are the ones opening that door for us.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: I think a good way to understand it is that these are plants that have, for whatever reason, evolved human neurotransmitters. The plants, being much older than us on the evolutionary scale, are almost trying to teach us a simpler way of being, for want of a better description, and to look back through historical lineage to perhaps examine where we went wrong.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Where we went wrong—again, we don’t blame a first grader for being six years old. They didn’t do anything wrong; they’re just six. Humanity has made mistakes, done dumb-ass things, terrible things. But in a larger sense we’re just young, inexperienced, not understanding. Because we didn’t understand, we made mistakes. In Eastern traditions they say the core problem is not that we’re evil—the core problem is that we’re ignorant. We literally don’t know, and because we don’t know, we make bad choices. And because we make bad choices, those have bad consequences. But the more we understand—</p>
<p>Jef Baker: We can make better ones too. I like the analogy: people don’t judge a tree because it grew a little bit this way because it didn’t get enough light from the other side. It just is. We accept that more easily than we do with people.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Exciting times we live in. I know we’re coming towards the end, so I want to mention something. The last chapter of my book is called “Coming Off the Mountain,” and I discuss what happened when I stopped my sessions—the years after I stopped. I mention this because it’s getting easier with the substances available to us to break through consciousness, to break into intimacy with the universe, to break into transcendence, to access information. My experience was that when I stopped my sessions, I thought that since I’d been given so many gifts and had so many mystical experiences and experiences of intimacy with the being of existence—dissolving into the primordial light—I thought it would be easy to stop and be nourished by those experiences. What I found was a deep existential longing to return to those dimensions. I knew I had to stop for reasons I explain in the book. I came to a point where I knew I needed to stop and slow things down, and I knew when I stopped that I would never go back into such intimacy with the divine during my lifetime. It would only happen with death—that I would return to such depth of place. I found myself slowly entering a condition where I was just waiting to die. I was taking care of my children, teaching my classes, doing the things I do, but in my heart of hearts I was just waiting for this life to be over so I could return to the full intimacy of the divine. In time I realized this is not right. This is not the way this work is supposed to end. I had been so careful to integrate every session and not get ahead of myself that it wasn’t clear where I had gone wrong. My life was screaming “failure to integrate,” but it wasn’t clear how I’d failed, because I had paid so much attention to integration. I learned that integrating a session is different than integrating an entire journey. My journey had taken me so deeply into transcendence that I lost my footing in the world of immanence. It’s all the divine—the physical world is the divine—but I had gone so deep into the transcendent divine that I lost my footing inside the immanent divine. It took years—about ten years—to get grounded back in space-time reality so that I could live the remainder of my years within the joy of space-time reality. I mention this because as more people have experiences of transcendence, we naturally want to go there, or let there come in here more completely. It’s really important to address integration while we are going into these states—integrate, integrate, integrate. Integrating a journey is different than integrating individual sessions. It’s a delicate process. I mention my own mistakes to encourage other people not to make those mistakes.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: Thank you for mentioning that. That’s quite pertinent. After this goes to air, the Australian Psychedelic Society is running a large integration workshop. As I was saying before, with people having difficulty integrating such a peak experience like 5-MeO, that embodiment—that immanence, that experience of the divine in everyday life and the small things—and being in nature, eating clean, and looking after the presence rather than constantly seeking transcendent experiences. That’s a beautifully pertinent way to round the interview off. There are a couple of quotes that really jumped out at me from the book, and one that fits here: you said, “It’s all too easy to think that because we have had a deep and profound experience, we have become deep and profound ourselves. This is a false delusion.” Did I describe that right?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yeah. The greatest danger of working with psychedelics is psychic inflation. We can overvalue the temporary experiences and undervalue the stable platforms of our day-to-day consciousness. In Maslow’s terms, we can overestimate the value of peak experiences and underestimate the value of plateau experiences. We can have a very profound spiritual experience on Saturday and still be an asshole on Monday.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: It’s certainly visible within some aspects of this community. But we’re all growing and learning. If you’re happy to leave it there, Chris, thank you so very, very much. On behalf of the Australian society and everyone viewing this, thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Pleasure to have the Congress. Thank you. Good to have this conversation.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: I recommend everyone read your latest book. Let us know where readers can get hold of it.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I’ve been told that Amazon isn’t delivering to Australia now, so probably the easiest way is through digital forms—Amazon will deliver digital. I’m very late in getting my website up; it isn’t finished yet. It’ll be there within a couple of months, I hope. Easiest way to get it is through Inner Traditions, or through Amazon or other booksellers—get it digitally if it’s not being mailed in hard copy.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: Thank you for that, and stay safe in these strange and interesting times.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you for your work. One day I hope I’ll be able to get to Australia in person and have conversations with your larger psychedelic society. It would be a pleasure.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: Absolutely. We’d love to have you speak at one of the larger conferences here, if you’re so inclined.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Be great. Be great.</p>

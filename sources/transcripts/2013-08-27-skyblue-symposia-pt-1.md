**Susan: ** Welcome to Sky Blue Symposia, a convivial gathering for stimulating conversation and a free exchange of ideas. We're so glad you could join us, friends. I'm Susan, your host, and here at our round table are Cybele and Chipper, and today, Chris Bache is kind enough to join us for a new symposium as we continue consciously exploring. Welcome, Chris, it's so nice to have you with us.

**Chris Bache: ** Thank you, Susan, it's a real pleasure to be part of your conversation today. 

**Susan: ** We've been anticipating this, and we're all very interested in your field, so I think we're going to have a cracking time. Good. But I'd like to start off by talking a bit about Stanislav Grof's extraordinary accomplishments as a scholar, healer, pioneer of transpersonal theory and practice. I wonder if you'd be happy to tell us a bit about Stan's work, and most especially, how it's influenced your path, your decisions and your use of psychedelic inquiry.

**Chris Bache: ** Well, Stan's been a huge influence on my life. I met Stan's work, his books, at the beginning of a series of books when I first came out of graduate school in 1978, and his work, and Ian Stevenson, the scholar on reincarnation, but particularly Stan's work, changed the direction the course of my personal and professional life. Stan is a psychiatrist and the foremost authority of the influence of LSD and psychedelics in general, on consciousness and the integrating of psychedelics into the psychotherapeutic process. He had been working for many years in Czechoslovakia at a psychiatric institute. He came to the United States and was the director of research at Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, and after a number of years there, he went to Esalen, where he was a senior research fellow and worked for many years in that peculiar, that very distinctive hotbed of humanistic and transpersonal psychology that we all know and love. At Esalen, he has written over a dozen books. I think he's really one of the most seminal thinkers in psychology and consciousness studies. He was the president for many years of the International Transpersonal Association, co-founder of transpersonal psychology, with Maslow and the ITA, the International Transpersonal Association, bringing transpersonal psychology and consciousness studies around the world and the series of conferences held in multiple countries. He's just been a seminal thinker, and what he did for me was, when I came out of graduate school, I was a very well-educated, atheistically inclined agnostic. I had assimilated the modern and postmodern critique of religion, and I was trained as a philosopher of religion. I had assimilated that critique, moving from medieval theology and the Protestant Reformation and the emphasis on scripture, and then the social and scientific and psychological critique of religion. And then I met Stan's work, and Stan basically put in front of me not only an extraordinary model of consciousness, but he outlined a methodology for using psychedelics to explore the deep recesses of consciousness, both for therapeutic purposes, but eventually the therapeutic trajectory. When one goes deep within, it's like the bottom of your mind; there is no bottom to your mind. You drop right out of the personal psyche into the vast expanse of the mind of the universe itself. So as a philosopher, I mean, I'm not a therapist, and have not primarily been concerned with exploring psychedelics' potential to heal, but I've been a philosopher, and so my interest has been to use psychedelics to explore the deep structure of consciousness, to explore those non-ordinary states of consciousness through which we can experience the deeper structure of reality itself. Now of course, that involves a lot of healing, but healing in a shamanic sense, going beyond, you know, conventional Western senses of healing, healing of not only the psyche, but healing of the soul, but then exploring healing at a deep existential level, as one explores the very structure of the universe. I just couldn't pass that opportunity down. So my problem was, it was 1978; we were past the Timothy Leary era and the '60s. Things had calmed down some, and my government had made psychedelics illegal. And so I had a hard choice to make, and the choice I made was to conscientiously and respectfully use these substances in a systematic, 20-year-long inquiry, which I kept separate and out of my professional life as much as possible. I'm an academic, so I'm a university professor here in Ohio, but in my background life, I began this regimen of systematically exploring the deeper reaches of consciousness, and that influence I brought that into my academic work in a very modest way, but it's really been only now that I've retired that I'm trying to give a systematic accounting of the full nature of that journey that I went on.

**Susan: ** That is fabulous, absolutely fabulous. And it's so needed right now. And I think the time is actually ripe for this. And as we were discussing before we started the symposium, it seems that ayahuasca is the path that is most available to people, at least in North America, but I think people will find their own way to whatever they need, whatever they can, to open up these avenues. I think we're starving for it.

**Chris Bache: ** Yes, yes, yeah.

**Susan: ** And so I appreciate very much what you're saying. And Cybele, you had the next question you were going to ask, yeah.

**Cybele: ** So, Chris, for a beginner, what actually happens in a psychedelic session, and what's the difference between using psychedelics recreationally or using them therapeutically or spiritually?

**Chris Bache: ** Yeah. Well, there are many different psychedelics, of course, and so if we were to take this conversation down to a more precise level, we'd have to discuss specific psychedelics and how they interact with consciousness, but generally the category of drugs that we call psychedelics are consciousness amplifiers. They are amplifiers and catalysts of consciousness, so that what they do is hypersensitize consciousness with a particular tilt one way or the other. But they hypersensitize consciousness so that what happens in a session is actually not simply a function of the psychedelic; it's the function of consciousness itself. So consciousness becomes hyper-energized, hypersensitized, in a very short period of time, and then there is a confrontation with the deeper contents of what we previously would call, you know, the unconscious. The contents of the unconscious begin to surface into one's awareness, and one literally becomes aware of dimensions of one's mind that one previously had not been aware of. If you take psychedelics recreationally, most people would basically be trying to stay in contact with the physical world and stay in the identity of their ego. And then they're entertaining the ego by having some type of hallucinatory experience where there is blending between the what's arising from the unconscious and one's physical environment. And there is a tendency to sort of often focus on aesthetic aspects, visual aspects, hallucinatory aspects, engaging in sensory awareness through music or sight or sound, or if there is a kind of therapeutic aspect, it's engaging the surface of consciousness, the psychodynamic level of one's personal history. A second modality of working well is working therapeutically and working spiritually, what I would call much more serious work, where you try to harness all that energy of that hypersensitivity, so you isolate yourself from the physical world. People will work at night; they'll work, you basically create a psychological space of the Kivas of the southwestern Native Americans, where you isolate yourself from the world. You're wearing headphones, you're wearing eye shades, you're listening to very carefully scripted music. You have a sitter where you're basically creating conditions where you provide maximal confrontation with the content of your consciousness that opens up depths which very seldom surface in just recreational tripping, and I have very little experience with recreational tripping. All of my work has been in this therapeutic modality, in this shamanic modality of working with psychedelics. When the content of one's consciousness begins to surface, yes, one literally usually what happens in the early stages is stresses and strains that we have kept at arm's length are existential questions or doubts and uncertainties that we usually try to stay away from. Paramount, for example, would be the fear of death and extinction. These, these begin to surface and come at you, and how you meet them, if you meet them in an embracing way, one goes through a certain encounter, a certain engagement, where you confront your deepest fears. You engage the most profound questions that human beings ask themselves, and you let the universe take you where it wants to take you. There are a series of crises that emerge of varying depths and varying types, and usually, usually there is a crisis that ferments and develops into a critical crisis, a critical kind of point of impasse. And if you surrender to this impasse, if you surrender to whatever it is, wherever your session is taking you, wherever consciousness is taking you, you will go through a type of death and rebirth process. You'll go through a complete surrender where some part of your life, or some part of life as you have known it will fall away, will just combust. You'll die. Some part of you will die, and then you find yourself waking up in a completely different reality, a larger reality, a new reality, a reality that you had never expected previously, and a reality where the universe operates by different laws, and you are a different kind of being than you were in your previous reality, and that can be an exciting and a terrifying process all at the same time, yeah.

**Cybele: ** So kind of what I'm hearing, though, is that, like someone will take an antidepressant, and there's some brain chemistry going on with this medication. And even, you know, with psychedelics, there's some brain chemistry that's going on, but you're really talking about consciously taking this and moving it forward in a certain direction rather than just having brain chemistry, is that, yes?

**Chris Bache: ** I'm not addressing the physiology of psychedelics at all, the brain chemistry of psychedelics. I'm not really competent to discuss that. I'm really addressing just the psychoactive properties of these substances. My understanding is basically we don't yet know how psychedelics work. I mean, really, we don't; we understand some of the biochemistry of it, but we don't really understand completely how they work. But we've been using them for thousands of years as a human species, and we have a great deal of experience working with them, so we do understand a lot about how they work psychologically and spiritually.

**Cybele: ** Yeah, yeah. Well, thank you.

**Susan: ** Well, this is Susan again, Chris, when psychedelics are not used to entertain the ego, sort of a spiritual materialism, but instead the intent is this spiritual process with an intention of a personal ego death, what happens is, is it this existential death is that a guaranteed before you can, you can move past that that it is about facing one's deepest existential fears. And that's kind of the ring pass, not that you have to go through.

**Chris Bache: ** I think that's inevitable. I want to, if I get lost in this, in my answer, bring me back to the question of dose in low dose versus high dose. But I think it's inevitable that one comes to these thresholds of impasse, because we have to reverse image, reverse imagine everything we know about consciousness. We tend to think of our consciousness as small, and by doing this, we are opening our consciousness to something larger. But actually, I think it would be better to start with what emerges in the work itself is that an understanding that our consciousness is actually infinite, absolutely so. It starts and somehow, in taking birth, in incarnating, we have voluntarily accepted a contraction of consciousness, and we stayed within that contraction so that we begin to think that that's what our consciousness is, that our consciousness is kind of person-sized, but our consciousness is really as large as the universe itself. So if one starts to open to the natural dimensions of your own mind, you have to free yourself from that contraction. The easier it is for you to surrender the identity that you have developed over all your lifetime, the easier it is to open to these deeper currents of mind. If it's harder, it is, the more challenging it is, so that there will always be a crisis that challenges you to let go of everything you think you are, everything you have known as real, your whole vision of yourself and reality that seems inevitable if you're going to push the limits deeply to basically remember what you've forgotten. Now, you can do this in two different modalities. You can do it in low dose work, where you basically energize the psyche just a little bit and you peel back the layers of these contracted identities in small increments, or you can work with high doses, where you basically consume those contractions. You break through those contractions in leaps and bounds, in a way where you force a larger confrontation and explode through those shells and run more quickly and more into the deeper nature of mind.

**Susan: ** Now, you mentioned shells plural, yeah, lots. That implies that yes, that there's more than one. Yeah. That suggests cycles of death and rebirth and initiation, and does that happen through the course of this long period?

**Chris Bache: ** Well, I can't imagine that you would want to that it even we would be capable of doing that in a short period of time.

**Susan: ** Yeah, the universe is so big, she's so beautiful, and there's so many layers of depth to her. She's so magnificent. And it takes years, I think, and even lifetimes, more than one lifetime, to explore the farther reaches of her. Let me give just put myself back in my own history so I don't make false claims. I mean, I made a choice early on in my work, after a half dozen or so sessions to work exclusively in a high dose regimen. So that really has shaped the trajectory of my work. I've always worked with very high doses of LSD, kind of causing maximum combustion, maximum explosion, and maximum absorption into the universe itself. It would have been, I don't recommend that; if looking back on it, what I if I knew then what I know now, I think I would have taken a gentler approach. But at the time, it seemed like, you know, the most reasonable way to go into this, this adventure of learning, but the fool's journey, the fool's journey, yeah. And I what you're absolutely right; you go through. What I found is that there are many layers of death and rebirth that you go through in the beginning. Death and rebirth is often related to your personal identity, your personal history. You're confronting the limitations of that personal history. And then, as Stan Grof describes it, you go into what he calls the perinatal level of consciousness, which is the interface between physical reality and spiritual reality, where the overarching themes tend to be biological birth and physical death, overlaid with all sorts of existential death-rebirth, the meaning of life, whether life has any meaning, whether it's significant, whether we have any significance in the larger order of things. And one often experiences this existential crisis in the context of actually reliving your biological birth. And one also can be reliving deaths that you have experienced from previous lifetimes. It's a very complex amalgam. And the reason is because death and birth is a revolving door. It's how we get back and forth between the world of spirit. So if you are going back through the world of spirit, through the door into the world of spirit, it's not surprising that we would activate memories of how we came back from the world of the spirit into matter, that is through the womb. So people relive their births. And birth is a very often painful and challenging experience. I mean, put yourself in the fetus's position being forced out into the world. And then when one relives one's birth, one is kind of born back into the states of consciousness, that the state of consciousness that you were in before you were born. So you're in spiritual reality. But it doesn't stop there, because that spiritual world is so vast. If you want to explore, it has layers to it, and often these layers are—they've been described. Ken Wilber uses the categories of psychic levels, subtle levels, causal levels, and non-dual or absolute levels, different levels of transpersonal reality. If one is going to allow yourself to be solved, to be dissolved deeper and deeper into the universe, one goes through layer after layer after layer, and there is a tax, so to speak, as one goes into those layers—there is a deeper yielding, a deeper letting go, a deeper kind of confrontation that takes place as one opens to deeper and deeper dimensions of existence. So death and rebirth in this type of work is a cycle. It repeats itself many times along the way, and that simply is a function of the enormous depth and breadth of the universe and of the Divine.

**Susan: ** That is so, so beautiful and so rings true to my own experience. Yeah, really, really, really appreciate this.

**Cybele: ** Yeah, Chris, I have a follow-up on this. Did you ever reach a point of complete giving of yourself or relaxation, allowing into the experience of dissolving into the universe or into source? Because on a recent experience of mine, I experienced the dissolving into source and then rebuilding myself and dissolving into source. And, I mean, it was a continual process of cycling through, but there wasn't—I didn't have any tax or any losing of parts of myself, other than losing myself completely.

**Chris Bache: ** I think many people who do spiritual practice, whether it's with psychedelics or meditation or long-term retreat, you know, their psychedelics is nothing that happens in psychedelic sessions of this sort are unique in the larger spiritual landscape of spiritual practice. There are many methodologies that open us up to these very deep dimensions of life. So people have, and one of the most common experiences that people have who use these practices at one time or another, is a return to source. You know, it's just the most natural thing in the world. It is a waking up to who we always have been. We don't become source; we just return to source. We awaken to it, we dissolve into it, we relax into it. And when, as you say, we kind of, you can move back and forth, kind of, into the source mode, and then back into the individualized, the catalyzed individual, and then back into source mode, back and forth. And yeah, those hours spent opening up to that part of consciousness that you have always been. You were before you were born, you are while you were born, after you were born, that you always will be the absolute source and ground of all existence, that which is alive in you, and that which is the aliveness in all other life forms, that is considered one of the great healing and awakening experiences that humankind can have, to awaken to what you truly are. So our individual identity, whatever it is, whoever we have developed over hundreds, thousands of incarnations, that individual identity and the truth of our individuality plays itself out against a backdrop of the other identity, the identity of totality, the identity of source, the identity of the Divine, if we use theological language. There's a sense in much of the literature, the Vedic literature, and different spiritual systems, to think that it's all about return to source, that ultimately, the goal of spiritual practice is simply to return to source. And if you dissolve completely into source, that is the end of the line. There is an endpoint, and that is the endpoint to return to source. And I don't agree with that entirely for two reasons. One of them is that it's been my experience that if you do return to source, and if you return to source frequently and in a systematic fashion, that oneness itself has many layers to it, and oneness cracks open to reveal many different modalities and layers of depth, even into oneness. So that rather than think that oneness is once you arrive at oneness, that is the end of the journey, I think what the universe shows us is there are actually infinite depths of the one, infinite ways in which the oneness lives in the universe, or it lives as the universe. So that I personally have given up the goal of ever reaching the end of the journey. I think that the Divine is far too vast and far too extended a reality to reach an endpoint of the inquiry. It just keeps opening and opening to me. But the other reason I have reservations, questions about the goal of the journey is simply to open up to source; it's a larger cosmological question. I think we come from source. We come from the one, and the one has birthed the universe, the domain of differentiation, and we exist here as individual beings. But if the goal were simply to return to one that ultimately leads to the metaphysical visions that have dominated our cultures in the last 5000 years, which are up-out cosmologies, you achieve awakening and you leave; you achieve spiritual consciousness, or you return to source, you awaken into nirvana or Moksha, and you leave. Because if you can be in heaven, why would you want to be on earth? Because the spiritual world is infinitely more satisfying than we can be on Earth. And so all the cosmologies of Hinduism and Buddhism and Christianity and all the world religions have basically been up-and-out cosmologies. The goal, one way or another, even for a Bodhisattva, is to empty the world so that we can all become enlightened and return to spirit. But that, I think, is an incomplete cosmology. I think a deeper cosmological vision is emerging more recently, now that we truly are absorbing the scale and scope of evolution, and that is the goal is not simply to awaken to source, but to bring source into and empower the evolutionary project, to actually embody, to incarnate the divine ever more fully in history, so that we'll be doing this for billions and billions and billions of years more. So awakening to source is, to me, a midpoint. It is the turning point, and then this next point is to continue and deepen consciously the evolutionary project.

**Cybele: ** So bringing heaven to earth, rather than bringing heaven...

**Chris Bache: ** Heaven to earth, yeah, bringing heaven to earth and basically creating a greater porosity, so that there are fewer membranes between heaven and earth, so that one can live more consciously the bi-citizenship that we all have. We are physical beings, but we are spiritual beings. And I think the evolutionary trajectory is towards ever greater inner penetration, which is actually changing and redefining what we think of as our natural capacities, what we have, the capacities that we think of as human capacities, and are being dictated and limited by our biology, by the physics of our bodies. I think are actually simply evolutionary staging areas. They're just evolutionary midpoints, that our senses are evolving as consciousness evolves, and just as we are becoming more soulful over multiple incarnations, literally, the way in which we see and hear and think and feel, the depth of it, the entire project of being human, I think, is expanding and will continue to expand, so that literally, in the future, we will see differently, we will hear differently.

**Cybele: ** Thank you. It's definitely something to work on achieving. I think Chipper has the next question.

**Chipper: ** Chris, that sounds a whole lot like what I think of as field work in that inner penetration, that conscious inner penetration of awareness, of shared awareness of this individuality that returns to source over and over again. Each of us brings in the Divine as we're capable is happening quite rapidly. Over the last two years, I've talked to people that have become way more sensitive to what they ingest, what they associate with, what they take care of themselves with, and I have that sensitivity I've felt personally as an expanding capacity for field work, I guess.

**Chris Bache: ** Yeah, yeah. Uh. Yeah, you know, scientists are now telling us that everything that we had thought of previously as particles, particles are really fields. If you get down into the deep quantum level of reality, that particles are really fields. We are, fields are primary; particles are secondary. And I think that's true of us as human beings too, that we are all interconnected in these vast fields. And we are interconnected to our own history, our reincarnational history, through the fields of consciousness. And we are connected to each other through the fields, the morphic fields of the human psyche, and these fields, I think, are becoming more energized in history, that it's almost like nature has turned up the fire and it's bringing the human psyche to a boil. I think that the collective unconscious, Jung's collective unconscious or the mind of the species, is actually becoming more and more energized for a variety of reasons, so that, and we all feel it. I mean, we can feel this kind of urgency, kind of a crescendo that's coming up underneath us. And I think there's a, you know, the first book I wrote was on reincarnation. And for me, reincarnation is just one of the simple facts of life, I mean. I think we're coming to see that, that the empirical evidence for reincarnation is incredibly strong, stronger than it's ever been historically. And I think there is a—I think that the evolutionary sequence, which is underwritten by reincarnation, is progressive, becoming more conscious, more aware, more empowered, learning from our mistakes, exercising new capacities. There is something happening now on the planet; there's an interrelationship between the global crisis that we have entered and a deep individual soul fermentation that we have entered. I think the way I language this is that I think the planetary crisis is driving us past our limitations of the past, driving us to a global citizenship, driving us to a consciousness of oneness on the planet that's forcing us to outgrow the divisions of our history, of our egoic consciousness, what they are anyway, for sure, yeah, seeing for what they are. I mean, they're real, but they aren't the whole story. And I think that there's a parallel process taking place at the very depths of the psyche, that there is a psychological at a soul level, all of our previous lives are coming together into critical fusion. So that as above, so below, as without, so within. So that as the world enters deeper, more and more deeply into this crisis, there is an inner gestation that is taking place. So I think that where this is taking us is that we are literally giving birth to the soul in history. And by the soul, I mean the consciousness that integrates all of our previous lives into a singular consciousness. Usually, we only make contact with the soul when we're dead, when we enter the Bardo. We retain, we recover our full memory. And we usually give that memory up when we are incarnate; we shrink our memory. But if we keep that process shrinking and expanding, shrinking and expanding, sooner or later, I think inevitably, the process is not just towards more sophisticated individual egos, but to the birth of soul consciousness on the planet intact, so that our consciousness never is tempted to shrink to the limits of just this body, just this individual of physical embodiment, right? I think we're giving birth to soul. And so many people are feeling this. They're feeling this kind of deep awakening in their body, in their psyche. And I think there's a relationship between the crisis that we're all facing on the planet, so that the global—in a nutshell, the global crisis is actually the womb which is engendering what I call the birth of the diamond soul in history. And the diamond soul is simply my way of language. And what many people are intuiting that consciousness of a higher order, a more complete order, is manifesting in time.

**Chipper: ** And by order, I'm going to assume that you're talking structure.

**Chris Bache: ** Structurally conscious of itself, yes, yeah, the deep identity, the soul identity, is emerging underneath the egoic identity, and it is absorbing and bringing to fruition the egoic identity. I think, I really think, like many other people, I think we are at a cusp. We literally cannot afford to stay at the egoic level of conscious evolution, because ego is a divided consciousness which leads to a divided world, which leads to a competitive world and a world of rampant consumption and violence.

**Chris Bache: ** I mean, a divided consciousness leads to a divided world and an awake consciousness, an integrated consciousness, a soul embedded consciousness, which is conscious of the breath of our existence, conscious of the breath of mind, leads to a compassionate world, leads to a world which is first healed and then carried forward into, I think, into the creation of new cultural forms. I think we are just, we are really on the cusp of creating an entirely new cultural form, as many of your participants in previous conversations have pointed to, right?

**Chipper: ** It does seem to be a widespread topic of conversation these days.

**Susan: ** Yeah, Chris, for years, I've been feeling like we've been approaching a collective initiation process. Yeah, and we may have to do it individually to kind of get the ball rolling, so to speak. But also that as individuals do it. It's done for the collective yes and but also, is the collective doing it to individuals? Yes?

**Chris Bache: ** I think, yeah, the relationship of individual consciousness and collective consciousness, particularly in this evolutionary pivot that we are making is really the dominant theme of my second book, Dark Night, Early Dawn, where here I'm talking about the dark night of the soul and the dawn of the rebirth consciousness. But here the emphasis is not on the rebirth of the individual or the dark night of the individual soul, but the dark night of our collective soul. Let me just back up and just give you my particular perspective here. When I reached a certain point in the early stages of my own psychedelic work where I had already gone through a series of death and rebirth experiences at the individual level, had my ego shattered in the different ways that it shattered in this type of work. And then what happened is that I entered into what I would describe as the ocean of suffering. I began to have just for years sessions where the suffering that I was confronting was not personal; the suffering was collective, just vast tracks of human suffering of all sorts of different orders of magnitude, just shattering levels. And first I was I asked myself, What are all these people doing in my therapy? You know, what's humanity doing showing up in work which I had previously thought of in terms of individual transformation? And what I came to understand over time is that I may have thought that I was doing a process of individual transformation to maybe contribute something to the collective good. But the universe doesn't think in those terms. The universe, the game that the universe is involved with on our planet right now, is nothing less than the transformation of humanity as a whole. That's the game. That's where we have to go. That's what's happening. So the collective psyche is boiling and is bringing its history forward, outpouring in all sorts of historical and social movements as all the sins and toxicities of our past are coming forward. Naturally, we feel this at an individual as well as collective level. And if you do deep spiritual work, it's people find in hypnotherapy and in yoga work and deep meditation practice, or in psychedelic work, shamanic work, that they begin to open up into these vast tracks of human suffering, which, in my experience, went on for about three and a half, four years. I began to understand that the patient in these sessions was not me. The patient was some aspect of the morphic field of the human species, so that it's the collective psyche which is trying to heal itself and taking advantage of the opportunity that I had provided to heal itself. And I think that's happening in all of our lives, that we are all with one foot in a personal world and one foot in a collective world, and so we're all channeling a healing energy, which is pulling poisons out of the collective psyche and putting healing energy into the collective psyche.

**Susan: ** Well, this actually answers a long time question of mine, because I've had two near-death experiences, and I trained as an existential and transpersonal therapist, and then practiced at it as one for years, but I was in that field of experiencing things that had nothing to do with me. And I was very aware it wasn't mine. It was not only the ancestors, not just personal, but the collective. And, you know, I take it back and back and back, but when you said the universe may or source makes use of those opportunities, that makes sense to me. So if an individual, through whatever means, as you mentioned, makes themselves open or available, that source is going to use that opportunity. That is really, really helpful and insightful.

**Chris Bache: ** Wow, that since we're all—and I think we all chose this—we knew what we were getting into before we were born. We chose to enter into this time in history, even though we may have forgotten that choice temporarily while we're here. There are no victims here, and there are no innocents. In a way, we all knowingly embrace this time in history in order to be a co-participant in this evolutionary journey that we are on. And clearly, the fire is heating up, and it's bringing out these collective threads where I think they probably maybe weren't as pronounced a thousand years ago, but they're very pronounced now. My students have, they have people who are not even doing this sort of deep, introspective work. I've had so many students recognize that there is more going on in their pain and suffering and their healing of their pain and suffering than could possibly be explained in terms of simply their own personal life. And I was talking years ago to Roger Wilber, who’s passed on now, one of the great past-life therapists, and he said he had come to the same conclusion that he was working with clients who were just uncovering so many lives, lifetime after lifetime of pain and suffering. He began to realize that somehow, in doing past lives therapy, they had become a midwife to a healing that was reaching beyond the soul history, as you said, reaching into the ancestors, reaching into the collective so that their work may have begun as an individual soul healing, but it actually had changed into a much larger collective healing exercise.

**Susan: ** Absolutely, absolutely. And like you said, it's speeding up so much now and it's quite overwhelming at times for some people. Hopefully, there's enough information going out and like our program here that gives people some sort of structure that they might be able to make some sense of things, or if they don't know about it, they feel that somebody else can resonate with what they're going through. Because I imagine if people do experience it and don't know what they're going through, that could be quite dangerous. It would be awful.

**Chris Bache: ** And there are times when you want, you may need to step back from the intensity of this work and there are other times when your life allows you to step more deeply into it.

**Susan: ** And then sometimes, and just take a break and time to integrate it all and be you with it and even see how your whole life changes as a result of it, because it will be drastically changed. Yes, no doubt about it. Yeah. Chris, could you tell us the names of your books and maybe just a brief synopsis about them?

**Chris Bache: ** The books are—the first one is called Life Cycles: Reincarnation in the Web of Life. It's basically a book on reincarnation. It looks at reincarnation through the issue of empirical evidence. It looks at it as a psychological and spiritual phenomenon, and then once it documents the empirical evidence for reincarnation, it then asks the question, so what? What's the difference if we see ourselves as reincarnating beings versus one-time-through beings? So it's just one of the early attempts to explore the universe as a pulsing, throbbing, reincarnating universe. The second one is Dark Night, Early Dawn, which is a book in the philosophical study of non-ordinary states of consciousness, specifically psychedelic states of consciousness, but integrating psychedelic studies with near-death episode research and out-of-body research, trying to ask the question, does the universe as it shows itself in near-death episode research, in out-of-body research, particularly Robert Monroe's work at the Monroe Institute and psychedelic research, are those pictures cohering, or are they fragmenting? And so exploring that and exploring the ways in which the collective psyche shows up in the work of individuals, and the way the individuals' work influences and contributes to our collective evolution. That integrated part. And the third book is called The Living Classroom. And all of these you can get on Amazon or other book sites. The Living Classroom tells the story of—it's about fields of consciousness, collective consciousness, the subtler background textures of consciousness as they surface in the classroom. Because what I found over time was, while I kept my personal life, my quote, personal spiritual practice out of the classroom, because it's not appropriate to bring it into the classroom—that was my weekend work—what I found was that the work I was doing in these very deep states of consciousness outside of the classroom began to impact my students in the classroom, and I began to understand and had to think about and theorize about the nature of collective consciousness, not at the species level, but actually at a very intimate level of the students that I was working with, week in, week out, year after year. So it's about teaching and collective consciousness. So those are the three. And now I'm going back to the topic of psychedelic work and trying to give some type of philosophical description or exploration of that 20-year psychedelic odyssey that I went on between 1979 and 1999.

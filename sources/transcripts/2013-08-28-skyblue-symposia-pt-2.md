You are listening to part two of our conversation with Chris Bache.

**Susan: ** Chris, you've mentioned this crisis or pivotal point for humanity. What insights or experiences have you gained from your psychedelic work regarding this crisis, and what do you see as the evolutionary trajectory of humanity as a whole through that?

**Chris Bache: ** Well, that's a big question, isn't it? It's one that has absorbed a lot of my time. In non-ordinary states of consciousness, it's been a recurring theme. When your individual bubble of consciousness dissolves and you experience a deeper reality, you fall into what I call deep time. You move out of linear time into a more expansive sense of time. The universe has many different time signatures, and you can experience arcs of time over thousands and thousands of years as if it were a single hour. I found myself drawn into the evolutionary arc that underlines my individual existence, which is just one layer of the larger evolution of the planet and solar system.

During these experiences, I was often pulled into large episodes of collective suffering. Just as I would feel this deep pain, it would peak, leading to a cathartic death-rebirth process. When I emerged from these spaces, I would find spiritual ecstasy or deeper truths about our collective journey. I repeatedly experienced this evolutionary crescendo—a breaking forth of deeper consciousness in history, a consciousness that is emerging into time. In one extraordinary session, I went through a collective death-rebirth process for our species. I felt as if I was billions of people at once, each facing a life-death crisis on a global scale. This profound restructuring of life felt imminent, as if we were on the brink of extinction due to our ecological recklessness.

**Susan: ** So, this was more than just an existential death; it had physical implications as well?

**Chris: ** Yes, it was as if an entire species was brought to the edge of extinction. During this crisis, it looked like death was inevitable—like being on an island with a hurricane approaching, where everyone was just hunkered down, holding their breath. Yet, suddenly, in the last moments, the storm crested and passed, and survivors began to find each other and rebuild. What emerged was an extraordinary explosion of new social structures reflecting a new consciousness born from the trauma of near extinction. This is what I think of as the birth of soul consciousness, which knows the truth of our interconnectivity and our place in the universe—not just with other humans, but with all beings sharing this planet.

**Susan: ** You’re describing the prenatal perinatal matrix outlined by Stan Grof, but on a collective level.

**Chris: ** Exactly. This future human I experienced is extraordinarily beautiful—it's a healed humanity with open hearts, fully embracing one another and communing deeply with the divine. It’s a humanity where war ends, and collaboration becomes the norm, creating new forms that reflect these new realities birthed through crisis.

**Susan: ** I’ve heard this described as "homo luminous." Do you think this goes beyond human evolution and resonates throughout the cosmos?

**Chris: ** Absolutely. What happens here is mirrored in processes across other planets, solar systems, and galaxies. This gestational process is a natural extension of evolution reaching a new critical point. Everything we learn about our own evolution applies to other parts of the universe, making us cosmic citizens as well as global ones. There will come a time when higher orders of community and intergalactic communion will emerge as part of our evolution.

**Susan: ** Beautiful. Thank you for that.

**Chris: ** It speeds up the more we cooperate with this process. We have a vast distance to travel as a species in a very short timeframe. Many people ponder how we can change sufficiently to survive the ecological crisis. The key lies in understanding the dynamics of collective consciousness. This isn't just about 7 billion individual minds needing to change; it’s the collective psyche undergoing transformation. Once we reach a tipping point within that unified field, the pace of evolution can accelerate exponentially.

**Chipper: ** It's like playing chess with Koyaanisqatsi.

**Chris: ** Yes, exactly. That’s why programs like yours are so important; they create connections that amplify understanding. 

**Chipper: ** In your advanced sessions, you’ve experienced various permutations of the divine and domains beyond our narrative of evolution. Would you share those experiences and insights with us?

**Chris: ** This is hard to do without sounding like a madman. Speaking about psychedelic experiences is challenging because they expand the conversation so radically. If we let go of all preconceptions and delve into the possibility that we can tap into the mind of the universe, an extraordinary story unfolds. The privilege is to experience the alive currents of the universe that are hidden from ordinary awareness. To enter archetypal realities—beyond time and space—is to be drawn into the very process of birthing time and space itself.

To taste the intelligence behind the universe is a mind-shattering experience. Dissolving into that state and beginning to connect with divine love and compassion radically reframes our understanding of life. The love that undergirds this universe is as immense as its intelligence. Life can be hard, filled with suffering, which may make it easy to argue against the presence of love and intelligence in existence. But to experience communion with that intelligence and feel the love behind it showcases that the suffering we're experiencing is just a phase—not an enduring condition.

**Susan: ** Is this a state beyond even our understanding of creation and evolution?

**Chris: ** Yes, it transcends all time and space, serving as the fundamental reality where form does not exist and where all forms are birthed. This reality is often referred to as the void or the divine plenum—it's the mother universe, the essence that underpins all manifestation. As such, we need a radically expanded cosmology to acknowledge that many universes exist, all arising from this primal formless reality.

**Chipper: ** It sounds like the influence of Sri Aurobindo's thoughts on super consciousness.

**Chris: ** Yes, Sri Aurobindo is one of the thinkers guiding us to pivot from an old cosmology toward an incarnational understanding, which is vital.

**Chipper: ** Earlier, you mentioned recommending a lower dose regimen for your younger self. What would you advise based on your experiences?

**Chris: ** That depends on what someone aims to achieve. When I began this work, I sought enlightenment, a deeper awareness. I discovered that if you want to attain the depth of reality, it is better to work with lower doses, focusing on uncovering the ego and truly integrating those experiences. My journey involved blending contemplative practices with shamanic ones. 

While I've taught courses in various spiritual traditions, I found that high doses often diverted my focus from individual enlightenment to collective exploration. Working with lower doses in concert with a strong daily spiritual practice builds a more solid foundation for deeper experiences. I believe alternating between synthetic psychedelics and organic ones like psilocybin can ground you in these profound expanded states. For instance, I’d suggest that 300 micrograms of LSD is more manageable than 500 or 600 micrograms. 

**Chipper: ** That approach makes sense. Continuous high doses without the purpose you’ve described can feel tiresome.

**Chris: ** Exactly. Some believe that returning to the same high doses yields repetitive lessons, but for me, if you maintain an internal focus and willingness to evolve, the universe continues to unfold new insights. Eventually, I had to step back from high-dose work because it was overwhelming my physical and subtle energy bodies. 

The intensity of those experiences made reintegration difficult; everything felt more beautiful in those deep states. The challenge turned from simply breaking free to focusing on integration—how to weave those experiences back into everyday life.

**Cybele: ** Fascinating. Chris, would you say that ultimately, unconditional love is the lesson we all need to learn?

**Chris: ** Yes. Unconditional love and unrestricted compassion correlate to oneness. If the universe exists as a single entity, then love is how oneness manifests in the human heart. That deep sense of acceptance, even toward those who cause harm, embodies the essence of our connectedness. Love—that is the breath of the universe as one.

**Cybele: ** Do you sense that these experiences help co-create a meeting with the divine, allowing us to remember what we've forgotten?

**Chris: ** Definitely. The classic story of reincarnation suggests that we remember at death and forget at birth. Each technology we employ—be it meditation, deep tissue work, or psychedelic experiences—loosens the constraints of our identity, opening us to a dialogue with the universe that feels like remembrance. As we collectively remember who we are and what our purpose is, every individual awakening aids others in their remembering. We create a field of remembrance, leading to communion with that living universe—a universe rich with intelligence and intentionality. This collective remembering allows us to co-create thoughts, feelings, and realities that have never existed before.

**Cybele: ** Thank you for sharing that, Chris. It’s been enlightening.

**Chris Bache at SkyBlue Symposia - Part 2 of 2**

Chris Bache: You only get promoted for your 'muggleness.' At universities, it’s a different order; that's a complicated process and not entirely comfortable. I've learned how to live in two worlds. This work, because of its legally problematic nature, cannot be openly discussed in academic circles. It can be talked about in certain avant-garde circles, particularly in Bay Area contexts and very progressive institutions. I've taught courses on this type of work at the California Institute of Integral Studies in the Department of Philosophy, Cosmology, and Consciousness. Here in Ohio, it’s a much more conservative environment, and they have the right to be where they are. There were tensions, but ultimately, I found I could work creatively with them. As my consciousness changed, so did the experience of my teaching and what I taught. There are two levels to consider: one is content, and there’s a deeper level concerning the energetic being beneath that content.

Content-wise, I was able to design courses to discuss some of these phenomena. For instance, I taught a course called Transpersonal Studies, where we studied reincarnation research, near-death experience research, and out-of-body research. I also taught a course called Psychology of Religion, which was really about Transpersonal Psychology of Religion, where I traced the history of depth psychology and spent a significant portion discussing Stan Grof's work in psychedelic research, never referencing myself, just the literature and Grof's work. Over the years, I taught seminars in advanced Transpersonal theory where I created an academic context for discussions about these realities.

My colleagues were always supportive, aware that I was on the far side left, yet they granted me room to explore. I found that if you have student numbers and if you’re a good citizen of the university—if you do your work and support the department—you have more room to improvise and push boundaries than might initially appear. Many people have asked how I managed to teach the courses I did at this state university. I found that we can claim more freedom and flexibility if we’re willing to seize it.

There are others pushing boundaries too. Tom Roberts in Illinois has been teaching about psychedelics for years at a state university, creating an academic context where you pay your academic dues to the discussion. However, a deeper process was occurring. The deeper my experience became of this universe, the more it changed how my mind and psyche worked, altering my energy. This shifted my presence in the classroom. Even when teaching subjects unrelated to psychedelics, I found that at a subtle psychological level, something unusual happened between me and my students.

For instance, I would reach for an example to illustrate a theoretical point, pulling from my imagination, and then a student would approach me after class. When he was sure no one else could hear, he mentioned that my example perfectly mirrored an experience he had just had. This happened repeatedly, with students finding pieces of their lives reflected in my lectures, often in deeply personal ways. It was as if their souls were whispering to my soul, bringing forth information they needed to heal themselves and advance in their own journeys. During those years, I became somewhat of a lightning rod for the souls of my students.

This intensity led me to engage this process consciously and understand it more deeply to ensure it wouldn’t overwhelm my students. That's the narrative I explore in my book *The Living Classroom*, detailing the intricate dance that unfolded between us. I began to recognize that it was more than just resonance between us; there was a resonant field created from our collective efforts, focusing on intense study, which energized our individual minds.

While some faculty had reservations about my approach, my students never did. They were much more forward-thinking and eager to engage, resulting in wonderful classroom adventures. I realized I couldn’t share everything I knew to be true in an undergraduate classroom—it just wasn’t appropriate. Towards the end of my career, this restraint became difficult for me, as I felt a tension in my throat when my instinct was to express more than my situation allowed. It was a struggle between the forces holding me back and those wanting expression.

I served as a professor for 33 years, and while I loved being in the classroom and with students, I chose to retire to write books that I felt I couldn’t while working in academia—books that embrace the hidden aspects of my life, particularly my experiences with psychedelics. I hope to connect with a different, more spiritually informed audience in this phase of my life.

Cybele: It sounds like your experience with your students was really beautiful.

Chris Bache: Indeed. We were profoundly touched and learned many things from each other. The last third of *The Living Classroom* consists of essays written by my students. I often required them to write, mostly academically, but occasionally, a student would take the chance to pen a more personal essay, sharing their most profound experiences, stories of loss, and transformation. I began collecting these pieces, asking if I could keep copies for future use. When I wrote *The Living Classroom*, I knew it was time to present their stories to the public because they were just so beautiful.

Cybele: It sounds like it’s a stretching dance of straddling two worlds. We've all experienced knowing something that the person we’re talking to isn’t ready to hear. Now, we have the freedom to discuss these things openly and let people engage at their own pace.

Chris Bache: Yes, and the undergraduate students seemed far more receptive than the faculty, who belong to a different generation. They already have these ideas embedded within them.

Susan: Don’t you think that those doing this work enable younger generations to come in already knowing much of this?

Chris Bache: I hope so. We all have different roles in this evolutionary saga. If there is a ‘seventh generation’ as the Hopi prophecies suggest, and perhaps the Indigo generation, we might be part of the sixth generation. Our job is to break new ground for these younger individuals and create a container that allows them to develop their capacities and consciousness. I believe our work lays a tangible social structure and creates a subtler psychic framework that empowers them.

Susan: It's definitely a collective consciousness. What we learn or discover impacts them, especially since they're often more open-minded than we were.

Chris Bache: Yes, it’s a complex feedback cycle. For instance, I’ve often experienced reading a book that opens my understanding and then, within a week, a student would ask a question I hadn’t been able to answer before. It’s fascinating how the universe seems to use one person's learning to benefit others. But then I began to realize that it’s reciprocal; the students’ questions were seeding my own understanding and interests.

Cybele: What are your thoughts on the legal use of psychedelics in therapy and healing? What do you think is the future?

Chris Bache: I believe we're tilting back in the right direction. Many listeners may know about MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies), which is working to change laws around psychedelics and bring them back into respectable research and therapeutic contexts. I don’t believe we can lose these substances forever. We’re moving away from the oppressive policies of the 60s and 70s, beginning to re-appropriate these substances for their therapeutic potential. 

As we open to Ayahuasca circles and the practices of indigenous populations, we’re not only healing psychologically but delving into the spiritual and philosophical realms. I think as we reclaim these substances for clinical, therapeutic use, we are also accepting their philosophical value. The universe that psychedelics reveal itself to be is inherently compatible with the scientific world. With our growing understanding from quantum theory and field theory, it’s becoming clear that psychedelics align beautifully with the world of academia.

There’s a shift occurring among leading thinkers that will open more doors for psychedelics in the future. I foresee a time when you can engage with psychedelics as part of your therapeutic regimen or spiritual practice. Some Ayahuasca communities in the U.S. have taken their case to the Supreme Court and won the right to use Ayahuasca in their spiritual practice. We’re already seeing legal progress.

Psychedelics, in my view, are essential for facilitating this intellectual paradigm shift. Historically, it took decades of spiritual practice to access Transpersonal dimensions of existence. Yet psychedelics can provide even a modest individual with a brief gateway to the deeper textures of reality. Even if one can’t fully abide in those realms, they change how we understand our existence. They’re tremendous door openers, and I don't believe we can overlook the invitations they present.

Cybele: It seems that psychedelics allow individuals to step outside of the Newtonian framework and observe the 'water' around them, opening whole new possibilities.

Chris Bache: Yes, absolutely. Once that door opens, it doesn’t necessarily mean continued psychedelic experiences; it may guide one towards more traditional spiritual practices like meditation or yoga. The door opener effect is significant. For many decades, I’ve witnessed how detrimental a secular humanist perspective can be for students. The belief that existence is merely an accident fosters a sense of chance without deeper intentionality, leading to personal and social pathologies.

But with emerging ideas that the universe is alive, we can document its liveliness in our labs and facilitate experiential immersion in that aliveness. This broader understanding provides us leverage to move away from blind consumerism to draw from a deeper connection to the universe itself.

Cybele: For those experiencing a crisis of meaning, this could be a beneficial avenue.

Chris Bache: I believe exposure to the right literature can be immensely beneficial. I sometimes conduct a workshop called "No Fear of Death." My assertion is that reading the right dozen books should dissolve fears around death and open up possibilities for understanding life and its purpose. Research on reincarnation, near-death experiences, and life between lives can create an intellectual context that opens new avenues for exploring the meanings and potentials of life.

Susan: Before we conclude this symposium, I’d like to share something you wrote in *Dark Night, Early Dawn*: “I believe that this divine marriage of individuality and essential ground of the masculine and feminine of Samsara and Nirvana is the dawn humanity's dark night is driving toward. This is the dawn that, if successfully navigated, will unite humankind and elevate us into a form that has never before walked this earth...”

Chris Bache: Thank you for that.

Susan: Thank you so much for such a wonderful conversation. We truly appreciate it.

Chris Bache: Thank you. It’s been an honor and a privilege to spend this time with you.

Chipper: Can I read a poem? It goes, “Moving as love’s beauty is moving, standing nakedly and blushing in photonics, brightly rushing as love’s artistries unbrushed…” 

Chris Bache: That’s beautiful. Thank you.

Susan: Chris, could you tell us the names of your books and maybe give a brief synopsis?

Chris Bache: Sure. The first book is *Life Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life*. It explores reincarnation through the lens of empirical evidence as a psychological and spiritual phenomenon. It asks what it means to see ourselves as reincarnating beings versus one-time beings.

The second is *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, which philosophically examines non-ordinary states of consciousness, particularly psychedelic states, while integrating research on near-death experiences and out-of-body experiences. It delves into whether these experiences cohere or fragment, while also addressing how individual experiences shape our collective psyche.

The third book is *The Living Classroom*, which discusses the subtler layers of consciousness that surface in educational settings, analyzing how my personal spiritual practices, though kept out of the classroom, began to influence my students.

All these books are available on Amazon and other book sites. Now I’m returning to the topic of psychedelics, trying to offer philosophical insights based on my twenty-year psychedelic journey from 1979 to 1999.

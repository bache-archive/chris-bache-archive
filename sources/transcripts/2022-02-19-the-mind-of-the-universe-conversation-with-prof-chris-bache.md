Rachel Fleming: 
Lovely to see you wherever you are in the world. It's a beautiful evening here in Devon, England, so thank you so much for joining us tonight. You could be out in the sunshine, but it's lovely to see you. And welcome to anyone watching the recording—I think there will be quite a few of those.

We are talking about contemporary animism tonight, part of our Contemporary Animism program. We’re really delighted to share an interview we did some time ago with a chap called Chris Bache. Colin is going to introduce him in more depth, but just to say that he took part in our Contemporary Animism Confluence back in February. What he had to say felt so hopeful at a moment when we—as a species, as a community of species—are facing a fairly dark night of the soul with all the climate change news and social crises. Chris’s vision is one of hope, and we really hope you’ll enjoy it.

What we’re going to do tonight is play you the interview. It’s quite heady—there’s a lot of talking—and it goes for about 15 minutes. We’d love you to watch it, go in and out of it as you like, and then stay with us for 10–15 minutes afterwards, if you’re interested, to share your feelings—what came up as you watched it. Whether you like it, whether you’re as excited as we are, or whether it’s not for you. So, without further ado, Colin, can I ask you to introduce Chris? Also, just to give you the logistics of Chris: he is a professor of theology, retired from one of the American universities, and he’s the author of several wonderful books. The first is about reincarnation, the second is called Dark Night, Early Dawn, and his most recent one—the one he’ll be talking about tonight—describes his research method, which he’ll tell you more about, called LSD in the Mind of the Universe. Colin, over to you.

Colin Campbell: 
Thanks, Rachel. Good evening, everyone. It was about a year ago, relatively recently, that I stumbled upon the title Dark Night, Early Dawn, and I was particularly struck by the subtitle, Steps Towards a New Ecology of Mind. That rang massively for me, and I simply had to get hold of the book and read it. This is a huge passion of mine, in the sense that what we are in search of in these times—and amid the conundrums and transformations we’re up against, in crisis and other terms as a human collective—is a redo of what we conceive of as our relationship with existence, with life, with the rest of the natural world. So the idea of a new ecology of mind really appealed to me.

I wasn’t disappointed. I think it’s a seminal piece, to be honest. He’s saying profound things that are close to my heart—finding experiential ways to reinvigorate much of what we lost during secularization, industrialization, globalization; finding ways of re-entering, re-accessing that, and revivifying it, bringing it back into our being as part of the search for what being human means now and going forward. Of course, the primary way of exploring into it is to delve deeply into what it means to be human. Part of the problem we sit with is that we’re so drastically distracted in the world we’ve created—primarily the industrialized world—that our inner environment, and what I would call our pre-industrial ancestry, which is dynamically within us, has fallen beneath the level of our everyday awareness.

As we question how we move forward as a species, how we renegotiate our relationship with the rest of the natural world, how we engage some of the dramatic crises we face, we need ways of bringing back that part of us that’s been sequestered off—the pre-industrial aspect—too often labeled regressive or primitive, trivialized and depreciated. When I came across Chris’s work—and I’d read Stan Grof before, out of which a lot of Chris’s work comes—I felt this is an incredibly important, radical way of delving in. I deeply believe our engagement with where we are as a humanity requires radical, potent engagements. We can’t afford to dabble at the edges. If we’re going to look at contemporized forms of our pre-industrial ancestry, at experiential exploration and deep delving into who we are and our broken relationships with the natural world, there has to be radicalness, because it’s urgent.

With Grof’s work, and with Chris’s writing and experimentation—his deep and profound courage, in my opinion, in the way he’s gone in—I think you’re going to see tonight the tip of a profound iceberg. It’s well worth reading his work. It’s well worth looking at Grof’s work as well. In my opinion, this is a critical part of the kind of exploration most needed at this time. Pardon my bias, but I really do believe this. With that said, I’ll pass back to Rachel, and I’ll be very interested to hear your reflections at the end. Thank you.

Rachel Fleming: 
Thank you, Colin. We’ll dive straight in. We’ve just started, and I’ve asked him to tell us about his research method—how he came to the vision he’ll share later in the interview—and how that fits into the animist world we’re exploring. It starts mid-sentence and you only miss two or three words. Enjoy. I find him very mind-blowing—but see what you think.

Chris Bache: 
…shared in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—infused with mind and soul. And, of course, now we know how vast the physical universe is, and the question becomes: how large is the mind of the universe? How deep is it?

I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.

So in 1979, I began what became a 20-year journey working with LSD. That’s what Stan had done his research with, and that’s what I chose to continue with. If I were doing it today, I’d have a more diversified cocktail of ayahuasca, civil side, and more. But I worked with LSD, and I chose to work with very high doses for reasons too complicated to go into now. That had a profound impact on the work because it not only changed how deep the work went, it changed how wide it went. The field of consciousness expanded with the power of the state I was entering.

I did this work in standard Grofian protocol: totally isolated from the world, with a sitter—a trained clinical psychologist. I did it at home, in a controlled environment, totally internally focused, with no contact with the outside world. I amplified the states of awareness with carefully selected music designed to empower the states of consciousness. In essence, you shatter your mind; your mind dissolves into subtler and subtler forms or aspects of reality. It became a systematic exploration of what I think of as the mind of the universe. I hesitate to call it the divine, though sometimes I do; the divine has so many culturally infused qualities and history that I’d rather avoid. So: the mind of the universe.

I did this work for 20 years, keeping very careful records, and then I digested those experiences for another 20 years. These are not immediately transparent experiences. They’re very complex and interwoven, involving many levels of reality being orchestrated in tidal surges of these states. There was systematic instruction. One session more or less started where the other stopped. Working systematically, there was progressive deepening and deepening. It took years to understand what the universe was showing me and where it was taking me. I had a sense of a systematic encounter with an intelligence orchestrating my experience in dialogue with me—not taking any form, never any deity or archetypal form, but always, when pressed, dissolving into deeper and deeper layers of infinity. That, cumulatively, is the story I’m telling in LSD in the Mind of the Universe.

Rachel Fleming: 
Would you say this is an objective reality—that if anyone used a similar method they’d reach the unfolding you did? I think what you did was incredibly brave, but is it possible to say?

Chris Bache: 
I think it is, and Stan Grof’s work allows us to say it. He integrates the experiences of thousands of people; I’m only integrating mine, but my experiences fit comfortably within the larger matrix Grof has explored.

It’s a complicated answer because I want to say yes, and then immediately qualify it. These substances only amplify consciousness. They don’t give you an experience or take you to a particular place. They amplify your mind. Because each of us has a different life story, the mind that’s amplified is different. When an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe, what comes forward will, in the beginning, be somewhat unique and reflect our individual history. That’s why these substances are very helpful for healing: they evoke our unconscious, and therefore they evoke our problems—an individual experience.

But if you keep going—press to the limits of your time–space identity, press to the limits of what your individual history can hold and undergo ego death—then you begin to open into spiritual reality farther removed from your personal history. That’s when experiences begin to overlap and converge.

My understanding is that spiritual reality is not something you enter and pluck fruit from, like an apple from a tree. It’s interactive. There’s a participatory quality. The mind we bring acts as a seed catalyst that crystallizes a certain set of experiences from the infinite potential of the mind of the universe. As we internalize those experiences and are purified by them, the seed mind changes, and then it catalyzes an even deeper level of secrets from the universe. So it’s a both/and situation—participatory. Once you understand the cycle of participation, the universe we discover is coherent and consistent. My universe is the same universe discovered by contemplative monks, the mystical traditions, the near-death traditions. There are degrees of depth, and we have to be careful: you can reach a point and think, “Oh, this is what reality is,” and it turns out, “This is what reality is at this level,” but you can pop that and go into a deeper level, and things change a bit.

Rachel Fleming: 
One thing I find exciting about your work is that we talk about practices—finding the right practices to find the cracks in ourselves and get back to a more porous, expanded way of being. These practices take repetition and tenaciousness. You’ve used a different method—what one might think of as a fast track to some of these experiences. It’s difficult and not one you’d recommend to many, I’m sure, but that’s where the excitement is for me: you fast-tracked a lot of slower practices and possibly reached the edge of the map many contemplatives get to. I feel you’ve gone further than much I’ve seen on the underlying nature of reality. Would you say that’s true?

Chris Bache: 
It is a fast track—except it doesn’t allow any bypassing. It’s a much more intensely concentrated path. Purification that, in a conventional spiritual path, would be drawn out over years can take place within days. And, as any woman who’s given birth knows, a short labor is not necessarily an easier labor—just much more intense.

That’s true here. The purifications one goes through to acclimate to subtler, cleaner, clearer states of reality are extremely intense. They can send you in convulsions across the floor, with vomiting coming and going. They require a systematic purification of lifestyle, as any traditional spiritual practice does. I want to emphasize that the states I touched for hours at a time we usually only learn about from contemplative mystics who have a sense of abiding in these realities. This, by contrast, is a practice of temporary access—temporary immersion in these states. I don’t want to confuse temporary immersion with abiding immersion. All honor to the great ones who abide; this is different. You don’t come away with permanent access embedded in your nature. You come away with seeds of transcendence, or seed experiences, which you then have to nurture within your daily spiritual practice and embodied existence.

I also want to mention that earlier in history these practices tended to be associated with dissociative spirituality—the goal being to get up into transcendence and away from Earth: the up-and-out cosmologies of the Axial Age religions of the last 5,000 years. The cosmology that emerged in my work is very different. It wasn’t about transcendence for its own sake; it was transcendence in service of incarnation, in service of deeper integration. It was about opening up and letting in as much of the universe as possible, then undergoing the transformations that allow this energy to live in the historical body. At one point I was given insights into where evolutionary intelligence was taking the human family as a whole. I began thinking in terms of a personal model of transformation, but things happened that shattered that model. I came to understand I’d been drawn into a collective transformation, and that my so-called individual work was part of a collective process—which naturally yielded insights into our human family’s evolutionary trajectory.

Rachel Fleming: 
Fantastic—and I want to ask you about that in depth in a minute, because for me that’s the exciting thing you discovered. But first, the aliveness and intelligence in the universe. We’re talking about the aliveness and intelligence in everything around us—an animate world and an animate universe. Could you summarize your understanding of that aliveness—how layered it is, how deep it goes, how big it is?

Chris Bache: 
You’re asking a lot, because the universe is vast, and the mind of the universe has many layers, all complexly interwoven. It’s all alive. It’s all intelligent. Everywhere we dig into the universe, we discover aliveness and intelligence. We can’t dig anywhere and not encounter this living intelligence.

When you dig into the mind of the universe, you find layers of intelligence operating there; layers operating in the biosphere; layers operating in the incarnational rhythms of a planet. I began to experience, at one point, reincarnation. I had gone into states of consciousness in which time was radically dilated—not eternity or timelessness, but radical dilations of time—and dilations of personal boundaries, dissolving into my human family, becoming the human family. From that perspective, I experienced reincarnation—the pulse of reincarnation—taking place with all of us together as a single organism, incarnating generation by generation. I experienced whole lifetimes: incarnating in generations, living lives, dying, and returning into spiritual reality. There was an intelligence to this entire process: what I had previously thought of as individual karma and transformation was part of a vast network of exquisitely tuned collective karma. History expressed the rhythms of collective transformation through the medium of our individual transformation.

Going deeper, I began to experience the pulse of the entire universe as a single living organism. When you dissolve into that level of oneness—Buddhists have words for it: Nirvana, being blown out; Shunyata, emptiness of self—you experience that there are no permanent boundaries between yourself and the world. There is no private self. The self pops; life runs through you; you run through life. The whole of life breathes as one; it breathes together, as Plotinus said.

Everywhere you touch it, the world is intelligent. At the very end of my journey, in the 70th session out of 73, I was taken deep into what I call deep time—farther into time than I’d ever been—and given a series of visions. One had to do with experiencing, from my perspective and history, the large story of what was happening in the universe. I experienced the same deep pattern of reincarnation and saw stars of light shooting out of time and space into the universe. I understood these as what I call diamond souls—the fruition of a reincarnation process creating a diamond-pure soul that could explore the spiritual world in dimensions previously unavailable to it. Time and space were creating diamond souls over vast periods—layers and layers of intelligence operating at different levels.

Rachel Fleming: 
When I read your book, it’s literally mind-blowing. It feels like science fiction, and yet nothing in there didn’t sound right. It has that feeling of, “Ah yes, I understand this—it feels right.” I’d love to talk about the evolutionary process—you touched on it there—but first, reincarnation. Not everyone feels it’s true, but you did earlier work on the subject. Before we go on to the evolutionary story you’ve seen, could you talk a little about reincarnation and your work on it, and why you believe that’s what’s happening?

Chris Bache: 
I wrote my first book on reincarnation because I thought it was such an essential principle. Our philosophical roads divide if you think we’re on Earth only once versus multiple times—those lead to different visions of reality. Today I think we have overwhelming empirical evidence that reincarnation is simply true—it’s a fact of life. Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia, in his study of young children around the world who have spontaneous memories of their most immediate life, documented hundreds and hundreds of these children. His research has been challenged, but it holds up. I think he is the Charles Darwin of reincarnation studies. Then we have past-life therapies—highly qualified people using access to past-life memories to heal present-life traumas. This, to me, is an empirical fact of life.

It takes a long time to live in a reincarnation universe and understand the implications of this pulse of life—that all of us have been here multiple times and have deeper histories with place, with people, with projects; that we’re always starting something, continuing something in one lifetime, and doing something that will be continued in another lifetime. There’s overlapping complexity. I don’t see little children as little anymore; I don’t see old people as old anymore. Sometimes little children are deeply old in soul, and old people are sometimes very young in soul. You tune to a different level.

In the early stages of my psychedelic work, I was taken into some of the nuts and bolts of reincarnation and karma, and that became ground one as I was taken into experiencing the human family evolving and growing through reincarnation. To me, reincarnation is simply the higher octave of evolution. It’s the cutting edge of evolution in our species. Where evolution tries to change whole species, reincarnation evolves individuals within certain species—not just human. Somewhere lower down the line, reincarnation begins to turn incipient.

Then the question becomes: where is reincarnation taking us? If we’re reincarnating so many times, what’s the whole project? What’s the purpose? Determining the purpose of a reincarnating species is complicated because every human being on the planet is reincarnating with a purpose—its specific purpose. You realize the full breadth of what humanity is learning is enormous. When we try to say “this is the purpose of life,” we tend to take a purpose we identify with and overgeneralize it. We have to look at the whole human family and digest the whole of what people are learning to even begin to articulate generalities that encompass them all.

So, in some cases, we can be learning love; generosity; strength of self; physical defense; surrendering physical defense. What one person is growing into in one lifetime another person may be growing out of—and both are living their truth.

Colin Campbell: 
At a process level.

Chris Bache
Most Eastern religions basically say, yes, you grow: you activate the chakras, you bring higher and higher levels of consciousness online. But when your consciousness opens to divine essence—when it opens to the you that is more real than any of your individual, private incarnational selves—the divine you, the essential you—then you reach enlightenment, what the Hindus call moksha. That means you can leave; once you wake up, let’s get out of here. There are better places to be than Earth. That’s an up-and-out cosmology.

What happened in my sessions was different. About halfway through my journey, all of my former lives began to come into me. I was in a kind of pregnant reality of deep time, and my former lives kept arriving, wrapping around me like a filament of kite string around a spool—but that string was human experience, whole human lifetimes. They reached a critical mass, and then they fused into one. When that happened there was a tremendous explosion of energy. A diamond luminosity exploded from my chest. That’s when I began to understand—and was shown—that we make progress incrementally, lifetime by lifetime, as we incarnate. But the goal is not simply incremental progress. Eventually all of our lives fuse into one, and we become, on Earth, a being who has hundreds of thousands of years of history awakened and empowered within it. That is the being we are becoming. It’s a different kind of being than an egoic being. The depth of its heart is bigger; the breadth of its mind is bigger; the texture of its social relationships is bigger; and its relationship to nature is different because it knows the world we leave is the world we inherit. It carries a deeper, embodied intimacy with nature.

My discovery was that this is not simply an individual path. This is not only a story of private awakenings. We are all going through this transition. We are giving birth to the diamond soul. The entire species has reached a point where it can no longer afford the luxury of trying to live on this planet in a fragmented, egoic state. When the world order is created by egos, it produces a fragmented order that serves some and not others. But when the soul wakes up—with the profound compassion of its history—it lives differently on this planet than the ego does.

I think we are entering a profound, tumultuous period of history—a birth process. It will feel like a death process—and it is a death process. It’s destroying the culture built by the ego, and the ego that built that culture, and in dying to that which is small, it gives birth to something new: literally a new stage in the human story. Not just a new body politic and new economics, but a shift taking place at the depths of the collective unconscious. The plate tectonics of the collective psyche are moving, in that Jungian sense, deep inside. This transformation is unfolding so that all human beings born after this transition will live their individual lives within the matrix of a different collective psyche. That, I think, is the work of the hour—actualizing this shift and reawakening to Divine Presence, which we’ve tried to strip out of nature—unsuccessfully. We’re reawakening to our common ground with nature, to the intelligence that surrounds and saturates us.

Rachel Fleming
I’m imagining people hearing this for the first time—it’s difficult to get your head around. To summarize in my terms, you’re talking about the evolution of the human species, individually and collectively, toward a condition where we can remember our entire history—if we take reincarnation as a given, we’re evolving toward remembering our past incarnations here on Earth. To reanimate ourselves, do we need a completely new cognitive framework, because the way of connecting to the intelligence of the universe is now so foreign to us? What’s your feeling on that?

Chris Bache
It’s a good question. If we eliminate the arrow of time, then reincarnation begins to look like multi-incarnation, not reincarnation. Some people conceptualize that we’re living all our lives simultaneously and interacting across them in ways that befuddle the logic of linear development. It requires a different logic. I’ve tried to think in that world multiple times, and I keep coming down to: I can’t do it. I can’t make multi-incarnation make sense as a lived reality.

Another thread: Robert Monroe, from the Monroe Institute—the out-of-body guy—wrote three wonderful books exploring the universe in the out-of-body state. He says you reach a point in spiritual development where you discover you can incarnate in any time period you wish. Soul-forward does not mean time-forward. You can incarnate in the 10th century BC and next in the 20th century AD. So there’s permeability of time. That continues the concept of development but flexes time’s absolute linearity.

I’ve gone through many permutations of time—moving into deep time, experiencing my entire life, birth to death, as simultaneously present. Later I was taken into periods where 100,000 years were being lived out as if in one minute. It convinced me the universe has many modalities of time built into it. In deeper dimensions, different modalities are available. That makes me receptive to loosening the concept of linear time and linear development. I try to reconcile that from the universe’s perspective there are multiple modalities—so the universe can show me the future from its time, give me the experience of knowing the future as something that has already happened and is yet to happen—and at the same time hold on to some notion of the value and challenge of something approximating linear development.

My best take is that life chops the learning into bits and pieces. We can’t learn it all in one lifetime. We can’t do it all simultaneously. It’s easier if it’s broken down. If the challenge of linear development is coming to fruition in a diamond soul—an awareness that holds all of its time-moments in present consciousness on Earth—of course that’s not the end of the developmental story. In a million years we’ll be farther; in a billion, farther still. The universe is just getting warmed up. We have no reason to think it’s anywhere near the end of its evolutionary story.

I think of time as one of the great gifts of evolution; individuality as one of the great gifts of the physical universe. Time is a gift of the physical universe. Behind that lie metaphysical permutations more fluid with respect to time. But inside spacetime, there is an approximate linear arrow that serves the soul’s purpose and some deeper cosmic web. And yet, within linear development, when we open to the universe’s sense of time, we often get flashes of more than the present—parallel dimensions of time. So your question makes a lot of sense; it’s substantive.

Rachel Fleming
When we get to what you call the diamond soul—when there’s this moment of remembering—what else comes with it beyond remembering and wholeness? What are its other attributes?

Chris Bache
First, I think full consciousness is what we return to when we die. While we’re in the Earth bardo, when we die we return to whole consciousness. It’s not unfamiliar; it’s something we know. Then we precipitate out of whole consciousness into part consciousness—egoic consciousness—and return. It’s a constant accordion effect: we die and get large; we’re born and get small; we die and get large; we’re born and get small. Sooner or later—if we just keep at it for thousands or millions of years—large wakes up inside physical consciousness. This is simply a consolidation of what is already taking place. It’s a stage in the process.

The times I’ve been carried into deep time and temporarily experienced my diamond soul—the soul emerging as an archetypal imprint, an archetypal form—it’s hard to describe because of the enormity, beauty, and joy. We’re talking about a human being completely healed of the wounds of history—healed of the terrible things we’ve done to each other, men and women, wars and violence—healed of those scars. There’s a tremendous breadth of communion with the natural world, an intimacy with all life forms; a breadth of companionship with human and nonhuman communities. There’s an openness of mind able to enter more directly into deeper communion with the intelligence of the universe. The genius of the universe has answers to all the technological and other questions we hunger to solve; we’re just not yet able to download all that knowledge. The diamond soul is a more complete, higher-potency human being that can enter into deeper downloads from divine intelligence.

It’s not only expansion of heart and mind—our physical senses are amplified by orders of magnitude. In my very last session—after 73 sessions—the universe gave me what I call diamond vision. In a late-session clear space, my vision became thousands of times more acute and sharp than ever before. I could see details, gradients of color, precision of form. I was amazed that I had accepted this fuzzy stuff as real seeing. This was diamond-clarity seeing. After 10 minutes it went away, and I returned to ordinary sight. I realized I was being shown that sensation is not merely biomechanical; it’s conscious. The more consciousness present in the body, the more the body’s built-in capacity for higher levels of sensitive experience—touch, hearing, seeing, all sensations—can express itself.

It truly is heaven on Earth in the body, so the body participates in the qualities of heaven without leaving physical existence. It’s not an up-and-out cosmology; it’s bringing it in deeper and deeper, literally changing physiology to allow an ecstatic state to become the normal state. That child is worth the labor we’re in. And the labor is terribly severe. Our past is being stripped away. We will lose capacities we associate with “normal” existence. In all mystical and psychedelic traditions, the small must be broken down—stripped and dismembered—for the new to awaken. This is happening now historically. We’re entering the dark night of our collective soul. In John of the Cross, the Dark Night of the Soul is not just a hard time; it’s an intense purification that immediately precedes full illumination. The dark night of the collective soul is a time of intense purification, intense loss of reality as we’ve known it. Out of the coming pain and suffering, we’ll crack open and be broken down to our center. In this ordeal, we won’t survive as we were, but we will give birth to that in us which is more beautiful, more ecstatic, more competent, more plugged in.

I think we truly are becoming a species of buddhas, a species of christs and prophets. These are models that tried to give us early visions of what’s emerging. We couldn’t imagine ordinary human beings reaching that level of excellence. Now we begin to understand—through reincarnation, over and over—slowly we grow into that level of excellence, which is simply transparency to the essential condition in which life is experienced. The irony is we awaken to what has always been happening. It’s always been this way: the universe one; the universe filled with intelligence; we empty of separate self. Somehow we distracted ourselves from it. So we’re waking up to the paradise the universe already is. We’ve just been missing it.

Rachel Fleming
I find your experience and vision so hopeful as we move into ecological and societal crisis. We have about ten minutes—does anyone have a question for Chris?

As we enter this dark night of the soul, many of us can feel it. I feel small. I’m a mother of three kids, and I’m trying to understand how to be a mother in this moment in time and to love my children well. How do I do that?

Chris Bache
A couple of thoughts. I absolutely identify with what you’re saying. I have three children. Parenting in the age we’re entering is different from parenting in the age we’re leaving, because we’re trying to inculcate a different set of values in our children even as we internalize them ourselves.

I think that’s how nature works. Each of us is a fractal cell within a tissue of consciousness. As we actualize the future in our individual lives, we catalyze its actualization in our collective life. Not simply by example—we become seed catalysts that psychically activate the web of transformation in people we’ll never know or meet. Just as we have been nourished by the ancestors and by others making the transformation, our transformation nourishes others. This came up in my sessions many times: the states of consciousness I entered were filtering into the collective psyche.

So when we do ritual at dawn, when we embrace the sun as a representative of larger intelligence, when we adopt rituals of conservation and cultivate lifestyles of using less and doing more—when we actualize those things—we make it easier for the entire species to actualize them, until we reach a tipping point and the uncommon sense becomes common sense.

This transformation is not just going to happen to us, though I do think nature knows what it is doing. We aren’t generating it—nature is taking us through it—but we must cooperate. It won’t be handed to us; we have to create it out of the fabric of our being, where we are living.

A consoling thought from reincarnation and near-death literature: we choose the incarnations we find ourselves in. At a time when we knew more, we knew what we were getting into. We knew this century would be about the dark night of the soul. We chose to incarnate where we did and to become who we are. Each of us carries a component of the transformation humanity is trying to make. The question isn’t “What can we do?” The question is, “Do we have the courage to do what is within our reach to do?” What is within reach has already been decided by the soul. Parenting is a big part of this transition—so are art, medicine, knowledge, communication, technology. We’re working it as we go.

Rachel Fleming
Thank you, Chris. We’ve gone over time, but I’d love to keep going a little longer. Here’s a question: what I thought I heard you say is that our task is to tune in to who we really are in this lifetime and live that—and that’s the best we can do. My first impulse was to ask what ritual or task would accelerate the process, but it sounds like it’s not about that; it’s about living what we dreamt in for this lifetime. Would you agree?

That’s certainly what I heard reading your book as well.

My experience in this lifetime includes many different ways of being. I’m aware of the small self that just gets on with everyday life and isn’t doing much, and another part of me that’s doing more spiritual work. Can I relax and let that happen—will it happen—or should I be focusing more? There’s always the worry that we haven’t done enough, the anxiety that comes with the industrial setup.

Isabella, you had a question—you’ll need to unmute, I’m afraid.

Rachel Fleming: I'm thinking of what he was saying about if the individual does it, then it adds to the collective. I'm thinking of Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic resonance—Colin will be able to talk more about that. I just wonder if it's that kind of process at work: once individuals start, it becomes easier for the collective. Is that what you're saying, Christina? I may have understood.

Rachel Fleming: Thank you so much, Chris, and I'm sure we could really explore that. We have about six minutes left. Theresa has a question. Before I come to you, Therese, just in case people have to go: Chris is going to come back as part of our Contemporary Animism program, which starts again in July. We have a new intake every year, and we still have some places. Jackie, you were saying you'd love to explore this kind of subject more—that's what we’re hoping to do in this year’s program. Breathing workshops—absolutely. I’m hoping we’ll do that as part of the program as well. Breathwork, for me, is where it’s at. So, Therese, I wanted to come to you, and if anybody else has one, put up your digital hand and we’ll try to get them in.

Rachel Fleming: Do you have a response on that, Colin?

Colin Campbell: Well, I think you’re opening a kind of door-handle thing—we could spend the rest of the night on this topic.

Colin Campbell: It’s very important, and you’re raising some very interesting questions. It harkens back to my question on time and how we perceive things. We often assume, as Westerners—as humanity—that we have a certain way of perceiving time and that this is part of being human. I don’t agree. The way we perceive time, and the nature of sequential events, is characteristic of a particular moment in our history as human beings. It was not necessarily the case in earlier states, and perhaps won’t be in future states either.

What we have to struggle with is that we are immersed within this framework we call present existence—in the particular sociocultural context we’re in. When we have these conversations, we’re tasked with modulating to other views and perspectives we might have within us and within our history—circular dynamics as opposed to linear dynamics, and so on. At the same time, we’re also tasked with coming back to rest within where we are, so as not to get completely lost in the transitive process we’re attempting. I wouldn’t know how to answer the question exactly. I’m opening a can that could last forever, so let me stop there. It’s a really good question—worth pondering further. Thank you.

Rachel Fleming: Which we’re going to have to do because it’s time—or it was time a long time ago. I apologize for keeping you longer than expected. Lovely to see you. We have a small group that made it to the end.

Rachel Fleming: Don’t know what more to say, really. That was Chris Bache—check out his books. Have a look at our Contemporary Animism program if you want to do more of this kind of conversation. We also do a lot of embodied work as well; it’s not just talking. Lovely to see you tonight, everybody, and see you very soon. Bye for now. Thank you, Gabby. Thank you, Colin.

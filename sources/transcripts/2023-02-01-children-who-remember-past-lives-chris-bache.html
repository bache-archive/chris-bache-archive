<p>Chris Bache: 
I think Stevenson's evidence is really strong evidence for some type of continuity of awareness from lifetime to lifetime, especially his last two books, a two-volume work on philosophy and on reincarnation in biology, in which he studied 170 87 cases of children who not only had psychological recall from their previous lifetime, but actually bore marks on their bodies in the form of birthmarks that replicated wounds of death in the previous incarnation. Somehow it was as if consciousness had been traumatized in such a way that it not only imprinted on the subsequent mind, but also on the body of the subsequent mind. After looking at this data, I think what it tells us is we have information in our mind that predates this body.</p></body></html>

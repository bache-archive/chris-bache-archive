Chris Bache: We can't solve the problems we're facing at the level of ego. We either grow up or we go extinct. Growing up has to do with the maturation of the soul—the transition from ego identity to soul identity—because the soul lives in the world differently than the ego does. The soul has an awareness of its history and, therefore, an awareness of its extended relationships with the people around it. We have been black, white, red. We've been all the colors. We've been all the religions of the world. We've been rich, poor. When the soul matures, there’s a tremendous sense of compassion and generative freedom in that process, and that's what I think we need to meet where we're going.

Lauren Taus: Welcome to Embodied Life, the podcast. My name is Lauren Taus, and this show is a space for you to move past the traffic of the mind and into the stillness of your heart. The journey is inward, and a courageous traveler welcomes the wide range of their human experience. We are meeting pioneers, healers, and change-makers who are showing us the way with important guides and maps. Feel whatever it is that needs to be felt so that you can return home to yourself. Let's go. Let's get embodied.

Lauren Taus: Chris Bache is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an Emeritus Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the Advisory Council of Grof Legacy Training.

Lauren Taus: An award-winning teacher and international speaker, Chris’s work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states.

Lauren Taus: He has written four books, translated into eight languages—Life Cycles: A Study of Reincarnation in Light of Contemporary Consciousness Research; Dark Night, Early Dawn: A pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness; The Living Classroom: An exploration of teaching and collective fields of consciousness; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe: The story of his 20-year journey with LSD

Lauren Taus: between the years of 1979 and 1999. Chris had 73 high-dose LSD experiences. We sat down to talk about these experiences and the book that he wrote about them. I enjoyed every moment of my time with Chris, and I hope you enjoy our conversation. Take a listen.

Lauren Taus: Thank you so much for taking the time to share your extraordinary experiences and wisdom.

Chris Bache: I'm happy to share as much as I can. I'm also very much aware that your work has been focused primarily on the therapeutic applications of psychedelics, and of course my work is very different from that, so you'll have to show me how I can support your work with what I have.

Lauren Taus: Very happy to do so. I think there's a larger conversation I'm weaving together around consciousness, and for me, one of the biggest parts of the medicine is to sense into what else we're part of. Yes, and I think that's a lot where you come in, Chris. Okay—can you tell me a little bit about how you started your explorations in the psychedelic space?

Chris Bache: Well, I have to go back to 1978, when I had just started my university position at YSU. That first year, I encountered the work of Ian Stevenson, whose research on reincarnation turned my worldview upside down. And I also encountered the work of Stanislav Grof, who turned me upside down even more because he gave me a method—he showed me how to explore these deep states of consciousness. I was trained as a philosopher of religion; I'm not a clinician. What interested me about these substances was not only their capacity to heal or clarify my personal consciousness, but to explore the deeper structure of consciousness itself, and eventually the mind of the universe. To do that, a large slice of my life had to go underground. I was working at a state university, in a public environment. The age of legally sanctioned psychedelic research was over in 1970. This was ’78. So I divided my life into my public life, and then in my private life, I began this psychedelic work.

Lauren Taus: You took 73 high-dose LSD trips over the course of 20 years—and really high dose?

Chris Bache: Yeah. And I wouldn't recommend that. I wouldn't do it the same way again myself, and I strongly recommend that people don't do it that way. I would be much gentler with myself and have a more modulated approach. But that's what I did. I started with three sessions at medium doses—about 250 micrograms—and then for the remainder I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms.

Lauren Taus: What inspired you to double the dose and continue in the way that you did?

Chris Bache: First, I saw Stan’s early work and the distinction between psycholytic therapy and psychedelic therapy, so I knew that working with high doses could be safe and managed effectively. I knew the sessions would be more difficult at that intensity, but I thought if I focused on confronting my shadow, I could work with those doses as long as I could manage the intensity. In the beginning, arranging a session day in a dual-career marriage with children was hard to do, so I wanted to make the most out of every day. After working at those levels for a while, I developed an aptitude for them. I liked where they were taking me, and I continued to press on.

Lauren Taus: For the sake of listeners who might not have as much knowledge as we do, can you name the difference between psycholytic therapy and psychedelic therapy?

Chris Bache: Psycholytic therapy is low-dose LSD therapy, typically 50 to about 150 micrograms, sometimes up to 300 but mostly around 150. It's an amplification of consciousness that allows your unconscious to surface layer by layer—personal unconscious, then the perinatal level. Psychedelic therapy is high-dose therapy, originally developed for terminally ill cancer patients to blow through the levels of consciousness and trigger a near-death or interior death experience so they could have an experience of where they were going when they were dying. It was quite successful. In the early protocol it was limited to three times. I thought if you could do it three times safely, you could do it more than three times safely. What I hadn't counted on is that, when you do it like that, things start that go beyond the framework of the early psychedelic therapy.

Lauren Taus: When you started this work yourself, did you anticipate that it would go for 20 years and that you would continue at such high levels of exploration and experience?

Chris Bache: I didn't. I didn't anticipate where it would go. I worked for four years—17 sessions—then took a six-year break, and then worked for 10 years very intensely, about five sessions a year on average. I didn't have a plan or a strategy. I was following the experiences, and as long as I could manage them and they were unfolding new levels that were philosophically and personally productive, I went with it until I got toward the end. Things developed that led me to know it was time for me to stop. That's when I stopped.

Lauren Taus: What were the questions that were leading you? What were you looking to answer or experience with the psychedelic work?

Chris Bache: I was trained in Western religious thought and philosophy of religion, so I had the classic questions in the love-of-wisdom sense. I wanted to understand the structure of reality—why life is the way it is, what the working dynamics are, what's the rule book, what's the manual in this damn thing. I wanted to understand the deep structure of the universe as much as I could. I learned a lot. What I found is, if you approach these things conscientiously, in a way that encourages clear, clean contact and high retention—if you work on recording and integrating your sessions—it’s as if the universe sees that you're working hard to absorb the teachings, and it starts to pay you attention. It took me systematically through levels of consciousness and experience. I always felt the intelligence of the consciousness I was engaged in.

Lauren Taus: Can you describe those levels?

Chris Bache: It took me a while to figure it out after I finished in ’99, when I was plotting the larger trajectory—what story I would be telling. I eventually differentiated five levels of consciousness that seemed operational. The first takes place at the level of personal mind, where you go beyond your personal time-space identity, culminating in what we classically call ego death—your consciousness exploding beyond the parameters of your physical experience. The second takes place at the collective level of mind—species mind—lots of experiences in the collective unconscious. The third goes deeper into the archetypal mind, beyond the species mind into archetypal reality. The fourth is the One Mind—causal reality—where the fundamental theme is oneness. There are many degrees and permutations of oneness, but that’s the core domain. In the last five years of my work, I entered what I came to call the Diamond Luminosity— the clear light of absolute reality, as it's called in Buddhism, Dharmakaya.

Lauren Taus: How is this not therapeutic? All of these journeys and dimensions are so important. I imagine there must be tremendous relief and ease when you can access them.

Chris Bache: Sure, it's very healing. You might think of it as healing at the soul level rather than the personal level. There were personal healings, like everyone, in early childhood relationships. But overall, I didn't walk into this life with a whole lot of trauma, so there wasn't a lot of deeply buried trauma in my psyche. At a deeper level, it was very healing at the level of the soul. When one begins to have what we often call mystical experiences—experiences of oneness—when you're taken by the universe and shown how life works, how reincarnation works, the larger trajectory of the reincarnation dynamic, deeper into the evolutionary dynamics that underpin our existence billions of years back and billions forward—those are questions I had been holding for many lifetimes. In that respect, it was very healing at a soul level. And very satisfying, because it gave me enough of a sense of what's going on that it allowed me to relax and quieted that existential hunger we all have to understand the game of life better.

Lauren Taus: I know that you had these experiences with your wife as your sitter, and that you would do these journeys on Saturday mornings, usually, with music. Did you ever have one of these high-dose experiences with different conditions or without a sitter?

Chris Bache: I have done sessions without a sitter, but never when I was doing the high-dose work. I've done sessions after that particular phase ended—lower-dose sessions or with gentler substances—but when I was doing the high-dose series, I always had a sitter. I was always protected from the world, working in isolation and buffered, taken care of. There was always music involved. I only had contact with my sitter during a session largely through the music, not a lot of conversation. At doses this high, your verbal functions are pretty much knocked out. You're not necessarily in strong contact with the room. It was a very controlled environment. I called it the kiva—you climb into the kiva, pull up the ladder, and you're there for the duration.

Lauren Taus: Were you able to control or direct the sessions in any way?

Chris Bache: Not really. At low doses, you maybe can hold onto an idea of something you want to work on. At doses this high, the most effective thing you can do is surrender completely to the process, not knowing where it's going to take you but trusting that the intelligence behind it is larger than yours. There were times when I begged, “Please take me this way,” but it would take me that way. I surrendered and let it go.

Lauren Taus: Did your wife ever participate? What was that like for her—and for your marriage?

Chris Bache: No, she never participated. She supported me, but she wasn't fond of the sessions. They were not natural to her mode of spirituality. Carol had an early orientation toward meditative and contemplative practice. She is a serious Vajrayana practitioner. After our separation in 2000, she completed her three-year, three-month retreat in the classic Vajrayana tradition. She was never attracted to psychedelics—the work was too violent, too intense—and she had other criticisms of it. It wasn't her cup of tea. We accommodated that difference. I followed her into the Vajrayana community and benefited greatly from learning the practices she was learning in various retreats and settings, but she wasn't attracted to the psychedelic work. We navigated that difference comfortably enough.

Lauren Taus: You mentioned the violence of psychedelics. Often we speak about dying—death and rebirth. How has that process impacted you? What was that like for you during these experiences?

Chris Bache: Violence may not be quite the right word. It shows up in the early stages when you're going through powerful kriyas and this tremendous physical and emotional detoxification, which can leave you in convulsions, bouncing around the mattress, as your body throws off vast quantities of physical and emotional stress. There is a certain violence in dying. Over the course of the work, I learned that the deepest breakthroughs followed the deepest purifications, and the deepest deaths yielded the deepest ecstatic joys on the other side. As that became clear, death became my closest ally. Rather than trying to avoid harsh confrontations, I did everything I could to facilitate their emergence. I went right at it—not because I like suffering, but because I like what was on the other side. I came to understand that even death in a psychedelic context is a form of purification: letting go of reality as you know it at one level to gain access to reality at a deeper level. So it became part of the work.

Lauren Taus: I certainly relate to that. Any psychedelic experiences that confronted me with my own mortality and dying have been generative, life-affirming, and liberating, and yet it’s one of the scarier things for most people.

Chris Bache: I understand that, and maybe I pushed it a little harder than most. That makes some people in the therapeutic community uncomfortable. But once you learn that deep purification—the deep confrontation with limits at any level—leads to ecstatic deliverance from those limits at another level, then it's the most natural thing in the world. It's quite natural for us to die. Nobody survives the game of life. We live in a culture that's uncomfortable engaging content around death because we don't understand what death is. We're chronically constricted within time-space realities. We don't understand what happens when we die or the liberation death involves. It's not just psychedelics that show us this. Near-death research shows us this; hypnotic regression past-life therapy shows us this; Michael Newton’s work shows us this. Once you understand the larger circle—that life is a circle; that there is birth, a deep internalization of circumstances and challenges and learning; and then death, which is a phase of homecoming, returning to the light—what's to be afraid of? Dying is graduation. Birth is when the hard work begins. That's what you should be afraid of.

Lauren Taus: So you're not afraid of dying.

Chris Bache: No, not at all. In fact, just the opposite. I look forward to it. I've been through that death process so many times, and I've been privileged to be given experiences of where I'm going when I die, that I'm looking forward to it very much.

Lauren Taus: Not rushing there.

Chris Bache: No. My work is here as long as I can be productive and contribute to the larger project we're part of. But as you get older—I'm 70 now—it's nice to know that the one thing life cannot do is stop you from returning to paradise. It's like sliding down a sliding board into a swimming pool of pure light—joy waiting for us at the end of this life.

Lauren Taus: What's the point of all this?

Chris Bache: That's a big question. Any early answers need to be stacked up because it has so many layers. My work, before and within psychedelics, involves reincarnation. I see reincarnation as a natural fact of life. Over hundreds or thousands of lifetimes, we're constantly learning and growing. We make mistakes, learn from them, and undergo a developmental process. It's not simply the good we do or the growth in one life, but cumulatively—it's not just moving grade by grade. Sooner or later, all our former lives congeal into one integrated consciousness—the totality of our consciousness, a being hundreds of thousands of years old. We return to that consciousness when we die—ego to soul, soul to ego—over and over. Eventually, the soul manifests in its entirety on Earth. The process is about learning—activating the capacities inherent in our nature. At its core, our nature is divine: Atman is Brahman. The capacities we’re activating are the same capacities that created the physical universe, that create galaxies. We're learning how to activate and use them to create heaven on Earth eventually. There are intermediate stages—learning love and service, surrendering violence, learning compassion—but at a deeper level, we're learning how to be gods. I mean that modestly but literally: learning how to create, to manifest the deepest capacity of our being to create our reality in the very demanding circumstances of time and space. Time and space is a demanding environment—more demanding than spiritual reality—but very useful in that respect.

Lauren Taus: I work as an academy and assisted psychotherapist, and I had a session recently where a client said, “Time is just an adjective. It's not really a thing,” and had this whole journey around the infinite. What’s it like—can you speak to the experience of transcending time and space?

Chris Bache: There’s a tremendous sense of freedom. Your entire physical life falls away. I've had experiences where all the leftover desires or unfulfilled ambitions from my historical existence just fall away in the face of the most elementary conditions of being conscious at these deeper levels. There's a tremendous sense of homecoming—deeper and deeper levels of remembering—and you ask yourself, How could I possibly have forgotten this for so many billions of years? There’s an extraordinary peace—the peace that surpasses understanding. At a deeper level, when you dissolve into the radiant light—my cosmology understands that all physical existence ultimately emerges out of light, and the light emerges out of the primal void—when you dissolve into light, to actually be light, so your being has the quality, infinite extension, simultaneity, and clarity of light—that’s the experience.

Lauren Taus: Right now my mind is very much holding onto the world we live in. I'm looking at a very binary world—man, woman; black, white; good, bad. You've spoken about shifting from personal transformation into collective transformation, about experiencing profound pain that wasn’t yours but was systemic and ancient. Given the environment we find ourselves in now, how do you relate to this historic suffering and systems of oppression within the context of light and oneness—outside time and space?

Chris Bache: It’s a very large question. Reincarnation is not simply a personal thing. It's not simply a personal soul evolving. It's also collective. Every hundred years, entire generations—our species is constantly reincarnating. All our individual incarnations are part of the single intelligence of our species incarnating. The human species is reincarnating and growing in a dynamic way, and a lot of it involves actualizing and then transcending lesser forms of our capacity—our lower self—our animal self, if you want to put it that way; I wouldn't, but…

Chris Bache: 
I think humanity, like individuals, is growing deeper, better, sweeter, stronger, more courageous. But we find ourselves at a pivot point. When I began this work, I thought, Oh, this is about personal healing, personal enlightenment, personal spiritual realization. After a couple of years, most of my work was not focused on the personal at all. I was drawn into some collective project that I didn’t understand at the beginning and only began to understand slowly. A lot of the pain I was engaging, as you mentioned, seemed to be collective pain. My sessions were being used by a larger intelligence to clear collective trauma—the trauma of history stored within the collective unconscious.

There has always been a strong collective theme in my work. Starting in the 23rd session and continuing, intermittently but consistently, through the 70th, a recurring theme was the evolution and transformation of humanity. I was given a recurring series of teachings that humanity is coming to a turning point, a major breakthrough, a great awakening—a profound spiritual transformation, a before-and-after point in history that’s going to change everything. I eventually came to understand this as a change in the fundamental architecture of the collective psyche. When the core blueprint of the human psyche changes, all individual incarnations subsequent to that point in history will actualize their lives in the context of a shifted archetypal blueprint.

Just as individuals moving toward mystical union go through a dark night of the soul—a purification where they let go of everything keeping them small in order to open to that which is large—humanity seems to be going through the same process. We’re having to let go of everything that’s small to give birth to this new human. What has kept us small? Our hatreds, divisions, and self-preferential treatment—by race, religion, class, country. All the ways we’ve partitioned the planet into socially constructed but ultimately unreal divisions. It’s like the sins of our fathers and mothers are coming up on us now. We’re vomiting up the racism, the gender abuse, all these terrible things we’ve done to each other in order to permanently remove them from our system and confront our past.

We’re doing this not simply to heal that past. We’re laying the energetic foundation for a different communion with the divine—a deeper, more porous communion, one that will reconnect us with each other and with the universe, allowing a more intimate rapport to develop, a rapport that has immediate consequences.

Since all the intelligence, all the answers we could ever want, already exist inside the divine mind—divine reality—I use “divine” not in a theistic, culturally narrow sense, but in a post-religious, broader horizon, on the scale science has shown us: a universe billions of years old, a creative project billions of years in the making, a framework that dwarfs all the religions of history. This process is taking us into a new and unprecedented opportunity. And so this is a hard time—the time of birth. Gestation is long; labor is fast. We have been gestating the future human for thousands of years through our evolutionary reincarnation dynamic. But the time of giving birth to this new human is now. It’s short, intense, hard, painful—and magnificent. The project is coming into fruition. It’s hard to let go of our habits of the past, but it’s a time of grace.

We’re in a tumultuous time, pulled fiercely by forces trying to drag us back—to the old ways, to the divisions of history, patriarchy, my religion is better than your religion, my race better than your race. And there are forces pulling us into a future of more intimate equality, more intimate communion with each other, and a transformed relationship to the Earth itself. It’s all on the line. This world was built by ego—by a species at a certain stage of psycho-spiritual maturity: self-conscious but not yet grasping our profound interconnectivity, our participation in each other’s lives and in the life of the planet. I don’t think we can solve the problems we’re facing at the level of ego. We either grow up or go extinct.

Growing up looks like the maturation of the soul—the transition from ego identity to soul identity. The soul lives in the world differently. It has an awareness of its history and extended relationships. We have been black, white, red; we’ve been all the colors and all the religions; we’ve been rich and poor. When the soul matures, a tremendous compassion and generative freedom arise. That’s what we need in order to solve where we’re going.

Lauren Taus: 
I gotta take that in for a second. Well said, Chris. So much of what you’re sharing really echoes in the chambers of my soul. When I look outside, it can feel like one giant ayahuasca vomit—everything is coming forth and out—and I want it to. Bring it on so we can let it go. I’ve also likened this process to giving birth, which, if you didn’t know what was happening, you might think is someone dying—there’s blood and poop and pee and screaming and crying. It’s not pretty… and yet new life, and it’s beautiful.

Chris Bache: 
And I know you’re a yoga teacher, so I think disciplines like meditation and yoga, and operating within a therapeutic awareness, are really important because there’s a tremendous amount of poison and conditioning coming through our systems. If we don’t have a daily practice of purification, this energy—which is collective and part of our personal story—can get stuck and lodged in the system. Never has it been more important to have regimens of purification and self-transformation as part of our daily habit.

Lauren Taus: 
Couldn’t agree more. I’ve heard you say the twin anchors for your work were courage and grounding.

Chris Bache: 
Yeah—courage to face the difficult experiences when they arise, and grounding to bring back the insights and root them in daily life. What we’re finding with psychedelics is that it’s getting easier to have extraordinary experiences; now we’re pivoting to the equally hard task of holding onto those experiences and integrating them—literally into our bodies, minds, and social relationships.

Lauren Taus: 
Do you have particular strategies you’ve found effective for integration? As a clinician working with psychedelic medicine, I have worksheets; I invite clients to journal, create art, dance—whatever’s relevant to the individual and the learning. But commonly, profound experiences aren’t met with profound life changes. How do we bridge that gap?

Chris Bache: 
All the things you mentioned are really good—use whatever talents we have to reach out, grab, and hold on: talk about them, write about them, make music, draw. Most of all, follow the teachings we’re given. In psychedelic sessions, we are given teachings and instructions. You have to put them into practice—every day.

We also have to self-modulate—pace ourselves, know when to slow down or speed up, when we’ve gotten enough and need to digest longer rather than take on more.

For me, as an intellectual by training, I spend a lot of time thinking about and trying to understand my experiences and their implications. Someone like Alex Grey, while I’m sure he intellectually absorbs his experiences, creates magnificent works of art out of them. Others plunge into social activism to bring about the social transformation that has a chance of saving this planet and taking us into this great future. Different strategies for different people, but all involve taking the time and paying attention so those insights become not just memories but part of the living tissue of our lives.

Lauren Taus: 
You’ve said these experiences give us a taste of the infinite, and integrating that into the finite body and psyche is challenging. You’ve also said it took you 10 years to digest what you experienced in the ’90s.

Chris Bache: 
When I stopped my work in ’99, I thought that, having been given so many gifts, I could simply withdraw and nourish myself by continuing to digest and assimilate them. That was true—but only half the truth. The other half was confronting the tremendous sense of loss I had from not being able to enter this deeply into communion with the universe. There was a real loss of communion because I couldn’t sustain it in my daily life. Some beings can—the great masters of meditation have always been my heroes—and they hold these experiences in an abiding way. That wasn’t the case for me. It took me about 10 years to get over my sense of loss and to recommit to being who I was, where I was, for the remainder of my life, and do as much as I could with that time.

Another thing that made it hard to come back was our society’s rules that we can’t talk about these things. I’m a teacher; I love to teach, but I couldn’t teach from this knowledge. I couldn’t share it. Writing LSD and the Mind of the Universe has been a very satisfying part of integrating my work—publicly owning my experiences and beginning to teach on the basis of them. And not just my experiences—if they weren’t supported by others in the psychedelic community, they’d amount to nothing. But I’m part of a movement, and there’s tremendous coherence in it. We’re entering into the systematic integration of psychedelics into our culture. That’s the exciting part—the teaching moment.

Having community has always been one of my most important integrative tools. I was not in San Francisco or LA where this was fair ground for conversation, and as a philosophy professor I didn’t feel safe to talk about what I was experiencing. I’m glad those conditions have shifted. That cumulative secrecy is kind of schizogenic. I divided my life into two halves, but I didn’t realize the wear and tear that division would cause. When you’re constantly checking yourself—what you can say to one person and not to another—you’re living a divided reality. Those divisions enter your psyche and produce cracks I hadn’t anticipated. Coming out of the psychedelic closet was as liberating as coming out of any closet. We know how sanity-making it is to come out of those closets.

Lauren Taus: 
What do your children think about this work?

Chris Bache: 
They understand it to varying degrees—some more than others. Some have an aptitude for it; some have intellectual reservations. Some completely understand and accept it; others understand it from the sidelines, not as participants. There’s a range.

Lauren Taus: 
One of my proudest achievements—among many interesting things over the years—was converting my father to psychedelic experience in his 70s. My dad is my prescribing MD in my clinical practice. I’ve also developed relationships with the MAPS team, and Rick, for example, talks so much about the importance of talking about these experiences and coming out of the psychedelic closet. Doing so in family constellations is really healing and important. I want to ask now, Chris: 500 to 600 micrograms—you’ve said you don’t recommend it, but what was the gift in that?

Chris Bache: 
The gift is like taking a month-long meditation retreat and cramming it into five hours. Again, I don’t recommend it, but having gone through it, I’ll describe it objectively: it’s a very accelerated explosion of your life. It’s very different from low-dose work where you soften boundaries, retain cognitive functions, and the shadow surfaces to be engaged. At very high doses—amplified with intense music and isolation—it blows your psyche completely apart, layer by layer, until eventually you dissolve into the universe.

On Saturday morning you’re in time-space; then you blow yourself apart and dissolve. You’re not functioning as “Chris Bache having an experience.” You dissolve as Chris Bache into some stratum of existence, some field of reality. You become that reality. If you do it well, you have continuity of memory in and out, but you don’t have continuity of identity. Dissolved into these fields of consciousness, you can do things my “Chris Bache” could never do and learn things he could never learn within ordinary time-space reality. You get blown into these realities, live there for a few hours, and then the second miracle happens: you come back and re-integrate your time-space identity.

I seem to have a psychological makeup that makes both rhythms—dissolving and re-congealing—easier for me. The letting go into, and the coming back to a single human being, are both important.

Lauren Taus: 
So profound. Given that you don’t recommend that, what would you advise for someone seeking to access some of these experiences?

Chris Bache: 
I’d recommend a more balanced regimen: alternate low-dose and high-dose sessions; balance LSD with more body-grounded psychedelics like psilocybin or ayahuasca. LSD is, to me, a high-altitude psychedelic—very different from psilocybin, which is more body-emotional. Be more nuanced and balanced in the rhythm.

If I had a breakthrough session, I’d balance subsequent sessions with psilocybin to help integrate and absorb the intense energies I’d dissolved into. One thing I learned is that every step into a deeper state of consciousness is a step into a higher level of energy. You have to transform your entire psychophysical system to enter and maintain cognitive coherence at that level. It’s one thing to touch them briefly in a confused way, but if you want to hold that level of awareness so the universe can meet and engage you there, you have to acclimate to that energy—go through the transformational process to stabilize at that level.

After every major breakthrough to a new level of consciousness, the next session was always very difficult and turgid. Once I broke into a new level of purity, I had to clean out all components of my being that were lower than that level so I could return to it with clear, sustained focus. It’s an energetic process as well as a cognitive one.

Lauren Taus: 
For sure. From a psychospiritual perspective, you’re working with the body’s energy and transpersonal, collective energy. What’s the story you’re telling with your book?

Chris Bache: 
Just what happened. Among all the psychedelics on the table today and all the experiences people are cultivating, this is one person’s experience with one psychedelic used in a very specific manner. It’s extreme in certain ways. I drilled an unusually deep borehole into the universe, but I didn’t explore a lot of the levels I moved through—I just went very deep and very far.

When I fell back thinking, How can I tell this? I know it’s a radical, challenging story to absorb and to write. In the end, I fell back on: just tell the truth. Tell them what happened. No judgments. Let them do with it what they will. Toward the end of my sessions, the universe asked me: Let them see me as you’ve seen me. That’s all. They’ll know what to do with it. I’m not trying to do anything else.

Lauren Taus: 
Did you write much of it during the course of these experiences as part of integration, or was it reflection looking back?

Chris Bache: 
Reflection looking back. All my sessions were recorded within 24 hours. I had about 400 pages of notes, which I studied, blocked, took apart, reassembled, diagrammed in different ways. It took years to piece together the storyline—and decide what to leave out and what to include. I left out a lot of the personal healings and small personal things because those weren’t the important parts for this book. Everyone has a personal story; as a philosopher, the story becomes interesting when the process takes you beyond the personal psyche into the deep waters of the psyche.

The therapist’s story—healing the personal psyche—is vitally important work; it’s just not the story I’m telling. I’m telling the story of a love affair with the universe and with the intelligence of the universe. My name for this intelligence is “my Beloved,” because engaging it activates such profound love in your being. It’s the most intimate kind of true becoming-one to a preexisting One. I wish it were not a love affair but an abiding marriage—maybe one day it will be. But these are temporary states, not permanent ones. You have to come to terms with that temporariness. It’s very much like an affair: you enter, make love in some way, then come back and try to live it as best you can inside time and space.

Lauren Taus: 
Listeners can’t see my face, but it hurts from smiling—and my heart feels like it’s exploding. I love this love, and I think it’s a healing love. As someone who works with the individual psyche, I feel you’re contributing so much to this part of the conversation. I’m incredibly grateful to share your voice, wisdom, and experience with my community. Deep, deep gratitude.

Chris Bache: 
Thank you. It’s a joy to share. My hope is that, in some way, my story will support you and others in theirs. We all have different journeys, but in the end we’re arm in arm—we’re in this together. Everything you do, everything I do, reaches out into the larger collective network every day, every minute. It’s a joy to be of use to people.

Lauren Taus:

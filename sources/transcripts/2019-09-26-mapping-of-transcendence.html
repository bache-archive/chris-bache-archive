<p>Chris Bache: 
I want to thank Swamiji for taking us into such a wonderful, spacious place. It was a little disorienting for me, because I went so deep with him that when he was finishing, I suddenly realized, oh, I have a talk to give. I also want to mention that the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic research is not a new cosmology. It’s the same cosmology that appears in the deepest and best mystical traditions around the world; we’re simply using a new set of technologies and techniques for entering these states of consciousness.</p>
<p>It’s a pleasure to be with the time waiver community again. When I was with you last year, I spoke about a book I was writing called Diamonds From Heaven. The book is finished and will be released this coming November. The publisher has given it a new title—LSD and the Mind of the Universe. It’s not my favorite; it will always be Diamonds From Heaven for me. The revolution begins with the question: What is it possible for human beings to experience? The Global Consciousness Project pushes that edge. Parapsychological research pushes it. Psychedelic research pushes it—what is it possible for human beings to experience? The foreword to this book was written by Urban Laszlo, who I’m so pleased will be with us this afternoon by television. It is Urban’s work, through his mastery of multiple scientific disciplines, to demonstrate that there is a super-implicate, super-coherent cosmic intelligence that informs time and space. It’s my experience and contention that psychedelics, when used in a disciplined and therapeutically structured environment, give us the opportunity to enter into a progressively deepening communion with this cosmic intelligence.</p>
<p>As you all know, there is a renaissance in psychedelic research taking place across the world. Most research today focuses on two projects: mapping the neurology and biochemical pathways that psychedelics activate, and healing the personal psyche—the wounds we collect in life: post-traumatic stress, depression, and other conditions. These are important first steps in reclaiming these valuable substances, but historically and cross-culturally, healing the personal unconscious is only the first stage of a much longer journey. The agents we have access to are so powerful that I believe they mark a new frontier in human experience. We can shatter the shell of the earthbound mind so consistently that it becomes hard to describe the depths of cosmic communion that follow. By taking our life to its limits and repeatedly shattering those limits, we dissolve for hours at a time into flows of life that transcend all measures. Enter these states with focus and clear intent; submit to the harsh demands of death and rebirth; surrender all you have been to become something utterly new for six or eight hours at a time—a being who can do things you could never do, a being who can know things you could never know. As we enter larger and older levels of existence, the universe receives us and tutors us. It rewards our courage with exquisite intimacies, drawing us into almost unspeakable ecstasies of discovery.</p>
<p>My own psychedelic journey began 40 years ago when I was a brand-new academic, fresh out of graduate school, and I met the work of Stanislav Grof. I read his early books—Realms of the Human Unconscious (1976), which I encountered in 1979, followed quickly by LSD Psychotherapy—where he sets out the methodology of working clinically and in a very disciplined, structured manner with psychedelics, integrating them into the therapeutic process. What I’m describing today is not “tripping.” It’s not recreational use. It’s not a careless engaging of these states of consciousness. These are amplifiers of consciousness. When we contain that amplified consciousness—take it into a meditational situation, take it into a kiva, completely isolated from the outside world—and use this energy to drive deeper and deeper into consciousness, that’s what I’m talking about. That’s what Stan Grof’s work explores.</p>
<p>First, a few words about the protocol I used, and then where this journey—told in LSD and the Mind of the Universe—went. Most of you who know Stan Grof’s work know the fundamental distinction in his methodology: low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy. Psycholytic therapy works with lower doses, perhaps 40 to 100 sessions, peeling the unconscious layer by layer, stripping down trauma, angst, pain bit by bit. At Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, they developed a different form: high-dose psychedelic therapy. The strategy was to take an overwhelming dose—about 500 micrograms—and blow through all levels of consciousness to try to trigger a near-death experience. They worked with terminally ill cancer patients, hoping to provoke a confrontation with the universe that would give a glimpse of where they were going and reduce death anxiety—and they succeeded.</p>
<p>I thought: if you could use psychedelics in this manner safely three times (their protocol limited patients to three doses), then you could do it safely more than three times. And that’s what I set out to do. Quietly and covertly—because I couldn’t do this work legally—I created a barrier between my professional life as a professor of religious studies and my personal life, where I began systematically exploring my own consciousness using Stan Grof’s protocols. It ended up being 73 high-dose sessions at 500 to 600 micrograms, spread over 20 years. I did four years of work, stopped for six years for reasons I explain in the book, then did another 10 years of very intense work. I did this between ages 30 and 50. I stopped in 1999, and it’s taken me this long to digest everything, organize it, and write it in a way I could share. What’s important is not that I experienced these things. What’s important is that these levels of consciousness are available for everyone to experience—through psychedelics or non-psychedelic means—because this is the nature of the universe itself.</p>
<p>I’m not a psychologist or therapist. I didn’t go into this seeking healing—though I received much. I’m a philosopher, trained as a philosopher, with a philosophical agenda. I trace this work back to William James in The Varieties of Religious Experience, where he talks about experiences with nitrous oxide. The essence of this philosophical modality is three steps: push the boundaries of consciousness; write a detailed, phenomenologically accurate report within 24 hours; then critically analyze your experience, comparing it to other bodies of knowledge and to the experiences of other journeyers.</p>
<p>When I got to the end of my 73 journeys and began writing, I realized this was something different from an extended course of psychedelic therapy. Entering this state so many times in a controlled fashion opens opportunities not considered in the early years of psychedelic therapy—and presents challenges not encountered then. It needed a new name. I call it psychedelic exploration. The method is psychedelic therapy—very controlled circumstances: always working with a sitter; always in a contained, private environment; eye shades; earphones; a carefully curated musical list. The difference between psychedelic therapy and psychedelic exploration is the number of sessions. For me, 73.</p>
<p>This is not a protocol I recommend. At the time, I thought I could do it safely, and I did stay within safety limits, but pushing yourself that hard, that deeply into the universe, generated complications that took all my resources to manage. If I were doing it again, I’d be gentler—balance high-dose sessions with low-dose sessions, and balance LSD, which is a high-altitude psychedelic, with psilocybin and ayahuasca, which are more body-grounded. I think a more nuanced approach would produce better results.</p>
<p>I worked as systematically as I could. I kept very detailed records—about 400 pages of my psychedelic journal. I tracked all the dates and even looked at astrological variables when I began to understand, from Stan and Rick Tarnas, their proposal that there is a correlation between the outer planets and what happens in psychedelic sessions. My protocol was highly standardized to minimize variables: the same sitter (a clinical psychologist whom I happened to be married to at the time—very handy), the same set and setting, the same location, the same substance, the same dose level, and the same recording process. The stability of those variables contributed to the clarity and stability of the communion that opened.</p>
<p>The story in Diamonds From Heaven—because to me, it’s always Diamonds From Heaven—is not primarily a personal story. Of course it’s personal because it’s my experience, but I dropped many personal details. These represent a series of psychedelic sessions that pick up a conversation and continue it session by session. I found that things relevant to my personal life tended to occur when I was leaving time and space and when I was coming back, but during the peak hours—after the first 12 or 15 sessions—I was usually operating far beyond personal reality. That’s the philosophically more interesting story: the cosmological story. This is not a therapeutic story; in a therapeutic story, personal details are very important. In a cosmological story, they’re less so.</p>
<p>In this regimen one undergoes many deaths and many rebirths. Everything below the line in the image I used is time-space reality; the drop at the end represents our individual time-space identity, our egoic identity. The first transition is the death-rebirth that takes place when we move into spiritual reality—ego death. It gets a lot of attention in the literature, but less attention is given to deeper deaths at deeper levels. Stan Grof uses the vocabulary of psychic-level transpersonal experience, subtle-level transpersonal experience, causal-level experience, because the universe reveals itself in layers. Every time one goes into a deeper level of consciousness, everything known up to that time—including what you know to be true from previous psychedelic experiences—must be surrendered if a truly new and novel dimension is going to open.</p>
<p>I asked myself: How many fundamental, core death-rebirth transitions did I go through? There are levels within levels, with iterations that go deeper and deeper. But I identified five core cycles. First, the death of self: the complete shattering of your time-space identity—ego death. Second, entering the collective mind, the collective psyche. Third, entering archetypal mind—the domain described by Jung and Plato, though different than either portray it. Fourth, entering causal oneness. Oneness appears much earlier in the journey, but causal oneness is distinctive: there is no outer boundary. It is the totality of existence; you cannot step outside it to get a perspective on it. Fifth, the domain of Diamond Luminosity, which occupied me for the last five years of my journey.</p>
<p>In the book, these stages map to chapters: crossing the boundary of birth and death; exploring collective mind—the ocean of suffering, deep time in the soul, initiation into the universe; archetypal mind—the greater real of archetypal reality; causal oneness—a benediction of blessings.</p>
<p>Diamond Luminosity is discussed in Chapter 10, the largest in the book—26 sessions, almost a third of the entire journey. Before I talk about Diamond Luminosity, I talk about the birth of the future human, a series of experiences that began during initiation into the universe and continued into the Diamond Luminosity work. At the end, in the last year, there was a final vision that became the capstone of the birth of the future human. It’s impossible to do more than touch on a few themes to give a sense of the trajectory—so first, let’s do that.</p>
<p>Crossing the boundary of birth and death is the easiest to summarize because it’s thoroughly described in Stanislav Grof’s work: the perinatal level of consciousness. Many people relive their own birth; many have profound encounters with death and dying. We get here by being born; we leave by dying. When pushing consciousness beyond the limits of the physical, birth and death get complexly intertwined. One goes through profound existential crises—confronting the meaninglessness of existence, the futility of life understood purely as a physical structure—until eventually one goes through an event usually described as ego death. In my ninth and tenth sessions—two years and ten sessions into the work—the universe snapped me like a twig. Everything I knew myself to be at the beginning of the day was completely reversed and inverted. I began as a white, male, middle-class philosopher obsessed with the meaning of life. For hours, I was immersed in the experience of women—women of color, women who were poor, women with no interest whatsoever in philosophical exploration—and that’s what I became. It frightened me, but when I let go and allowed myself to become fully a woman, everything pivoted and I was taken into the world of women. I experienced hundreds and hundreds of women, many dimensions of female experience under the arm of the Great Mother. I wish every man could have the experience I had that day. The message was not “reclaim your femininity” or “reclaim your former lives as women”—I know I’ve had former lives as women. The message was: where you are going, gender does not exist. Let go.</p>
<p>Where things went next: after ego death, I expected things to get lighter. Instead, they got much worse. I entered a domain of extraordinary suffering—collective suffering—unbelievable pain, anger, and violence. This took place over two years, deepening systematically until I had the experience of becoming, in some fundamental way, all of the human beings of our entire species, gathering experiences extending over 100,000 years.</p>
<p>At first, I thought this was a deepening of ego death—that pieces of my ego had slipped through the noose and it was still my personal death and transformation driving the process. But it went on so long, involving so many beings, that eventually I came to a different conclusion: something had shifted in my sessions, and the universe was using them to bring a kind of healing to some portion of the collective psyche. With Urban Laszlo, I agree that there is an Akashic memory that holds the record of everything that’s happened in the universe, and in the collective unconscious of our species we hold our entire history—our wars, the terrible things we’ve done to each other. Just as personal trauma burdens our lives and must be cleansed if we are to be free, our species holds these wounds, and they must be cleansed if we are going to function at a higher level. By the end, I understood that something was working not to transform me, but through me, to transform some aspect of the human species and help us move forward.</p>
<p>There are two phases of a session when working like this: a purification phase and an ecstatic phase. In the purification or suffering phase, if you allow it to take you as far as it wants—wherever it wants, even if you don’t understand what’s happening—it will eventually culminate, come to a crescendo, and you’ll go through a death-and-surrender process. Then you wake up into a completely different, unexpected reality. For the remainder of the session, you’re in an ecstatic state. When you resume the next session three or four months later, the same process repeats.</p>
<p>The ocean of suffering lasted two years. There was a year of work; then I stopped for six years; then I resumed on the other side. In that first year, when I came through the sessions, I entered what I call deep time in the soul. For seven sessions over the course of a year, I entered a state in which I experienced the totality of my life, start to finish, as a completed whole. All the details were suddenly present; I was overwhelmed by a systematic instruction on what my life was about and how it connected to the lives around me. It was the deepest, most moving experience of my life at the time. Yet, the first time I came back, I couldn’t remember it. I had no reference points in time-space consciousness to anchor states that shatter linear time. But when I went back a second, third, and fourth time, I remembered more; I could hold more. You can learn how to stay conscious in levels of consciousness where you previously could not. This is important epistemologically: deep experiences of the universe are not simply given. First, you have to reach that level of reality; then you have to be taught by the universe how to stay conscious there. It takes discipline and training, and the universe will train you to have accurate recall of levels of consciousness that were previously completely novel.</p>
<p>After the six-year break, when I began again, the ocean of consciousness began exactly where it had stopped and kept getting worse. The fact that it started exactly where it had stopped says something about the intentionality and magnitude of the intelligence guiding one’s work. I always felt in communion with an intelligence. It never took any form—no images, no deities—but I felt in dialogue with a superordinate intelligence. After the break, the ecstatic portion shifted into a completely different domain. I was given a systematic course of instruction in the structure of reality at a cosmological level. I know this sounds terribly arrogant, and I apologize, but that’s what happened.</p>
<p>I give all my sessions a name—the pith of what happens—so the name reminds me of the session, because I’m trying to hold all of my journey in mind at once. In the chapter on initiation into the universe, I discuss sessions like “The Master Plan,” a series that began and continued for years, in which I seemed to be taught what was happening to the human race and where we were going—the larger developmental trajectory of humanity. Again, I apologize for the apparent arrogance; it sounds like ego run amok. Eventually, the ocean of suffering culminated in the 24th session, which I call “Healing the Collective Wound”—an orgy of suffering that, when it climaxed, spun me into a level of reality ancient beyond reckoning: archetypal reality. The collective suffering never reappeared in any subsequent session.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Where I went next was into the greater realm of archetypal reality. I entered a reality that was more real than physical reality—like Plato’s cave, where someone escapes the cave and enters a world more real than the physical, which is disorienting at first. When I entered archetypal reality, I stayed there in my sessions for the next year and a half. I went through a death deeper than ego death: I had to cease to be a human being in any way, shape, or form. My consciousness could no longer operate within the confines of even our collective psyche. I entered a state of awareness beyond the collective psyche, and at that level I was being worked with, taught how reality functions.</p>
<p>The experiences in this chapter are divided into two levels. There was a high, subtle, Platonic level where I encountered archetypal forms—beings so vast my mind couldn’t wrap itself around them. I imaged them as galaxies, billions of light years across. These are beings responsible for creating time and space itself, and for governing the emergence of life within time and space. At a lower subtle level, I entered deep into the collective psyche and repeatedly experienced the human species as a single organism, with our individual minds as fractal aspects of its comprehensive mind, and our bodies as cells within the unified body of humanity. As we heal our minds and bodies, we contribute to the developmental history and strengthening of the mind and body of our species.</p>
<p>In archetypal reality, the deaths I went through carried enormous energy—fire, volcanoes, solar flares—excruciating experiences of being burned alive and consumed. This is important: as you go deeper into the universe, every deeper level of reality functions at a higher level of energy. This is recognized in the deep mystical traditions. A deeper level of consciousness is a higher level of energy, and if you are going to have stable experience there, you must stabilize your consciousness at that higher energy. Mountain climbers adapt to less oxygen as they ascend; likewise, in deep non-ordinary states you must accommodate greater and greater energy, learning to manage it. Otherwise, your experiences will be fragmented and incoherent, and you won’t bring back much detail.</p>
<p>I began to have experiences of reincarnation as a collective phenomenon. Previously I had written a book on reincarnation that told the individual soul story: we learn, hopefully progress, die, are reborn, and our choices lead to an improving destiny as the soul matures. But now I experienced the entire planet as a single organism growing and maturing through the pulsating rhythm of its entire population reincarnating century after century. I was shown that our individual karma is integrated into our collective karma. The boundary between individual and collective evolution came down entirely. That’s the primary theme of Dark Night, Early Dawn: it’s impossible to achieve spiritual awakening by yourself, because there is no private self to awaken. All awakening emerges from a collective context and contributes back into it. In the end, we are always working with the divine for the good of the entire species and beyond.</p>
<p>After the time spent in the greater realm of archetypal reality, I entered causal oneness—a period of tremendous blessings, a year of unbelievable blessings. There were four sessions I address in this chapter. The first was an experience of emptiness—Shunyata—complete transparency: no self in me, no self anywhere in the world around me. The entire world is a living oneness. When you experience oneness, you instantly experience no-self—the absence of an independent, separate, autonomous self. When the self goes, the world is one. Let me jump over “The Birth of the Diamond Soul—Singing the Universe Away.” That was an experience of the deep, fertile void, the primal void that is the matrix within which all form emerges. “Jesus’s Blood” was an experience of extraordinary cosmic love, being awash in love like I had never known in my life or in previous sessions.</p>
<p>Let me return to The Birth of the Diamond Soul, because it comes up later. In that session, my former lives came in fast and furious. I had done a lot of work through hypnosis and previously experienced my life 11 years earlier as a totality from beginning to end. But here, former lives were wrapping like kite string around a spool—except the lives were filaments of light—wrapping around and around until they hit a critical mass and fused. When they fused, there was an explosion of diamond-like light that broke out of my chest, and I was thrown into a state of consciousness that was still individual but at a higher level of individuality than anything I had known. I think I was being shown where reincarnation is taking us. It doesn’t just produce a little improvement each life. Eventually, all that we have lived and learned in all our lives—remembered when we die as we expand into the soul and then return to egoic awareness—eventually all of it is integrated as a singular individuality inside time and space. We wake up to the cosmic beings that we truly are. We are no longer tempted to identify strictly with our time-space body.</p>
<p>From here, the work went into the Diamond Luminosity. But before that, I need to backtrack and talk about the birth of the future human. In the “Initiation into the Universe” work, I started having visions about the evolution of humanity. This may sound ridiculous, but it isn’t from within transpersonal psychology. When you shatter individual consciousness, you don’t simply flip into oneness; you open into a multilayered universe, and one layer is the consciousness of our species. When you open to it, it’s natural to get insights into where we came from, where we are, and where we’re going. Over five years I was repeatedly given the same story—different aspects of it—which I gather in this chapter.</p>
<p>The first is the Visions of Awakening: six visions describing a profound awakening of the human psyche and heart, a Great Awakening, a shift in the fundamental architecture of the collective unconscious. A year and a half after those sessions, I was taken into deep time—beyond personal deep time—into collective deep time, into what appeared to be the death and rebirth of our species in the near future. I wasn’t given how, when, or why, except that it seemed triggered by a global systems crisis arising from a global ecological crisis. I was given the fact of this transformation and insights into mechanisms that could make this transition as quickly as we need to, because we have so little time. It has to do with understanding the collective psyche, that our collective unconscious is a field, and when this field is hyper-stimulated by suffering, it enters far-from-equilibrium, nonlinear conditions. There is a structural parallel between what can happen in a psychic field under nonlinear conditions and what happens in physical fields under similar conditions. We can extrapolate from physical fields to understand the psychic field: rapid, accelerated change, heightened creativity, and the emergence of a higher self-organization. In my sessions, it was always: this is going to happen faster than anyone can imagine. The pace of our past development is irrelevant to the pace of our future development. It hinges on what’s happening at a deep collective psychic level.</p>
<p>From there, I went into the Diamond Luminosity work: five years of progressively entering a field of consciousness completely empty, devoid of content, breathtakingly clear and luminescent. Buddhism calls this Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality, the clear light from which physical reality springs. I called it Diamond Luminosity.</p>
<p>My time is running short. I take comfort that all of this is in the book, where you can go into greater detail.</p>
<p>Out of these four sessions—I entered this reality only four times in five years—it took five years of work to spend four days in that condition, with a high cost in between: intense episodes of purification, more purification, and more. Just to touch this reality, to return to it and have stable experience, you have to purify anything in you that is less than this reality. The first two entries into Diamond Luminosity took place in sessions 45 and 50. After that, we didn’t go deeper into Diamond Luminosity itself; instead, Diamond Luminosity began to crunch itself deeper into my physical body. It was as if this light was restructuring my biology—my mind, emotions, subtle energy system, and cellular anatomy—in ways I couldn’t begin to understand, soaking itself deeper into my physical presence. I learned that the purpose of this work was not simply transcendence. The goal wasn’t a disembodied transcendent reality, however beautiful. Ultimately, the goal was to bring this reality deeper into our physical existence—to let as much spiritual reality as possible enter physical awareness and transform our lives so we become an integrated whole, balancing spiritual reality and access to the magnificent universe gestated within it with the reality of time and space.</p>
<p>At the end, in the last year of this work, I was given one final vision that was the capstone of everything before. The universe put me through the absolute worst strip-down process—cascading loss of control, dying, burrowing deeper and deeper—until it spun me into deeper time than ever before. I haven’t tried to explain deep time here, but in the book I describe entering a state where I experienced 100,000 years as a simultaneous present. I began to experience time as the pulsation of death and rebirth of whole lives—whole generations dying and being born every few seconds—a radical expansion of the time frame. I was given an experience of what Buddhists call Samsara in the raw: everything being born, dying, conserving, growing, integrating.</p>
<p>In this context, I was given three teachings. First, human beings are built for speed—built for accelerated evolution—because our lives are so short, merely 100 years. Underneath repeated reincarnation there is a gathering of knowledge and experience, and periodically this gathered knowledge flips and becomes a new foundation for subsequent incarnations. From an expanded time horizon, I could see that human beings are designed for accelerated evolution. We think of human nature too statically; we need to think more dynamically and open-endedly to see ourselves as the creative intelligence behind it all might.</p>
<p>Second, I experienced the universe as a diamond maker. Through the cycling of reincarnation, sparks of diamond light periodically shot into deep space. I understood that the universe is making diamonds—the distillation of all our experience into crystalline, pure forms that allow us to enter dimensions of spiritual reality we could never survive without this hyper-concentrated, hyper-accelerated developmental process taking place in time and space.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was given an experience of the future human—taken deep and allowed to experience, briefly, the human being nature is giving birth to in this long developmental process. Such an exquisite being. Touching it for only a few minutes was profoundly helpful, expanding my sense of human potential. It’s important to have a vision of where we’re going historically, because as shadows darken and we enter deeper into the historical crisis—the dark night of our collective soul—we could lose hope and think it’s over, that we’re being punished, that we’re entering an extinction event. But really, we are in labor. We have been gestating for hundreds of thousands of years. Gestation is long; birth is relatively short. Labor is intense and painful, but it gives birth to something wonderful and new. I think that’s what’s happening historically. After hundreds of thousands of years, we are entering labor, and the global crisis is synchronistically connected to a developmental crisis inside each of us. We carry the entire history of the world in our former lives, in our heart and soul. As the planet struggles to become one, we are working to become one coherent, integrated soul. There is a relationship between the building tension in the global order and the building tension in our psychological order as we give birth to a new species on this planet and a new center of consciousness within our own person.</p>
<p>What’s important is not that I had these experiences—and I could be wrong on many levels—but that many people are having these experiences, as Stanislav Grof has documented. These levels of consciousness are there for all of us to explore. I do not recommend that people explore them as I did. I truly don’t. I wouldn’t wish anyone to go through some of what I went through to enter these domains. Be gentler. Use a wider complement of techniques and technologies. But they are there for us to explore. There is a massive information field we can enter suddenly and temporarily, or we can sit here, open up, and let it enter us and soak into our bones. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Welcome to OM Times TV, a division of OM Times Media and Broadcasting. Each week on OM Times' flagship radio show, veteran broadcaster, author, and media consultant Sandy Sedgbeer conducts thought-provoking interviews with inspirational authors, artists, musicians, scientists, speakers, and filmmakers who are working at the intersection of spirituality and science.</p>
<p>Today, Sandy welcomes Chris Bache, a notable figure in the fields of philosophy and consciousness studies. Dr. Bache is a Professor Emeritus at Youngstown State University and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. He joins Sandy to discuss his groundbreaking book <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven</em>, which chronicles his extraordinary journey exploring the depths of consciousness over two decades.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Hi, Chris. It’s a pleasure to have you on the show.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Hi, Sandy. It’s a pleasure to be here with you today.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: This is a long-awaited interview. Your journey began in 1979, exploring your mind and the universe with LSD. If you had known then that this journey would entail 20 years of pain, bliss, and a rigorous process of digesting and writing about it, would you do it all over again?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That’s a good question. Knowing now what I know, I would have been gentler on myself. I might have balanced my high doses with lower ones or included other substances like psilocybin and ayahuasca. I would have taken the journey, but perhaps not as aggressively.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Given the outcome, it’s hard to say you wouldn’t have done it at all. You had 73 high-dose LSD sessions, following protocols established by Stanislav Grof to help clear chaos at each new level. How did you determine the precise dosage for your sessions?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Stan was clear in his works, especially <em>LSD Psychotherapy</em>. He differentiated between psychedelic low-dose therapy and high-dose therapy, which ran from 350 to 500 micrograms. High doses were utilized at Spring Grove Hospital for terminal patients to provide a glimpse of what lay beyond. I thought if three sessions were safe, more could be too. Initially, I believed it was about personal healing and transformation, but the reality proved to be much larger than my personal journey. The doses I selected aimed to push my system efficiently, as time for these sessions was constrained by my dual-career marriage.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: When did you realize your journey was about more than personal transformation?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: For the first two and a half years, it mirrored Stan Grof’s descriptions, focusing on perinatal experiences. I confronted death, underwent an ego death, and expected access to transpersonal realities to ease thereafter. Instead, I entered deeper suffering, which involved the collective trauma of humanity, not just my own. It became clear that I was healing some aspect of the collective psyche.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Your sessions weren't random; you'd go periods without sessions, but upon returning, you would pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely. I engaged in a sustained communion with a larger consciousness. There was continuity across my different work phases. After a six-year hiatus, I resumed and found myself back in the ocean of suffering where I had left off. This intelligence guided my sessions; all I had to do was trust and surrender.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Listening to your experiences, it’s hard to understand the drive to return to that pain.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Pain is hard, but you go back for the joy that awaits on the other side. The suffering is part of a purification process that I learned to trust, leading to insights and profound communion with the universe.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: So, the suffering served as a gateway?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, it’s necessary to let go of our small selves to enter into the larger existence. Ego death is just the first step; much more must be relinquished beyond personal identity.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: There’s one collection of sessions I wanted to ask about. You experienced life as different women. What was the purpose of that experience?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That session was my ego death. It broke my identity, forcing me to embody women from various backgrounds and experiences. Initially, I fought this transformation, but eventually, when I surrendered, I was initiated into the positive aspects of womanhood. The fundamental message was about letting go of gender; my male identity needed to be broken to access a larger reality.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Over two decades, you carried this journey alone, with only your wife being aware of it. As a philosophy professor, did you find it challenging not to share your experiences?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It became increasingly difficult. I often felt the urge to share insights grounded in my psychedelic experiences with students, but I couldn't. At times, I experienced physical reactions when I couldn’t be open. Ultimately, this internal division caused fractures in my psyche, only healed when I publicly acknowledged my experiences.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Modern spiritual teachings cover concepts like NDAs and reincarnation, but your experiences have taken you much further. You’ve gained insight into the Bardo. Can you share what you learned?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: My sessions affirmed the classic understanding of the Bardo. After death, we reflect on our life, integrate our experiences, and eventually choose to incarnate again. There are many layers of spiritual reality, and I tapped into collective realities analogous to various realms in Buddhist cosmology.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Why do you refer to this advanced stage of consciousness as diamond luminosity?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: This stage revealed an exquisite light unlike any I had encountered before. It's an incredibly pure clarity, which, when touched, can undo countless years of living in the shadows of karma. I only accessed this reality a few times, each triggering more purification processes.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Was this realization the driving force behind your continued exploration?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely. The last phase of my work was about returning to that profound reality.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Your experiences led you through many layers of consciousness in a condensed time frame. What impact does that have on someone?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It accelerates the natural evolutionary process of growth and understanding. Through intensive psychedelic experiences, you engage with a deeper pulse of existence, where personal transformation transcends individual progress and ties into a collective journey.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: You touched on the challenge of reintegrating after such experiences. How do you cope with that dichotomy?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It can be tough, but a deeper understanding of life’s intelligence helps. Experiencing that cosmic intelligence shifts your perspective, enabling you to see the universe as a manifestation of divine intention, which offers joy even in current struggles.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: As we wrap up, you describe the universe as the body of God. What are we then?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: We are part of that universe. Our minds and bodies manifest the divine intention of existence, connecting us inseparably to the universe.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Thank you, Chris Bache. After this enlightening conversation, it’s clear that your journey sheds light on our shared existence. </p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, Sandy. It’s been a pleasure discussing these profound topics with you.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: We'll take a short break and continue our exploration when we return shortly. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Let me break that down into two parts, starting with the classical vision of reincarnation. In most Eastern traditions, the classical vision suggests that we grow, become clearer, kinder, more generous, and cultivate deeper qualities. Eventually, we reach a point of spiritual maturity, where our consciousness opens to the core of our being. We awaken to the understanding that the essence of our nature is, in fact, the essence of all nature. All beings share the same essence, leading to an explosion of compassion and a deep embrace of the universe. The interpretation of what happens next is that we are free to leave time and space—what the Hindus call Moksha, the escape from Samsara. </p>
<p>This up-and-out cosmology is present across all religions of the Axial Age. They suggest we don't want to be on Earth; we arrived here by accident, and it’s a veil of tears. We crave to escape, whether through salvation or enlightenment. However, this perspective fundamentally leaves unexplained the purpose of the universe. Given our deeper understanding of existence and the vastness of the universe, it seems profoundly shortsighted to think that the purpose of life is merely to awaken to our true nature and then escape into nirvana or some celestial paradise.</p>
<p>At a crucial point in my work, I experienced all of my former lives coming back to me, one after the other, like wrapping a string of white light around a spool. Ultimately, all those lives fused into one consciousness, resulting in an explosion of light from my chest that catapulted me into a deeper state of consciousness than I had ever known. While I remained an individual, it was an individuality beyond any previous reference point. This became known to me as the birth of the diamond soul. </p>
<p>As we reincarnate repeatedly, sooner or later, the soul consciousness we return to when we die awakens and manifests within our time-space consciousness. We awaken within time and space as fully conscious beings, equipped with a deep intuitive awareness of the intricacies of human relationships and the ability to commune with cosmic intelligence. At that moment, we do not leave; rather, we begin to live differently on this planet. I believe the entire human species is evolving in this direction.</p>
<p>When I refer to soul consciousness, I do not mean a separate or isolated existence. I envision a fully transparent existence rooted in emptiness and the absence of a self-concept—a conscious soul that manifests within us. If we imagine a world populated by such fully conscious souls, it’s likely that this species would create a profoundly different life on this planet.</p>
<p>Later in my work, over four years, I began to receive visions about human evolution, consistently conveying the same message: we are nearing a point of profound spiritual awakening in human history. This transition would involve a collective purification, where we would release the pains of our history to lay a new foundation for a divine energy rising within us. I glimpsed a transformed humanity emerging from this purification, though I wasn’t shown how nature would manifest this.</p>
<p>In 1995, while already deeply involved in the diamond luminosity phase of my work, I found myself absorbed into the human family. I experienced a death and rebirth process impacting all of humanity, similar to the intense process an individual experiences during spiritual or psychedelic practices. History seemed to be placing the entire human family into a death-rebirth cycle, unraveling life and exposing the fragility of our ordinary assumptions. A series of crises cascaded, seemingly leading towards a global crisis, likely triggered by ecological disasters. </p>
<p>However, just when it appeared we would face a catastrophic end, the peak of turmoil passed, and we began to reclaim stability. Emerging from this, our entire existence was transformed; we were filled with new ideas, values, and capacities that reshaped social relationships and institutions. This profound breakdown connected us to the universe in a way we had never experienced, resulting in the birth of a new kind of human being. </p>
<p>I refer to this emergence as the birth of the future human, embodying what I describe as the diamond soul. This refers to a spiritually awake, mature, and soul-conscious species. Our understanding of the soul has been limited by preconceived assumptions, which is why I equate it with the diamond soul—to signify something entirely new. Great spiritual masters throughout history have given us glimpses of the being we are becoming, as they serve as prototypes of this transformation.</p>
<p>In the later stages of my journey, I was taken deep into this vision of the future human. This being was extraordinarily magnificent, endowed with a vast heart and a mind capable of tapping deep into creative intelligence. Such a being perceives the fundamental oneness of all life and would, therefore, never harm another being. This consciousness would shape a very different world from what we currently inhabit.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Do you think humanity has no need to evolve?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I see this as simply the next step in our evolutionary saga. I can't predict how long this transition will take. It could be generations, and whether it happens in 100 or several hundred years remains uncertain. However, if we fail to make this transition sooner, we risk extinction. Evolution itself is an ongoing process; it has been around for billions of years and will continue for billions more. </p>
<p>This isn’t an end point but merely the next phase: waking up to what’s really occurring and who we truly are. We need to recognize the depth of our relationships with life itself, others, and every species. We must overcome the outdated notion that places humanity at the pinnacle of evolution, viewing us as unique in kind rather than simply unique in degree.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: After 24 years since you stopped, do you feel you’ve fully integrated those experiences?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I have not. When I completed my sessions and began the digestion process, I received a clear message: 20 years in, 20 years out. I initially thought that it would take me 20 years to assimilate my journey. However, reflecting on my progress while writing "Diamonds from Heaven," I now believe it may take lifetimes to fully integrate all the gifts I've received.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: What do you think is our most urgent need to address now as a species?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: There are many layers to that. First, we must take full responsibility for our shadow side, clearing any obstacles blocking our compassion and holistic psychological functioning. We need to rekindle our relationship with the universe and recognize our core identity within it. We must transcend centuries of teaching that positions humanity as superior to all other forms of life, recognizing our interconnectedness instead.</p>
<p>Additionally, we need to embrace the divinity present not only in our minds and hearts but also in our bodies. The notion that humanity could become spiritually energized to the point where our bodily existence is perpetually rejuvenated is fascinating. </p>
<p>Now, we are like children waking up in a garden cultivated for billions of years. We are beginning to comprehend what’s truly happening. </p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Do you believe there is an urgent need to reintroduce psychedelics to help people heal and evolve?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, I believe they offer valuable insights. Fortunately, we’re in the process of reclaiming them after a long interruption. These consciousness amplifiers could assist us in healing life’s wounds and help us access insights about our essential nature and interconnectedness with other life forms.</p>
<p>Psychedelics can open spiritual dimensions within us, acting as a catalyst for profound philosophical insights. By temporarily expanding our minds and then analyzing our experiences, we can create a trustworthy foundation for understanding what is happening on a broader level. While these substances must be used with great respect, they can yield incredible benefits when approached with courage and care.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: There was a movement in the 60s focused on using psychedelics to explore their potential benefits, which was shut down. Are you hopeful we’re moving forward this time?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I am hopeful. The psychedelic renaissance is increasingly focused on personal healing, treating conditions arising from modern culture. By utilizing scientific Methodologies, we seek to document the therapeutic effects of these substances. Once validated and acknowledged in scholarly dialogue, we can transition to acknowledging them as tools for deeper spiritual communion. Indigenous cultures have been using these substances, like ayahuasca, for centuries, and there’s much wisdom there that we should honor.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Do you ever ponder why you had these experiences and not someone else?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Many have engaged with these substances wisely and had extraordinary experiences. I see myself as part of a social movement, driven perhaps by deeper training and analysis of my experiences. I believe our souls decided to partake in this specific time in history, aiming to engage at a collective, healing level. We may not remember why, but we are all here for a purpose, contributing to the transformation during this global crisis.</p>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: Thank you, Chris, for sharing your incredible journey with us.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, Sandy. It’s been an honor and pleasure to discuss this with you.</p>

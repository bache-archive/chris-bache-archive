<p>Rick Archer: 
Welcome to Buddha at the Gas Pump. My name is Rick Archer. This series features ongoing interviews with spiritually awakening people—I've done over 500 so far. If you’re new and would like to explore previous interviews, visit batgap.com, where you’ll find them organized in various ways under the “Past Interviews” menu. This program exists thanks to the support of appreciative listeners and viewers. If you’d like to contribute, there’s a PayPal button on every page of the site, as well as a donations page for those who prefer not to use PayPal.</p>
<p>My guests today are Michael Pollan and Chris Bache. I’ll introduce Michael first. He’s the author of eight books, including <em>How to Change Your Mind</em>, which is the focus of today’s conversation. Michael has also written several books about food—<em>Cooked</em>, <em>Food Rules</em>, <em>In Defense of Food</em>, <em>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</em>, and <em>The Botany of Desire</em>—all of which were New York Times bestsellers. He’s a longtime contributor to The New York Times Magazine and teaches writing at both Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley, where he is the John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Science Journalism. In 2010, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>
<p>Chris Bache has been on BatGap before, in a panel discussion about five or six years ago. Chris, say something so your picture comes up.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Good to be here. Looking forward to our conversation today.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: 
Chris is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He’s also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. An award-winning teacher, Chris's work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. He’s authored four books: <em>Lifecycles: A Study of Reincarnation in Light of Contemporary Consciousness Research</em>; <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, a pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness; <em>The Living Classroom</em>, an exploration of teaching and collective fields of consciousness; and his new book, <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven</em>.</p>
<p>Michael, here’s the cover of your book <em>How to Change Your Mind</em>. The subtitle is “What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence.” I’m really glad to have you both here—I've been looking forward to this conversation, and our listeners seem excited too. In fact, I mentioned Michael’s name in a Facebook group and someone said, “The food guy?” Michael, how did you shift—from being known as the “food guy” to delving into exploring psychedelics?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: 
Well, before I was the food guy, I was kind of the nature guy. My interest in food really began with a fascination with the reciprocal relationship between people and plants, and with co-evolution in general. In <em>The Botany of Desire</em>, which you mentioned, I explored domesticated plants and proposed the idea that they manipulate us as much as we manipulate them—that, for certain plants, a powerful evolutionary strategy is to gratify human desires through the process of natural selection. For most domesticated plants, their main focus is food, but beauty is another, and so on. Yet what I found most intriguing was the group of plants that have thrived by gratifying our desire to change consciousness.</p>
<p>In that book, I wrote a long chapter on cannabis, exploring how it’s served the cannabis plant to—through trial and error—essentially engage with the receptor network in our brains and bodies. So, I’ve had a longstanding interest in plant medicines and psychoactive plants. I put that aside for a while to focus on food research, but then I stumbled on new research using psilocybin—specifically, not a plant but a fungus. Mushrooms are actually more like us than they are like plants; plants make their own food from sunlight, but we and mushrooms are both parasitic on them. Anyway, I heard about this research giving psilocybin to people with terminal cancer, and how it was helping them deal with the prospect of death or the fear of recurrence. That struck me as very curious; on its face, I didn’t see the logic of it.</p>
<p>As a journalist, I started picking up that there was a renewed, very serious scientific and philosophical interest in psychedelics. Then, I was at a dinner party and overheard a woman about my age—an accomplished developmental psychologist—talking about insights her recent experience with LSD had given her into the consciousness of children. That was a lightbulb moment for me; as journalists, we piece together these data points, and that was enough to convince me that something was happening here that deserved a closer look.</p>
<p>Frankly, I was thrilled to have such a rich new topic to go into—one I knew little about at the start. I was a total neophyte in spiritual, neuroscientific, and psychological matters. But the great thing about being a journalist and not a specialist is you get to master completely new topics as an adult, and you get paid to do it. It’s quite a gig.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: 
I feel much the same way doing these interviews. It’s the same broad topic week after week, but always with a new flavor and focus. Something that comes through in your book, Michael, and which you just alluded to, is the sense that there’s a certain intelligence in the plant kingdom—especially among psychedelic plants. These aren’t just dumb chemicals. It’s almost as if there’s a spirit to these plants, with an agenda to foster human evolution by providing themselves as means to shift our consciousness. Would you care to elaborate on that?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: 
I don’t think I’d go quite that far—or at least, I haven’t seen evidence to support the idea that plants are bearing a message and trying to get us to save them or the planet. It might be true, but I don’t have evidence for it. But I have written about plant intelligence, and I’m continually amazed at what plants can do and how much we underestimate them. We now know that plants have elaborate communications networks. Trees in a forest communicate using mycelium—the filaments of mushrooms—to send messages and trade nutrients. They can warn one another of threats, and in response, they might change the flavor of their leaves or produce toxins to deter insects.</p>
<p>Plants have memory. They are, in a sense, intelligent—if you define intelligence as a problem-solving ability. Their reactions aren’t merely automatic; they can deal with novel threats in novel ways and remember solutions. Monica Gagliano, a botanist, has demonstrated through experiments that plants can remember and store information. I have enormous respect for them and think we need to acknowledge that they have a kind of subjectivity, a point of view, and interests they pursue, albeit very differently from us. They’re conscious of their environment and can respond appropriately, though not in the self-aware way we typically mean when we talk about consciousness.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: 
We may return to this theme later, but some people claim that consciousness is fundamental, that matter is an epiphenomenon of consciousness—not the other way around—and that all forms of matter, even a stone, express consciousness to various degrees. But let’s table that for now.</p>
<p>So, you overheard this conversation at the dinner party. How did you proceed from there? I know you moved forward with a lot of caution and seriousness—sometimes even trepidation. You describe being unable to sleep the night before a session because of anxiety about what might happen.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: 
The idea of having a psychedelic session myself came later. My first step was to reach out to an editor at The New Yorker and pitch a story about these clinical trials—to interview the people going through these psilocybin journeys, talk to the scientists, and try to understand the neuroscience and psychology involved. Happily, they supported the idea, and I wrote a piece that came out in February 2015 called “The Trip Treatment,” which you can find online. That article was straightforward science journalism, with no participatory angle—just white coats, scientists, patients, and volunteers.</p>
<p>The interviews I conducted for that story were extraordinary. The experiences people had—a single psychedelic journey, sometimes completely resetting their attitude toward death and erasing their fear—were transformative.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: 
These were cancer patients?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: 
Yes, these were cancer patients—some with terminal diagnoses, some paralyzed by fear of recurrence. In all cases, what the doctors called “existential distress” was part of the picture. These people found relief in about 80 percent of cases, which is remarkable for a single psychological intervention. In psychiatry and palliative care, we don’t have much to compare—morphine dulls perception and relieves pain, but it doesn’t help people spiritually come to terms with their situation.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: 
Tell us some more anecdotes and give us an overview of the research taking place. It’s not just cancer patients, right? There’s work with alcoholics, people with depression, and so on.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: 
It started with cancer patients, for a couple of reasons. First, they’re a sympathetic group, and regulators are less concerned about potential toxicity with people who have terminal diagnoses, much as with the early days of AIDS research. The public is generally sympathetic—who could deny relief to someone who’s dying and facing tremendous fear? But since the success of those studies, other indications are being explored.</p>
<p>An important one is depression. This grew out of the cancer trials, as psychologists saw significantly lowered depression scores among participants. The FDA actually encouraged researchers to look at depression, since current treatments are inadequate and rates are rising fast. A big question is whether all depression is the same: is the depression a cancer patient experiences—which is relatively recent and has a clear cause—the same as treatment-resistant depression that lasts for years with no clear origin? We don’t know yet, but there’s some evidence it works more broadly. A trial at Imperial College in London with treatment-resistant depressed patients showed significant, though often short-lived, results. Their depression lifted for a couple months, then in many cases gradually returned—not all, but most. So, there’s encouraging reason for further research, and two large depression trials are now getting underway.</p>
<p>There have also been trials for addiction—alcoholics, cigarette smokers, cocaine addicts—with preliminary but promising results. Behavioral change might become one of the most important applications of psychedelics. With that in mind, Johns Hopkins is planning studies on eating disorders, especially anorexia, which is very difficult to treat and has a high mortality rate. Any progress there would be fantastic. There’s also been a small trial on obsessive-compulsive disorder and some work with high-functioning autistic people with social anxiety, which has been encouraging.</p>
<p>To those who wonder how one class of drugs could address such a variety of problems, it’s important to see that they have something in common: these conditions all involve rigidity of thinking—people get trapped in deep grooves of mental or behavioral habit and can’t break out. Psychedelics appear to jolt the system, granting people the perspective needed to break habitual patterns, especially when combined with therapeutic support. These aren’t just people taking psilocybin on their own in the woods; the clinical trials are carefully guided. Participants are prepared in advance, told what to expect, and coached on handling difficulties. During the experience, two guides (typically a man and a woman) are present—not intervening, but offering a sense of safety so the subject can surrender to the experience. Integration sessions afterward help people make sense of what happened and find ways to apply insights to their lives.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: 
Have these therapists usually taken psilocybin themselves, so they have a better idea of what the participant is going through?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: 
I can only speculate, since none would admit it—understandably, as it might compromise their perceived objectivity or the credibility of the studies. Some, I have reason to believe, have had experiences themselves, but only spoke about it off the record or denied it. It would certainly be hard not to develop some curiosity—I know I did. Through my research, I realized I couldn’t fully understand what these volunteers were experiencing without doing it myself. That led to the more autobiographical part of my book, where I worked with several underground guides, since I couldn’t participate in the official clinical trials, to have similar experiences in a slightly different context.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: 
That brings up another point: since the early 70s, when Nixon declared Timothy Leary the “most dangerous man in America” and psychedelic research was clamped down on, not much official research has happened. Now it seems to be burgeoning, but can anyone qualified study this, or is it still just a trickle compared to the potential?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: 
The slow pace is mostly due to lack of federal funding—all funding comes from private, charitable sources. Fortunately, there are visionary donors supporting the work, and it’s spreading: many universities and medical schools are getting involved. The FDA, since 1992, has said it will treat psychedelics like any other drug—if you can justify your experiment, they’ll permit it, and the DEA will issue a license. Serious researchers aren’t encountering major federal obstacles—the biggest challenge is money.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: 
Your comment about the commonality among the issues addressed by psychedelics—that they all involve people whose minds are locked into rigid patterns—reminded me of how different psilocybin and similar drugs are from conventional protocols, which often just suppress or dull symptoms. These compounds, by contrast, open up awareness and catalyze radical shifts in perspective. In your book you note that many people say after just one session, “That was the most profound experience of my life,” and lose the urge to drink or smoke permanently. It’s fascinating that a single experience could create such lasting and deep change.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: Yeah, and I also think it's important to note that other psychiatric drugs generally deal with symptoms—they're something you take every day, possibly for the rest of your life, so the chemicals are always in your brain. With psychedelics, you might only have a one- or two-shot intervention. The chemicals, which are not very toxic—whether we're talking about psilocybin or LSD—are in your brain for only a short time, and you're actually dealing with potential cures. In many cases, you're solving the problem because, as you said, you're not dulling the patient. You're opening them up, relieving them from ego consciousness for a period. I think that's probably a key mechanism for how this works.</p>
<p>One fascinating finding from research I cover in my book is the effort to figure out what's going on in the brain during a psychedelic experience. The current thinking is there's one particular brain network—the default mode network—which is a tightly linked set of structures along the midline that connect the prefrontal cortex to older, deeper areas of memory and emotion in the posterior cingulate cortex. This network is like the orchestrator or conductor of brain activity. It's closely associated with the sense of self: self-reflection happens here, as does mental time travel, theory of mind (the ability to impute mental states to others), and autobiographical memory—the way we tie the events in our lives to the story we tell ourselves about who we are. If the ego has an address in the brain, it's probably here.</p>
<p>What's remarkable is that this area is dramatically suppressed during the psychedelic experience. That was a big surprise. Initially, researchers thought psychedelics would just excite everything in the brain—lots of fireworks. But for this particular network, the opposite happens. There's radical downregulation of the default mode network, and you can correlate that with reports of ego dissolution—when people describe their sense of self as obliterated, you see on an fMRI that their default mode network has been almost completely deactivated. That's a fascinating insight into how these experiences might be materialized in the brain.</p>
<p>It may be that relief from ego consciousness—and from an overactive default mode network—is implicated in problems like depression. There's research suggesting that depressed people often have an overactive default mode network, which can be punishing; they just can't get out of their heads. The default mode network also lights up when your mind is wandering and nothing in the world is really holding your attention. It operates in a kind of seesaw relationship with the attentional networks. So, giving people a vacation from that regulatory authority allows lots of other brain activity to flourish.</p>
<p>There's an illustration in my book attempting to show how the brain gets "rewired" during a psilocybin or LSD experience. Picture a circle with all these different brain networks around it—the visual cortex, the auditory networks, the ones directing physical activity—and suddenly, there's communication between networks that don't ordinarily speak to one another. That might explain synesthesia—the phenomenon where someone "sees" musical notes, for example—perhaps because the auditory center is talking directly to the visual cortex without going through the default mode network. So, the brain is temporarily rewired, and we know that brain connections are new ways of thinking. Even if they're temporary, you can exercise them and make them more salient. It's just a theory, but one of the operative theories: when you have a profound insight on psychedelics, maybe it's literally a product of connecting the dots in a new way.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: I have a couple of thoughts on that. One is, if we think of the brain as a filter, lens, or receiver of consciousness, rather than as a generator, then the default mode network shutting down or quieting could imply there's less filtration going on—so whatever consciousness is can shine through more fully. Ancient traditions say that consciousness is, among other things, bliss by its very nature, so if the default mode network is subdued, you might experience very gratifying, fulfilling states.</p>
<p>Another point: a lot of the meditation research has shown remarkable coherence between different brain areas that ordinarily aren't correlated or coherent, as measured by EEG. Frequencies just line up in synchrony, whereas before they were asynchronous.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: And also, the meditation research done by people like Judson Brewer, who's taken fMRI images of experienced meditators, shows scans that look a lot like the psychedelic scans. He was really struck by the similarities—both seem to downregulate the default mode network. I think that's significant.</p>
<p>Your point about “opening the doors of perception,” as Huxley called it—referring to the “reducing valve”—was really about the ego. The ego walls us off from both internal unconscious material and external sensory information. It's what defends us from being overwhelmed—by reality, nature, or what's in our unconscious. During a psychedelic experience, those walls come down, which accounts for the merging that people feel. I think we're just using different vocabularies for describing the same thing; I'm using ego and walls, which is psychodynamic, and you're using a more spiritual language—but we're talking about the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Chris, do you have any questions or comments on what we've been saying so far?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I've just been enjoying Michael's presentation immensely. Michael, I'm deeply appreciative that someone of your caliber has done such an excellent job of presenting the history and the complexities involved in this form of therapy. You've opened up the conversation to many people who previously would never have been willing to discuss psychedelics, and you've done an exceptional job with it—capturing the personalities involved so well. I'm really grateful for your work.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: Thank you. I was approaching this as an outsider, with a fair amount of naivete and skepticism. Of course, there are people with much more knowledge and experience in the psychedelic world, but those conversations have mostly happened within the psychedelic community. I wasn't coming from there. I've always written for an audience that I don’t assume has any prior interest in the subject—whether it’s food, agriculture, or anything else. My method is to grab the general reader by the collar and say, “Hey, this is really cool, you should pay attention!” I think that stance helped bring more people into the conversation. It's been gratifying to see how many people—therapists, neuroscientists—have become excited in the past year about the potential here and now want to get involved in the research or personal experimentation. The renaissance was already underway—I was simply reporting on something that was happening—but I feel lucky to have played some role bringing people into the tent.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: We could spend hours going through the stages of your exploration with psychedelics and all the different experiences you had, much of which is well documented in your book. I’d like to ask a question from a listener named Susie Parkinson in Carlsbad, California: Since your original psychedelic journeys, or perhaps as a result of them, has your belief system or perspective changed, deepened, or taken on a meaning it didn’t previously have?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: That's a great question. My experiences have changed me in various ways, though most personality changes are pretty subtle. My wife, who knows me better than anyone, has noticed that I’m more open and patient now. She was very apprehensive when I started getting involved with psychedelics, worried I might change for the worse, but she doesn't think that's happened.</p>
<p>Intellectually, my understanding of spirituality has shifted. I was, honestly, pretty spiritually retarded before all this—it was an undeveloped part of my life. Some people view discussions of the body and desire as spiritual, and I’ve always written about food in a way that touches on the importance of communion, but I didn’t see myself as spiritual. Partly, that's because I used to think spirituality existed in opposition to science or skepticism, implying belief in the supernatural—things science would never be able to explain. I approached things from a pretty confirmed materialist perspective, believing that the laws of nature could explain everything. But I realized, after my psychedelic journeys—especially one particular experience of transcending my usual sense of self—how limited that was.</p>
<p>In this one experience, I actually beheld myself dissolving—first breaking into a cloud of post-it notes, then, in another instance, spread out on the ground like a coat of paint or butter. But a new perspective arose to witness all this: an “I” that wasn’t familiar, that observed the scene with total detachment and was completely fine with what was happening—unburdened, reconciled, and untroubled. Once my ordinary sense of self was gone, I was totally open—unprotected, undefended—and then a merging began. In this particular instance, I merged with a piece of music: an unaccompanied cello suite by Bach. I became the music—there was no subject-object duality. I could feel Yo-Yo Ma’s horsehair bow over my skin. I was in a dark well, and the breeze of the music’s vibration was physical. It was remarkable.</p>
<p>The next day, in integration with my guide, I described this complete ego dissolution and she asked, “What did you learn?” I said, “That you’re not identical to your ego. There’s another ground on which to stand—but it's mysterious.” She said, “Wasn't that worth the price of admission?” And I agreed it was interesting, but wondered, “What do you do with it?” She explained that you can cultivate that way of being, mainly through meditation.</p>
<p>Like many people, especially American Buddhists, this experience opened a door and made me more at home in the mental space of meditation. Now, sometimes, I can attain that perspective I found during the psilocybin trip. Did that make me more spiritual? I’m not prepared to say that new perspective was a transpersonal or universal consciousness. When it happened to Aldous Huxley, he called it “mind at large”—something we tune into that's outside ourselves. I’d really like to hear Chris’s take on that. I don’t know—maybe it was just another product of my own mind that I hadn't experienced before, simply because the ego usually overshadows everything.</p>
<p>But I did come to see my previous understanding of spirituality was faulty. Spirituality, for me now, is powerful connection—an openness, an undefended ability to connect, whether that’s to nature (which is very important to me), to other people, or to the universe in a more general way. During another experience, I felt nature to be very much alive—the leaves in my garden seemed to return my gaze. It was beautiful. So, connection to nature opens up, as does connection to others: the sense of love and the powerful merging that so many people report on psychedelics. To me, spirituality now means opening the gates so you can connect deeply, without a screen between you and the other, with no subject-object split.</p>
<p>So, the opposite of “spiritual” isn't “material,” as I previously thought—it’s “egotistical.” Really, it’s the ego that stands in the way of these powerful connections. The ego is the enemy of spiritual development. That’s my current takeaway. It’s not final—I know I have more to learn and might eventually land elsewhere. I’m very curious about how you, Chris, would interpret that experience of a new perspective opening up as the self dissolves.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Listening to you, I’m reminded of Shunryu Suzuki’s description in his book of “big mind” and “little mind.” There’s “little mind,” which is efficient at getting things done—sitting at our desk, answering the phone. Then there’s “big mind”—that dimension of consciousness which is profoundly larger, other than, and inclusive of “little mind.” It’s just a different wavelength of awareness.</p>
<p>All meditation traditions agree there are many layers to the ego. You can clear one level, get caught on another, and it’s a bit of a labyrinth. But according to their thinking, it is possible to profoundly still or make the ego transparent, and when that happens, the larger, background context surfaces into awareness. That rings true in my experience. The question then becomes: if there's little mind and big mind, what is mind itself? That opens up a fascinating discussion—what is the nature of consciousness? Who or what can have consciousness?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: What is the nature of mind? I know that's a big question.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It's a big one. Personally, I don't have a vested interest in specific definitions of consciousness or mind. I’m happy to go where anyone wants—as long as the definition is open to a complete phenomenology of mind. My background's in philosophy of religion, and phenomenology has been a large part of that. I think it's important that we critically—not naively—look at the broadest possible body of data on what mind is, how it manifests, and what it can do.</p>
<p>Can mind influence the health of the body? Can it actually move physical objects—telekinesis? Is there mind-to-mind or even mind-to-plant communication, an exchange of information? That takes us into deeper questions. When we reference Aldous Huxley’s “mind at large,” that’s the assertion of an encompassing mind that holds all sub-minds—a kind of creative intelligence underpinning the universe. I’m comfortable with that concept. I’m not a theist or supernaturalist—it's all nature, all natural to me. For me, exploring consciousness doesn’t go beyond the reach of scientific investigation. But I've spent many years exploring different dimensions of that mind.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Using what tools?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: My primary tool has been LSD, used in a specific modality. I also have experience with psilocybin, ayahuasca, and salvia divinorum, but LSD was my main instrument of exploration. Should I describe this now, Rick?</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Let me just wrap up a point Michael made earlier, and then let's get into that. Michael said he used to be averse to spirituality because it seemed anti-scientific—if I'm expressing that correctly. There’s a lot of "woo" out there, and historically religion and science have been at odds, sometimes with dire consequences for new ways of thinking. But I think we've reached a point where science and spirituality can complement each other tremendously. If we treat anything spirituality or religion proposes as a hypothesis—open to experiential investigation, instead of something we’re supposed to believe—then it’s all potential fuel for discovery.</p>
<p>Chris is going to comment on things he’s investigated experientially—some of which might seem extremely hypothetical to the average person, but which have far-reaching implications for humanity, religion, and spirituality. I don’t see a lot of value in simply believing something because a tradition or authority says so; everything should be open to experiential investigation. That’s what the scientific attitude brings to spirituality.</p>
<p>On the other hand, spirituality brings something to science: science doesn’t yet have tools for investigating the subtler realms that spirituality specializes in. LSD is such a tool—ultimately, our own human nervous system is the tool, which mystics have been developing and refining over the ages to explore subtle dimensions and expand human knowledge in ways modern science can’t yet reach. So, I just wanted to make that point. Chris, please go ahead and segue from that.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Just to add to what you said, Rick—there’s a distinction between studying the quantitative qualities of consciousness, which science is very good at, and the qualitative nature, which is equally important. With a broader methodology, we can study the qualitative aspects scientifically—through controlled experiments, carefully screened participants from diverse backgrounds, putting them through the same regimen, recording their experiences, comparing across populations. We can't literally put experience under a microscope, but we can use all of our critical faculties to study qualitative experience—then broaden it to cross-cultural and historical analysis. We need to be critical, but being critical is broader than just being neurological.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: Yes, and what's interesting to me about consciousness as a scientific subject is that you can't study it without experience. There’s no other tool; phenomenology is the only path we have so far for understanding subjectivity. I agree you can pursue that path with rigor. In the psychedelic research, for example, volunteer reports are critically important. Sometimes you correlate those with brain scans, sometimes you don't have to. But a big question remains: is there evidence that brains don’t produce consciousness, or that mind precedes matter? That fascinates me. I went into my investigations assuming the scientific consensus—that we don't know how, but neurons must be producing consciousness. Even though it’s hard to see how you get from cells to experience, that’s been the default assumption. But many people, after psychedelic experiences, come out in a different place.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: I interviewed a guy a few months ago, Mark Gober, who wrote a book called "The End to Upside Down Thinking," which addresses this very issue. At first glance, it might seem simple or parsimonious to say consciousness is just an epiphenomenon of brain functioning. But there are so many anomalies that poke holes in that materialist worldview. Mark’s book goes through these anomalies in a brilliant way. What's the name of the book? "The End to Upside Down Thinking" by Mark Gober—G-O-B-E-R. We had him on not too long ago, so you can find him there. But it's like there's a new...</p>
<p>Michael Pollan 
This book by Jeffrey Kripal is fascinating—I recommend having him back on the show. He looks at a series of people, some scientists and some philosophers, who underwent a flip in their thinking, coming to believe that mind may, in fact, perceive matter. He documents some fascinating case histories.</p>
<p>Rick Archer 
Yeah. Go ahead, Chris.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
The field of study that shifted my thinking about these matters was reincarnation research. Because even though I finished graduate school in philosophy of religion, by the end, I was pretty atheistically inclined—an agnostic. I was well versed in the rise of science and human values and fully embraced that movement. I tell my students, if you haven't fallen in love with Kant and with science, you've missed one of the great romances of history—it's a massive, ground-shaking pivot in human understanding.</p>
<p>But the research that really started to shake my belief that the brain creates consciousness—because, of course, the brain clearly generates consciousness in some sense—was Ian Stevenson's work at the University of Virginia. He published multiple volumes documenting detailed cases from around the world of children as young as three, four, or five, who had very specific memories of what appeared to be previous lives. Stevenson was able to extract and consolidate these memories, verifying enough of them to build an extremely strong case for the fact of reincarnation—without necessarily knowing the theory behind it or exactly how it occurs, but at least that some type of continuity of consciousness exists. There are many levels of complexity in moving from one life to another. Some people would say those memories are simply drawn from the collective unconscious, which wouldn't necessarily prove continuity from life to life. But I think Stevenson's evidence is powerful support for some form of ongoing awareness across lifetimes, especially his last two-volume work on reincarnation and biology. In it, he studied 1,787 cases of children who not only had psychological recall from previous lifetimes but also bore birthmarks that replicated wounds of death from their alleged previous incarnations. It was as if the trauma of consciousness imprinted not just on the mind, but also on the body in subsequent lives. After reviewing all this, I think we have information in our minds that predates this body, and if those memories are legitimate, then there is at least some sense in which our awareness, memory, and mind aren’t solely generated by our brains.</p>

A simple metaphor for this—which I’m sure you’ve both heard—is that radios and televisions are detectors, receivers for fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. If a radio breaks, the transmission from the tower doesn’t stop. Other radios can still pick it up, and if you get a new radio, you can listen again. So if consciousness is a field as opposed to just a product of the brain, then we’re all tapped into that field and share it as a foundation. But then, how do you account for individuality, especially individuality moving from life to life, from one body to another? That leads me to a question I’d like to ask, which brings us back to psychedelics: Research shows that subjective experiences in meditation and spiritual practices have physiological effects, and Western science is only able to measure the gross physiology. Traditionally, it’s understood in systems like Chinese and Vedic medicine that we also have a subtle physiology—terms like Qi, Prana, Sushumna, Ida, and Pingala nadis. These traditions stress the need to condition and strengthen the subtle body to sustain the intense energies that accompany spiritual awakening—often after years or decades of preparation.</p>
<p>This subtle body has implications for reincarnation; it might be the subtle body that moves from one physical body to another. The Bhagavad Gita says it’s like changing clothes. So, here’s the question: What are your thoughts on the fact that anyone can ingest a psychedelic substance without having prepared the subtle body? Or can psychedelics facilitate such preparation? Either of you can answer.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan 
Give this one to Chris.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Thanks, Michael.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan 
The question is built on an understanding of subtle bodies and gross bodies that is totally unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
In responding, I don’t want to assume the subtle body is what transfers from incarnation to incarnation. It may be, but I’m not convinced we’ve nailed it down that closely. Let’s take it as a hypothesis. The whole question of individuality is very subtle and complex—are we talking about the individuality of one life transferring to another, or something else entirely? I don’t want to assume a set answer there.</p>
<p>That said, I have convictions around the subtle body and especially the impact psychedelic experiences can have on it. Let me give a bit of background, because there are many variations of psychedelic experience, and my own work is the body of data I draw from.</p>
<p>When I finished graduate school in 1978, I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work—he’d just published <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em> and had over a hundred essays out already. I was, at the time, very much an atheistically agnostic philosopher, but I was immediately taken by his research proposal: that with these substances, used carefully and in controlled circumstances, we could experience deeper dimensions of our own mind. I was fascinated in particular by his observation that you can go deeper than personal consciousness, deeper even than the collective unconscious—to, potentially, the mind of the universe itself. He didn’t say it exactly like that, but that was the implication I drew. As a philosopher of religion, I saw enormous implications for a variety of philosophical questions.</p>
<p>So, in 1978, I decided to do psychedelic work. Much like Michael, after researching and noting the impact on others’ lives, I wanted to participate. I basically made the choice to have some underground experiments with psychedelics, since a legally sanctioned protocol wasn’t available. I learned Stan Grof’s methods—how to prepare for a session, the ins and outs that are now somewhat standardized—and used them privately to explore my consciousness as rigorously as I could, drawing on my philosophical and psychological training.</p>
<p>Stan differentiates between low-dose psychedelic work—15 to 200 micrograms—and high-dose work, up to 500–600 micrograms. The low dose approach gently peels back layers of consciousness through the personal and perinatal unconscious into transpersonal reality. The high dose work was, in the early years, focused on terminally ill patients—cancer patients—where the idea wasn’t so much to heal the personal unconscious as to break through all its levels, triggering a near-death-type experience and hopefully reducing anxiety around dying.</p>
<p>After a few low dose sessions, I opted for a very intense regimen with LSD. Over twenty years, I completed 73 high-dose, fully internalized, therapeutically focused psychedelic sessions, always following the same protocol, with my first wife Carol—herself a clinical psychologist—as my sitter in every session. I worked for four years, stopped for six, then worked another ten aggressive years.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend this protocol to others, especially such high doses. No current federal research recommends doses this high. But I wanted to push the limits, thinking that if high-dose psychedelic work could be done safely three times in the Spring Grove project, perhaps it could be done more often. I found it could, but it’s extremely demanding and brings both opportunities and challenges earlier protocols didn’t envision.</p>
<p>One of those challenges is how these deep states of consciousness impact the body and the subtle energy system. I discovered that as I descended into deeper levels of consciousness and stabilized at each new level, I would continuously drop into even deeper states—each associated with higher levels of extraordinarily powerful energy. I had to work very conscientiously with my body and subtle energy system: detoxifying the body, clarifying negative emotions, strengthening the subtle energy body. Purification is, I think, essential and endemic to working with psychedelics.</p>
<p>In Tibetan Vajrayana, for instance, monks must complete ngondro—the five foundational practices, including 100,000 prostrations with mantras and visualizations—to transform and clarify the subtle energy system before receiving deeper teachings. These practices build the capacity to enter very profound states of consciousness. If you enter these deeper states rapidly—as can happen with psychedelics—very powerful purification processes are triggered: physical, emotional, and mental detoxification. It’s a tremendous catharsis, described in subtle energy terms. You really have to work with the subtle energy bodies—plural, not just one—which fits well with Indian Ayurvedic and Chinese meridian systems.</p>
<p>Rick Archer 
You’re almost downplaying what you went through. If people read your book, it's clear: it’s a testament to your wife that she was able to sit through it. You went into convulsions, there was projectile vomiting, strange noises—you were undergoing excruciating subjective suffering, beyond anything you could have imagined. And you chalk it up to deep purification. In your book, you say the core of the cycle is that increased awareness triggers the surfacing of toxins in the system, precipitating a crisis of disease, which is followed by a higher level of health—operating at many levels: physical, psychological, and soul. Very often, the first part of your session was this horrible ordeal, which, once cleared, allowed you to enter an ecstatic realm and experience all kinds of beauty.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Basically—and I'll discuss this strictly in terms of the LSD work—after I stopped those sessions, I did psilocybin and ayahuasca several times and am comfortable in those worlds, but I want to restrict my account to LSD.</p>
<p>When you “die as a self,” when you undergo ego death, psychedelics—following Stan Grof, and this is from their psychoactive, not neurochemical, properties—act as amplifiers and catalysts of psychological processes. They take what is small and make it loud; what is distant, they bring close. For several hours, you are in this hypersensitive state. What you do with that awareness during a session makes all the difference: you might listen to music, have conversations, or you might go deep within, unearthing obstacles to healthy functioning, and, if you go still deeper, confront deeper existential relations with the universe.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that what we're doing in our laboratories is rediscovering a class of chemicals that cultures have used for thousands of years—ayahuasca for at least 1,500 years, with psilocybin mushrooms and peyote even further back. We're studying them in new contexts, but there's a large body of wisdom in the cultures that have long used these materials. Many of these systems see consciousness as a universal quality of life: individual consciousness, but also universal consciousness, with many tiers or levels.</p>
<p>When you enter deeper states of awareness, each is a higher level of energy, requiring its own purification and stabilization to maintain coherence. Here’s the tricky part: when I began, I thought this was about therapy, about healing my personal psyche—enlightening Chris Bache, so to speak. But some of the pain you referred to, Rick, began after I underwent a crushing ego death experience. That broke me wide open and led to a new layer of work. For the next two years, I endured excruciating psychological and psychophysical suffering—so large, broad, and deep, and prolonged, that eventually I became convinced this was not about healing my psyche. It wasn't about something personal to Chris Bache. Eventually, I was forced to conclude that, somehow, the universe—or some dynamic within it—was using my sessions for healing at a collective level, not just the individual psyche.</p>
<p>Just as I remember all of my experiences, for better or worse, the human species has a mind that remembers all the experiences of its members. If you think of all the terrible things humans have done—the wars, bloodshed, suffering—somehow the species is stuck with those and has to digest them, just as individuals must confront the darkest aspects of their shadows. It's good for us to do so individually, and the same holds at the collective level for the species. Usually, this kind of confrontation takes place in terms of social transformations or revolutions, but in very deep psychedelic work, I found that something was using my sessions to heal pain lodged in the collective psyche. To make sense of the data, I had to move to a collective model of consciousness.</p>
<p>Rick Archer 
That gives new meaning to the idea that Christ died for our sins. If a being is vast enough in awareness, it's like an ocean dissolving mud, whereas a glass of water can only handle a little before being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
We see this in Buddhist traditions too—the Bodhisattva places the good of the whole above their own, making that their project. But I don’t think this requires spiritual giants; any mother or father would do what they can to help end the suffering of their child. It's just part of being human. If you’re given an opportunity—and some deep psychedelic sessions do present that—to relieve suffering, it’s the most natural thing in the world to try.</p>
<p>Rick Archer 
But it's a question of capacity. Rupert Sheldrake talks about morphic genetic fields, which can store humanity’s traumas. I've heard it said that wars break out when enough stress accumulates in the collective field—like lightning strikes when there's enough static electricity in clouds. If we attune ourselves with that field, as you seem to describe, we can become an instrument for its purging and purification.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
The universe does seem to be intensely interested in us as individuals, but also as a species. When you move into that level of consciousness—where the universe is communing with the species, after ego death and dissolving boundaries—you open up to the “species mind,” the collective mind of humanity. The universe is nurturing the wellbeing of our species just as it nurtures individuals and other species. There’s tremendous power flowing through our lives, both individually and collectively.</p>
<p>Rick Archer 
Yeah. Michael, are you still with us?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan 
I’m fascinated by what I’m hearing. I don’t know how to process it. Chris, I’m curious: Where did the turn come, from thinking you were dealing with your individual suffering to realizing it was a collective matter, a transpersonal question? Was it an insight during one of these high-dose experiences, or did it emerge as you processed them afterward? That’s a big shift.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It was a big shift, and it’s a little of both, but probably the most important part came after the sessions, as I processed and worked through them. It took years. I kept trying to fit it into Stan Grof’s paradigm and the other paradigms available at the time—which always focused on healing or enlightening the individual. I wrote <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> largely to answer the question, "Why did suffering get so large in my psychedelic sessions?" Eventually, that led me beyond the person-centered model to a collective one. My thinking has evolved since then, but that’s where the jump happened. I started the work in ’79 and wrote the book in ’95–’96, about 15 years into the process. So it took more than ten years for me to really accept and understand that idea. Once I did, a lot of other things began to make sense—how, at the collective level, after going through that “ocean of suffering”—which lasted two years—and experiencing the associated death and rebirth that led me into deeper archetypal reality, I had many experiences showing me how the species mind is alive within all our individual, fractally embedded minds; how each individual mind feeds into the collective, as Rupert Sheldrake describes, and the collective feeds back into the individual. It's a constant feedback system. Intellectually, it was integrating Rupert's morphic field theory with Stan Grof's paradigm that gave me the permission to make this radical reinterpretation...</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: The data is fascinating. How do you respond to people who say, "Well, you just had a drug experience. You messed with the chemistry in your brain and had delusions of insight into something collective"? That's how a lot of people would automatically react, especially those not versed in this world. Why should a molecule afford such insight?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That's an anthropological question—maybe better answered by anthropologists—but I understand the objection, the cautionary concern. I was trained as an analytic philosopher, a highly skeptical discipline, so I value that skepticism. But I also think it's important to look at the history of human beings using these substances, to see how they've been regarded in other civilizations, and to examine the emerging body of modern psychedelic research. In my book "Dark Night, Early Dawn," I devote a chapter to the methodology of taking a philosophical approach to psychedelic inquiry, and I cite reasons why we should take these experiences seriously rather than dismiss them.</p>
<p>For example, sometimes we gain knowledge in those states of consciousness—knowledge we didn't have before and could reasonably exclude having had previously—that turns out to be true and valid.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: Like the perinatal research that Stan Grof did, for example?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Exactly. Some people relive aspects of their birth, which they can later verify. Or, even more radically, someone might have an experience showing them how whales give birth or how lions experience hunger—things they never considered before—which then prove to be physiologically accurate. I remember Stan recounting a session where a person insisted Stan call his mother and father, gave a telephone number, and wanted him to reassure the parents he was okay. This was bizarre, but they wrote down the information. After the session, once everything was stable, Stan carefully reached out to that number and found a husband and wife on the other end. It turned out their son had just died—maybe days or weeks before—and they understood their son would wish them to know he was okay. So you get these very unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: So, wait a minute—this wasn't a physical person in the room giving the phone number. This was something Stan cognized in a psychedelic state, given by a non-physical entity, and then he called the parents and it checked out. Wow, that's interesting.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: Chris, you also said you wouldn't recommend this kind of regimen. I have two questions: Why not? And after the agony you experienced in those sessions, how did you muster the courage to do it again, let alone two more times?</p>
<p>Rick Archer: And before you answer that, Chris, let me add—did you ever worry you were "frying the circuitry," that your suffering was self-inflicted damage, or that you might be exposing yourself to some negative astral level? How did you have the confidence to proceed? I'm just adding that to Michael's question.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I really trusted Stan Grof's work. That's why I consider myself in his lineage; my work builds on his scholarship. I trusted his methodology and his survey of the literature. I trusted his evidence that there was no physiological or genetic damage, and the cases he presented. I appreciated the rigor with which he integrated various theories—especially in "Beyond the Brain"—into the phenomenology of psychedelic discourse. One of the main takeaways from Stan's work for me was learning to absolutely trust what arises in a psychedelic session if you surrender completely. You may not understand it going in—it can be horrendous and painful—and it might take months or years to grasp why things are unfolding a certain way, but it always comes out well in the end. That was my approach.</p>
<p>As for not recommending this work: I wouldn't work at such high doses so frequently. Not that high doses shouldn't ever be used, but I wouldn't recommend "blowing consciousness apart" so aggressively for so many sessions over so many years. Even though I was responsible—about five sessions a year, lots of time to recuperate, taking care of my body, doing spiritual practice, keeping detailed notes within 24 hours, studying those notes as methodically as possible—it was still intense. By the end of my journey, I had major breakthroughs and insights, but I realized an assumption I had held was wrong: that there is a particular goal or endpoint, whether it's oneness with God, the meta-cosmic void, or the super-cosmic void.</p>
<p>What I found after experiencing many permutations of oneness and exploring subtleties even in formlessness, is that if you have a method powerful enough to keep pushing the boundaries of your experience, it will keep unfolding boundary after boundary. It brings you deeper and deeper into intimacy with what I call the creative intelligence of the universe—something infinitely vast, intelligent, compassionate. The experience of dissolving into it with no boundaries has been deeply life-changing. But about 17 years into the process, at the edge of what Buddhists call the Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality—I was in a deep state of bliss, and suddenly my visual field pivoted, and I saw galaxies far in the distance; a beam of light emerged and shattered me. In those seconds, I realized: it's an infinite progression. You cannot reach the end of the universe, or of the universe's mind. Because of that, I'd be gentler with myself now. With these substances, we can open ourselves to infinity, but only as much as we can psychologically, emotionally, and physically digest. I'm more patient now with slower spiritual development than I was when younger, rushing into these states.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: What you said speaks to Michael's earlier question—how a molecule could alter the brain so we have profound, meaningful cognitions about life and reality. I wrote down a question: Are psychedelic visions just projections of our psyche, or do they reveal things that actually exist, ordinarily beyond perception? But your comments about the creative intelligence of the universe answer that—if that's what exists, then by any means (psychedelics, meditation), if we merge with that ocean, we realize our ultimate, essential identity with it—the mind of the universe, the source of all laws of nature. As finite beings, we can only express so much, but we do share, briefly, a kind of omniscience. All the great pronouncements of the mystics have been their attempts, through human language, to express that experience of merging.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes. When we have temporary experiences of infinity, they leave lasting impressions, even when we come back to being finite. And if we experience infinite, all-embracing love—a love that transcends species and reaches down to the molecules and atoms—then returning to ordinary reality leaves a profound impact. That's one of the reasons I think we ought to take these experiences seriously—not just for empirical data or the correlations across multiple experiences. Of course, there's always deception, incompleteness, distortion; we'll always wrestle with "what if it's just this, not that?" That's a worthy question, and part of the ongoing dialog.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: The experience carries enormous authority. William James called it the noetic sense—these aren't mere subjective opinions but feel like authoritative truths. That's why they're so sticky. Chris, do you feel that with proper discipline and commitment, one could reach the same place with meditation?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely, with some qualifications. As a professor of religious studies, I've taught courses in comparative mysticism and studied those traditions. The great masters have always guided me—some reach these states through natural means, others with assistance. Sustaining these states for hours is impressive, but sustaining them for months or years is greater still and deserves respect.</p>
<p>Carol, my sitter during the years we worked together, is a serious Vajrayana Buddhist practitioner. She never did a session with me or used psychedelics; her practice was contemplative. After we parted (we're both remarried but remain close), she completed a three-year, three-month, three-day retreat under her teacher's supervision. She's a serious practitioner. Compared to her, I'm modest, but I understand the relationship between my psychedelic experiences and those preserved in meditative traditions—traditions she has introduced me to. I see strong correlations. I don't think the cosmology we're encountering with deep psychedelic work is new—it appears in the great mystical traditions. Yet all those traditions are stage-specific; they reflect historical, anthropological, even evolutionary contexts. They're not eternal truths, but approximations of an ever-expanding truth. Psychedelics can push the edges of those classic cosmologies and open new possibilities.</p>
<p>For instance, deep immersion in transtemporal experience is not so deeply embedded in mystical traditions, but it's been a big part of my psychedelic experience. Let me back up: I started in 1979 interested in spirituality and enlightenment. I'd been meditating for years, hit common early blocks, and thought sessions would help me break through to enlightenment faster. It didn't turn out that way. When I really dove in, I found a different track—a cosmic exploration to explore the consciousness of the universe, to experience the fabric of reality. It's not incompatible with the enlightenment track, but cosmic inquiry dominated my sessions. So, I wouldn't use the measure of enlightenment as the only way to evaluate what happened in those sessions. They're different projects. Only in recent years did it come back around to classic enlightenment.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Plenty of yogis and siddhas have performed cosmic exploration and written down their findings; they've just gone about it through other means. Michael, did you want to add something?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: No, go ahead.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I'll add one thing: If LSD is only an amplifier of consciousness, then by definition it can't do anything that can't be achieved through other methods. It's not the psychedelic that does this—it's consciousness itself. The psychedelic simply amplifies and focuses it; so can meditation.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Right. That thing you said about patience as you get older, and abandoning the "enlightenment or bust" attitude—I relate. I did psychedelics for a while in the '60s, then learned to meditate at 18, have done so for over 51 years, a couple of hours a day. For years there was that desperate feeling of "I've got to get enlightened, got to break through!"—until it just faded, and contentment dawned. Maybe that's natural maturation, or the effect of meditation—a fulfillment not dependent on external circumstances. Either way, safety first is best. Impatience can lead to unfortunate situations if one proceeds recklessly, in any area.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Here's a question from my good friend Dana Sawyer—professor of religion and philosophy, biographer of Aldous Huxley and Huston Smith. He had two related questions. First: What are the connections, similarities, and differences between psychedelic and mystical states of consciousness? Maybe we've covered that?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: The researchers I've interviewed see them lining up very closely. Sometimes they'll use the term "mystical-like experience," perhaps not to offend religious circles. They've studied the anatomy of mystical experience, as described by William James, and they find all six, seven, or eight characteristics present.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: I was reminded of that story: Ram Dass gave some LSD to Neem Karoli Baba, and apparently it had no effect on him. Presumably, he was already in a high, abiding state, and LSD couldn't add anything.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: Yes, I've heard that story for a long time—and it was one of Chris's doses, something like 500 or 600 micrograms. I've always thought it was apocryphal, but maybe we should ask...</p>
<p>Chris Bache: You'll find the story in the book "Miracle of Love," Ram Dass's collection of anecdotes about Neem Karoli Baba. According to Ram Dass, he gave him 600 micrograms the first time, but nothing happened. Back in the States, friends suggested Neem Karoli Baba must have palmed it, because nobody could take that much and not be affected. Ram Dass returned to the ashram; Neem Karoli Baba asked for more "Western medicine," and Ram Dass brought 1,200 micrograms. Neem Karoli Baba put them on his tongue, made Ram Dass verify it, swallowed them—and again, wasn't affected.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Did you ever hear Bruce Joel Rubin's story? He wrote the screenplay for "Ghost" and "Jacob's Ladder." When he was a teenager in New York, someone left a jar of liquid Sandoz LSD in his refrigerator. He and his friend decided to try it—his friend was supposed to put a drop on his tongue with a dropper, but accidentally squeezed the whole dropper. Anyway, it's quite a story.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Stan Grof says there's a natural threshold around 500 micrograms. If you take more, you don't necessarily get higher, so there's a saturation point at five to six hundred micrograms.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: All right, here's the important question—then we should let Michael go. This is Dana's second question, and I should have asked it first. Huston Smith argued that traits matter more than states: even if psychedelics can trigger religious experiences, it's less clear they can help develop religious lives. Dana mentioned that psychedelics can definitely trigger genuine mystical states as measured by eight of the nine parameters of the States-Pahnke typology, but the ninth parameter is continued improvements in behavior. Is there evidence that psychedelic experiences lead to more compassionate or selfless behavior?</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: That's a really good question. I don't know the answer. Some people feel that knowledge attained through psychedelics is so rapid—"easy," though that's not the right word, especially after hearing Chris—that it has less enduring traction in our lives. The oft-used analogy is: if you climb the mountain, you get the view, but if someone lands on the peak by helicopter, they get the same view without earning it, so it is less powerful. That seems a bit Puritan to me—the notion that you need good works to justify faith. In reality, some people who have psychedelic experiences carry the insights and convictions forward, changing their lives to become more moral, ethical people; others don't, and that's where integration comes in—approaching it with reverence and recognition. The real work is applying what you've seen: how does it change your behavior? It's not automatic. Some people do psychedelics and behave badly; some have egos dissolved in a session, only for it to inflate afterward. We have to be wary of those pitfalls.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: The same can be said for meditation. I know people who've meditated for decades who are not people I’d want to associate with, and others who’ve truly transformed. So maybe, in addition to whatever practice for "dipping into consciousness," we need conscious attention to ethics—to being a more responsible human being.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I completely agree with both of you. As Michael said, a mystical experience does not a mystic make, to paraphrase Huston Smith. But a mystical experience can also unmake a materialist philosophy, so it has philosophical significance. If enough people, across enough sessions, reach consensus on certain cosmic details, that’s important. But just having the experience doesn’t necessarily make you wiser, kinder, or gentler. If you work conscientiously at integrating those experiences, hopefully they help. They don't flip a switch, but they act as seed catalysts—and we have to cultivate those seeds.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: Yeah, well, I think that's a great note for me to leave you on. I'm very sorry I have to go—I have another appointment—but thank you very much for a very stimulating conversation. I look forward to continuing sometime.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Thank you so much. And I should add that Michael's book will be coming out in paperback—what did you say, the 14th? Tuesday? Well, anyway, by the time this interview is up, the book will be out. You can get it on Amazon, and I'll have a link to it on the page at batgap.com.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: Chris, I look forward to your new book, and I'll be sure to order it.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, Michael. I hope we have many more conversations—there's a lot more to talk about.</p>
<p>Michael Pollan: We've just begun. Thank you, it was an absolute pleasure.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: For those who are listening, hang on because I'm going to continue a little longer with Chris. Let me start, Chris, by asking a few questions that have come in from the audience, and I want to save time before we wrap up to talk about your notion of the birth of the future human, which I find fascinating, and the changes humanity may have to go through as that birth takes place. Let's budget our time—you let me know when you feel we should cut the questions and get to that. So, here's one from Amit in New Zealand. He asks: "After Ayahuasca sessions, I experienced some detrimental energetic shifts, for lack of better words—waking up deeply, physically tired for months afterwards. It became somewhat worrisome. Are there specific methods or practices that you can personally recommend for the most efficient integration and minimum of any potential detrimental physical or energetic effect after some deep sessions?"</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It's a complicated question, first, because every psychedelic is a little different. Since you're talking about Ayahuasca, it has a different quality than LSD, and a different quality than psilocybin mushrooms. Let's assume a rather strong dose of Ayahuasca—it can have a tremendous impact on our physiology and psychology. When we jar ourselves that way, entering these temporary conditions of awareness so radically different from our ordinary consciousness, it's going to shake up our system. It impacts us, and I think we have to be gentle with ourselves and cultivate practices of contemplation to help us integrate these experiences.</p>
<p>I don't think there's necessarily a formula that will ensure an outcome free from periods of physical or even psychological exhaustion that sometimes follow. But if we look to spiritual literature—what does it mean to take up a spiritual practice?—my belief is the more powerful the psychedelic experience you want to cultivate (by the nature, strength, or frequency of the chemical), the more you push your system into new territory, the more important it is to cultivate meditation, classic contemplative practice, take care of the body, stretch the body, support your subtle energy system, care for your emotional, mental, and spiritual life. All those are important. How it actually cashes out in a specific regimen—I know I have my routine, and it has changed through the years. It's good to ask the question, to seek advice, and to cultivate practices that will help stabilize your system after such an extreme experience.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: And there are other things—exercise, diet, you know, the obvious stuff that anybody benefits from if they do it regularly and properly. Everything is interconnected. Here's a question from Bobby in Griffin, Georgia. Bobby asks: "If psychedelics give a glimpse into true nature or reality, that seems to beg the question of there being some sort of sheath or mask covering common daily experience. Is this sheath or veil developed during early childhood, and therefore, would infancy and early childhood experience be akin to psychedelic experience?"</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I understand the logic, and I know a number of people would say that. At the same time, I hope no child has ever had some of the experiences I've had on psychedelics—not just the negative ones, but even the cosmic, ecstatic ones. Those are extremely powerful experiences, and I hope a child doesn't have to take that in. But within that caveat, there's a sense in which children are more naturally receptive to those more sensitive dimensions of consciousness, which they lose as they grow older—it's talked and conditioned out of them, and later they have to rediscover it.</p>
<p>It's not just something that happens in childhood. Besides psychedelics, I study reincarnation research, near-death experiences, out-of-body research—lots of forms of non-ordinary states of consciousness. The emerging picture seems to be that when we die, we expand into a larger, subtle, higher state of consciousness; when we incarnate, we contract into a small, physically-dominant kind of consciousness. We die, we expand into great spaciousness; we incarnate, we contract. We repeat that over and over. Over thousands of years, the more we do it, the more we begin to integrate spiritual and physical dimensions. It's not either/or; it becomes both/and within our own lifetime and body. So simply taking up an incarnation has a naturally contractive effect on consciousness. I don't think it's something we're doing wrong to our children, though once you understand that progression, there are things we can do to help our children adjust to this world.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: That cycle you just mentioned can be true of meditation, too. My teacher used the example of dying a cloth in India: they'd take a white cloth, dip it in dye, bleach it in the sun, then repeat—dye, sun, dye, sun—until eventually, even if you leave it in the sun, it retains the color. So, you dip into Samadhi, then engage in activity, and repeat; the nervous system transforms, and the Samadhi becomes stabilized. You end up having Nirvikalpa Samadhi all the time, or whatever you want to call it—it doesn't have to just be with eyes closed.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Okay, one more question from the audience, then I want to get into the birth of the future human. David from Cambridge, England, asks: "If psilocybin or similar substances were made widely available to the public, do you think there would be a negative side effect to consciousness or society? Are these substances restricted, perhaps, due to society not being ready for them?" And I'll add that Michael Pollan wrote an op-ed in the New York Times the other day about Colorado's recent permissiveness regarding psychedelic mushrooms; he cautioned, "Take it easy—we shouldn't go too fast here, there could be negative consequences."</p>
<p>Chris Bache: We should have gotten Michael to comment on that, since it just came out today.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Ran out of time, yeah.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Focusing on the Cambridge question: Is it perhaps prudent that psychedelics are restricted, at least to some extent? Because all hell might break loose if they just became legal, as some Libertarians want. I don't know if that would be advisable.</p>
<p>One of the points that Michael makes in his article—with which I completely agree—is that when you look at cultures with a long-term relationship with psychoactive substances, you don't find them being used recreationally. They're used under very careful ritual or spiritual conditions, and in collective circumstances—you don't just go trip out by yourself. We have much to learn from cultures with a living history with these substances. Our culture has very little such history, except recreationally or underground. Given our naiveté, maybe it's good to be cautious about bringing these into our culture.</p>
<p>But I also absolutely agree with Michael that nobody should be put in jail for possessing some psychoactive mushrooms. Toxicologically, they're very safe; psychologically, they're extremely safe; they're not habit-forming. You want to use them carefully, under guidance, but they're much less destructive than cigarettes or alcohol, and we've learned how to live with those. I hope we will decriminalize and, more importantly, learn to work respectfully with these powerful, positive substances. They can be life-transforming, but we have to be careful as we approach them.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Well said. You have a section in your book towards the end entitled "The Birth of the Future Human: Global Awakening and Its Impact on Society." I want to read a couple of bits from it. You say, "I believe that the global systems crisis taking place in the world outside us is deeply connected to the evolutionary metamorphosis taking place inside us. Humanity is coming into a time of great awakening, a profound shift in the fundamental condition of the human psyche. But for there to be a great awakening, there must first take place a great death. This global crisis will be so severe that it will impact not only individuals, but the collective unconscious of humanity itself." And you wrote about a session that left you feeling "like someone walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb was dropped, with unbidden knowledge of what lies ahead." It was terrible to experience humanity's coming collapse, but redemptive to experience the rebirth that followed. You wrote, "Since that session, I have never doubted the larger arc of our evolutionary journey, even as I mourn its casualties. Without a vision of where nature is taking us—without understanding the higher good that our collective suffering is bringing forward in history—we might drown in the sorrow that lies ahead, and we must not drown. I believe the form that the future human will take will be the diamond soul." That gives you a springboard.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Let me just back up a second. When you work with high doses of LSD, totally internalized and intensified with music and eye shades, you basically explode your consciousness—you shatter it. For six or eight hours at a time, you become a different kind of being. You're not a human being; you open yourself to an unprecedented intimacy with the universe, which takes the role of teacher. The universe decides where you go and what you learn, balancing what you can take in and what it wants you to take in.</p>
<p>As my journey continued—over years, systematically—about 23 sessions in, I began to have a series of visionary experiences about where the universe was taking the human species. These were about evolutionary dynamics after consciousness became such a powerful factor in human evolution. We're not changing our body very quickly, but consciousness is changing rapidly. I had many experiences showing humanity poised on the edge of an enormous breakthrough—not just a civilizational, economic, or technological breakthrough, but a transformation in the fundamental platform or baseline of human consciousness. There was tremendous pressure and acceleration of our conscious dynamics, a massive detoxification over generations—this was not only influencing individuals, but was a collective dynamic.</p>
<p>The vision was that we are approaching a great awakening—an exponential increase in our psychological and psychophysical capacities. But there was no indication of how this would be accomplished. Then, in 1995, the universe took me deep into "deep time." After a grueling journey, I blew out into a radically expanded time framework and entered the heart of the death and rebirth of humanity. The state of consciousness I was in was not Chris Bache having a collective experience—I dissolved completely and experienced the coming crisis as the species experiences it, like being able to experience a thunderstorm as both the totality and each drop simultaneously.</p>
<p>What was shown to me was that the global systems crisis we are entering—seemingly driven by the ecological crisis and climate change—will lead to a tremendous global crisis of our fundamental institutions, with major die-off around the planet, tremendous suffering. But this pain is transformative; it's a process of confronting our past, essentially confronting karma, and going through a collective death and rebirth that will take us beyond our previous level of functioning. It's not a single event, but an evolutionary process, likely to take multiple generations. We will be brought to our knees, we'll lose control, we will suffer terribly—our children and grandchildren will suffer terribly—but this suffering is labor, not simply destruction or extinction. When the process reaches its absolute peak and it seems all will die, the storm passes, survivors pull their lives together, and they begin to connect with each other in unprecedented ways. It's a time of new values, insights, technology, social relationships, and especially a new internalization of deep spiritual values—a new experience of oneness in our daily lives.</p>
<p>We learn a deep responsibility to all life forms—not only to each other and human life, but to all life on this planet and beyond. That's the part you quoted. Another part of the sessions took me deep into reincarnation: my first book is on reincarnation, and I've thought a lot about it, but in these visions, I began to integrate all my former lives. It was like winding a kite string made of light around a spool—eventually, there was a fusion of all learning and experience, and my consciousness exploded into a diamond-like state. I became an individual, but at a new order of individuality—the sum total of all my lives cascaded into a higher state, a deeper awareness of myself, others, and the universe. I began to call this the birth of the diamond soul.</p>
<p>When we reincarnate over and over, it's not just incremental improvement; evolutionarily, there comes a time when the soul wakes up inside our physical incarnation—all those former lives and learnings fuse and reach a crescendo, and we wake up. The bubble pops, and we know we are not just this body, not just this ego or this incarnation. We recognize relationships going on for thousands of years and open up to deeper communion with the creative intelligence of the universe.</p>
<p>My visionary experience shows this is the transition our species is making—we are growing into the birth of the diamond soul. Concurrently, we're clearly going through cascading global crises. As we try to become one planet externally, there's a synergistic internal process as well: trying to become one being internally, integrating all our former lives as we try to transcend our past.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: We're trying to unify engineering, ecological, industrial practices; taking responsibility for planetary health geopolitically and geophysically. That effort is mirrored by the intrapsychic process where we strive to grow up and come to terms with who and what we are. This is what I call the birth of the future human. The crisis we are entering, which will likely dominate the 21st and extend into the 22nd century, is not simply economic or industrial—it's a crisis of consciousness, an evolutionary crisis giving birth to a future human.</p>
<p>Late in my sessions—at the very end—one of the last great visions took me deep into the future and let me "try on" the fundamental blueprint of the human psyche at that point. This being was the most extraordinary being—imagine the highest, finest qualities, the greatest spiritual capacities: a mind and heart completely open to the universe and to each other, a truly magnificent being. That's what's at stake; that's what we're trying to become.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Beautiful—so eloquently put, I can't really add anything to it. And we're almost out of time. If anybody finds what you just said frightening, in terms of what the world may go through in transition to this beautiful future—there are people stocking up food and guns in preparation for the chaos they anticipate. I'd say what you really want to stock up on is consciousness—spiritual evolution, as much as you can gather, through whatever means works for you. That's the best preparation for whatever life may bring.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I absolutely agree. The survivalist mindset is about protecting and holding onto the ego, but what we really need is the cultivation of service, transformation, generosity, and compassion. Those are the qualities that will carry us into this future.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Yeah. Well, I've really enjoyed this conversation. I really enjoyed reading your book. I want to close with an endorsement from our friend Anne Baring, who’s been on BatGap, about your book. She said, "Once or twice in a century, a book appears that has the explosive force of a supernova, breaking through the limitations of religion, science, and culture. LSD and the Mind of the Universe is such a book—a gripping account of an utterly unique and extraordinary hero's journey that opens our minds and hearts to a new vision of our universe and ourselves as inseparable from the ineffable being we have called God. All beliefs fade before the incandescent revelations contained in this book—a deeply moving template of our evolutionary journey." I think that's beautifully written, and it was a marvelous book. As you said, the book won't be out until—when? November?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: November 26. Amazon has it on preorder, but it'll be out then.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: I have a link prepared, so people can order it now, and it’ll come in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I did this work for 20 years, and then I waited another 20 years to publish the book. It took a long time to digest everything that happened in those first 20 years before I was really ready to share them with other people.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Yeah, and it's been a great conversation. Conversations like this could go on for many more hours, but interviews are meant to be a sampling.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: A wonderful sampling, Rick, and the work you’re doing here—the number of minds you’re opening and the conversations you’re having, bringing people together—talk about a catalyst for positive change in our future. Way to go, really.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Thank you very much. I really hope to meet you in person one of these days.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, let's do that.</p>
<p>Rick Archer: Let me close by thanking those who've been listening or watching. I encourage you to go to batgap.com and explore the menus—sign up for the email newsletter, subscribe to the audio podcast, or donate if you feel like donating. There are other things on the site if you poke around. I really appreciate your time and attention—those in the audience, and of course you, Chris, and Michael, who has left. It was a great conversation, and I'm really glad we got to do it. Thank you.</p>

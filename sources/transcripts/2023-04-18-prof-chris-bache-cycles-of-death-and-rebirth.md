Chris Bache: When one works with very high doses of LSD, one goes through a series of Death-Rebirth experiences. In this image, the drop at the center underneath the line represents our egoic, private consciousness. Everything above the line represents spiritual reality. In transpersonal consciousness, the first Death-Rebirth experience takes place at the interface of our time-space consciousness and the beginnings of spiritual consciousness, and it's usually referred to as ego death. It is the complete destruction of our personal time-space identity and the beginning of an opening into spiritual reality.

But if we continue this process—if we press deeper and deeper into spiritual reality—we go through more deaths, more cycles of death and rebirth at the psychic, subtle, and causal levels of consciousness, to use terms that Stan uses. Now, I have no vested interest in a particular cosmological map that delineates the various strata of transpersonal consciousness. I'm simply making the point that as you go into deeper levels of consciousness, you come to certain gateways, and at these gateways, you must give up everything—everything you have known up to this point in your journey—in order to enter into the new fields of consciousness that are beginning to open to you.

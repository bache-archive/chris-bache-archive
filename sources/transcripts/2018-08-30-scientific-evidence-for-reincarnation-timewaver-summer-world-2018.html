<p>Chris Bache: 
The good news is that after me, it's lunch—so I'm the end of your day. Now, I'm a professor, and I've been at this game for a long time, so I know a tired audience when I see one. It's been a long morning, full of wonderful ideas. So let’s take a moment—everybody, stand up, stretch your arms, and bring in some good energy. Okay, now sit down.</p>
<p>If the most important philosophical question one can ask is, "Do we survive the death of our body?"—which Dr. Van Lommel is addressing—I think the second most important question is, "Do we live once, or do we live more than once?" And it all hinges on time. As a teacher, if I give a quiz, I have a right to expect a certain level of performance from my students. If I give an hour-long exam, I expect more. And if I assign a take-home research paper, I expect the highest level, because they have more time. If this magnificent universe has a purpose, then as a philosopher, we have to measure that purpose in proportion to the time we're given. If we live only once, we might extrapolate or estimate the purpose of existence to be limited. But if we live a hundred times, or a thousand times, or if our participation in this universe is truly open-ended, then our relationship with the universe changes, and the possible purpose of existence unfolds in a completely different framework.</p>
<p>Religions in the last 4,000 years have tended not to value physical existence. They say you achieve realization or enlightenment—then you leave, you escape Samsara, you attain Moksha or salvation, and move on. But that leaves the fundamental question unanswered: What is the purpose of the universe? What is the purpose of our physical existence here? If we return, if we come back to this life many times, then a different story begins to unfold. I think our understanding of reincarnation is extremely incomplete at this point—just as we've only begun to understand the true depth and breadth of the universe itself. When we see that we may dance with this universe for an extended period, we gain a deeper understanding of what the universe might be trying to accomplish in us, and what our gift to the universe might be, especially through the continual refinement and compounding of our talents over time.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to talk about the evidence for reincarnation. I’ve been thinking about this topic for a long time. In fact, the first book I wrote—as an academic—was “Life Cycles,” which signals how important this subject is to me. I believe there is valid, critical, empirical evidence that allows us to approach this question. If such evidence didn’t exist, it would just be a fruitless exercise. This kind of evidence didn’t exist fifty years ago, when theologians would endlessly debate the reality of reincarnation. Today, however, we have a new body of empirical evidence that has shifted this topic from the theologian’s table, to the psychologist’s, the philosopher’s, and even the psychiatrist’s table. That’s what I’d like to explore with you today.</p>
<p>Looking at the evidence for reincarnation, we can approach it by going “small” or “large”—either focusing on detailed, individual cases, or looking at the broader body of literature. The real joy is in the details, but given the time constraints, I’ll be taking a big-picture view. What I genuinely hope is that you’ll be inspired to read a new book on reincarnation—a book you haven’t yet read. So, let’s look at some of the literature and emerging patterns in studies of rebirth.</p>
<p>Ready? Let’s start with “Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation” by Ian Stevenson. This is a book that changed my life. Like many, when I finished graduate school in 1978, I was an atheistically inclined agnostic—trained in philosophy of religion, yet all that training left me an atheist. But when I encountered Stevenson’s work just after grad school, it turned my life around. He convinced me that there was evidence that we live more than once.</p>
<p>Stevenson was the Carlson Professor at the University of Virginia from 1967 to 2001 and wrote eleven books on reincarnation. Some of his most important works include detailed case studies written between 1973 and 1984, “Unlearned Language,” about children who could speak languages never spoken by their family or town, sometimes even ancient languages, and “Children Who Remember Previous Lives.” His last book, his magnum opus, is a thousand-page, two-volume study of 187 cases in which children not only remember details from previous lives but also carry physical scars corresponding to the death wounds of their former personalities. This, of course, really upsets academics. It’s one thing to have continuity of memory—that’s challenging enough—but to suggest that death wounds can transfer to the physical body of a new personality drives my colleagues up the wall. Yet, 187 well-documented cases exist—a magnificent collection.</p>
<p>What are we looking at in Stevenson’s work? Cases from around the world in which young children recall their most immediate prior lives in detail. They know their way around towns they’ve never visited. They recognize people when introduced to communities where the former personality lived, even though they've never met them before. They know personal histories and have appropriate emotional responses—there are cases, for example, of a five-year-old child exhibiting all the feelings of a husband toward a 35-year-old woman, including the right emotional responses.</p>
<p>One compelling case is that of a child named Parmod. When Parmod was reunited with the family of his previous personality, he was initially shy with the wife of that personality—he wouldn’t identify her until she left the room. Later, he took her aside and said, “I’ve come, but you have not fixed bindi,” referring to the symbolic mark Indian women wear to indicate marriage. He also criticized her for wearing a white sari instead of a colorful one; in India, a widow wears only white. Essentially, a five-year-old boy was telling a 35-year-old woman, “I’ve come back, but you’re acting like you’re not married.”</p>
<p>These children sometimes know the inner architecture of homes they've never been in and can identify places where items like wills were hidden—information only the previous person could have known. Such cases drive university philosophers up a wall; it’s difficult for them to deny, though they struggle with what to do with it.</p>
<p>Looking at patterns in the data, the average interval between the death of the first personality and the birth of the second is about two and a half years. The average distance between the life place of the first and second personality is about fifty miles. These children tend to lose their memories around age eight, when school and social complexity increase; most forget entirely by eight, and those who don’t typically lose the memories at puberty.</p>
<p>Stevenson asked, why do these children remember what most of us forget? He doesn't know—more research is needed. His hypothesis is that about 60% of these children died violently in their previous lives, and the remaining 40% died suddenly or with acute unfinished business, as in the case of a mother dying shortly after childbirth. Perhaps the trauma of sudden or violent death encodes consciousness in a way that draws these children back faster and closer than usual. The two-and-a-half years and fifty-mile average are faster and closer than expected for the population at large.</p>
<p>Reviewing Stevenson's "Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation," the Journal of the American Medical Association wrote that Stevenson has “painstakingly and unemotionally collected a detailed series of cases in which the evidence for reincarnation is difficult to understand on other grounds.” Two years later, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease published an entire issue devoted to Stevenson’s cases and, in a special editorial, justified their decision, acknowledging the legitimacy of his research methods and reasoning. That’s as close as academics get to endorsement.</p>
<p>Of course, the philosophical establishment—the guardians of orthodoxy—weren’t going to let Stevenson get away with this unchallenged. His most important critic was Paul Edwards, a major American philosopher and editor-in-chief of the eight-volume Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Edwards wrote a four-part article on reincarnation from 1986–87, later published as “Reincarnation: A Critical Examination.” He harshly accused Stevenson of fraud and insufficient rigor, suggesting that Stevenson failed to rule out possible contact between the involved families and did not properly verify his data.</p>
<p>But to accuse someone of bad research and to prove it are different things. If you look carefully at Edwards’ arguments, there’s a deeper logic at play. He says reincarnation would be a crucifixion of our scientific and philosophical understanding—which, for him, means secular humanism, Newtonian and Cartesian traditions. He claims that belief in reincarnation requires what he calls “six collateral assumptions”: that materialism is false, that mind is not reducible to brain, that identity goes beyond personality, that there’s a domain beyond space and time, that death is an illusion, and that there may be a deeper logic to life. Edwards says these assumptions are “fantastic, if not indeed nonsense,” and concludes that even in the absence of specific flaws, a rational person must assume Stevenson’s reports are seriously defective or at least explainable without reincarnation.</p>
<p>I won’t go further into Edwards’ arguments—Robert Almeder has done this for us. Almeder, a major American philosopher and Professor Emeritus at Georgia State University, wrote a book evaluating five categories of evidence for survival after death, focusing extensively on the debate between Stevenson and Edwards. Almeder argues that Edwards doesn’t so much refute Stevenson as refuse to look at the evidence seriously because he’s convinced it must be false. Almeder calls this blatant question-begging: what’s at issue is whether consciousness can exist without a brain, but because Edwards believes science has “proven” it cannot, he dismisses the evidence. Almeder states that if there's a powerful argument you cannot refute, to not accept it is irrational.</p>
<p>Stevenson's tradition continues, even though he’s passed on. He’s now “watching from the bleacher seats,” so to speak. Tom Schroder's book “Old Souls”—which, by the way, wins for worst cover in reincarnation research—is intriguing. Schroder is a Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter and Washington Post editor who wanted to see if Stevenson’s research could withstand a reporter’s scrutiny. He accompanied Stevenson on his travels and came away convinced by both Stevenson's methods and the reality of the cases, as his subtitle says: "Compelling Evidence from Children Who Remember Past Lives." Stevenson's work is also carried on at the University of Virginia by Jim Tucker, who inherited Stevenson’s chair. Tucker's book, very much in Stevenson’s tradition, details these cases and explains why they cannot be attributed to weaker hypotheses, such as super-psi. Incidentally, Tucker’s book is much easier to read—Stevenson wrote like a lawyer: thorough but very dry. Tucker brings more life to the topic.</p>
<p>All the evidence I’ve discussed so far pertains to spontaneous memories—children who remember previous lives without prompting. But there’s another body of evidence involving memories evoked by particular techniques, such as massage or, most commonly, hypnosis. The following are representative works in the field of past-life therapy. My favorite, written by a single therapist who has given thought to the subject, is a book by Roger Woolger. His earlier book, “Other Lives, Other Selves,” traces his journey from Jungian analysis into past-life therapy, despite Jung’s own quiet belief in reincarnation later in life. Woolger’s book is intellectually robust, offering detailed case reviews and a discussion of implications.</p>
<p>Past-life therapy really began to flourish in the 1970s and 1980s. Many therapists were concerned by the lack of a unified curriculum or agreed credentials for practicing past-life therapy. This challenge was taken up by Winifred Lucas, who compiled a magnificent two-volume anthology—“Regression Therapy: A Handbook for Professionals”—which gathers the most important essays and articles from leading figures in past-life therapy. So, if you want a recommended single-author book, I suggest Woolger; if you want an overview of multiple contributors, Lucas’ handbook is ideal.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Carol Bowman was a social worker. She wasn't initially interested in past life therapy, but her journey began when her son started having disturbing nightmares. She tried the conventional routes—therapy, working with him directly—but nothing helped. So she decided to do her homework, began learning about past life therapy, and was eventually able to help her own child work through trauma that seemed to be carried over from a previous life. As word spread, she began to attract other parents whose children were having similar difficult memories. Eventually, she wrote a remarkable book, specifically aimed at helping parents navigate traumatic memories surfacing in their children. That book was very successful and influential; it brought her more recognition, leading her to write a second book—although she does get my award for the second worst reincarnation book title: <em>Return from Heaven</em>. In this book, she explored cases where relatives appeared to have reincarnated within their own families. </p>
<p>Now, as a philosopher, I think that's a weaker body of evidence, because there's so much potential for contamination if someone claims to remember being their own grandfather, for example. But as a father, it's intriguing. Reincarnation doesn't only happen where researchers find it convenient—across great distances and between unrelated families; it frequently occurs within families, and that deserves more study.</p>
<p>Next up is Michael Newton. He wrote two wonderful books, and I have to confess a special partiality for his work. If you were to pick just one or two titles to read from all I've mentioned, I would hope you'd consider Michael Newton's books. He was a hypnotherapist doing past life therapy when he accidentally discovered something unexpected: his clients, under deep hypnosis, could not only recall previous lives but also describe what happened to them after they died. The afterlife. As a good therapist, he followed their accounts, even though he hadn't thought this was possible. For hundreds of clients, he conducted deep hypnotic regressions, guiding them through their former lives, their death experiences, and continued their journeys into the afterlife, asking them about what they perceived.</p>
<p>What he found was striking: regardless of background—be it fundamentalist Baptist, Marxist atheist, or hard-core scientific reductionist—people described the same fundamental after-death reality. They spoke about a world with order, structure, and even social organization. Older souls taught younger ones. And, crucially, reincarnation was portrayed as a conscious, careful decision—like choosing which courses to take if you go to college, fully aware of the commitment involved. The choice of what life to incarnate into is made consciously, with guidance from spiritual helpers, and coordination with others you'll be incarnating with. So, before we’re born, when our awareness is greater than it is now, each of us chooses the life we’re living. That fact alone is worthy of deep meditation.</p>
<p>Two more examples, this time from amateurs—but that's what makes them especially interesting. The first is the book <em>Looking for Carroll Beckwith</em>. Its author, Robert Snow, was the commander of the homicide division of the Indianapolis Police Department—a chief of detectives responsible for cases that must stand up in court. The last person you'd expect to do reincarnation research. But he found himself, almost on a whim, undertaking a hypnotic session that unexpectedly plunged him into vivid recall of what felt like a previous life. It rattled him so much that he ran out of the room. But curiosity prevailed, and he pursued it systematically, using all his detective skills to see if he could identify whether the "previous" person really existed. The result is chronicled in his book.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s <em>Soul Survivor</em>, written by Bruce and Andrea Leininger about their son, James. As a toddler, James began waking up at night, traumatized by spontaneous memories of dying as a pilot in World War II over Japan. His father was a fundamentalist Baptist and strongly opposed to the idea of reincarnation, wanting instead to disprove it to protect his faith. But as James’s memories grew more detailed, his parents began to investigate. Ultimately, they tracked down the specifics of the pilot’s case and even reunited James with members of this pilot’s old squadron. James was able to identify people from photographs. In the end, even his father became convinced: his son was, in fact, the reincarnation of this pilot, and reincarnation was real.</p>
<p>Now, let me close with two quick observations as lunch awaits. First, let’s be clear about what we don’t know about reincarnation. The evidence for it may be compelling, but we know very little about how reincarnation actually takes place—the "physics" of rebirth, so to speak. We don't yet know what the soul is or what it's made of, how it comes and goes from the body, how it interfaces with genetics, or how it encodes and transmits learning from one life to the next. Right now, these matters are beyond our grasp. I'm sure progress will come, but first, we’ll need to stop reducing mind to brain and start approaching this research with a more multidimensional, metaphysical cosmology.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’d like to draw attention to a certain paradox in this evidence, and here I’ll return to Ian Stevenson. I consider Stevenson’s evidence the strongest for reincarnation; it both frees and restricts our thinking. The most compelling cases he documented are those with the tightest, most immediate connections—but these can also lead to a rather narrow view of what life after death is like. We have to remember that the children in his studies come back very fast and close to home. Most people, however, spend far more "time" in the timeless condition of the spirit world, gathering a wider range of experience. Stevenson’s work opens minds to questions about the soul and our existence on a grand scale, but to fully explore what happens after we die and what the complete cycle of life looks like—from expanded consciousness to contraction and back—we need to explore other bodies of data as well. Michael Newton’s work offers one such vision, and this afternoon, as I discuss psychedelic research, I’ll present other data I believe can expand our understanding of life in this universe. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Interviewer: 
Chris, thank you so much. Listening to you is truly an experience, and I appreciate how you clarify that this kind of knowledge can fundamentally shape the way we live—how we approach each minute of life. Whether or not this is true, it makes all the difference. I think all three speakers in this session fit together so well—it’s almost as if it was arranged, and really gets at the core of the Institute for Existential Consciousness. These are existential questions, and there’s a scientific basis that needs to be brought to society to shift our consciousness. Thank you again, and I’m very much looking forward to your next lecture.</p>

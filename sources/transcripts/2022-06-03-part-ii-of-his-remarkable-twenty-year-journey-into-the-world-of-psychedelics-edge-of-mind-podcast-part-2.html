      <p>Andrew Holecek 
Welcome, everybody, to our ongoing Edge of Mind Podcast, where I have the great honor and delight to spend a little more time with this remarkable thinker, psychonaut, explorer of the mind and heart, Christopher Bache, and continue to unpack some of the many aspects of his remarkable journey that we introduced in round one. I’ll reiterate a very brief bio of Chris, and then we’ll jump right in and venture into some rich, deep waters. Christopher Bache is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years, a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. He was also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies and on the advisory board for Grof Transpersonal Training and the Grof Foundation, an award-winning teacher and international speaker, author of three books, and lives in Portland. You’re still in Portland, right?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Actually, we’re in Weaverville, North Carolina now.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
I’m glad I asked. So Chris, thank you again for taking time to return and unfold with me some of the remarkable implications of your journey. At the outset, deep gratitude to you.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It’s a pleasure to be with you today, Andrew. Thank you for the invitation.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
I deeply appreciate it. I was rereading some of the material, especially the latter chapters in your journey—LSD and the Mind of the Universe is mostly what we’ll be unfolding, but also conjoined with The Living Classroom, because there’s some wonderful interconnectivity between those narratives. I want to introduce a topic very near and dear to my heart—so much so that I’m writing one book on it, and probably two. We pinged on this a bit in our first session, but I want to explore it in more detail now. Using your languaging, this narrative of openness and contraction has become, for me, the combustion cycle of the spiritual path. I thought we could start there as a way to reiterate the entirety of your journey within this session—start with that narrative and expand into deeper dimensions, as your twenty-year journey and its aftermath took you. I love these terms in a somatic sense, because openness and contraction are things we can feel, not just cerebral storylines. I’d like to dive into that with you as we set our direction toward what I consider to be the climax of your book—the Diamond Luminosity. Because that light is so bright, that space so open, perhaps we can dilate the aperture more slowly and start by asking how your journey could be articulated in this pulsation. The Hindus talk about it as spanda, the doctrine of vibration—openness, contraction, openness, contraction. Maybe we could start there and let it lead us into wider and wider degrees of openness.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
You bet—that’s a good place to start. In my understanding and experience, psychedelics in general, and LSD in particular—my primary medicine—are amplifiers of consciousness. When consciousness is amplified, signals that are quiet get loud, and you become aware of more and more. How you meet that increase of awareness—how you engage what emerges—is seminal. If you engage the shadow consciously, you confront the things that keep you habitually contracted and small. You take those fears, or whatever they are, to their source. They resolve themselves, and when they do, your consciousness is free to open into more spacious places. Every time you let go of something that holds your consciousness in a fixed pattern—particularly your time-space identity, your historical egoic identity that tells you who you are—you discover dimensions beyond that identity that are even more truly what you are.</p>
<p>If you keep going, you pass through multiple layers of consciousness. There’s a point where you have to surrender or die, not only to your individual identity, but to your identity as a human being. There’s a deeper sense of humanity that holds the limits of your knowing, and then you go deeper still. You let go of time-space identity and your entire existence, including reincarnational experiences of time and space as a framework. Your experience flows beyond time and space—and this is an entirely natural process. My broader conjecture is that a psychedelic session accelerates and intensifies what is taking place in nature all the time. When we are born, our consciousness contracts into an individual, egoic, time-space identity. When we die, we expand—back into the soul, into deeper spiritual awareness. Birth is contraction; death is expansion. A session accelerates and intensifies that natural process, allowing you to burn off more karma than one might otherwise. The same dynamic is present in meditation.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
My favorite running definition of meditation these days is habituation to openness. There are so many implications to that. Etymologically, the Buddha is usually translated as the awakened one, but I’ve also heard the opened one. That resonates because, by contrast, we’re the contracted ones. Bringing this process and its phenomenology into the light of conscious awareness helps us sensitize to it somatically. This is something we can feel in our very soma.</p>
<p>Two questions, Chris. First, how early in your journey did this become apparent? Where did this narrative become identifiable for you, and how did it help as you went further? Second, as you suggested at the outset, we’re practicing this whether we know it or not. We’re either habituating to openness, or—by default—we’re practicing contraction every time we capitulate to grasping, beliefs, a solid self-sense. After decades, when I look back, my whole journey has been this pulsation: opening, expanding, metabolizing, contracting. A little more around that.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It actually started in the very first session. I hit an experience where I couldn’t remember anything about myself—who I was, what I did for a living, whether I was a man or a woman. I was absolutely jammed. I looked in a thousand mirrors and couldn’t find any piece of individual egoic identity. It was jarring—frightening in the beginning—and later in the session my sense of identity returned. That experience was really important. It gave me an insight into the dynamic. It shook me up and showed me the true cost, because I had read about ego death and thought, “Oh good, let’s do it,” without appreciating that this is a true death—a loss of your identity. It taught me the art of letting go and surrender, because if you can’t control your self-identity—and that’s as basic as it gets—then later, when the ante kept increasing, I knew the key to navigating whatever was coming was to surrender and let go, not to hold on to something familiar.</p>
<p>It escalated from there. About two and a half years later, my individual egoic identity was turned inside out and crushed. I went through a collapse of that smaller state and a rebirth into a deeper state. Then, after spending two years in the ocean of suffering—surrounded by the historical suffering of humanity and unfinished, painful memories—there was a death process that catapulted me into a deeper level of reality, beyond the collective unconscious, into archetypal consciousness. This pattern kept repeating. The texture of openness differs—the context, the purity. There’s a lot of light, engaging fields of light, but light itself has gradients—levels of purity and clarity. The content of openness changes as the work deepens, but the phenomenon of opening into something larger remains.</p>
<p>I want to qualify the language. In certain stages—what I’d call the psychic and subtle levels of consciousness—the sensation is often of getting larger. Later in the journey, this reversed. I was experiencing huge fields of light contracting into the present and exploding me into a different state of consciousness. Everything was contracting—deeper and deeper into the present—until you drop into a very different experience of the present. It made me wonder whether calling psychedelics “mind openers” is incomplete. At another level, they’re mind contractors, drawing you deeper into the present. So yes—openness is multivalent. There are different modalities.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Exactly—it’s a multivalent term. That contraction into the present moment is very interesting. In the language I’m familiar with, Padmasambhava talked about the “fourth moment,” which one can only access through the conduit of the present moment. You contract—condense—into the portal, and the present becomes the portico into the timeless beyond. You arrive at the present, and then it “blows up,” so to speak, into the fourth moment, which transcends even the present moment. I think that’s helpful, because language is dualistic and becomes problematic at this depth. In the Buddhist tradition, one is invited to be incredibly precise about context. So yes, it’s about opening, but it’s also about honoring contraction and how it can lead to that opening.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Your mention of Padmasambhava gives me an opportunity to emphasize that I’m grateful for the correlations between my experiences and those recorded by the great contemplatives. But the path I was on is not the contemplative path. It’s a path of temporary immersion. When I’m describing things, it always has to be understood that these are temporary experiences. We can talk about unpacking their spiritual potential, but it’s not the same as coming into these experiences via the “slow-bake” method of sustained contemplation. I want to keep apples and oranges separate, because many people think, “I’ve had a tremendous revelatory enlightenment experience,” and—well, good for you—but that’s a temporary experience.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Unbelievably important. An enlightened experience does not make one an enlightened being. In Tibetan language there’s a difference between experience and realization; experience always has a beginning and an end. The path is to mature that. Just to be sure I’m understanding: when you’re talking about deeper states, are you saying a deeper state is somewhat synonymous with a more open state—waking and expanding—and that it points to how we construct the self moment to moment? We tend to think the ego is a monolithic, reified entity, whereas it’s a process, not a product. Through deconstruction—this demolition derby—you can see the construction process and how we’re responsible for the way we contract, largely for protection and fear. Is that a fair representation?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It is, and that description fits better in the early stages, when you’re working at insights that help you understand your individual way of being in the world. I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality. The invitation I was given was to explore how time and space are made. I often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics—I could have understood so much more of what I was being shown. The universe can only communicate to you what you have the capacity to understand.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Fantastic. Toward the end of your book, when you were wrestling with integration, you dis-integrated—opened, opened, opened—and then needed to ingest, digest, metabolize. My read is that you opened to such an extent that the issue became digestion. Sometimes, when we look at psychosis—and you were treading that thin membrane between transcendence and psychosis, the loss of self—the issue of integration looms large. Psychosis can be, in a way, an eating disorder: you open so much that you don’t have the infrastructure to digest and metabolize, and instead of opening body-mind, you blow body-mind. That’s one way to talk about the risks of deep diving.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I understand, and you’re right that this work carries risks and has to be approached cautiously, with support structures and careful self-monitoring. I understand the relationship between psychosis and transcendence. I think it was Huston Smith who said a mystic learns how to swim in vast waters and a psychotic drowns—</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Actually, R. D. Laing, yeah.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
In my case, I understand the psychotic-looking qualities of loss of self, but I wouldn’t describe my experiences as walking that edge. If I had found myself there, I would have changed course. My experience was that, by working in a very careful, clinical modality and opening systematically, the universe opened me systematically—beyond my calculation—but very carefully. It peeled me, broke me open layer by layer. If it had catapulted me beyond so quickly, then I could have had problems integrating. But I always opened and I always congealed comfortably and carefully. If I hadn’t, that would have given me pause—that’s a symptom of something going wrong. It’s not the depth of loss of self that marks the psychotic episode; it has to do with confusion as well. You have to walk these waters carefully.</p>
<p>I seem to have a natural constitution. I didn’t come from a traumatized background—just the ordinary pains of growing up. I had a fundamentally strong core self, and an innate capacity and interest—reflected even in my natal chart—to open into the vast expanse of consciousness and to contract back. If you don’t have that natural capacity, or you’re bringing disruptive trauma or other qualities in your person, then this work may not be for you.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
As Jack Engler famously said, you have to be someone before you can be no one. The ego itself is fundamentally non-problematic; it’s a developmental stage. Without a stable self-sense, instead of dis-differentiating, you dissociate, and that becomes problematic. Toward the end of your book—what dictated stopping after the 73rd journey—was, to me, one of the most electrifying parts. It was as if your body-mind matrix had become so open—and this is important, the tantric understanding that body is as important as mind—that when you open the mind you open the body, and the winds come through. If those winds aren’t ridden properly, they can throw you. If I understand you, your system was running too hot—so much energy, so much release. My cup runneth over. I have enough experience to spend the rest of this life, and other lives, digesting this feast. Isn’t that a fair recapitulation—that you stopped the feast because there was too much to eat?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I think that’s fair. In my case, it’s not that I didn’t ride the winds successfully—I think I did—but I rode them too long. They stretched me so wide and so deep. In the early stages of psychedelic use—individually and culturally—we get excited by contact with transcendent dimensions. It’s liberating, and intellectually opening to the intelligence that lives in the universe and is the universe. Our theological and even contemplative traditions, at the very highest levels, tend to underestimate the dimensions of the Divine, the dimensions of the universe. That leads us to underestimate how vast the world is that we can open into. Psychedelics can open us deeply, even when used skillfully and responsibly. They opened me into such intimacy with the universe—transcending time and space—that, even though I contracted back, the memory and beauty of the communion were so dear, so intense, that I couldn’t take returning and coming back. I just couldn’t do it anymore.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
You couldn’t go to the train station and leave your lover one more time.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Right. I had to stay here and let her come to me in whatever form was possible without going into a non-ordinary state—just digesting. I picked up a lifetime and more of experiences to digest.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Let me ask you this—and I hope it’s okay to be this intimate. In a way, when I look back over my own life, it’s become more articulate in recent years: my entire life has been learning how to prepare to die. That journey has actually brought me more fully into life than I could have imagined. I have a deep fascination with death, dying, thanatology. The whole spiritual path is death in slow motion—opening, titrating, opening on our terms. What you share at the end is beautiful: in a certain way, you couldn’t wait to die, to return to your beloved. What do you expect will happen, and why do you think you’ll be more prepared for her ultimate embrace with the dissolution of your body at the moment of death than you are now? Are you perhaps kidding yourself? What is the intuition or felt sense that says, “I can’t wait to dissolve into the embrace of the beloved at the moment of death,” and why do you think you’ll handle that any differently than you can now?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I don’t think I would handle it differently at the moment of my final death, whenever that takes place, than I could handle it now. If I were to die right now, the training I went through in my psychedelic work— and it is, as you say, a training to die—actually becomes a training in how to live. There are two realities in the world: the domain of light, which I think of as pure light, and the “green reality,” the manifest physical world that we’re part of—nirmanakaya. So there’s Dharmakaya and nirmanakaya, interpenetrating, the same reality experienced in different modalities. What we experience as death is really just a moment of intersection between these realities. As you awaken, you awaken into the fact of their constant intersection, their constant simultaneity. What happens when we die physically and what happens when we die spiritually are deeply one and the same.</p>
<p>In my sessions I was taken into my own death process multiple times. I can’t count how many times I died, but I have a sense I know the pathway well. I’ve read the literature about the Bardo confusions that can distract us and prevent us from returning fully to Dharmakaya when we die, and I recognize that. I may be wrong—we’ll find out on the final exam—but I have a sense that death will be not only joyful, as it is for everybody, but easy, because I don’t feel a deep clinging to my personal identity, to human existence, or to time-space. All spiritual practice—and I try to do psychedelic practice as a spiritual practice, which is why I call them sessions—is preparing you for that moment of death. If everything goes well, you get to die before you die. Remember the words: “Those who die before they die do not die when they die.” What would be lovely, if I could experience what I think of as full liberation, would be if She came to me while I was still in my body and I got to live in the death state while alive in the physical state.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Beautiful—and this is so important. This view alone can irrevocably, radically alter our relationship to the end of life and transition. And by the way, we should make a deal with each other. When I was reading your book, I thought both “psychedelic” and “death” are branding issues. We need to rebrand these terms. You should replace psychedelic with entheogen. I’m going to try to replace death and dying with transition, because “death” seems so final and monolithic. But it’s not. What did Marie Curie say so beautifully? “Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood.” What we’re doing here is tremendous understanding. I want to talk about this because it’s so important.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Before we go to the next topic, let me respond to something you said. One of the things I write about in the Diamond Luminosity chapter is that once you’ve died so many times and at so many levels of consciousness, the very concept of death loses its meaning because you learn you cannot die. The form you are can die; all your understandings and history can die, but you cannot die. In that chapter, when I made my first transition into the Diamond Luminosity, I called it the death state. The “song of realization” in that chapter was the death state. The death state is the awakened state. It is the reality state.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Exactly the question I was going to ask. When you went through these repetitive openings, releases, and deaths, it became easier. You became more familiar with it—the very Tibetan word for meditation is “to become familiar with.” Because we don’t understand it, we fear it. As you die over and over, you befriend it, and realize this natural openness is only fearful to the ego structure we’re exclusively identified with. It becomes easier the more frequently you die in meditation or these sessions, until, like His Holiness the Karmapa said two days before he died, “Nothing happens.” To get to the point of saying, with utter conviction, “Nothing happens”—unbelievable.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Death becomes your best friend. Truly. In practice, you’re always looking for your best friend. I want to qualify this with the unusual scope of my work. The hardest strip-down I went through in any session—the most extreme destruction—was in the 70th session, the last major vision I was given. Earlier, I had gone through so many deaths and they do get easier; you look forward to them and embrace them. Yet beside that, there was this phenomenon where the transition was not easy. I didn’t resist it; I gave into it, but it was extremely radical. The consciousness guiding my session was taking me into a state deeper into deep time than ever before, giving me a culminating series of teachings that required an unusually large canvas. It had nothing to do with personal enlightenment or personal ego death. We always have to contextualize our observations in terms of the level of consciousness we’re working with. In general, you’re absolutely right: the more you die, the more comfortable you get with it. And to be able to say, as the Karmapa did, “Nothing happens,” is to be in a cherished state.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
If we truly understand the contraction–openness narrative, when we die it’s the ultimate grand opening. These are miniature openings we become familiar with in meditation. How much of the path is letting go of identification with thought and body, with form? It’s death in slow motion. Near the end of life, as you said, it’s a reversal of our normal fear. Instead of going into the bardos looking through the rearview mirror, we now have something to look forward to—the big unwind, the final exhalation, the final openness, which is fundamentally ecstatic, a release into the beloved. I love your language of returning to the Beloved. If we know we’re going to the embrace of the Beloved—the cosmic mother—that changes everything. Then you die with a smile on your face instead of kicking and screaming. This, in my opinion, cannot be overstated. It radically changes how we relate to old age and sickness. As this apparatus starts to crumble, instead of “Oh crap,” it’s “Oh wow.”</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It’s the wonderful joy and mercy of life that it can’t stop you from dying. The older you get, the closer you get to joy and ecstasy. Cryogenics—the attempt not to die, to freeze the body—feels terribly sad. I taught near-death episode research for years, along with reincarnation research. Over and over, when students went through this literature and saw how lives were totally changed—how people’s relationship to death was transformed by a temporary experience of what’s on the other side, of encountering the beloved in their own form of the beloved—it permanently softened their fear and changed their expectations. Death research is really powerful psycho-spiritual work.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
I couldn’t agree more. The work of Bruce Greyson, Eben Alexander, and others who come back with remarkable stories—this is worth reinstating. I’ve never had an official NDE, but I’ve had what I call meditative NDEs. You don’t have to have these over and over for them to change your life. You just need one, because they’re so true, so real, that one can completely change the texture of your life. As you know, these agents are now used to remove fear of death in people who are terrified—one session can open you to the point where the fear is done and over with. That’s no small thing.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
People say, “How do you know whether what you experienced was real? Maybe it was a hallucination or self-fulfilling prophecy.” No. You know what reality feels like, and this is more real than the physical real. It is hyper-reality. Its objectivity is unmistakable. You don’t have to quibble, argue, or question—it’s obviously true.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Returning to contraction and openness: it’s the ego’s inability to digest and metabolize that openness that contracts against it—a reducing valve. I love Huxley’s “brain as reducing valve.” On one level we need it; we don’t have the capacity to be developmentally that open, so we need reduction to survive. But growth is reducing the reducing valve—continuing to open until we become ultimate openness, in that sense becoming the cosmos itself. This ties into what we talked about last time: in order to become one with the universe, we first need to become one with the self. You could say they’re the same. Can you say a little more about how that played out in your experience? Because when we die, we become nothing and simultaneously everything.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
The experience was to become one with all of existence—to become one with God, with the universe, with the One. We can’t do that if we’re not one within ourselves—if we have unintegrated shadow, ego fragments, untouchable wounds. When you move into intimacy with life, life brings these unintegrated pieces to the surface so you can make peace with them, reabsorb them, and become whole and coherent within your own being. How could you become one with life if you’re not one with yourself? These things develop synergistically: the deeper your experience of oneness with life, the deeper your experience of oneness with yourself, until these divisions disappear inside. One of the wonderful qualities we appreciate about awakened beings is their integrity, their oneness, their deep relaxation within themselves, which grows out of their intimacy with life itself.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Isn’t it fantastic how this reiterates the process of reiteration itself? By learning to embrace ourselves—practical maitri, loving-kindness—befriending every aspect of our usually disenfranchised being, the parts we reject and throw into the unconscious, we transform the shadow. Without this framework, we spend our lives in sophisticated avoidance strategies. With this view, we say yes: befriend every aspect of your being. Like with death, this radically changes how we relate to the unwanted parts of our spectrum right here and now. We learn to open and say yes to whatever arises, and that integration—the integrity we feel—leads to fundamental integration with the so-called outside world.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
One of the last pieces, well recognized in the spiritual traditions, is the importance of giving up private enlightenment, because that’s just spiritual shadow. Everything you do for others is part of your awakening, and everything you do for yourself—including trying to become enlightened—gets in your way.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
This brings the social nexus of the path into play, which I love in your book. We tend to think—provisionally—that we start at home, clean up our stuff. But the near enemy is becoming myopic. I speak from my path: I’m happiest down in my study, writing and on retreat. But my long retreat was by design with others. You can’t wake up without others; the “we” becomes your path—the social, cultural aspect. Otherwise the solitary path can be a real trap. In the narrative of opening, we work with the people who press our buttons—we installed those buttons. This morning I had a little run-in with the guy who cuts my lawn. I watched it closely. I capitulated to my habit patterns—oh, crap, there it was again. Then stepping away, I said, “Oh my gosh, that was Padmasambhava teaching me patience.” Coming out of my three-year retreat, my aspiration is lifetime retreat with the view that the annoying (that’s my projection) aspects of reality are my path. There’s tremendous power in tradition, but also colossal enemies—like thinking we can only practice when conditions are right. As the world goes to crap, it’s even more helpful to bring this view to unwanted experiences and realize they are our path. Anyway, it’s like I’m interviewing you. With your permission, I want to transition to what I found a dazzling section in your book: the light, the Diamond Luminosity. You mentioned this phenomenon of light early on. Among the most profound aspects of the whole shebang. Can you walk us through your exploration of this light and how it worked with you on the path—this fundamental matrix of reality?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
This transition took place 15 years into my work. I had already gone through ego death; I’d gone through the ocean of collective suffering; I’d navigated archetypal reality—both Platonic archetypes and the tissue of our species mind, the tissue of the human psyche—and then was taken into a year of incredible blessings: experiences of oneness, shunyata, emptiness of self, cosmic love, primal void. I felt profoundly existentially complete. I had been asked to give something in the ocean-of-suffering work, and I gave it, and the universe rewarded me with a cascade of blessings that left me feeling profoundly complete. I had been given a deep experience and new understanding of reincarnation that transcended classical Eastern understandings. I had been taken into the birth of the diamond soul. I had many visionary experiences of where humanity was going—the future human.</p>
<p>Along the way I had experienced light many times in different modalities. Then I went through yet one more very intense death process, which took an entire session. In the next session I immediately entered the fruition portion: I was taken into light beyond any I had experienced before. I dissolved into a luminosity that was absolutely spellbinding and intoxicating. In my notes, I called it the death state because I entered it in a form of dying—an ultimate dying. At a key point, I was surrounded by a swirling disc that contained all the moments of my life. I would fall from the center into the circle, touch some aspect of my life, instantly die into the luminosity, then be brought back to the center and fall in a different direction, touching a different set of experiences—and instantly be taken into the death state. This happened over and over until eventually there was no going and coming—just a session-long abiding in this transcendent luminosity.</p>
<p>You could call it ecstasy, and it was, but different from earlier ecstasies. Its most striking characteristic was clarity—clarity, clarity, clarity. It was the context within which all thinking and feeling took place; in itself it was hyper-clear, breathtakingly clear. I understood the teachings that even touching something like this for one second dissolves thousands of years of wandering in the shadows of samsara. I came to understand it as extra-samsaric reality, and a particularly intense version of it. At first I thought of it in terms of sambhagaya because of the extreme bliss, but as I went back to the sources and studied more carefully, I associated it with Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality.</p>
<p>In the next session, of course all I wanted was to get back there. I wasn’t taken back for another year and five more sessions—very intense purification, cleansing, healing. After a year, I went into Diamond Luminosity for the second time. Over the next several years it would take about a year of very intense work, and then I would die awake again into Diamond Luminosity. The second time was the deepest. In that immersion my cosmological vision was reversed and turned upside down. I experienced a reality of light beyond Diamond Luminosity. My field pivoted; far in the distance I saw exquisitely beautiful light. A ray hit me and completely shattered me. I called it the Absolute Light—light beyond even Diamond Luminosity. In that instant I understood it’s an infinite progression. I had to give up the idea of ever coming to an end state. My spiritual tradition had taught me there were end states—reach home, become one with God, dissolve into the meta-cosmic void. With that instant I realized: no, it’s an infinite progression, and death will keep coming back as long as you keep pushing, because you’re never going to reach the end of it.</p>
<p>In the next depths of Diamond Luminosity, and the fourth and final time, I wasn’t going deeper into Diamond Luminosity; rather, it was crunching itself more deeply into my being. The lessons pivoted around that; it was dissolving the structure of my body. I could feel it crunching into my cellular makeup—very intense physical detoxification and purification. This culminated in an initiation into Buddha Nature, the pure nature of mind. I began to understand that this magnificent reality has no beginning and no end. It always is, always has been. We never step out of it; we never step into it. It is the abiding foundation of all existence—that is, in a sense, the embodied Diamond Luminosity. It’s the closest I’ve come to experiencing what Diamond Luminosity is like in the body. My other experiences were of Diamond Luminosity as extra-physical, extra-samsaric reality. This was an experience of pure light as the foundation of my very physical existence.</p>
<p>That was the last time I experienced Diamond Luminosity. From there I went through a couple of experiences, then the final vision in the 70th session, and then the consciousness guiding my work wrapped it up, gave me a last set of instructions, and sent me on my way.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
I want to take 15 seconds to pause and digest that.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I understand. I’ve been digesting it for 20 years.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
The ineffable enormity of it—there’s a dance between the mythopoetic aspect of my being, bathing in the artistry of what you shared, versus formulating references. On one level I hesitate to say anything—what can one say without watering it down? But with your understanding of Buddhist nomenclature—and the interesting synchronicity that when Diamond Luminosity was introduced to you, Vajrayana became part of your path—using that language is interesting. When you say these things, I find myself exploring my reference capacity to understand: “Oh, that sounds like Dharmadhatu.” But naming can shrink-wrap the enormity. Still, we can sit in silence or do our best with language. Would you resonate—with your understanding of the Buddhist tradition—with descriptions of analogous states like clear light mind? You’ve used Dharmakaya. Are there other Tibetan or Buddhist terms that relate to what you experienced?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes. Clear light mind, to me, is closer to the nature of mind in this context. I’m still digesting the differences between Diamond Luminosity as an extra-samsaric reality and Diamond Luminosity as the foundation of nirmanakaya existence. There are many correlations, and all honor to the great beings who have explored these dimensions more deeply than I’ve been able to—always a humble student of the great teachers. I put names as best I can to clarify, but it’s tricky—naming can shrink-wrap and stop the mystery, letting the mind back in where it doesn’t belong. So let me step into a little different framework.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
The universe is 13.7 billion years old. Our planet is about 4.5 billion years old. When we plot the evolving structure of Homo—Homo erectus, Homo sapiens, the various stages—we got the big brain, a 50% increase in brain size. About 100,000 years ago, self-awareness begins to emerge. Along the way, about 3–5,000 years ago, we began to develop the spiritual technology that allows us to concentrate the mind and enter that part of our being where we are not just the private self. We touch the life of the world; we touch that which is universal. There’s this tremendous aha, this awakened sense, and we’ve applied all sorts of names to that experience of our true, essential nature.</p>
<p>Whatever this is—and I think you and I have a pretty good sense of what it is—it is the tip of the iceberg of the intentional, exquisite unfolding of an extraordinary consciousness we might call divinity, or perhaps not call divinity. This unfolding has been gestating in creation for 13.7 billion years—and that’s only in this Big Bang. We don’t know how many other expansions and contractions of earlier universes preceded this particular explosion. I mention this to underscore the enormity and profoundness of the reality within which awakening takes place, and within which even deeper and deeper awakenings take place, as recognized by our spiritual traditions. Our spiritual traditions are only 3–5,000 years old, and that’s a lot of time for an incarnating soul to penetrate into the deeper texture of existence. But if we were to go forward in time 100,000 years—and that’s a wink of cosmic time—surely we would reasonably expect our great spiritual teachers to be having deeper experiences of the universe than our best spiritual teachers today are capable of having, because it’s an ongoing developmental process of exploring the deep mystery.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, I want to honor and affirm the categories and descriptions of the beings who have lived up to this point in time. I place my experiences at their feet, and I seek their guidance in understanding what has taken place. But just as the Absolute Light came from a reality far beyond whatever the Diamond Luminosity is, likewise evolution is continuing. We are nowhere near even 10% of human development. I would expect—and almost demand—that we expect deeper and deeper capacities for spiritual experience to continue to emerge.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we want to use the categories to help us hold, illumine, and understand; on the other, we don’t want to shrink-wrap them. We want to stay open. Staying open in this way is to stay open to a deeper intimacy with the Beloved, to stay open to the Light that is the Light that gives birth to the world, second by second.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
That’s exquisite. What comes to mind is this fundamental archetypal narrative of openness. On one level, the invitation is ideological openness. As you know, the near enemy of tradition is that, while I have tremendous allegiance and respect for tradition, if it isn’t modernized—without being edited and distorted—it can become ossified. We can reify even the tradition, and then we become closed around our ideologies and belief systems. What I hear you saying, which I really appreciate, is this ideological openness.</p>
<p>But, Chris, a question of clarity. When you use the term “extra Samsara,” that’s not in my common vocabulary. What do you mean when you talk about the Light as extra—do you mean post- or trans-Samsara? What do you mean by “extra”?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Samsara? I mean beyond the Bardo, beyond all the layers of the Bardo—beyond all Samsara—at a place where the patterns of cyclic existence have been eclipsed. My sense is that between physical reality and the rhythms of physical reality, when we die we enter into various patterns of Bardo reality, various spiritual states. There are many, many layers—thousands of layers—but one can go beyond that. What is the nature of reality that’s beyond Bardo existence? The Buddha refused to describe it—very wisely—saying, just experience it for yourself.</p>
<p>My sense is that outside of that, what happens in the upper Bardo is that the light gets brighter and brighter until you move into a world that is all light—it’s just all light. The quality of Light is different because it’s trans-Bardo. As to individualized existence—and here I have to be careful, because I, for one, do not see individuality as the enemy of spiritual awakening—when we stabilize deep spiritual awakening, our individuality is liberated, not extinguished. So I don’t want to say that in the domain of extra-Samsara luminosity there is no individuality, but it is an extraordinarily translucent, extraordinarily transparent individuality.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
I’m going to make it a practice to pause and work with my habituated reflex to fill the space after you make these amazing statements, because I want to rest in the somatic impact of what you’re sharing and not capitulate to my usual intellectual contractive predispositions. Let me ask you this: I was as surprised reading your work as you were experiencing it—the dissolution of the so-called Omega Point, that there isn’t some final destination. How do you reconcile or balance what you experience as this endless evolutionary unfolding with teachings about the changeless nature?</p>
<p>One way I’ve played with this is that emptiness—Dharmakaya—doesn’t evolve; form evolves. When the Buddhist tradition talks about Buddha-nature as changeless nature, how can something without form change and evolve? Form evolves, not emptiness. How does that land with you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I don’t feel it as a dissonance. It is a deep mystery, which I don’t pretend to fathom in any profound way. I’ll share a few pieces. On those occasions when I’ve relaxed into—fallen into, been drawn into—the unchanging condition, the reality within which everything arises and passes away, and which itself is not impacted at all, it appears to be the fertile void from within which all existence springs.</p>
<p>If we then step into the existence that springs from within this cosmic fertile emptiness, what’s happening? We look at the Big Bang, the magnificent story of the explosion of energy, the congealing into matter, the formation of galaxies and solar systems and sun-life, then the emergence of life and the emergence of self and self-awareness. Clearly, existence seems to be going somewhere, and it seems to delight in form and unfolding and complexification—in making self aware and awakening and empowering the soul, as our former life memories become conscious and we wake up to our 100,000-year identity, not just our 100-year identity.</p>
<p>Form is going somewhere, and that which is driving form is going somewhere. It’s the magnificent creativity of the universe. That’s why I used “the mind of the universe”—I didn’t want to call it God, and I never got comfortable with the word entheogen because it has theos in it, and our understandings of God are so limited. I yield to the cosmologist’s language of “the universe,” because we measure the universe in light years—6 million million miles—and it’s billions of light years across. And yet, as we become self-conscious as this complex biped and drop our awareness to the center of ourselves, what we find is this magnificent reality which feels unchanging and yet seems to be at the center of everything that is changing. Beautiful. So it’s a both/and.</p>
<p>If we use the word divinity, the divinity that delights in existence has—at least, and I don’t know whether this is ultimately true, because we may be scratching the surface—even now, a nature that seems unchanging at the center of perpetual change. That’s the best I can do.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Fantastic—and it reveals the limits of conceptual frameworks. Just because concept can’t relate to the seeming paradox doesn’t mean reality doesn’t abide by it. It’s only a paradox to the conceptual mind.</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
It has no problem—exactly.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
It’s only when we try to shrink-wrap it that we enter into paradox and irony. One characteristic, to me, when duality tries to wrap itself around nonduality—which it cannot do—is this irony, paradox. Niels Bohr introduced the notion of complementarity: phenomena aren’t either/or; they’re and. They can be both light and particle. You can be both Chris Bache and the cosmos. Who says you can’t be both? Aristotle? We live in his world.</p>
<p>One other important thing, Chris. We touched on this briefly last time. There seems to be a suggestion in your language—a quality of return. “I want to return to the Beloved. I want to return to the Light.” I’m wondering how we can play with that alongside decimating the notion of path itself. Is “return” a provisional description, and a more absolute approach would be recognition and self-liberation? That is, you don’t need to return to anything—the issue is removing the cataracts of confusion, opening the aperture of heart and mind, and the Light, the Mother, is right here now. Does that speak to you when you reference longing to return to the Mother, the Beloved, the Clear Light? That denotes a subtle dualism—“I have to return”—versus “No, I just recognize.”</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Absolutely. That’s a fair observation. Return implies absence, and the nature of union dissolves absence, and thus dissolves the category of return. It encourages a different set of categories—the eternal Here, the eternal Now. It’s just here all the time. So it fits at one level, and dissolves itself at a deeper level.</p>
<p>Having said that, I want to contextualize this within my particular journey, which is not the same as the journey of spiritual awakening. Spiritual awakening is the art and craft of releasing all the constrictions of the present self so that we can live in a state of abiding transparency—shunyata—to life as it flows through us, like wind blowing through trees. We rest in the abiding presence of the universe as it unfolds.</p>
<p>Cosmological exploration is different. It’s like getting into a rocket ship and going to a different solar system, maybe even a different galaxy altogether. It pushes the capacity of experience—the limits of awareness—so that remembering reaches beyond even the nature of mind. If I had been seeking only to awaken into the abiding present, I would have adopted a completely different strategy. I think Myron Stolaroff’s recommendation of working with very, very low doses of LSD in meditation practice would be a better strategy. But the strategy I used—working with very, very high doses—pushes consciousness so far beyond enlightenment. I say that humbly, trying not to confuse the categories—not “I’m enlightened and I’m more than enlightened”—not that at all. It’s going beyond the state of the abiding condition of emptiness into the unchanging reality underneath; going deeper into physical reality, deeper into consciousness: Where does consciousness come from? What are the prototypes that inform the very structure of time and space, and archetypal consciousness within the human psyche? What are the very forms giving birth to time and space? What is the Light that gave birth to the world—not just our moment-to-moment exotics, but the Light that gave birth to the universe?</p>
<p>From that condition, there is a sense of return—entering that condition and then coming back. That’s why what you say is absolutely true within a spiritual context as we usually mean it: spiritual “return” is an oxymoron; it’s better to use other categories. But within a context of cosmic exploration, maybe there’s a place for it, because I cannot imagine how I could personally live in some of the places I have touched. I can only visit them as a sojourner. I come back and try to bring back as much as I can, and cultivate whatever I can of that condition in my daily life. But I know the vast majority of that reality I will never be able to bring back in this lifetime—maybe a hundred lifetimes from now, maybe. Therefore, in that context, return has a certain ring of truth.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
Several things come to mind. You’re a philosopher, and it’s interesting: things become “philosophy” because they haven’t become direct experience yet—hence the slight pejorative. What you’re sharing is quite something. I want to discuss—not challenge—this. Educate me. I’m completely admissive of my frameworks. Unless I sit here in silence—I love the line “Silence is the language of God; all else is poor translation”—I don’t have a choice, and I’m a poor translator doing my best.</p>
<p>Something that rubs me—productively, like the sand that creates the pearl—is your distinction between the individual and the cosmic. Take Advaita Vedanta, or in Buddhism, Cittamatra/Yogachara: the world is heart-mind-spirit. What you’re saying seems to intimate a separation: cosmological versus individual. How do you reconcile that with oneness? On one level I hear monism, but now a dual-aspect monism. I don’t want to drag this into philosophy, but I do want to understand so I’m not left merely with a wonderful transmission from your experience. Is there an inherent cosmological dualism when you say individual versus cosmic, or is it a monism, as you often suggest?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I don’t see any dualism in it. If there is a dualism, it’s not of my making; it’s of the universe’s making. The universe begins as one in some fundamental core—pre-Big Bang, instant Big Bang—it begins as one and manifests diversity. I didn’t choose that. You didn’t choose this. The universe chose to manifest diversity. We are part of that diversity. In its process of self-emergence, it chose to empower life to become self-aware and self-empowering. The soul grows and grows—the consciousness that holds the awareness and experience of our multiple lifetimes. We’re expanding. We didn’t choose that; we are discovering a world designed billions of years before we showed up.</p>
<p>So we show up and try to make sense of it. One thing is very clear: there is a part and there is the whole. There are many parts, and there is the whole. When our spiritual experience deepens, we have experiences of the whole, and at the same time we experience ourselves as a part. How do we reconcile those? With a deep understanding of emptiness—shunyata—emptiness of self. When we open to the wholeness of life, it’s immediately obvious there is no separate self. We are part of life—an abiding part of life. We are a bubble in the ocean. We are part of the process. That’s why oneness and emptiness are two sides of the same coin. Every molecule of my being, every thought, every consciousness, every soul—everything I am—is part of the manifestation of the universe. I am the universe in that respect, and yet I’m obviously just a little bitty part: a little planet in a little solar system in a galaxy among 2 trillion galaxies.</p>
<p>So we are part, and our nature is the totality of the whole. There’s no ontological duality—only the duality forced upon us by the conditions of life, a functional duality. I don’t even like using philosophical and metaphysical categories, because that traps us in human thought. The history of human thought, particularly in the Western philosophical tradition, is so constrained. It isn’t rooted in deep experience; it’s rooted in sensory experience and highly refined intellectual analysis of sensory experience. When we turn to the contemplative traditions, different insights emerge because the experience is deeper.</p>
<p>That’s the significance of psychedelics for the West, as a philosopher: they not only give us new clinical categories and opportunities to heal the personal psyche, but they open up the entire world of cosmic experience. As we try to digest and articulate those experiences, it allows us to draw from a deeper set of experiences—which allows a deeper set of ideas. I trained in philosophy of religion; I point to that only to differentiate myself from the good psychologists working in clinical contexts. But I don’t speak like a philosopher, do I? I don’t do what philosophers do; they would disown me in a minute—indeed, they do. To me there’s no duality—only a functional duality, basically just a bubble on the ocean of time and existence.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
That’s an incredible response to a very subtle, thorny issue. One question from the outset: when you had the experience of the Diamond Luminosity, post-session, post-meditation—where does that Light go? What is the relationship of that Light to the phenomenal display of the world and appearance? Does the world emerge from that Light? Is the world an expression of that Light? You enter and return to a luminosity state, and when you “come down,” this world appears. What is the relationship of the discovery of that Light to appearance? Where does the Light go?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Good question, which I’m not competent to answer, but I take some pointers from science and from my experience. The Light doesn’t go anywhere; the Light is always there. We gain access to it for a period of time, but we withdraw from the Light into what Plato would call the world of shadows. To me that denigrates the beauty and magnificence of physical reality. Scientists tell us the world is made of molecules, molecules of atoms, atoms of subatomic particles—ultimately quarks. In the end, matter is made out of light. So if scientists say matter is made out of light, and if we drop into the deepest levels of mind and encounter Light—well, there’s a synergy.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the Light doesn’t disappear; the Light is manifesting the physical world. The Light is manifesting as the physical world. When we really try to hold it all together, we experience the physical world as the manifestation of unified Being, which is Light. Everywhere we touch the world we find genius—in the creation of solar systems and how stars live and die, in DNA and ecosystems. Everywhere, layers and layers of genius. If we keep digging deep enough, we fall into quantum reality—dark energy, dark matter—Light. They call it dark energy and dark matter, but it really should be Light energy, Light matter. Light, light, light.</p>
<p>If I get depressed and live in a state of sadness or disconnection, that’s only my mind throwing up shadows of illusion. When I return to clarity, I see the world as a miracle of manifestation. I love that the Prophet Muhammad said the only miracle he would cite for the truth of what he was teaching was the miracle of the universe.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek 
And isn’t it worth reinstating that when you say “I experience it,” perhaps it experiences itself? It’s impossible to talk about this without stumbling into reflexive awareness—the Light aware of itself. Of all the teachings in physics, cosmology, and spirituality, the ones that captivate me most are the teachings of luminosity—inseparable from emptiness. Emptiness/luminosity. Is it fair to say that what we know as our self-sense arises when we condense and contract from the unity of that formless Light back into reified form? That this is a process of dissociation? When we completely open—die to reality—it reveals itself in undifferentiated, ineffable unity of Light. Then when we condense, reincarnate back into form, the minute we do that, the world appears as self and other, and we lose the recollection of this fundamental expression of the Beloved as this body of infinite luminosity and emptiness?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think there is a sad way of doing that, and then there's a happy way of doing that—maybe there's a pathological way, but there's also an entirely healthy way. Imagine it this way. Let’s use “God” language temporarily, just because it’s handy: if we were to become one with God for an hour, and if God is the essence and totality of all life forms, then we’d be becoming one with all life forms. Just imagine the nearby life forms in your neighborhood that would involve—becoming one with all the beetles and ants and grasses and seeds and cockroaches, all the human beings and all their manifest forms. There are so many layers and layers of life.</p>
<p>When we say we’re becoming one with God, we don’t usually mean, “Oh my God, we became one with the billions and billions of ants right in my neighborhood.” But if all life is one in God, then that’s what it involves. What happens, I think, is that we do become one with the One—we reconnect. But the happy way is that when we come back, I don’t return as an ant or a toad or a bird. I come back as Chris, a human being. And there is a healthy way to return to this individual life form while recognizing that its essence is the same as the essence of those ants and birds and toads. No better, no different. It’s more complex, but the essence is the same. That realization brings a profound kinship with all of existence. I happen to be a human bubble; they are other kinds of bubbles. Together we make up the unified existence of the totality. Let’s sing in celebration. We work together. We didn’t choose it; we didn’t create it. We are waking up within it. It is the design of a deeper intelligence, a deeper organization manifesting in joyful diversity. We can enjoy the diversity, acknowledge it, and be comfortable within it. There’s nothing pathological about that. In fact, there’s an ecstatic joy in celebrating being a human being in the now.</p>
<p>If we exalt our humanness at the expense of other life forms and are willing for them to go extinct so we can buy bigger and better whatnot, of course there’s deep pathology. But when individuality is truly liberated, it is recognized as an extraordinary gift—and a responsibility. We have to handle that responsibility to protect the well-being of all the life forms that we are part of and that are around us. Then the sense of our common ground, the ground out of which all life emerges, deepens and deepens. This is eco-psychology and eco-spirituality. We can’t really awaken as a separate self without simultaneously awakening as an earth self, an earth being.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
That’s fantastic. And talk about applicability. Sometimes it’s easy to think these are elite, sterile, ivory-tower spiritual experiences, but really there’s nothing more practical. This is the farthest thing from mere philosophy; it’s a radical transformation in view from which activism—enlightened activity—spontaneously arises. If what we’re discussing here can’t benefit the world, it’s irrelevant. And this is anything but irrelevant. This is foundational—right view, the ultimate basis. From this foundation, without thought, arises activity appropriate for this day and age.</p>
<p>So, when I hear you talk about these experiences, they sound like Samadhi states—specific absorptions. When you’re bathing in the light and become the light, that’s a luminous Samadhi. Why does it end? Why does post-meditation, post-session still occur? Why not abide in that light eternally? What brings you back? On one level, it seems involuntary—so we’re talking about rebirth processes. Is the return involuntary because of unpurified habitual patterns and karmic power? Why does the Samadhi end?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Once again, there are beings for whom their Samadhi does not end. But even those beings experience a movement in and out—they live at different levels at different seconds of every hour. My Samadhi ends because I’m a being who cannot sustain those levels of purity or clarity in my current condition. The habits of consciousness reassert themselves, the habits of embodiment reassert themselves, and I’m once again looking at the world through the levels of awareness I can manage in embodied existence.</p>
<p>There’s also the question: is the goal spiritual awakening, or is it cosmological exploration? If the goal is spiritual awakening, then we can realistically aim to enter into a Samadhi that abides and allows us to live with a profound sense of freedom within life. If the experiential trajectory is cosmological exploration, then the burden of that—as in the path I practiced—is that it’s temporary. Maybe Samadhi isn’t even the right word for it. To go beyond, to experience the future of humanity in a realistic, graphic sense; to experience the purpose of time-space existence and a profound expansion of time that spans millions of years; to absorb that—how could one live in that condition and have breakfast? If you want to understand those things, here’s a way of doing it, but then you have to come back and live as my 72-year-old self. I have to cut the grass and do my things. And that’s okay. If you do it well, there’s a happy way of coming back—integrating and recognizing the limits of what you experienced. It’s a temporary condition. No big deal. Learn more as you go. There are healthy ways and unhealthy ways. Hopefully the healthy way brings an abiding calm and trust—an abiding trust in the wisdom of the universe in its self-emergent glory.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Would it be fair to say we’re basically talking about the rebirth process, and that it unfolds on two dimensions: the degree of openness we can tolerate, and the end of involuntary rebirth through radical openness? What ends involuntary rebirth is the ability to open to such a degree that, when that state is revealed at the moment of death, we abide in and as that fundamental openness. Then, when we do return, we do so out of love—a manifestation of compassion—voluntarily embodying wisdom rather than involuntarily embodying confusion. Rebirth doesn’t end; involuntary rebirth ends. The play continues infinitely, out of love and compassion in service to others. Is that a fair way to express your understanding? I’m trying to dance around dissolving an Omega point—yes, there’s a final goal for the self, the cessation of that self—but then it’s the beginning of an endless voluntary display of wisdom and compassion.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think that’s a very fair description. What ends is the involuntary nature of reincarnation. We transition into voluntary incarnation. And I don’t think our future incarnations are the same as our past incarnations in this respect. The way it was shown to me in sessions is that—long term or short term, however it manifests—eventually we all become voluntarily incarnate. When the entire planet is populated by self-consciously incarnated beings, humanity will have transitioned to a new level of its evolutionary trajectory.</p>
<p>This was presented to me as the birth of the diamond soul. All my former lives at one point started coming into me. When they hit critical mass, they fused into one, and a diamond light blew out of my chest and catapulted me into a deep state of individualized consciousness—individuality actualized in a way I had never known. I think that’s where humanity is going. Across generations, billions of people are incarnating over and over again. Sooner or later, the entire species not only becomes awakened, but gives birth to a deeper spiritual awareness that has been gestating inside it for hundreds of thousands of lifetimes. We awaken into a deeper awareness that includes not just enlightenment, but our history—our relationship to the universe—a deeper intimacy with the intelligence of the universe and with all life forms on this planet.</p>
<p>This is when soul consciousness awakens—not “soul” in an anti-Buddhist way, but compatible with shunyata, emptiness. We awaken to the being that we are within the community of beings, on a planet at this stage of its evolutionary development, with billions of years ahead. When we first encountered enlightenment 2–5,000 years ago, we called it escape—moksha. “Let me get out of here.” Now we’re beginning to understand: we want to awaken here. In awakening here, humanity pivots into a new stage of the evolutionary story—more peaceful of heart, nonviolent, more compassionate, insightful, creative. That’s the kind of planet I think we’re giving birth to. Our individual aspirations—spiritual practice, purification, healing, justice—are organically part of this deeper story. Humanity is reaching a point where it no longer has the liberty of living at the lower level of maturity it has lived at in the past. We can’t run a planet run by egos. We have to grow up—into the higher form of spiritual awareness the teachers have pointed to for thousands of years. This is a turning point in human history—what I call the future human. People give it different names. We can feel it in our bones: Maitreya, that higher realization working its way to us.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
That’s exquisite. And I wonder if “growing down” might be a more appropriate embodied aspect—because “growing up” can sound like moksha, escapist, FedEx my consciousness to a pure land. It’s really waking down into the majesty—integrating your work, metabolizing, digesting, incorporating—literally bringing into soma this vast realization.</p>
<p>If you don’t mind a bit of devil’s advocacy: I’m fascinated by development, not just spiritual but structural. I take delight in this vision and aspire to it—may we all become tulkus—but I also wonder about wishful thinking. You talk in your book about evolutionary breakthroughs. When I look at the world and see what’s happening, and we can’t even agree as a society to wear a mask for each other’s benefit, why should there be something special now—a meteor of sanity, wisdom, and insight—that shakes us from our collective slumber and brings a collective evolution? Evolution stumbles along painful, laborious stretches of time. I revel in what you’re saying, but I’m less optimistic than I used to be. The winds don’t seem to be blowing in the right direction.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
So, it’s getting worse—they seem to be going away, right?</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Outside of your experience—and that’s the ultimate refuge for you—what else gives you the conviction that we’re heading toward an evolutionary breakthrough as a species? The big question: will we do it in time? I’m not so sure. I try to retain optimism, but it’s conjecture. How does that challenge land with you? Development doesn’t seem to work this way.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Outside of my visionary experience, I have nothing to say. We all look at the data. We see the stupidity and insanity around us. We see growing eco-crises; we anticipate the desertification of middle America; famine on the horizon penetrating into middle-class experience; we’re told that a 12-foot ocean rise is already baked in by 2050—unstoppable. We can calculate how many billions will be flooded out. We know we’re coming into extremely difficult times. We see reactionary, regressive forces internationally. We see higher concentrations of wealth in fewer hands. Very dangerous trends. Outside my visionary experience, I have no certainty this is going someplace good.</p>
<p>Starting around 1992–93, I began having consistent visions, completely by surprise—just as I hadn’t anticipated doing therapeutic work in the collective psyche, I had no idea one could have insights into humanity’s evolutionary trajectory. But living with this for years, I began to understand it as natural. Just as going deeper into our personal life yields a deeper sense of our personal trajectory, one can go deep—if one lives in service of the collective—into a penetrating understanding of the collective trajectory.</p>
<p>In that context, my experience has been consistent over years of psychedelic and visionary work: humanity is coming to a turning point, a before-and-after, a dawn of something fantastic—a genuine spiritual awakening. Everything our spiritual traditions describe for the individual—guess what? It’s not just individual; it’s collective. The forces of the collective unconscious are activated, not just my personal unconscious.</p>
<p>At a critical time in 1995—in my 55th session—when I expected to be taken back into the diamond luminosity, it dissolved me into the collective psyche—into the collective unconscious—took me into deep time. I experienced the death and rebirth of humanity: a global systems crisis, billions of people dying, a total unraveling of culture and civilization as we’ve known it—our entire species losing control of its story, being put under enormous, crushing pressure of death and destruction. It felt like an extinction event. I was given no details or timeline—just the experience of the species undergoing a Death Event on this planet, all of us together.</p>
<p>Then the storm began to pass. It subsided. Those still alive picked themselves up and began to rebuild, and what we were was different. A synergy of conscious creativity, of compounding freedom and insight emerged—a new set of values, understandings, and capacities. Humanity as a whole was going through what every spiritual aspirant knows: a complete collapse of reality as known, and a waking into a more spiritually animated, magnificent, beautiful, conscious awareness.</p>
<p>In my 70th and last session, I was given a capstone experience that took me deep into the future and showed me the archetypal form of the future human. It brings tears to my eyes to remember it. A truly different form of humanity—the best of the best in us—our hearts healed, our minds opened. Outside of my visionary experience, I have no reason to suggest that humanity is coming to this evolutionary pivot. I know evolution has dead ends; species die off; planets could die off. There’s no cognitively compelling reason for hope. As we enter this century, we’re going to lose hope again and again. That’s why I think it’s important to have a vision of what’s taking place at a deeper level—because it’s going to get bad. Realistically, we could lose more than half of Earth’s human population, and we’ll watch it on television every night. It will wrack us with terrible pain. But inside, we’ll be led to do things we wouldn’t otherwise do. We’ll be cracked open in pain and suffering, just as in deep meditation or deep psychedelic work, reaching deeper into ourselves than ever before, accomplishing what we might never accomplish without this ordeal.</p>
<p>I was also shown some of the mechanism responsible for this—over and over—until I understood it. It has to do with the functioning of the collective psyche. In this time of accelerated, intensified individual suffering, it’s not just our individual psyches being activated, but all the suffering of humanity gathering at a centralized level—as a morphogenic field, as Sheldrake has helped us understand. The scenario that unfolded was that the collective psyche will move into such a highly energized state that it will begin to operate as a non-linear, far-from-equilibrium system. We know something about how physical systems operate in non-linear conditions: they are capable of accelerated change; small perturbations produce expanded outcomes; creativity emerges from within the system in unprecedented ways; hydrogen and oxygen combine to produce water. Things happen that are unanticipated within a linear framework.</p>
<p>I was shown that this pivot will take place much faster than we could imagine if we calculate based on the past. It will happen more quickly, and it will be deeper than anything we could imagine. I know that sounds like optimism run amok, and everyone has to make their own decisions on this. All I can do is report the vision and let it go at that. We’re all in this together—you and I, and our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Part of me says, “May it be so,” and another part says, “May it not be so.” As we start to wrap up, prescriptions—what to do, or not to do? How can we bring our individual, empowered selves to actually help this world, now and for our descendants? Let’s end on some prescriptive notes.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In terms of the transition I’ve been describing, someone I know, love, and respect—who has thought a great deal about how we can accelerate this process and remove the worst of the pain—is Duane Elgin. His book Choosing Earth is a beautiful, powerful, short book. He lays out what he thinks the next five decades will look like—it’s not pretty; it’s frightening—but he also offers prescriptions for how we can engage this future and bring about a safe landing, individually and socially. His advice is worth much more than mine. He’s giving the book away—you can get a PDF on Amazon—because it’s so important. It’s all in service to humanity.</p>
<p>I’d also add a reminder from a reincarnation perspective: each of us chose to be incarnated at this time in history, at the time and place we incarnated, with the talents and challenges we brought in. We are exactly where we’re supposed to be to make a creative offering to this time in history. We don’t have to look elsewhere. The only question is whether we have the courage to actualize the potential we’re standing on right here, right now. Once we commit that our life will count toward the good, we look around and ask, “What needs to happen? What are we trying to become?” Then we put our hands to work.</p>
<p>Since we’re all different, with different missions—medical, political, philosophical, creative, hard labor—every human talent will be required. It’s not about looking elsewhere; it’s about looking at where one is already incarnated to serve. Spiritual practice is important—facing and clarifying the shadow, becoming open and receptive. Community is important—not only practice community, but social community: learning to do more with less, sharing, restructuring society. Political community is really important—we see what happens when ego runs amok in our politics. All these things are needed. All we have to do is look around, see what needs to be done, and give ourselves to it completely.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
Wonderful. Anything you wish I would have asked?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I don’t know—it’s serious territory, partner.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
As we really wrap up, any final thoughts or questions you felt should have been directed your way?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
You mentioned The Living Classroom at the beginning, and it’s too late to go into it at length. But the core truth manifesting there—without mentioning psychedelics—is that consciousness is unified from the start. Everything we do in our individual field radiates 360 degrees. All of our spiritual practice, all of our actions, radiate and touch the consciousness of the beings around us. Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world. We are never isolated from those around us. It may be invisible or subtle, but it’s always there. The more we act on that basis, the more we activate the sinews that bind us to life. This is true not just for human beings—it’s true for all life forms that surround us. That’s the core teaching of The Living Classroom: there’s an atomistic quality to teaching, and a quantum quality. You and I have been having, in some ways, an atomistic conversation, but we can trust that there’s a quantum quality to it.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: 
A field effect that extends beyond our limited self-sense, which is illusory in nature. That’s a wonderful way to end. It invites us to discover that we have so much more power than we think—in both negative and positive ways. The thoughts we hold, the aspirations, the motivations—they’re not encapsulated in this little ball of skin. They’re a pebble radiating out throughout the cosmos, not just this world. Understanding that will empower our ways to benefit the world. Chris, I can’t thank you enough. I’m thrilled to have spent this time with you. I’ve learned so much. I applaud your bravery, your heart, your capacities. It’s marvelous and of great benefit.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thank you for the conversation, Andrew. Thank you for your work bringing this and many similar conversations into the world. Conversations change lives. Thank you for what you do, and thank you for the opportunity to talk about these things together. It’s been.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: It’s been a delight for me too. Like we talked about briefly last time—I hadn’t really thought of it before—the dialog, the conversation, the sharing, as actually a quality of the path itself. That’s new for me, and I haven’t really thought of it that way. It’s a wonderful insight among the many you’ve shared. Thank you so much for everything. Let’s do it again when the next book comes out.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Oh no—help me. But I’m always happy to have a conversation with you.</p>
<p>Andrew Holecek: It’s been such a delight, Chris. Till next time—thank you so much for your time. Good heart. Love and blessings. Thank you. Bye.</p>

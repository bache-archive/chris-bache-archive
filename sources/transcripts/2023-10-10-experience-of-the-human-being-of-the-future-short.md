Chris Bache: 
One of the last great visions the universe gave me in one of my sessions took me deep into deep time—into the future—and gave me my last experience of the future human. It was as if it allowed me to try on, for size, the fundamental blueprint of the human psyche at that point in the future. This was the most extraordinary being. I can't quickly describe to you what an extraordinary being this is.

Picture the highest, finest qualities we've imagined—the highest spiritual capacities we can imagine: a mind completely open to the universe, a heart completely open to each other; an extraordinarily magnificent being. That's what's at stake here. That's what we're trying to become.

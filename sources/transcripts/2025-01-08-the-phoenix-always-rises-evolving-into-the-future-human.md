Manda Scott 
Chris, welcome to the accidental goals podcast. How are you, and where are you? It’s a slightly gray December day over here, but it might be lovely where you are.

Chris Bache 
Hi, Amanda. It's a pleasure to be here with you. I'm speaking from Weaverville, North Carolina, just outside Asheville, and it's a sunny day here. It's going to be a lovely afternoon in the mid-40s.

Manda Scott 
Okay, now I have weather envy—but hey, you're in a swing state, which at some point we might get onto. That must have been quite entertaining for a brief period of time. Let's not go there. That's two pages. All right. So you've written a number of books, you've had a very inspiring life, and my projection onto you—which I am almost certain is not true—is that you have the answers to life, the universe and everything. So we'll lay that one to bed as it's my projection and you don't see it that way. From where you are, what is most alive for you at this inflection point of humanity?

Chris Bache 
Well, we've just gone through an election in our country which, for the liberal side of the continent like me, was very disappointing and very upsetting. What's happening in politics in my country and in many countries around the world—the whole movement to the conservative right—is very much of concern, especially since fundamental facts that are critically important for humanity to address are being denied. First and foremost is global climate change.

In my book, LSD in the Mind of the Universe, I have a chapter on what I call the birth of the future human. It summarizes transmissions given to me over a 20-year course of high-dose LSD sessions about humanity's future, where we are in our evolutionary development, the critical crisis we are moving into, and the birth of a new form of humanity coming out of that crisis. A great future for humanity is possible, but for deep, spiritual realization to emerge, there must first take place a collective dark night of the soul. So I see what's happening politically against that backdrop: a growing dismantling of assumptions, an unraveling of our social contracts, and a growing global crisis generated by a series of eco-crises.

Manda Scott 
Okay, so that gives us an opening into the birth of the future human. For those watching on YouTube, my cat is on the desk—it's easier to let him just ramble across and then he'll go away and it'll be fine. Before we go there, let's just address the politics, because it's alive for everyone. This is going out at the start of the new year. 2025 is going to be the year when everything changes. America sneezes, the world gets a cold, and nothing will be the same—particularly geopolitics, which is about to shift enormously. I think a US–Russian alliance has never happened before, and it looks like it's arising in real time.

It seems to me 71 million people voted for Trump. That means, by my reckoning, 259 million didn't. And yet there's been, effectively, a bloodless coup by the fascist right. And no amount of ideology, however forcefully imposed, can overcome biophysical reality. You cannot stop climate change by pretending it's not happening. The ostrich position is only useful until the flood waters fill the hole you've stuck your head in.

So it seems to me that the shifts we need must be inner—and collectively inner—which is exactly the field you're working in. We don't want to go back over everything you experienced, but I wonder if you've got an elevator pitch of where you started and where it took you in terms of your own spiritual process. Is that something we could go into?

Chris Bache 
I can give you a quick overview. I began my psychedelic work when I was just hired as a university professor in Northeast Ohio. I began as a pretty well-educated, dedicated agnostic with strong atheistic inclinations—that's where all the years of graduate school had brought me. But just when I started teaching, I came across the work of Stanislav Grof, and his book Realms of the Human Unconscious changed the direction of my life. I saw the importance of his work for my discipline, which was philosophy of religion. I'm not a psychologist or a therapist; I'm a professor of philosophy of religion.

So I began an underground regimen of psychedelic therapy because I knew that, in order to speak intelligently using this methodology, you had to do the work yourself. Even though it was illegal—this was 1978 when I started my career; I started my psychedelic work in 1979—I decided to do this work underground, completely isolated. I never let my students know, and most of my faculty never knew. I continued for 20 years. I started at 30 and finished at 50, and I did 79 high-dose LSD sessions, which is a very aggressive protocol. I don't recommend this protocol today.

Manda Scott 
You did this so we don't have to, as far as I can see, and I'm enormously grateful.

Chris Bache 
Yeah. Then I spent another 20 years digesting those experiences—writing about them, integrating them, trying to integrate them. I've written two books based on those experiences. One is Dark Night, Early Dawn, which came out in 2000, and probably the more important one for a wide audience is LSD in the Mind of the Universe, which came out in 2019. So I did this work for 20 years, and then LSD in the Mind of the Universe came out 20 years after I stopped.

Manda Scott 
After you'd integrated a lot of what happened, and after you were also, it seems from the book, just beginning to be able to start talking about it, because you had issues where you couldn't speak. You physically couldn't speak because you couldn't speak of what you understood and what you knew. Can you tell us a little about that? That seemed to me quite an integral part of what was happening.

Chris Bache 
I love teaching. I love working with students. I just really love being in the classroom. I knew that if I began to speak openly about psychedelics in the 70s, 80s, even the 90s, I would very likely lose my position at the university, so I could not speak openly about my work. I spoke indirectly by teaching courses on psychedelic therapy, Stan Grof’s work, and other people's research. But I wasn't able to own my experiences publicly at my university until the very tail end of my career. I retired in 2011 a little early, to give me time to bring forward what I consider my most important work.

My conviction is that psychedelics represent a revolution not just in therapy, not just a clinical revolution, but a revolution in how we do philosophy. The methodology is to move systematically into very carefully controlled non-ordinary states; experience them as consciously as we can; bring them back and write a detailed account within 24 hours; then spend time digesting them and integrating them with our other bodies of knowledge; and then go back in. This systematic method of entering non-ordinary states and returning represents a new methodological platform for doing philosophy—what I would call a psychedelic philosophy grounded in the systematic application of non-ordinary states of consciousness through the use of psychedelics.

Manda Scott 
Can I interrupt you? This is already opening doors, and I'd like to go down a few of them. We're talking about integrating with other systems, and in the book you were becoming quite deeply involved in some Buddhist practices—were they Buddhist, I think? Within the shamanic world, we see a lot of people who want to go off and do ayahuasca or mushrooms, and it seems to me they're short-cutting—not universally; I’ve spoken to people who are absolutely prepared to go and spend six months in the forest alone with the plants and integrate it—but there are an equal number who think they can go from point A to point Z without actually doing the steps in between.

What I think I'm hearing from you is that the steps in between are crucial, and they need to be undertaken in a structured fashion, even as we move away from the reductive, scientific space—where atoms move like billiard balls and everything is predictable given enough data—to a place where everything is emergent and complex and nothing is predictable, but experience—the phenomenology of living—is what matters, and the more-than-human world takes part. It seemed to me, reading certainly the second book, and to an extent the first, that there was an extraordinary coherence. You had a six-year gap in the middle, and yet when you went back, you took off as if in a serial dream—those of us who practice dreaming, night after night, are in the same story. You were in an almost linear progression—more fractal than linear, I’d say—building on previous knowledge, and you were being taught quite clearly. Can you unpick a bit of the structure you see as useful for helping us move toward being future humans?

Chris Bache 
There are several things rolled into your observations—all good. First, I think integration is very important. We have the chemical technology to trigger very deep states of consciousness, but these states may have very little lasting impact on our deeply ingrained psychological and cultural habits if we don't take time to sit with them and integrate them as deeply as we can into our embodied existence.

Over the course of my work, even though I was paying a lot of attention and doing as good a job as I could to integrate each individual session, I still underestimated the long-term challenges of integrating an entire spiritual journey. I didn't fully comprehend this until I had stopped my journey and realized how hard the stopping hit me, exposing the imbalance—the failure to integrate the most extreme, radical experiences, which were the deepest: being drawn into intimacy, into communion with—I want to say the divine, but I'm cautious because we have to unpack theological baggage.

Manda Scott 
On this podcast, actually, we talk about the heart-mind of the universe all the time, which I think is what you would call the divine. So I think we can assume that unpacking has been done in the past five years.

Chris Bache 
The universe is good. I like that. That's why the book is called LSD in the Mind of the Universe—it could be the heart-mind of the universe.

Manda Scott 
But you came to a point where you were basically marking time, waiting to die in order to return to unity with the divine. Did I understand that correctly?

Chris Bache 
You got it correctly. It's jumping ahead to the story. Let me back up and work to that point.

In order to extract maximal psychological, psycho-spiritual, and philosophical value, it's very important to create a container—what I call the Kiva of practice. A container that affords the best opportunity for absolutely clear contact with deeper states of consciousness: no interruption, no confusion, no outside contact. You're in a therapeutic environment, lying down, with a skilled sitter, listening to carefully curated music. It's a complex process you prepare for, then have the session, then integrate acutely for several days after. Each session takes about a week for the immediate work, and as you build these sessions over time, there is, relatively speaking, a linear progression. Consciousness is holistic, so you may experience multiple levels simultaneously and may touch some deep levels early. But working systematically, my experience was a progressive deepening.

At the end, I looked at the landscape and broke it down into five fundamental terrains I explored: personal mind (your personal unconscious), the collective mind (the species mind—what Carl Jung would call the collective psyche), archetypal mind, causal mind (the mind of oneness), and the diamond luminosity. I would go through successive deaths and rebirths. Eventually there’d be a breakthrough that would catapult me into a new level of consciousness with a different physics. I'd learn how it worked, continue to purify, undergo deeper cycles of death and rebirth, and eventually break into a completely different level of reality—then start over again, acclimating until the visionary experience became clear, and then be propelled into another level.

In the deepest level, the diamond luminosity, I had an experience of a level of light beyond the diamond luminosity. A ray of light came out of that reality, hit me, and shattered me. It taught me it's an infinite progression. I had thought in the beginning it was a matter of becoming one with God or getting to the meta-cosmic void. But there are many levels of God, many levels even of the primal void. It's an infinite progression; you'll never reach the end of it—even using as powerful a protocol as high-dose LSD work.

That shifted my orientation. If I were doing it over, I would be much gentler with myself. I would use lower doses and balance and vary the psychedelic, because the goal is not to reach an end stage that changes your life forever. The goal is to open—to let in as much of the wisdom of the universe as possible, as much love and insight as possible—and then spend weeks, months, years integrating those experiences, changing whatever in your life keeps you from experiencing those realities on a daily basis, and then continue.

At the end, I had gone so deeply into intimacy with the divine—into the divine light, dissolving completely into fields of light, transcending space and time—that when I stopped this work after 20 years, I found I was missing the transcendent clarity so deeply that I was just waiting to die so I could return when I died. After reflecting on this for a long period, I realized something wasn't right. This is not how the work is supposed to end. It's not healthy.

I studied my work to find where I had gone wrong and realized I had gone so deeply into transcendence that I created an imbalance within my incarnation—tilted toward transcendence at the expense of affirming my deeply physical, embodied existence. Both are fundamental truths: we are always tapped into transcendence and into the physical world. I had tilted the balance very far and had to make a conscious choice to re-ground myself in physical reality so I could become more comfortable in my own skin. Writing LSD in the Mind of the Universe helped tremendously. Speaking about my experiences empowered my integration. Sharing them publicly—after so many years of keeping them private—allowed a healing to take place inside my psyche between the hidden and the public, between the higher and the earthier.

Manda Scott 
Again, many doors opened. We want to come back to why you ended. I’d like to make clear to people listening: first, this was industrial doses of LSD, and you’ve explained that you went through death and rebirth experiences. I think it's worth pointing out there were points where you were vomiting so hard for so long that the vessels in your eyeballs ruptured. It didn't sound like a whole lot of fun to me. And you also had your then wife, who was a trained psychologist—psychotherapist? I can't remember—but she was very good at holding the space. So you had a lot of anchoring. And it still sounds like the early part of every single journey was living hell, as far as I can tell. Would that be fair?

Chris Bache 
Yes. What I discovered eventually is there's a purification cycle. Traditionally, we would call it the death–rebirth cycle, but we often think of death as something that happens one time. A lot of the therapeutic literature focuses on ego death, which for me is only the first round.

After you've died many times in this process—complete loss of control, metaphysical confusion, complete surrender to overwhelming metaphysical waterfalls—you learn that you cannot die. It's impossible to die. The form you are can die, the structure of life as you've known it can be extinguished, but the inner essence of your being always re-emerges. The phoenix always rises. In that process I also learned that what we experience as death is actually an extremely intense form of purification. When your purification reaches so deeply that it reaches into the fundamental assumptions that structure your experience of reality, then death has returned to grace you. It's purification, breakthrough, experiencing a deeper state. If you want to stop at that level, it's perfectly fine. Different psychedelics and modalities have different powers. It happened that the method and substance I was using were so powerful they kept breaking me through level after level in this systematic fashion.

Manda Scott 
And did you choose LSD because of Stan Grof—and it was the thing back in the 70s? I suppose that's a head-mind question, but my spirit-mind question is: you could have done a lot of different things. Ayahuasca wasn't around much, but mushrooms were; there were other things. Do you think that whatever guides you through this incarnation led you to that? You said you wouldn't do it again now, but you wouldn't be who you are now if you hadn't gone through the military version of completely destroying yourself many times. Can you speak to that?

Chris Bache 
To understand why I chose LSD, you have to go back to 1979–1980. Ayahuasca was still not yet on the playing field for the most part. Mushrooms certainly were, but I understood LSD to be more powerful than mushrooms. Primarily, my work was based on Stan Grof’s work, and I trusted Stan. I trusted his research, and he did most of his work with LSD, so that's where I dug in.

Later, after I finished my 20-year journey, I've done many psychedelics—mushrooms, 5-MeO, Salvia divinorum, San Pedro, ayahuasca. They're beautiful and have taught me a lot. I have a sense that each psychedelic opens some portion of the spectrum of consciousness. Psilocybin, for example, is very body-grounded, very emotional and embodied. LSD tends to have a high cosmological ceiling—certainly at high doses it pushes the high ceiling—whereas psilocybin is more grounded, earthy in my existence.

Manda Scott 
It seems to me it's more about opening doors into the rest of the web of life rather than necessarily cosmic awareness—not that the two are mutually exclusive, but there's a tilt one way or the other. I want to move toward the future human, but before we go there, how was it taken in academic circles when you wrote these books? Were there people who came to you and said, Yes, I've been wanting to do this—or I have been doing this and thank you for opening the doors? Or were there others for whom the door was now shut and your access was denied? How did it land with your people?

Chris Bache 
My work has been well received in the consciousness community. In the academic community, they don't even know I exist. For the most part, it's been ignored. There hasn't been a single professional review published of my work in a hardcore academic philosophy or religious studies journal.

Manda Scott 
But you must have friends who could publish in those journals. You must have ways into that, if people wanted to. Is it just not worth their career to do that?

Chris Bache 
One of the things I decided early on was not to try to address the reservations—abundantly clear to me—coming out of the traditional academic mindset. I decided that if I tried to justify the method and the experiences to my colleagues, it would hamper me. I decided to push deeply ahead and let the chips fall where they may. I understand how exotic, how strange my claims sound to people raised and educated in a traditional environment, and I've decided to let that go and let history sort things out. I'm acutely aware that I'm writing not for my present generation; I'm writing for future generations. Paradigm changes take place in an evolutionary context, so I'm just doing the work and letting other people sort out what they think it's worth.

Manda Scott 
With any luck—and it sounds like there are, particularly, the earlier moments when you were having what we would now consider psychic experiences where you knew things from non-ordinary reality—not when you were on the LSD, but when you were teaching—and then you had to hold them in because if you said something it was basically going to blow everybody's fuses. They were going to wonder how you knew it and ask you to explain how you knew it. But those students, I am thinking, have been in the field of your awareness at a point when you were beginning to see the world in a different space. So with any luck, they'll go off and change the world.

Chris Bache 
I'll tell you one aspect about that. I never let my students know I was doing this work, but I began to find that, even though they didn't know about my psychedelic work, they began to have experiences showing they were being impacted by it. Secondly, my work was changing me at a deep structural level, so that my person became a lightning rod sparking transformational insights or breakthroughs among my students without my consciously intending it.

When I would be lecturing, I found myself drawing examples that were purely random for me, but I was told they were exactly the same things happening to my students that week. The things I was saying began to touch them in very deep, personal, intimate places—places they were wounded, places they were blocked from going forward. This became such a common feature of my work that eventually I spent a lot of time studying it and developing an entirely new way of teaching to take into account truths I was discovering in the classroom and in my psychedelic work—truths that revolved around the boundaryless nature of consciousness. Fields of consciousness develop in groups; there's an energetic resonance underneath the verbal exchange of ideas—consciousness directly engaging consciousness.

I published a book in 2008, after I stopped my sessions, called The Living Classroom, in which I lay it all out—but I never mentioned psychedelics, because the issue is not psychedelics; the issue is consciousness, the potential of consciousness. If you do very deep consciousness work without psychedelics, I think you can trigger the same things. Just recently—this month—SUNY Press is bringing out a second edition of The Living Classroom, and they invited me to tell the truth about my psychedelic practice because I'm out of the closet by now; LSD in the Mind of the Universe is out. So the new edition makes clear that my psychedelic practice was driving the phenomena that emerged in my classes, even though other people not using psychedelics can experience the same thing.

That's another aspect that has to do with integration. Integration here means taking care not only of yourself, but of anyone whom your practice touches—which, for me, included many of my students. A third of the book is essays my students wrote—very deep personal essays about their own spiritual experiences, their experience of death. It's a beautiful section of the book.

Manda Scott 
I will find that and put a link in the show notes. And you were still teaching the philosophy of religion at this point—you hadn't branched out into other things?

Chris Bache 
Right. I was teaching classic Religious Studies courses—Introduction to World Religions, Eastern Religions, Buddhism, Psychology of Religion, Mysticism and Meditation. Classic curriculum.

Manda Scott 
Gosh, I wish they were the classic curriculum when I went through. With my senior apprentice—and I don't work with psychedelics, but we teach shamanic studies—I’ve found that even when I'm talking about the book in front of a literary festival that's basically full of ordinary middle-class people who've come along and had nothing better to do and wanted to get out of the rain, we end up drawing in examples that seem to come out of nowhere. And then someone goes, “Oh, you just mentioned Boston and something about streets in Boston,” about which I know precisely nothing, and they say, “I come from Boston, and the streets are just like that.”

So I'm sure that what you said is absolutely true and, at a deeper level, when we're teaching a held circle, the resonances move across the circle. Becoming aware of these such that everyone in the circle is engaging with that strikes me as a step toward future humanism—becoming conscious of the things that can help us be different humans.

Chris Bache: 
Once you understand how fields work, and you develop a protocol that maximizes the potential for consciousness-changing fields to emerge within groups, you do it in a way that deepens the learning and accelerates the transformational value for everyone involved. This applies not just to university courses; it applies in research laboratories, in boardrooms—wherever citizens gather in sustained conversations, which is where most of our change takes place, in dialogue with other human beings. So this is very relevant to the challenge we’re moving into.

Manda Scott: 
Let’s go there. I’ll lay out where I think we’re at, and you can tell me—because you live in the US, and I’m watching from across the water, waiting for it to come over here. Musk has already said he’s going to basically buy the next election, and we’ve always had the best democracy money could buy. So unless we can change the democratic process, that’s it. And Musk and Starlink—I’ve been floating across Substack, watching very geeky people pointing out how he managed to steal the election and how the numbers don’t add up. But if you’re going to feed everything through Starlink, the person who owns Starlink can make it say what they want it to say. You and I are talking across many thousands of miles using technology that, in the end, is basically owned by an individual who might be very interesting, but I don’t necessarily want them knowing everything that I think and do. It seems to me that evolution only happens under moments of intense pressure. I would like this moment not to become any more intensely pressurized—it probably will—but this is as much as I ever want. Therefore, can we evolve our consciousness to become future humans? It seems to me that you have a framework within which that could happen. How does that land with you?

Chris Bache: 
That aligns fine, and I think you’re absolutely correct. I’m not sure I have a doorway I would recommend as such, but I do think psychedelics have entered our historical scene precisely when we need more awareness. We need it for therapeutic processes. We need it for political processes. We need to wake up and grow. There are thousands and thousands of people working very conscientiously with psychedelics to heal the accumulated trauma of many lifetimes and to open a deeper communion with the intelligence that resides within the universe—to help us transition from a mechanical, dead universe of dead matter to a living universe that’s alive at its core, expressing its intentionality through the quantum jumps that take place in our evolutionary journey. I think we are coming into a quantum jump right now.

Let me back up a sec. The chapter “The Birth of the Future Human,” and everything it contains, came into my work by complete surprise. I thought I was doing the work for personal transformation, personal healing, maybe even personal enlightenment. But the method was so powerful it pushed beyond all those categories, and I had to reframe my understanding of the boundaries of conscientious psychedelic work. I dropped the model of personal transformation and opened into a model of collective transformation. For years I had experiences where the shadow I was engaging was not my personal shadow—I did that work—but a collective shadow. The pain and excruciating suffering I was processing had to do with the pain of my entire species. I came to understand that there is a collective psyche that holds the trauma of humanity’s history, just as our individual psyche holds our individual trauma, and this collective pain encumbers the free functioning of the collective psyche, just as our personal trauma encumbers our individual health and well-being. By doing this work, I began to understand that something in the universe was using my sessions to make a small contribution to healing the collective psyche in order to make it more available to the influx of energy from divine consciousness—allowing it to manifest more completely in humanity.

Manda Scott: 
Can you say that again? I think that’s really important. It’s the opening of a door to something that’s trying to come in. Is that what I heard?

Chris Bache: 
I think we’re living at a time of ascending spiritual energy—an influx of higher light pushing in on us. The pain of our history—the karma of our narrowness, our smallness, our trying to live within the framework of individual ego at the cost of anyone else’s well-being—keeps us locked away, insensitive to this incoming light. In any mystical development, before there’s a breakthrough into non-dual or unitive consciousness, there’s a dark night of the soul where you have to let go of the obstacles and blocks. I think this is happening at a collective level, not only inside intense psychedelic sessions, but everywhere. If you’re doing past-life therapy, many of the lives that come up to be cleansed are not necessarily your personal former lives; they can be lives within the system. Social movements to end child abuse, to end abuse of our daughters, to end racism, to end speciesism—these movements are tackling pains much deeper than our personal pain. The whole system is straining against the burdens of the past in order to open itself to take in, more powerfully, the energy—the light—of our future.

In that context, in the middle of this work, I began to receive visions that were stable and consistent, stretching over several years, about where humanity is in its evolutionary journey and where it’s going. The message was that we were coming into a time of radical, pivotal breakthrough—a before-and-after moment—where the past would quickly become irrelevant because something fundamentally new was emerging. But for years it never showed me how nature was going to accomplish this; I had no idea. Then, in 1995, I had a fundamental experience. By this time I was working at very deep levels; I was into the diamond luminosity material. This session broke me open. It dissolved my mind into the species mind, and then asked the consciousness of the species. I understand how radical that assertion is, and I don’t take it lightly. The species mind opened and took me into future time—what I call deep time. In that future, I experienced the death and rebirth of humanity. I experienced humanity coming to an absolute breaking point—a breakdown, an unraveling of fundamental trust and convictions within our culture, a deep, systematic breaking down until the entire planet, it seemed, was faced with the task of mere survival. It looked like an extinction event. At first it looked like that was it—we had overloaded the system so badly, overdrawn the ecological balance sheet of the planet so badly, that we weren’t going to come out of it. But then, just when things were at their worst, things began to get lighter. People who had been brought to their knees began to stand up. We began to reconstellate. After these crises—and I don’t know how long they will last; I think of this as a three-generational pivot—I can’t imagine it lasting less than that. The 21st century is a major pivot, and we know by 2030, 2040, 2050 we’ll be facing worsening environmental crises. What I think is happening is that, by the time we go through this crisis, we will crack open something so deep in the human spirit, so deep in the human psyche, that what will emerge is a literally transformed humanity—not simply transformed individuals, but a transformation of the fundamental substructure of the human psyche. I think of this as a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective unconscious, so that every human being born after this period will experience consciousness within a collective psyche different from how we experienced it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Manda Scott: 
Now—or for a long time before that, within our time before that.

Chris Bache: 
There’s another theme that gave me some details of what the future human is. In other sessions, I was taken far into the future and experienced this new archetype. I believe in reincarnation—my first book was on reincarnation—and from a philosopher’s perspective, I think the empirical evidence is overwhelming. It’s always been part of my thinking, based on the evidence, not religious belief. I experienced reincarnation dynamics many times in my sessions—not only my personal reincarnational history, but reincarnation as a dynamic process for the entire planet. The entire species is pulsing in the rhythm of reincarnation. If reincarnation is a basic fact of life, then we have been building the future human for hundreds of thousands of years, growing bit by bit. We remember our former lives usually when we die and return to the domain of the soul, but I think we are coming into a point where the soul is becoming conscious inside our historical existence.

One day in my session, former lives were coming into me, like wrapping bright white light filament around a kite spool. There came a moment where they seemed to hit critical mass, and when they fused into one, there was an explosion of diamond light from my heart. I was catapulted into a state of consciousness where I was an individual, but far beyond Chris Bache—an individuality I had never known before. I came to call this the birth of the diamond soul. Many people are experiencing this; they give it different names. My language is simply my way of describing it. I think the soul—which holds all our former life history—is waking up inside our historical existence and supplanting egoic existence. We have lived egoic existence for thousands of years, but the ego has driven the planet into red-line conditions—unacceptable, stressful conditions—and now we either grow up or go extinct. Growing up, I think, amounts to owning the deep history and deep consciousness that is our truer nature. It’s all divine, of course, but the form of the divine here is our soul nature. And it’s not just individuals waking up—nature is putting enormous pressure to wake up the entire species. The entire species is becoming a species of Christs, a species of Buddhas, a species of prophets—of great spiritual saints and sages of history. That’s the pivot we’re trying to make: growing up, taking the long view—the seven-generation view. When the soul wakes up, our whole history becomes dynamically alive within us. We have been male and female; we have been every race on the planet; we have been every religion on the planet—all of these relative—

Manda Scott: 
And other species, absolutely.

Chris Bache: 
I think that’s what’s happening. We’re being brought to a critical choice point, driven by the ecological crisis and other systemic crises contingent upon the economic realities of the past. We’re coming into a meltdown of those realities—a choice point.

Manda Scott: 
I hear you, and I would agree. If someone is listening to this podcast, by definition they still have some resource and privilege—they have the time and means to do that. You suggest this is perhaps a three-generation span, but I’m wondering where we are in those three generations. We might not be the first of the three generations alive on the planet at the moment; we’ve got more than three alive—Boomers, Gen X, Gen Z, and others. For anybody listening, wherever they are in the span of age, gender, or race, what would you recommend? We don’t have a formula—“go and do this and this and this”—but what concepts could they prioritize? This is going out on New Year’s Day. What do we create as our soul priorities for 2025 that would help move this process forward?

Chris Bache: 
A couple of background assumptions. One: this transition will take the entire resources of the human family. There is no one formula. It will take everything we have—scientific knowledge, economic knowledge, political skills, educational skills, medical skills—to move us through. Two: based on years of studying the past-life literature, my assumption is that each of us has chosen where and when to incarnate with a certain prevision of what we’re getting into—what will be the dominant themes of that incarnation and the resources available within it. This is part of our incarnational psychic makeup. That means each of us is already positioned by our soul to make a contribution to this transition. So it’s not a matter of looking around outside of oneself; it’s a matter of looking deeply into where we are and what we are. The key question is not “What can I do?” The key question is “Will I have the courage to do what is within my reach to do?” If everybody does what is within their reach, we will make it through.

Very simply: become what you believe the planet needs right now. Become it in your personal life. Internalize the beliefs, the habits of mind, the generosity of heart, the clarity of thinking, and the social skills and community networks. If you have a clear understanding of what the planet needs and we begin to do that, then we become a microcosm of the evolutionary pivot. What is alive within us stimulates and activates the people around us who are struggling to do the same thing. We’re all in this together. Our arms are interlinked. One cell awakens another cell.

Manda Scott: 
Yes—the field effect you were talking about earlier. If we can come into alignment, connect to the web of life, ask “What do you want of me?” and be that, it ripples out. It stops our head-minds having to plan. Letting heart-mind lead and head-mind follow is an inversion of how we got here, but it seems important.

Chris Bache: 
For example, we think the future human—the planet—needs a more heart-based epistemology, a heart-based source of action. To put the heart-mind ahead of the head-mind is a reading of what’s emerging, of what we need to do.

Manda Scott: 
Our understanding may yet evolve—I wouldn’t say that’s necessarily an endpoint, but it’s a starting place to move from here.

Chris Bache: 
Deeply—biomimicry. Learning the rhythms of nature. Learning what’s alive in the physical world, the animal world, the world of insects—everything around us. Understanding how we have created imbalance, how we can restore systems, how to create harmony with those systems. Learning from the engineering nature has already accomplished through billions of years of evolution. So many ways.

Manda Scott: 
And healing the trauma—if Francis Waller is right and we are the trauma culture and the Indigenous peoples are a more whole version of humanity. We have ten thousand years of ancestral trauma and potentially previous-life trauma. I talk with people who are fixated on healing their ancestors, and I increasingly feel that if I can heal in the moment, that ripples up and down the timeline—that time is not necessarily one linear thing. Healing now—if I can become a fully realized human being—ripples to my parents and their parents all the way back down the line, perhaps not physical descendants but a spirit-descendant line. That saves me feeling I have to heal ten thousand years of ancestors, which is a big ask and quite demoralizing. How does that land?

Chris Bache: 
It lands well. Within a reincarnational framework, we add the rider that we were our ancestors. We can think of our ancestors this way: we were our ancestors. So when we’re healing our ancestors, in part we’re healing our own lineage. But anybody worth their salt—any mother, any father—who sees a child that is not their own in pain reaches out to help heal that child. Once you immerse yourself in healing, the boundaries expand: healing the trauma of ancestors, healing the traumas of neighbors, actually creating trauma-less societies for our future children. It’s all good work. It’s hard work, and it’s the work of the hour.

Manda Scott: 
People are going to email me asking where they can get enough LSD to start the process. Read the book first, people, because you did things that the rest of us don’t necessarily want to do. Psychedelics are big now. Do you believe everyone should, within a structured and held way and with suitable reflection, explore psychedelics? Or is it that a critical mass does that and the effect rolls out to the rest of us?

Chris Bache: 
I don’t think it’s wise to hold the value that everybody should try psychedelics. Psychedelics are amplifiers of consciousness. What you do with those amplified states of awareness in those precious hours determines their value. You can use them recreationally—go to a concert, talk with friends—or you can use them to expose and heal your shadow and to move into deeper cosmological exploration. But many of us are carrying tensions within our psyche that should not be amplified. Carl Jung would listen to people’s dreams on their first day working with him, and he wouldn’t work with some people because he knew they were not ready for the depth of work that would emerge. I think this is true for psychedelics. There are some people who should—and a lot who should not—use psychedelics. Given their current patterns of consciousness, it’s too strong a medicine. They need a gentler, slower way in. Among people who are basically healthier—

Manda Scott: 
Do you know anyone who has a healthy psyche?

Chris Bache: 
I know some who have a healthier psyche.

Manda Scott: 
Yes. I’m thinking of a lot of my friends who are really wounded. I think many people I know have healthier psyches, but all of us are carrying quite deep, frozen hearts.

Chris Bache: 
If you choose to work with psychedelics, I would say: very controlled circumstances. Batten down the hatches carefully before you set out into deep water. Be conscientious about dose. Ensure purity of substance—what you get on the street can be problematic. Use careful containers—therapeutically monitored, structured experiences. I don’t think it’s good to do what I did and work solo; it adds unnecessary burden. It’s good to have a group—

Manda Scott: 
Even though you were held by the person who held you.

Chris Bache: 
I wasn’t totally alone. I was held by my wife, Carol, and my manager was a PhD psychologist. But it wasn’t healthy in the sense that I didn’t have a group I could share my experiences with beyond that inner circle. I wasn’t able to talk about it and take in other people’s experiences until way too far down the road. Ayahuasca communities, psilocybin communities—where people can journey together, process together, mirror each other, help expose the shadow in their post-session personalities—are valuable. The greatest danger of working with psychedelics is psychic inflation. You can think that because—

Manda Scott: 
You have become God—now I can tell you everything.

Chris Bache: 
Exactly. Because you’ve had a special experience, you think you’re a special person. That’s a big fallacy.

Manda Scott: 
There are people in the incoming administration in the US who have taken ayahuasca. I’m sure they’re wonderful human beings, but breaking everything… One of the things I heard from an ayahuasca who has spent very large amounts of time in the forest is that Western people tend to want to come and do it and go away again, and don’t want to spend the weeks and months really getting to know the plant and letting go of the ego. It’s a process, not an event—a long process. We’re not used to that in our culture.

Chris Bache: 
Let me recommend a book on ayahuasca to your audience: Bill Barnard’s book, published by Columbia University Press, which is significant. His book is Liquid Light. Bill is a university professor at Southern Methodist University. He had several books under his belt—he’s a well-recognized philosopher of religion with books on William James and Henri Bergson. Liquid Light tells the story of years—decades—of going down to South America, living in the Santo Daime community, working every sabbatical and vacation with his teachers there. It’s an analysis of the Santo Daime community and also of his own experiences within it—an academic becoming autobiographical without being trapped in his personal story. He’s a beautiful writer, and his experiences are very powerful. Brilliant.

Manda Scott: 
I’ll find that and put it in the show notes. I could go on forever, but we’re heading toward the end of our time. A question with all the codas of what we’ve just said: it strikes me you’re probably familiar with an emerging network of people working together with a variety of psychedelic substances. Are you seeing networks of consciousness such that people are—this is about to sound really flaky—but a lot of the push I’m getting is to do the work so that I can actually connect with all of my students in the dream, in a way that we’re both fully aware of. Not the “I saw you in the dream last night; you did this,” and I have no awareness of it. That we move to methods of human networking similar to—but beyond—the digital networking of the last 20 years. Are you seeing anything approaching that? Or, if not, can you speak to what is happening in terms of a collective community?

Chris Bache: 
First, I want to own my limitations. Even though I’ve published this book and speak at some conferences, I don’t speak at most psychedelic conferences because my work is pretty radical, and the focus of the psychedelic renaissance right now is on therapy and careful scientific studies demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics. That’s perfectly fine—that’s where we need to be. But the movement is not yet pushing the cosmological territory I’ve pushed in my work.

Manda Scott: 
It’ll get there. There must be somebody somewhere—it can’t be just you.

Chris Bache: 
There are people—like Bill Barnard—and a lot is still underground. I’m aware of certain trends in the renaissance community and the psychedelic community, but I don’t have comprehensive access to what’s happening. I worked in isolation. My work is unusually intense and extreme, and I live a pretty quiet life around that. But I do see people doing what you describe—cultivating communities of paranormal contact within the dream state, extended dreaming. There are people working in meditation, trying to integrate psychedelics into meditation circles. There’s a lot going on, a lot moving. I think the internet is, in a sense, the physical manifestation—the hard wires—of this emerging field consciousness. Even if we don’t accomplish these networks psychically, we certainly can physically. We’re on a network right now; this is a global network we’re part of.

Manda Scott: 
It is—but somebody could pull the plug tomorrow. If China or Russia decides to switch it off or monitor it so it’s not safe to say anything outside a narrow bandwidth, it could vanish. The freedom we have now is not a given. If we could talk to each other without needing the internet, it would be hard to interfere with that.

Chris Bache: 
It would be great. The complication, of course, is the clarity and purity of the transmission, because the personal psyche throws up all sorts of filters.

Manda Scott: 
Ego gets in the way—head-mind gets in the way. We never got to—earlier you said you’d come to why you stopped. Did you feel you covered that? Did you want to cover that? If not, is there anything else you feel we could usefully cover in the time we have?

Chris Bache: 
That might be a good place to wrap up some of the discussion, because it's relevant to where we might go. I stopped for two reasons. I stopped first because my physical system—my subtle energy system, my prana or qi—was running so hot after all these years of practice that it was producing certain physical symptoms that left me continually uncomfortable. I describe these in the book, but basically I understood enough about chronic energy and Ayurvedic medicine to understand what was happening, and I was just running too much energy. But that's not the major reason I stopped. The major reason I stopped was heartache. It was getting increasingly difficult to come back from the deep states of ecstatic transcendence—immersion in the divine fabric—back into my time-space reality.

There are great beings who are able to sustain those transcendental states in their time-space personality. They are great masters, and truly, all honor to the great masters. I'm not one of those beings. This is a path of temporary immersion that's different than the path of contemplative presence. I can go into those states, but I have to come out of them, and eventually coming back out just became too painful a separation, so I stopped. And I knew I would be stopping for the rest of my life, because it takes years and years of momentum to develop the energy to break into these high, high energy states. If I did a massive dose of LSD right now, I would not be able to go back to where I was working at the end of my 20-year journey.

So I knew I was stopping for the rest of my life, but it was important for me to stop. I had to first learn how to manage the heartache, and then begin the slower process of working the living memories—actively living memories—into my physical existence, which conversations like this actually help me do. It's healing for me to talk about these things with you. And the way that applies to some of your listeners is: be careful about how much you bite off in your sessions, because even if you're really committed to conscientious integration, you can bite off more than you can chew—or more than it's wise for you to chew.

We can learn a lot from the contemplative traditions. It's one of the advantages I had going into this work. I was teaching courses in mysticism and meditation, teaching courses in shamanism and Buddhism. So I understood the literature of mysticism, the practices, the purification processes, and Ian and I tried to use those processes in my own work. There's a lot of wisdom there. It serves you to be well read, and to recognize the limitations of any one incarnation. In some ways, I went to places that were so deep it will take me not just one incarnation, but multiple incarnations, to truly integrate them—by which I mean being able to manifest those levels of consciousness inside my physical consciousness, comfortably.

Manda Scott: 
I think we've got the health warnings fairly clear on here. If you're going to work with things, work with somebody who really knows what they're doing. Me and my apprentice are working to find people we can pass others on to, because we get emails saying, “I took substance X, and basically I'm having a psychotic breakdown. What can I do?” And we're shamanic practitioners—it's not our field—so we're trying to pass this on to people who can actually help, but they're few and far between, because there are a lot more people who think they can help than the ones who can actually help.

So take great care. Find and test your people out before you decide to do something that is irreversible. Do the work beforehand, do the work during, and do the work after to integrate, integrate, integrate—and do it because you're doing it in service to life, not because you're trying to make your ego feel happy. Have I missed anything out on the—

Chris Bache: 
Health world? I think it's great. And if you do your work well, one of the things that happens is you lose all fear of death. Once you transition several times into that reality, you know in your bones, from your own experience, that death is not an end of anything. It's simply the end of an incarnational cycle, and there is absolutely nothing to fear about death. Death is homecoming. All of the Hollywood bullshit thrown up at us—dark places and demons and ghosts and all this stuff—it's just nonsense. Ninety-nine percent of people die and make a transition into the light perfectly naturally and comfortably. If you're afraid of dying, you've got your entire metaphysics upside down. Death is homecoming. Death is the end of your matriculation. It's the harvesting of your life. Birth should be mourned. Birth is where the work begins. It's like being a freshman in college—it's hard. Graduation is wonderful, right?

And when you lose your fear of death and begin to understand the deeper, meaningful challenges embedded in our time-space experiences, your whole game of life changes, because death is what people fear more than anything else. If you don't have that fear, you're going into a different lifestyle, a different way of living—a more joyful way of living.

Manda Scott: 
Thank you. That feels to me a fantastic place to end. Does that feel good to you? It feels good to me. All right, in that case, Chris, thank you so much for coming on to the accidental gold podcast. This has been an absolute delight. I have enjoyed every moment, and what a way to start the year.

Chris Bache: 
Thank you. Thank you, Amanda, and thank you for your work. We need all of the awareness that we can bring to ourselves, and you are certainly bringing awareness to many people. Thank you.

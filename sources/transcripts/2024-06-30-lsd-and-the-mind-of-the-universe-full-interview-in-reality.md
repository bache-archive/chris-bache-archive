In this short monologue, Chris Bache sketches the cosmology and evolutionary arc revealed in his

two-decade, high-dose LSD practice. He distinguishes rigorous, therapeutic use—rooted in Stanislav

Grof’s framework—from casual associations with “the 60s,” emphasizing cycles of purification and

death–rebirth that open progressively into deeper, more intelligent, and more luminous dimensions of

reality. Bache describes a hierarchy of levels in which higher strata source the lower, culminating

beyond time–space in “pure light.” He recounts repeated openings into species consciousness and a

vision of humanity entering a pivotal dark night followed by a great awakening—the birth of a “future

human” whose soul-awareness flowers within history. Reincarnational learning integrates across lives

to a fusion point symbolized as diamond light. Evolution, he argues, is guided by self-arising

intelligence rather than mere chance. Holding this vision, he urges trust through the purification now

unfolding, insisting that the creative universe is “very happy with us.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’m always hesitant to jump into this, because my experiences come from shamanic,

rigorous use of LSD. When people hear “LSD,” they think of the 60s or hallucinations, but this work

sits inside a therapeutic tradition—Stan Grof’s tradition—systematically engaging hyper-intense

states of awareness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Entering these states brings tremendous purification—death and rebirth, again and

again. If you go deep and often, there is a progressive initiation into deeper levels of reality, and

you come out with a sense of the large structure of things. I try to summarize that progression in

Diamonds from Heaven.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The cosmos has many levels. The physical is the dense level, with layers even inside

it down to the quantum. As you move into non-physical dimensions, each higher layer is more

intelligent, more energetic, more conscious, and it sources the levels below. Eventually you leave

time–space and pass through bardic echoes of it, and beyond that into extra-samsaric reality—domains

of pure light.

**CHRIS BACHE:** You cannot take your ego there. To enter, you surrender what you were in the lower

realms. The lower aren’t bad; they are specific, individualized expressions of the larger reality. To

be a citizen of those higher domains for hours, you stop being Chris, stop being human, stop being a

time–space being. The experience is one of profound homecoming—a return to primal wholeness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Our evolutionary theories are partly right but deeply incomplete. Chance plays a

role, but what presents itself is a self-arising intelligence manifesting through time and space. It is

not a god outside tinkering, nor top-down design. It is creativity emerging from within reality itself.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In deep states you move beyond linear time into deep time, sometimes beyond any time

at all. Coming in and out of those states gives a perspective on where this world is going. There is a

direction. The end result is a cultivated trust—trust that where you are and what you are doing fits a

wiser pattern.

**CHRIS BACHE:** When the bubble of the ego pops, you don’t just drop into unitive awareness; at the

subtle level you can open into collective consciousness. Many times I opened into our species mind.

Jung was right—the species psyche is coherent. Touching it, it is natural to be shown something of our

evolutionary trajectory.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Over years, I was taught that humanity is approaching a great fruition—a pivotal

awakening into a new platform of consciousness. But as with mystics who pass through a dark night,

our species must pass through a collective dark night to purge the karmic residues of egoic violence

and competition. A crisis is unfolding—a loss of control and structural breakdown—but on the other

side we are not merely making a better society. We are giving birth to a new form of the human

species.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Reincarnation appears as a given: birth and death across lifetimes, collecting

experience. In my sessions, many lives reintegrated like winding kite string on a spool, reaching a

critical mass and exploding into brilliant diamond light in the heart. That showed me where

reincarnation is taking us—not just incremental grades but a fusion point where the soul awakens

inside time and space. That is the future human we are birthing.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Humanity is built for speed in the long view. Though we live in hundred-year cycles,

the universe thinks in billions. Under intensified awareness—especially amid trial—we can shed the

past quickly, enact the soul in history, and move into clearer communion with the creative depth of

reality. The saints’ translucence foreshadows what is opening for the species.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Near the end of my journey, I was stripped down and thrown far into the future,

allowed to “try on” that form—an extraordinarily beautiful being. It is crucial to know we are

birthing something magnificent; otherwise the pain of purification can swallow us. Like a mother in

labor, we must not yield to despair. We must understand the birth.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Lastly, what keeps coming through is that the Divine—the creative consciousness of

the universe—is very happy with us. We make mistakes, yes, but in the long view we’re working hard

and right on time. There is more hard work ahead, but the trajectory is good.

- Stratified cosmology: higher, more conscious levels source the lower, denser realms

- Ego-surrender as gateway beyond time–space into domains of pure light

- Evolution guided by self-arising intelligence, not mere chance

- Deep time perspectives cultivate trust in the unfolding process

- Openings into species consciousness and a coherent collective psyche

- A collective dark night preceding a species-wide awakening

- Reincarnation integrating to a fusion point: “diamond light” and the future human

- Toward clearer communion between physical life and spiritual reality

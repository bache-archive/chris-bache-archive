Emmy Vadnais: Did you connect with a being, or beings, or angels or other divine entities? And if you could, share a little bit about what that realm was like.

Chris Bache: In all the years when I was doing this work, I never encountered a divine being who said, “I’m God. This is what I am.” It wasn’t like that. I would go deeper into a level of consciousness and experience a communion with this consciousness, and this consciousness would teach me. It knew me; it would teach me and show me things, and it would crush me and then bring me forward into still deeper levels. I would go into those deeper levels, enter into communion with them, and internalize their energy. I was with this consciousness, but it never crystallized into a specific form.

I always felt its presence. It guided my sessions. I could enter into dialogue with it, enter into communion with it. It would dissolve me into itself. But it never crystallized into what you might call a personality of God, or a person of God. It just kept getting larger and larger, deeper and deeper, more and more vast.

I think that many of our theologies of God—our thinking about God—are really based on what I would call early encounters with an infinite intelligence. This infinite intelligence is far too large ever to be concretized in the historical lineages we recognize in the world’s traditions.

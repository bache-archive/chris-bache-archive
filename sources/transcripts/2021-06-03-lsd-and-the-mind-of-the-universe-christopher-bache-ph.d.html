Hi everyone. Welcome to “LSD and the Mind of the Universe,” with author Chris Bache. The format today is simple: I’ll introduce everyone, then we’ll have a Q&amp;A. As John said, please put your question in the chat, let us know who it’s directed to, and we’ll try to get to as many as we can. Our panel, Teresa and David, have some questions that will be asked first.</p>
<p>I have the honor to introduce Chris Bache. We’re so happy he’s here with us today from North Carolina. Chris is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He’s also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory board of the Grof Legacy Training. His passion has been the study of the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. An award‑winning teacher and international speaker, he has written four books: Life Cycles, a study of reincarnation in light of contemporary consciousness research; Dark Night, Early Dawn, a pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness; The Living Classroom, an exploration of collective fields of consciousness in teaching; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe, the story of his 20‑year journey with LSD. Chris is a father of three, a vaccineer, and lives in Weaverville, North Carolina. Welcome, Chris, and thank you so much for being here today.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
Thank you, Donna—my pleasure. And thank you, everyone, for spending part of your Sunday with me. It’s a pleasure to be here, a pleasure to talk about these things, and I’m really looking forward to our discussion after my comments. Let me share my screen so I can put up a PowerPoint—please let me know if this is coming through correctly. John, are we looking good?</p>
<p>John Hock
We are looking good. Good.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
All right. What I’d like to do today is take you into some of the highlights—a kind of highlight reel—of my book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe. As Donna mentioned, I’ve written four books, but all of them come out of my psychedelic work, and this book summarizes the entire trajectory of my 20‑year journey working with LSD. I consider it probably the most important book I will write in my life, and it’s an honor to share it with you here.</p>
<p>By way of background: when I came out of graduate school in 1978, I was a philosopher of religion and an atheistically inclined agnostic, looking for where to take my research next. At that juncture I met the work of Stanislav Grof, and it changed the course of my life. Two books in particular—Realms of the Human Unconscious, which Stan had published two years earlier, and LSD Psychotherapy, his manual on conducting psychedelic sessions. I immediately saw not only the psychological significance of Stan’s work, but the philosophical significance—the possibility of exploring, experientially, deep states of consciousness that allow us to encounter the deep structure of the universe itself. That, I recognized, had profound philosophical implications.</p>
<p>So I split my life in half. During the day, I taught at the university—philosophy and religious studies, doing the things professors do. At night, I began a 20‑year journey working with high doses of LSD, following Stan Grof’s protocols, and recording my experiences systematically. That’s the backstory to the book.</p>
<p>In Stan’s work, he differentiates clearly between low‑dose psychotherapy and high‑dose psychedelic therapy. Low dose—maybe up to 100 sessions—unfolds the mind gradually, layer by layer. High-dose psychedelic therapy was limited to three sessions, designed to trigger something approximating a near‑death experience for people facing death. After three introductory medium‑dose sessions, I chose to work in the high‑dose protocol. I eventually did a total of 73 high‑dose sessions, and I tried to be as systematic and rigorous as I could: same set and setting, same sitter, same substance, same dose level, same recording process, even the same location in northeast Ohio. I mention that because the setting can influence the nature of the experiences themselves. This was a long, sustained inquiry into the deep structure of consciousness and the universe.</p>
<p>I saw myself at the time as doing an extended course of psychedelic therapy, but when I got to the end and looked back, I realized this was more than therapy. I was encountering phenomena and challenges not addressed in the psychedelic therapy literature. Eventually I named this particular protocol “psychedelic exploration.” The methodology is that of psychedelic therapy—working in isolation with a sitter, eyeshades, headphones, the whole nine yards. The difference is the number of sessions. The high number turns it into something more than therapy—an exploration of the deep structure of the universe.</p>
<p>Of course there are many uses for psychedelics: recreational, creativity, and more. Let me mention three that stand out in my world. One is therapeutic healing, as shown in the work of MAPS, which is generating so much important attention in this renaissance. The second is spiritual awakening, reflected in the dialogue between the Buddhist and psychedelic communities—Zigzag Zen, the use of psychedelics to facilitate awakening into one’s deeper essential nature. That’s actually why I started: to accelerate my own spiritual transformation. The third is cosmological exploration—and that’s what my journey turned into. By this I mean not simply collecting insights that arise whenever we open in a psychedelic state, but systematically pushing the boundaries of consciousness again and again, entering deeper communion with the consciousness within and behind the universe itself.</p>
<p>I kept careful notes of all my sessions, writing each within 24 hours, tracking dates, even looking at astrological variables, exploring correlations that Stan and Richard Tarnas have proposed.</p>
<p>A few more introductory comments. The story I tell in LSD and the Mind of the Universe is not primarily a personal story; it’s primarily a cosmological story. I found it useful to picture a series of sine waves representing sessions, overlapping to emphasize the continuity that runs between them. Insights into my personal life tended to arise at the beginnings and endings of sessions—when I was leaving and returning to time‑space reality. Working at 500–600 micrograms—which, as I explain in the book, is a protocol I don’t recommend—when I was in the peak hours of my sessions, I was usually operating far beyond my personal reality, at least after the first ten sessions or so. Sometimes an entire session was devoted to personal healing. Sometimes I was shown correlations between what I was seeing and my personal life. But for the most part, I was operating in states of consciousness far outside my personal consciousness.</p>
<p>[brief interruption]</p>
<p>Donna Loeffler
Hold on, Chris—you were muted. Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>Chris Bache
I actually filtered out a lot of personal material and healing experiences because I didn’t consider them central to the story I wanted to tell. If you’re writing about therapeutic psychedelic use, then personal experiences are essential. But I was functioning as a philosopher of consciousness. I wanted to explore deep structure. All of us have a personal story, but that tends to fall away the deeper one enters the cosmological journey.</p>
<p>I found continuity between sessions: one would end and the next would start where the previous had left off, with some overlap. In that process I went through not one, but a series of death‑rebirth experiences. Think of time‑space reality below the line and transpersonal consciousness above it. Crossing from time‑space to spiritual consciousness involves ego death—Alex Grey illustrates this powerfully—a complete loss of ordinary identity. As I continued to press the limits of consciousness, I went through not just egoic death‑rebirth, but a repeating cycle at deeper levels. Using Stan’s vocabulary: psychic, subtle, causal levels of consciousness.</p>
<p>I don’t have a vested interest in a particular metaphysical ladder; in my experience, the universe is infinitely deep. One can enter hundreds of levels. The point is: as you stabilize at one level, going deeper requires yet another cycle of complete surrender to enter the initiation available there.</p>
<p>Working with high doses of LSD has been compared to a nuclear bomb. The bomb and LSD were both created in the same decade. A long, sustained series of psychedelic experiences, focused therapeutically, triggers a sustained “nuclear explosion”—not only de‑structuring reality as you’ve known it, but exposing deeper levels that were always there but invisible until this explosion brought them into awareness. We’re not talking about bombs, of course; we’re talking about this beautiful universe: 100 billion galaxies, billions of stars in the Milky Way. I’ll use that as backdrop to touch on turning points in my journey and levels of reality I entered.</p>
<p>Looking back, I identified five core levels or cycles of death and rebirth: personal mind; collective mind (species mind); archetypal mind; causal oneness (the One); and Diamond Luminosity. That’s the structure I used to tell the travelogue in the book.</p>
<p>At the personal mind level—Chapter 2, “Crossing the Boundary of Birth and Death”—this was classic perinatal death‑rebirth. I felt like a poster boy for Stan Grof’s description: intense convulsions, confrontations with the meaninglessness and limits of life. Over two years and ten sessions, the universe snapped me like a twig by forcing me to become the exact opposite of everything I knew myself to be. I entered as a white male academic, passionately interested in the meaning of life. I became the exact opposite—hundreds of women, women of color, women with no interest in philosophical inquiry. It was terrifying. When I finally surrendered, I was flipped into the positive side of women’s experiences and taken on an extraordinary journey under the arm of the Great Mother.</p>
<p>I believe in reincarnation—we’ve had lives as men and women—but this wasn’t simply encountering former lives. The message was: where you are going, gender does not exist. Let go. When I let go of my identity as Chris Bache, I entered the beginnings of a deep conversation, a deep communion with the universe. I thought after such a deep ego death my suffering was over and I would be introduced to a banquet of cosmological insights. That’s not what happened at the collective mind level.</p>
<p>There are several chapters here. My sessions divided themselves into two halves: a purifying/cleansing stage and an ecstatic stage. In the two years following “Crossing the Boundary of Birth and Death,” in the purifying stage I began entering levels involving hundreds of thousands of people, thousands and thousands of years—a vast domain of terrible anguish, suffering, and violence. I was brought back into this domain consistently, taken deeper and deeper. At first I thought it was a deepening of ego death. But it went on so long, involving so many people in such excruciating detail, that I came to a different conclusion: in my sessions, my personal transformation had been surrendered and became a process of collective transformation. The healing and uncovering of trauma was not about my personal healing or trauma, but about collective healing—the pain our species has gathered over thousands of years.</p>
<p>When I went into the ecstatic portion of the same sessions, I entered what I called deep time—“Deep Time in the Soul.” For one year, across seven sessions, I repeatedly experienced my life from start to finish as a simultaneous present: the beginning, the end, all the middle, as a completed whole—something yet to be and already complete when I first entered deep time. It was extraordinarily powerful and moving, but when I came out, I lost it—I couldn’t remember. By going back to the same state again and again, my recall improved. I was learning how to stay awake inside deep time.</p>
<p>This is an important epistemological point: when you systematically enter states so far removed from anything we know in time and space, it’s very hard to bring back experiences intact. But with rigor and discipline, returning to the same state, consciousness adapts to the unusual conditions, and you learn how to stay awake in states that previously swallowed you. This repeated itself over and over: breaking into a new state made recall difficult; repetition strengthened it.</p>
<p>In my 20‑year journey, I worked for four years, stopped for six (for reasons given in the book), then resumed for an intense ten years. This is where my journey stopped after four years; then, after the six‑year hiatus, when I began again—reported in “Initiation into the Universe”—the ocean of suffering picked up exactly where it had stopped, without missing a beat, and continued to deepen. Meanwhile, in the ecstatic portion, I was taken on an extraordinary journey into the universe, completely transcending anything to do with my personal life. It was as if the consciousness guiding my sessions was giving me a crash course in Cosmology 101.</p>
<p>I give names to all my sessions. I take notes, break them into bullet points; the name brings the session to mind. My goal as a philosopher is to hold my entire journey in mind at the same time. The names of the sessions I address in this chapter are as follows.</p>
<p>All of these were operating at the subtle level of consciousness, beyond the psychic level, taking me deep into how the universe is put together. “The Master Plan” was an initiation into core themes of humanity’s evolution—and I’ll come back to this later. Eventually, the ocean of suffering culminated in Session 24, “Healing the Collective Womb.” The suffering reached unprecedented levels, then culminated in an orgy of healing—healing this collective pain—and then it disappeared. The ocean of suffering never reappeared in any subsequent session. We then went on to the next level of work.</p>
<p>The next level for me involved encounters at the archetypal level—“The Greater Realm of Archetypal Reality.” I can break these experiences into two tiers. One took place at the highest subtle level—the Platonic level—where I experienced archetypes that lay far beyond time and space. They were not archetypes as Plato described—unchanging, eternal ideas—but vast, living processes so radically beyond anything I knew inside time and space that I literally could not wrap my mind around them. The closest my mind could come was to see them as galaxies—simply the best approximation I could muster. They operated in a different order of time and intentionality and were the constitutive forces responsible for creating time and space and the reality unfolding within it.</p>
<p>At a lower subtle tier, also archetypal, I entered what you might think of as a Jungian level of consciousness, where I repeatedly experienced our species’ mind operating as a single whole—one mind of the entire species. I was given repeated lessons in how this works: how each of our individual minds are fractal aspects of the species mind; how our individual karma is part of our collective karma. I began to have experiences of collective reincarnation—the entire species incarnating generation by generation as a single unified whole. Previously I understood reincarnation in terms of individual souls choosing lives for individual development. Here that dissolved into the experience of the species as a single organism evolving itself through a profound collective process, with our individual lives as fractal aspects of it. The magnitude of what I was seeing completely reframed my understanding of the intelligence operating in the universe and in our evolution. These are the sessions I address in this chapter.</p>
<p>I’ll point out how much cleansing is involved, even at this high archetypal level. Session 28, “The Fever Is Broken,” was a very high, very pure, celestial first encounter with causal reality, after which I was plunged into three grueling sessions of excruciating purification. It took me a long time to understand, but eventually I saw that every deeper level of reality functions at a higher level of energy. When you break through to a deeper level, your entire psychophysical system has to be purified to handle the enormous flows of energy there. This repeated again and again: after a major breakthrough, the following session was always a “carrying out the garbage” session—deep cleansing. I began to dread the session after a breakthrough. If you just touch a deep state briefly, this may not manifest. But if your goal is sustained awareness at a particular level, you must go through the cleansing ordeal; otherwise your experiences will be fragmented and you won’t bring back a coherent story.</p>
<p>After archetypal reality, I moved into what I came to understand as causal reality. “Causal Oneness” was an extraordinary year of blessings—one after another. The four sessions in this chapter include: “The Forest,” an experience of what the Buddhists call shunyata—emptiness of self, profound transparency, no self in me, no self anywhere; the world as diversity with complete interpenetration and no separate self anywhere. “Singing the Universe Away” culminated in an experience of the fertile void out of which all existence springs. “Jesus’s Blood” was an experience of profound, cosmic love unlike anything I had ever known. “The Birth of the Diamond Soul” concerned reincarnation. The traditional teaching is that when we achieve a certain spiritual maturity, we awaken to our spiritual essence and then leave time and space—moksha, escaping samsara, entering the Pure Land, the Garden, Heaven. In Session 38 I was given a very different model. I began to experience all my former lives coming into me very quickly, like wrapping a filament of white light around a kite spool. And at some point,</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
All these lives fused, and there was a huge energy generated that catapulted me into a state of consciousness beyond any I had experienced up to that time. I was still an individual, but in a way that exceeded any frame of reference I’d previously imagined. When this happened, there was an explosion of diamond light from my chest, and I was given a series of teachings about where reincarnation is taking humanity. We’re not simply growing incrementally—lifetime by lifetime, century by century—making small improvements and actualizing our innate potential bit by bit. Eventually, we come to a point where all of our former lives merge and we experience our soul.</p>
<p>I think this happens when we die and return to spirituality, but the birth of the diamond soul is the birth of soul consciousness inside our physical incarnation. Humanity is evolving toward a point where every person will be born not into a contracted, egoic consciousness limited to time-space identity, but as a soul—more conscious, fully aware of their past, and in deeper communion with surrounding spiritual reality.</p>
<p>From here, my sessions took me into what I describe in the chapter called Diamond Luminosity. That chapter covers 26 sessions and four years of work. In those four years, I entered this state—Diamond Luminosity—four times, and only four times. It was a reality beyond anything I had previously touched: exceptionally clear, luminous. I had encountered light many times before, but this was a higher order of light. When I call it Diamond Luminosity, I don’t mean a metaphor; I’m trying to identify a particular register, a particular quality of light. I learned that light has many levels, many gradations. This was an exceptionally pure state of luminous awareness—what Buddhists would call Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.</p>
<p>Between those four immersions were repeated episodes of deep cleansing, profound purification, many personal healings, and then returns to these states of hyper-clarity. There’s so much more I could say, but I’ll move on to the ninth chapter. I wish I had written the book in this order, because this is the order that truly fits.</p>
<p>One recurring theme throughout my work, going back to the chapter on the initiation End of the Universe, was a master story of humanity. I kept being taken into the deep future and into the structural evolutionary processes underpinning history. I was given visions of where humanity is in its evolution and where we’re going. In the book, I pulled those bits and pieces together into one chapter: the birth of the future human. When I began this work, I never imagined I’d be talking about the birth of the future human. I thought of it as personal transformation, personal awakening. Yet this chapter may be the most important, because if the visions are true, they concern my children, my grandchildren, your grandchildren—all the children of our grandchildren.</p>
<p>The vision is that humanity is approaching a turning point in its long evolutionary journey, one that will forever change the conditions of life on this planet. In “visions of awakening,” I gathered six powerful visions indicating that the creative intelligence of the universe is trying to awaken the entire species—not just individuals, but the species as a whole. For there to be a profound collective awakening, there must be a profound purification.</p>
<p>In session 55, which took place in 1995, I was taken deep into the future, not as an individual but as the human species as a whole. I experienced the death and rebirth of our entire species. I experienced the world entering a profound global systems crisis that seemed to have been triggered by a series of ecological crises. At that time, I wasn’t informed on ecology—I was not aware of the challenges we now all recognize. Yet I was taken into a future where humanity was brought to its knees: a radical loss of our certainties, a complete loss of control, an absolute species-threatening crisis that went on for years. And just when it was at its worst, the storm passed. When the survivors picked themselves up and began to reassemble, they were different—changed profoundly at the core of their being by the intensity of what we had gone through. Their hearts were different. Their minds were different. They began to generate new patterns of civilization based on new values, new understanding, new insights awakened during the crisis.</p>
<p>The 11th chapter, “Final Vision,” is the last year of my work, including one particularly intense session—the most radical strip-down I experienced—taking me far into the future and giving me a series of experiences of our universe that seemed to capstone the journey. I won’t try to summarize it here. The last chapter, “Coming Off the Mountain,” describes what happened when I stopped my journey.</p>
<p>Long story, but this was the hardest chapter for me to write. It took over a year. Having been given so many gifts, I thought I could simply withdraw and receive the blessings of the visions. I had been given the gift of a lifetime as a philosopher. Over time, however, I entered a deep existential sadness. I came to realize I was suffering a withdrawal from intimate communion with the divine fabric. I eventually realized I was simply waiting to die so I could return to intimacy with the divine, to dissolve into the divine light again. Once you’ve dissolved into Diamond Luminosity, time-space can lose its appeal.</p>
<p>It took about 10 years to consolidate back into time-space in a way that allowed me to live contentedly within its conditions. I did so by grabbing my life and focusing on living in the physical world and on assimilating the implications of the visions I’d been given. All my books come out of my psychedelic work. The work on reincarnation comes from my early work in deep time. Dark Night, Early Dawn—though published after my sessions had ended—discusses my journey, but only the first half. Its core theme is the collective structure of consciousness and the collective import of our transformative practices.</p>
<p>Then I wrote The Living Classroom in 2008. Even though my students never knew about my psychedelic experiences—I didn’t talk about them on campus for obvious legal reasons—I found that my students were being impacted by my work. There was a ripple effect: the deeper I went into the unified fabric of reality, the more ripples of transformation seemed to radiate around me. I had to study this, to understand what was happening. The Living Classroom is about collective consciousness; I don’t mention psychedelics because the issue is the nature of consciousness itself. It doesn’t matter which transformational method you use—if you go deeply enough, ramifications will spread out around you in 360 degrees.</p>
<p>All of this comes out of my psychedelic work. LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven really tells the core story of this journey. Thank you for letting me describe it today.</p>
<p>Donna Loeffler 
Thank you so much, Chris. It does tell the story in detail—an amazing book, which I highly recommend, especially after hearing this talk. Before we move on to the Q&amp;A, I’d like to introduce our two co-hosts. One of our co-hosts, Teresa, is going to ask a few questions, but I’ll give introductions now.</p>
<p>Teresa Marie is a certified coach and speaker on neuroscience and consciousness. She has a master’s degree in organizational development from John F. Kennedy University, has spoken internationally, and has a TEDx talk on what the dying can teach the living. Teresa and Dr. David Jackson, an anesthesiologist, co-facilitate psychedelic psychotherapy sessions using ketamine and other psychoactive medicines. David uses his medical, scientific, and problem-solving background to work with clients to find the right medicine, and Teresa supports clients through the integration work. The goal is to make clients conscious of unconscious patterns that keep them in cycles of depression, anxiety, and addiction so they can experience personal transformation. Their integrated approach helps clients achieve a more meaningful existence.</p>
<p>Teresa, you want to say hello?</p>
<p>Teresa Marie 
Hello. How are you?</p>
<p>Donna Loeffler 
And Dr. David Jackson. Dr. Jackson is an anesthesiologist and functional medicine doctor with his BSEE from Rice University and MD from Southwestern Medical School. He developed his interest in transformative mental wellness and entheogenic treatment of addiction in a family member after 30-plus years of failed conventional therapy. Using his experience in anesthesiology, Dr. Jackson has developed specific means for mitigating undesirable effects of pharmacological treatment while developing compounded therapies tailored for optimal effect, timing, and safety. He emphasizes the importance of interactions with concurrent medications, age, coexisting medical conditions, medical and therapeutic history, precision dosing, chemical purity, and safety through the education of therapists and clients. David partners with Teresa for an integrative approach to transformative therapy for enduring results, and offers telemedicine consultations to determine the best approach to wellness. Welcome, David.</p>
<p>Okay, we’re going to the Q&amp;A and we’ll start with Teresa.</p>
<p>Teresa Marie 
That was an amazing talk. I have to tell everybody: his book is really wonderful. Can everybody hear me okay? Great. You worked with Stan Grof early on, with a lot of protocols. Many people ask whether you can reach these states of consciousness without psychedelics. How would you compare Holotropic Breathwork to your high-dose LSD sessions, given your training and dialog with Stan?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I’ve not done Stan’s formal training in Holotropic Breathwork, but we’ve been colleagues in dialog and on podiums together. I consider Stan the primary intellectual figure I’ve engaged as I unfolded my account. Absolutely, one can enter these states without psychedelics. Psychedelics are amplifiers of consciousness; in the end, it’s consciousness that does the work. Many people have written to me since the book came out, saying they’ve had similar experiences as lifelong meditators without psychedelics.</p>
<p>As an academic, I’ve taught comparative mysticism and studied the great spiritual masters, who clearly moved into these states and even deeper. All honor to them—they’ve always been my guides. One can move into these states without psychedelics, but we’re talking not just years or decades of work; we’re talking lifetimes of consistently pushing these boundaries. The great masters have been at this for many lifetimes.</p>
<p>My sense is that Holotropic Breathwork is a powerful, evocative amplifier of consciousness. It can evoke states equally strong to psychedelic states. I don’t have enough experience to be definitive, but in speaking with many practitioners, I’d say Breathwork can generate states comparable to low or medium-dose LSD sessions, but not the type of high-dose states that open in a sustained series. These are points on a continuum. I’ve had very deep Breathwork experiences that were, in many respects, comparable to my psychedelic experiences.</p>
<p>Teresa Marie 
Thank you. You also talk about the future human and the suffering involved in transformation—which is a shame, but it propels us. Can you share more about your visions? Have some of what you saw in the ’90s come to pass, or are you still waiting?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
The consistent theme in my sessions was positive: humanity is coming to a turning point in history—a collective spiritual explosion—driven from underneath, as if decided at a cosmological level, rising up through us and surfacing in our individual lives. It’s larger than the sum of our individual efforts.</p>
<p>There was only one session where I was taken into the specific conditions of our collective death and rebirth—session 55. I wasn’t given details or timelines. I didn’t see specifics like COVID-19. What I experienced was the entire species brought to its knees: profound compression, loss of control, deep existential anxiety, near-hopelessness—being overwhelmed by conditions. In the depths of that near–extinction event, we metamorphosed. We became more than we had been. Leading up to that, I was shown the nuts and bolts: reincarnation. We’ve been evolving for thousands of years. Gestation is long and gradual; birth is short and cathartic. Likewise, human evolution is long and gradual, but the birth of the next level—the future human, the diamond soul in history—is relatively short and cathartic. I don’t know how long it will take; I’d anticipate multiple generations. This is an evolutionary pivot.</p>
<p>I’ve also been taken into the future to experience the archetype of the future human, and those experiences drove me into deep ecstasy: a humanity healed of the scars of history, with consciousness open and in profound communion with the creative intelligence of the universe. We’re entering the hard part—the birth process. It’s important to have a vision of what this is about, because when it gets really bad—COVID may be the overture of the symphony of our transformation—it won’t itself be sufficient for what I was shown, but it’s teaching us a lot if we’re paying attention. I think deeper crises will be waves of ecological, punctuated crises in the decades ahead. We have better maps now. Duane Elgin’s Choosing Earth lays out the next five decades, decade by decade. Many books point to what’s coming. The challenge is understanding the evolutionary implications.</p>
<p>Teresa Marie 
There was a question in the chat about your “same set and setting” each time. For those who haven’t read the book, can you describe your set and setting and how that worked in your process?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I do a lot of preparation for every session. I take good care of my body—diet, relaxation—especially on session day. I always started early in the morning with yoga and meditation. I worked either at home or in my wife Carol’s office; she was a clinical psychologist and served as my sitter for all sessions. My sessions were focused on spiritual intention. I experimented with setting intentions, but at doses that high, personal intention became irrelevant. My intention became complete surrender: “Whatever you need, I give you.” Whatever the universe needed from me that day is what I offered.</p>
<p>I always wrote my sessions up within 24 hours. The more frequently you enter these states, the greater the impact on the subtle energy system. It’s important to do active spiritual practice, particularly after a session. During the Diamond Luminosity period, my practice became focused on Vajrayana Buddhism. I did specific practices before a session and different practices after. These ancient practices, with their old morphogenetic fields, had a distinct impact—facilitating entry into deep states and helping me absorb the insights and energy. These experiences take a lot out of the body—huge tidal waves of energy—so careful preparation, focus, and debrief are essential.</p>
<p>Teresa Marie 
Chris, you mentioned that music was a big part of your journeys, and that replaying it afterward helped with recollection. Is music important even at the higher levels later in your sessions?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
I used music in all my sessions—very carefully selected. There’s literature on matching music to the stages of a session. I avoid English lyrics; if there are words, I prefer languages I don’t understand to avoid triggering familiar associations. After about a year, I let go of most classical music and used almost exclusively indigenous music, which I found more evocative.</p>
<p>For recall, I developed a strategy: I would listen to the session’s music in the exact order it was played while writing up the session. I’d loop each piece until I felt I had captured what happened during that segment, then move to the next. Playing the music while writing gave me a more complete portrait and improved recall. After I stopped the high-dose LSD work, I’ve done other sessions; sometimes with music, sometimes without. I understand opening with or without music, but at high doses the experiences are so intense that music was a very helpful adjunct.</p>
<p>Teresa Marie 
You’ve mentioned your LSD doses were primarily between 500 and 600 micrograms, correct?</p>
<p>Chris Bache 
Yes. There are many psychedelics—thousands of synthetic and hundreds of organic. Each amplifies consciousness but has particular qualities and a range of activation that deepens with serial use. I experience LSD as a “high-ceiling” psychedelic—it pushes the cosmological ceiling. Psilocybin tends to be more body-grounded and emotionally saturated, tuning to the physical and emotional bodies. It has a ceiling, but in my experience it’s a more embodied opening, rather than potentially disembodied or far-from-bodied openings. Ayahuasca, in my limited experience, is similar—closely integrated with the body and emotional body—with more headroom than psilocybin in my experience, though I’ve only had preliminary exposure.</p>
<p>I’ve had some experience with 5-MeO-DMT—a very different, potentially profound, catapulting psychedelic. Its challenge is how short-acting it is, which opens another discussion: short- versus long-acting psychedelics. There are disadvantages to long-acting substances, but also advantages: sustained contact with non-ordinary states can purify the mind doing the exploration. Short-acting psychedelics don’t give as large a window to be changed by the dimensions of consciousness you’re contacting. This was Rick Strassman’s observation with DMT: profound experiences, but less lasting personality change, likely due to the short window.</p>
<p>I drilled an unusually deep borehole into the universe with LSD, but there’s so much I didn’t see that other substances reveal. Psilocybin and ayahuasca connect us to the elemental world, to the world of spirit, to levels of intelligence that live close to and saturate time-space reality—many levels I didn’t particularly engage.</p>
<p>Teresa Marie 
Thank you. We have questions in the chat. David, do you want to address some of them?</p>
<p>Donna Loeffler 
That was a beautiful answer, Chris—so well said. John Hock has a question. David, while you look, why don’t we let John ask his question? Go ahead, John.</p>
<p>John Hock 
A couple quick ones—well, the first may not be quick. I asked Stan Grof at one point if there was anything he could correlate a difficult trip with. He said his work with Tarnas and his own work turned up that a hard transit to Mars was the only thing he could point to that would predict a difficult trip, and at the time he was still working with Rick to go further. I find it fascinating that you charted correlations while doing your journeys. What have you seen correlate astrologically, and specifically, has anything correlated to a breakthrough—to moving to a higher level?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Good question, and a complicated one. Rick Tarnas is a good friend, as is Stan, and I'm aware of Stan's writing and his analysis of cases and the astrological correlations of people going through breakthroughs. I'm aware of the proposal that the outer planets correlating with the perinatal matrices seem to be somewhat predictive of patterns of oppression, contraction, breakthrough, and liberation in people's experiences.</p>
<p>I've looked at these correlations in my own work. First of all, I completely accept the proposal they've made. I understand it. It makes sense. The intelligence of the universe that I experience makes it intuitive that the rhythm of the universe would be part of the rhythm of this intelligence, and that as we open beyond the personal psyche there would be a kind of solar system pulse in the nature of our experiences.</p>
<p>That said, I have not found the correlations to be as striking as I expected. As my work deepened over the years, I couldn't correlate breakthroughs and impasses with astrological variables as much as I had anticipated. That led me to formulate what I call the roll off hypothesis: in the early stages of our work, or at lower doses—when our time-space identity is being unfolded and impacted—I think there are stronger correlations between our natal transits, the transits to our natal chart, or even global transits. But as one’s work deepens, when you begin to go into and beyond archetypal reality—beyond time and space and deep into the universe—I think there's a roll off effect of the planetary correlates to experience.</p>
<p>At least, I found that the dynamic relationship with the universe—the way the universe crushed me and kissed me and drew me out and melted me into herself—did not correlate tightly with specific planetary variables. Sometimes it did; sometimes it didn't. So my proposal is that there's a roll off effect of astrological import. This is an open question. I'm not an astrologer, and it's an active dialogue between Richard Tarnas and myself. This is why, in my book, I put the dates of all my sessions and I give my birth information, because I want to encourage discussion of the correlations between astrology and our psychedelic experiences.</p>
<p>John Hock: Thank you very much—excellent answer. I’m going to stop my questions now and open it up; there are a number of very good questions in the chat.</p>
<p>Teresa Marie: Rachel had a really good question. How has your consciousness work changed and affected your life over time in your physical existence right now—in other words, how has it been transformative in your life?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Good question, hard to answer. One of the things that complicated it in my case was that I wasn’t allowed to talk about my work. I'm a teacher. I love to teach, to learn, and share what I've learned. I'm a philosopher, and yet our psychedelic-phobic culture did not allow me or give me a platform to bring the deepest philosophical experiences of my life forward and mine them with my students or colleagues, to extract their philosophical potential.</p>
<p>So when I stopped my sessions, the deep sadness I entered wasn't simply from withdrawing from cosmological communion; it was a sickness generated by silence. I had not been allowed to talk about this work publicly. As I wrote the book, I began to experience changes, and as I began to speak about it, those changes deepened. I found my sessions beginning to come together into larger aggregates, into a larger whole, as I began to own my sessions, to own my psychedelic history, to come out of the psychedelic closet. The sessions began to saturate me and soak into me at deeper and deeper levels. This process is still continuing. I don't know where it will go.</p>
<p>I wish I could say, “I’ve touched the oneness of the universe and live in perpetual oneness, in ecstatic joy all the time.” But it's not like that. These are temporary states—genuine, but temporary immersions. They don’t have the same impact as touching these realities after 30 years of contemplative practice on the top of a mountain. You can't simply abide in these states when you come back, even if you've done your homework and attend to integration conscientiously. But they change the trajectory of your evolution; they change the trajectory of your soul's development.</p>
<p>I live with an understanding of reality that allows me to open into a prayerful engagement with it, certainly different than at the beginning of this journey. Late in my sessions, Spirit said two things: “Twenty years in, twenty years out,” meaning it would take at least 20 years to assimilate 20 years of the journey. At the time that sounded about right; now I think it might have been optimistic. I literally think what I've touched will be unfolding over many lifetimes, not simply one. It's changed the trajectory of the evolution of my soul.</p>
<p>The other thing it said: there’s the dying of seeing and the dying of keeping. The dying of seeing is the death-and-rebirth process you undergo when being initiated into the deep structure of the universe. The dying of keeping is what you do in ordinary consciousness, back inside time and space, to let those experiences enter and saturate you more deeply in daily life. My practice these days is primarily contemplative—Buddhist Vajrayana practice. I'm basically sitting still and letting the universe come to me here, rather than going out to meet it there.</p>
<p>Teresa Marie: Thank you. Donna, you said there were a couple more questions in the chat you thought were good?</p>
<p>Donna Loeffler: I do. Andrew has a question for you, Chris—none of these are going to be easy given the nature of your work. How has your understanding of the future human changed or been reinforced since first experiencing it in the late 1990s, to the writing of the book, to the present day?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It hasn't changed one bit. I say in the book that when I had the experience in session 55—the death and rebirth of humanity in 1995—for weeks I walked around like I was walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb went off. I have carried in my being, in my body, a knowing of where we are in history and what's coming.</p>
<p>When I look around, whether I agree with people politically or socially or not, I see heroes. I see every human being here on this planet as having incarnated voluntarily, choosing to be part of this evolutionary pivot. Every person here—even though they may not remember it—has chosen to be here, and this is going to be a very difficult period to incarnate. The beings who are part of the incarnation process are extraordinarily powerful, valuable beings.</p>
<p>Nothing has changed. It's been interesting to watch COVID begin, and ecological awareness begin to grow and ferment. Frankly, things are coming to a head faster than I expected. I expect this decade—if everything the scientists are telling us is right—is the last window we have to change the trajectory of what's coming at us. But if the past is an indication, we're not going to change as radically as we need to to avert this trauma. So I expect patterns of trauma to intensify in the decades to come. This century is going to be an extraordinary ordeal—the dark night of our collective soul.</p>
<p>But the dark night of the soul is a process of profound purification, and we as a species are purifying ourselves extraordinarily rapidly—of decisions we've made in history, our choices in how we treat each other, animals, and the planet. All of these choices are coming at us very fast and very deeply. This is what I saw in my sessions. This is what I carry, what I bring to my children and to your children: the vision that what we are doing is profoundly significant, and that it's important for every individual to reach as deeply and as high as possible and manifest the noblest intent.</p>
<p>If the future were moving the same way as the past—if we used a linear understanding of history—we might say the forces arrayed against us are overwhelming, that the individual can't do anything, that we'll be swallowed by environmental processes. But that's not what I saw. As suffering increases, the entire psychic field of humanity—the collective unconscious—will be increasingly pressurized, shoved into what physicists call nonlinear or far-from-equilibrium conditions. In far-from-equilibrium conditions, individual perturbations produce large outcomes. Which means that as we enter deeper into our crisis of history, individuals can have a larger and larger impact on the outcome—on how this crisis will manifest. I think it's a time of individual empowerment to facilitate deep, cultural, profound social transformation.</p>
<p>Donna Loeffler: Thank you, Chris. Another amazing answer. Again, I highly recommend this book—it's so detailed, just an amazing work. We're almost at the end of our time with you. Many thanks for being with us today and presenting on our platform. As a note to everyone: we're all volunteers; Chris is here for the love of the work, so are David and Teresa, all of us are. If you find any of our content valuable and you're able to donate, we would much appreciate it.</p>

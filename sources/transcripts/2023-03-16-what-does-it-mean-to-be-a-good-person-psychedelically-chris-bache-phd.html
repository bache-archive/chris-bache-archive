Given where we are and what's happening, from the perspective of the deep psychedelic work you've done, what does it mean to be a good person right now? What does it take?</p>
<p>Chris Bache
It's a large question. I think of half a dozen ways to answer it, and all of them feel wrong, so I'm sifting through layers.</p>
<p>In some of my deepest experiences—sometimes even after a session, under the influence of what was learned—something falls away and opens. I experience the Earth as truly living and breathing as one. I feel my feet rooted in the ground the way a tree is rooted. I look at the grass and feel a continuity of being between everything around me and my own being. I feel us breathing the same air, different species sharing the same moment in time. I feel the pulse of the universe in its utter simplicity, not paying attention to our divisions of species or moods or incarnations. The entire universe is simply being itself, and I am part of that. It's not even communion, because communion implies a subtle duality; this is when all of that falls away and a great transparency of being opens.</p>
<p>From there, my mind opens into a delicious sense of presence—an intimacy with grass, with everything. At a deeper level, my heart opens, and the idea of harming anyone is the farthest thing from my mind, while the idea of helping everyone feels completely natural. It's not “being good”; it's being alive within the reality of oneness. To me, goodness is an approximation, a compass needle pointing toward this fundamental truth. Compassion, goodness, fairness, justice—they’re derivatives of oneness, fractal manifestations of it.</p>
<p>So what does it take to be a good person today? A willingness, a commitment to serving a collective good—to serving a good that’s not private, that opens to future generations, to people unlike me and species unlike me. It’s an honest confrontation with what is, in order to bring about a better life for other beings. I know this is simple, but to me goodness is simple. It gets complicated in the enacting of it, but at its core it’s action that comes out of oneness. If it’s not grounded there, maybe there’s something not to trust in it, because deep goodness comes out of oneness.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this addresses the depth of your question. I understand the quandary it comes from. The deepest answer I have is a mystical experience of oneness, in which goodness becomes a spontaneous, almost insignificant component—like the way you react when you see something beautiful. It arises inside you when you’re in the condition of oneness.</p>
<p>Host
I have a more serious response and a more joking one. The serious one is about the dance you mentioned—the difficulty of enactment. I’ve had that experience, and I can say honestly that anywhere from 10% to 99% of the time, I’m not there at all. There’s no sense of it as I show up in the world. And the playful response is: so we should all take 500 mics of LSD, right?</p>
<p>What does it look like to have had that experience? Because when you’re there, goodness just flows—it's the most natural expression of being in the world. And yet, having a deep and profound experience doesn’t make you a deep and profound person. Experiencing oneness doesn’t mean you’re suddenly infused in all your actions, with oneness streaming from your fingertips and every interaction a blessing simply because you took enough mushrooms to touch it once. So what does it look like then—maybe this is a question about integration—what does it mean to remember that, and what does it mean to catch ourselves in forgetting?</p>
<p>Chris Bache
We go up on the mountain, we see some things, maybe receive blessings, and then we come down and go to work on Monday morning. Over and over again. It’s a matter of constantly engaging, being aware of how you’re engaging, checking yourself, recommitting to doing a better job—again and again.</p>
<p>For me, much of it showed up in my work as a teacher. I loved being with the students and always wanted to do it better, but I constantly caught myself making assumptions, drawing false inferences, not doing a good enough job, being a little tired and letting them down on a particular day—then coming back and trying to do better the next day, the next week, the next semester. Over and over, trying to live up to what we know to be true.</p>
<p>“Integration” is a strange term. I’m glad the psychedelic community is paying attention to it, because it’s critical. The word carries us a certain distance, but it’s hard to live our visions. It commits you to constantly being aware—if you really pay attention—of how poorly we’re doing at living those truths. That’s the nature of the beast. If we live around people who are really good—who have a deeper natural instinct for goodness, kindness, generosity—it’s easier to face our own shortcomings. We can look at them and say, “They’re doing this better than I am; I can do better tomorrow.” That’s why, in the Buddhist tradition, spiritual friends—people committed to awakening—are so important. Sangha, community, is one of the great pillars of progress.</p>
<p>It’s wonderful to have the experience, but we don’t walk around in that state. We practice and practice and practice. Ten years later, maybe we’re in it a little more. Ten years after that, a little more. And if we ever think we’re really there, we can ask our young children; they’ll remind us we’re not as far along as we think. Our kids will set us straight.</p>

Or perhaps, as Ram Dass said, if you ever think you’re spiritually awake, go spend a week with your parents.</p></body></html>

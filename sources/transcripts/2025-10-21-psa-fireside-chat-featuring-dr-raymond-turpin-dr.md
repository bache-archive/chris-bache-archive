All right, everybody, we're going to go ahead and get started here. First and foremost, is everybody here? Can you hear me okay? Beautiful. Thank you all so much for coming to tonight's fireside chat on Sky Mountain. We have our wonderful guests, Dr. Raymond Turpin and Dr. Christopher Bache. We'll give a little bit more context on them shortly, but first, I want to express our gratitude to Melissa and Joe Summerage for allowing us to host this talk at their lovely facility. It’s an incredible venue in and of itself, so thank you for this opportunity.

Before we dive deeper, I want to share a couple of housekeeping items. The restrooms are straight back by the stairs, and there are water stations over there with both hot and cold water. If you need to stand up or stretch, please feel free to do so. You're welcome to take pictures, but we do want to note that we are filming this event for the Psychedelic Society website, so if you could refrain from videoing too much, we'll ensure everyone has access to the recordings later.

My name is Ehren Cruz, and I’m a psychedelic ceremonial facilitator. I’ve worked with Sacramento Entheogenics for 15 years and am also a professional certified coach. I have a few wonderful co-facilitators and co-founders of the Psychedelic Society here with me tonight, including Sarah Saleecks and Dan Cao, along with Daniel Polk, the original founder who instigated this amazing group. Many of you have been part of this journey for over a year now, while some may be new faces, and we're excited to have you here.

To break the ice a little, how many of you are new to psychedelics? Great to see so many new faces! And how many have been on your own journeys with psychedelics, gaining some momentum over the last few years? Any tenured psychonauts or deep divers in the room? Wonderful! And how many of you work within the mental health field? Fascinating to see this range of backgrounds. 

Now, let's talk specifics. How many of you consider Psilocybin your medicine? Excellent. What about LSD? Great to see several hands. And MDMA? How about DMT or Ayahuasca? Beautiful! Welcome, everyone. This is our tribe. 

Before we dive fully into the discussion, I'd like to share a bit about our mission, vision, and the ethics we uphold. The mission of the Psychedelic Society of Asheville is to educate, advocate, and create community around the healing and transformational power of psychedelics. Our vision is to provide support, resources, and a safe container for those seeking guidance and healing, along with spiritual growth and personal development through psychedelics. We strive to foster an informed culture that respects indigenous lineages, scientific research, harm reduction principles, ethics, and personal responsibility in the intentional use and facilitation of psychedelic medicine.

It’s essential to maintain a sense of physical safety while we’re here. Consent is our top priority—honor each other’s boundaries, whether that’s in sharing, touching, or connecting. Psychological safety is also crucial; what we share in this space should remain confidential unless permission is explicitly granted. Transparency is vital, as is honoring diversity, equity, and inclusion within our community. We aim for a balanced representation of gender and culture, inviting everyone to feel welcomed and at home here, regardless of how they identify.

Self-care is incredibly important to us as well. Please make sure to take care of your own health, whether that means stretching or taking a moment for yourself. 

Now, let’s take a moment to acknowledge the land we’re on. We’re gathered here on Cherokee Chilagi First Nation land. As we engage in our work within the psychedelic community, we honor the wisdom of our ancestors and the responsibility we have to be stewards of this space. 

Thank you for that moment of reflection. Now, onto the conversation. We are thrilled to have two extraordinary individuals with us: Dr. Raymond Turpin and Dr. Christopher Bache. 

Dr. Bache began his journey on November 24, 1979, drawing from his training as a philosopher of religion to explore the connections between his mind and the universe through psychedelics. After engaging in 73 high-dose LSD sessions over two decades, he achieved profound communion with cosmic consciousness. He is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University and an adjunct faculty member at the California Institute of Integral Studies. Please welcome Dr. Christopher Bache.

Dr. Turpin has been studying the therapeutic use of psychedelics since the mid-80s, focusing on trauma treatment. He earned his bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Georgia, followed by a master's from West Georgia College and a doctorate from the California Institute of Integral Studies. He's also a mentor at the CIS Psychedelic Therapy and Research Program and a co-founder of the Pearl Psychedelic Institute in Waynesville. Please welcome Dr. Raymond Turpin.

Now, let's dive into where this all began. Can you tell us what initially turned you on to psychedelics? What was it about these compounds that sparked your engagement? 

Raymond Turpin: I would have to go back to around 1984. I was finishing my freshman year at the University of Georgia when I discovered Timothy Leary's autobiography, "Flashbacks." I was stunned by his writing and insight, particularly about Psilocybin and LSD. Much to my parents' dismay, I started chattering about it during a car ride to Mississippi for Thanksgiving. The real turning point came in October of '84 when I managed to score some mushrooms with two friends. We went out to a cemetery in Athens, Georgia—a spot we found sacred and fascinating. 

During that Psilocybin experience, I had a vision of my future in advertising, which felt extremely empty after a moment of success. I realized that I was trying to convince people to buy things they didn’t need and started to question my path. This earlier part of myself was really wanting to be heard. I became intrigued by the old LSD research from the 50s and 60s, which showed significant therapeutic effects—this was groundbreaking. I decided to devote my life to studying and eventually using these compounds legally.

Christopher Bache: I appreciate that, Raymond. My own journey started in a different way. After finishing my degree in religious studies and philosophy, I stumbled upon Stan Grof's work, which ignited my interest in the deep spiritual awakening facilitated by psychedelics. When I began working with these substances, I didn't focus initially on therapeutic healing, but it often unfolded throughout the process. My experiences were more intellectual and aimed at pushing boundaries.

Ehren Cruz: It’s fascinating how both of you found different paths through your journeys with psychedelics. Can you each share a pivotal experience or moment that significantly shifted your awareness in your work? 

Raymond Turpin: I can’t point to a single event, but I’ve had several breakthroughs. One particularly significant moment came from a sad realization of the inadequacies in the conventional approaches to therapy. I felt compelled to honor my motives—helping people, not just managing symptoms.

Christopher Bache: For me, certain periods of my work yielded deeper access to consciousness. Through decades of explorations, I reached what I call the "diamond luminosity." This profound state of awareness became a focal point for my sessions, guiding my path in ways I never anticipated. 

Ehren Cruz: Thank you both for sharing these insights. Your journeys highlight the importance of maintaining a perspective of humility and a dedication to the work, especially in the context of the 'dark ages' of psychedelics you both experienced. What motivated you to persevere in your paths during times when the support for psychedelic research was scarce? 

Raymond Turpin: I was driven by the potential I saw in psychedelics to address underlying issues, the very core problems that conventional methods often overlooked. I sought to understand the value within the historical research and knew there was a resurgence on the horizon.

Christopher Bache: My persistence stemmed from the belief that exploring consciousness through psychedelics could yield meaningful insights that transcended traditional academic boundaries. Mentorship from figures like Stan Grof kept me inspired—even during years when pursuing this path felt almost forbidden.

Ehren Cruz: Thank you for those reflections. The blend of individual experience and the collective wisdom you’ve both gathered is truly remarkable and inspiring. Let’s delve deeper into this journey to uncover what's next.

Raymond Turpin spoke about the significant influence Stan Grof had on him, describing Grof's powerful intellect and extensive research before writing "Realms of the Human Unconscious." He emphasized the importance of trusting the consciousness of the universe and surrendering to the process of exploring unknown territories. "You'll die 100 times, but it'll catch you in the end, and it'll embrace you," he shared, highlighting the courage he found in Grof's resilience.

Turpin noted that while he admired others who had a mentor in Ayahuasca work, his journey involved a continuous conversation with the universe itself. "I never had anyone to help me," he said. "It was just a communion, dissolving deeper into that consciousness." He reminisced about the challenges he faced in sharing his personal experiences due to a lack of intellectual and community support in academia. His journey remained largely solitary until he retired, allowing him the freedom to write about his experiences in "LSD in the Mind of the Universe," a book he titled "Diamonds from Heaven."

He contrasted his situation with that of indigenous cultures, stressing their frameworks for integrating deep experiences with elders. "In my world, there were no elders and no sharing," he lamented. "It had to be contained." This lack of community made it difficult to process his experiences until the current era of greater openness and sharing began.

"Ehren Cruz acknowledged Turpin's reflections and shifted the conversation back, pointing out how personal work impacts family dynamics and relationships. Turpin explained his strategic advantages: a PhD in philosophy and a deep understanding of various mystical traditions. "I had to stabilize myself and keep grounded," he noted, reflecting on the challenges of navigating psychedelic experiences alongside family obligations and teaching.

“Absorbing what I learned was crucial,” Turpin emphasized, remarking on the connection between states of consciousness and the body. He acknowledged the necessity of spiritual practice, grounding himself through meditation, and being inspired by the lives of great masters.

Cruz followed up by mentioning the immersive quality of psychedelic experiences, which necessitate a framework for integration once the experience subsides. Turpin elaborated on the concept of the "dying of keeping," distinguishing it from the "dying of discovery." The former, he said, pertains to the integral process of holding onto and processing experiences in a meaningful way.

Cruz then posed a question to Chris Bache about how psychedelic experiences had impacted his family and relationships during his journeys. Bache’s work with the Pearl Psychedelic Institute, a facility approved for expanded access trials for MDMA therapy, highlighted the intersection of therapeutic and ecstatic traditions. He deeply appreciated the synergistic relationship between these pathways and acknowledged the staggering amount of work involved in bringing such practices to fruition. 

He reflected on the cultural significance of both the clinical and the ecstatic traditions, noting how music, community, and profound experiences intertwine. “There’s a need for us to embrace both pathways,” he said. Bache spoke candidly about the risks and cultural implications of psychedelic use, referencing historical contexts and figures like Timothy Leary while advocating for a balanced approach.

“In the 60s, we were dealing with old white guys in lab coats,” Bache said. “It’s crucial to bring diverse voices into this conversation.” He remained optimistic about the potential of the medical model to validate and integrate psychedelics into society but cautioned against limiting these substances to clinical frameworks. 

Both Bache and Turpin expressed their excitement for the burgeoning renaissance around psychedelics and the collective responsibility to educate and share knowledge. They affirmed the importance of community and the ongoing dialogue about the transformative power of these experiences, recognizing the role of celebration and ritual in human experiences with psychedelics.

Raymond Turpin: I really agree that it’s the medical and therapeutic work with psychedelics that is helping to bring them back into our society, which is crucial. It's essential that we approach this work diligently and document the therapeutic potential of these substances. Once we successfully integrate this back into our culture, it raises questions about the possibilities: if psychedelics amplify our consciousness and can reveal dark aspects of ourselves that we can heal, then how far can we take this? Institutional exploration is still in its infancy, but I believe it’s a matter of time before we fully embrace this. 

In these altered states, it’s not the psychedelics themselves that do the work—it's consciousness. The psychedelics act as amplifiers, and if we handle our consciousness carefully, we can utilize them similarly to meditation practices. I refer to my sessions in this context; I consider them my “work sessions,” a play on the Japanese word for spiritual practice periods. 

That said, I don’t recommend everyone approach psychedelics as I did. I was fortunate to have the constitution to engage deeply and come out whole. Many people don’t share that capacity and require more support. I would approach it with a more nuanced understanding now, balancing doses between higher and lower, integrating substances like psilocybin and LSD. 

There's a breakthrough session followed by the need for integration, allowing time to absorb and process the material experienced. Initially, I thought it was a personal journey, but over time I learned that these deeper levels connect to a collective psyche. The visions experienced aren't just personal; they’re historical and universal in a sense. 

I learned that enlightenment isn’t a destination. After years of exploration, I discovered that integration is more about how we live our daily lives rather than seeking a final state of awakening or divine realization. Now, I’m acutely aware of the ongoing process of dying and living with these experiences. 

As I prepare to teach in the Kettleman assistant training program in San Francisco, my role will focus on integration, especially working at the psychodynamic level and understanding how spiritual experiences intersect with our inner intelligence. But the larger challenge lies in integrating these transpersonal experiences into our finite consciousness. The question becomes: how does a finite being, tethered to time and space, integrate experiences that transcend those very concepts?

We might have to revise our understanding of integration as we explore these deeper layers, moving beyond what we’ve learned about the personal unconscious. Lessons from indigenous cultures are valuable, but we have to recognize that the psychedelics available to us now push deeper than those historic uses. 

The movement is progressing rapidly, but I believe it will take generations to truly embed these concepts into our culture. Achieving a grounding in our society around psychedelics will require time and patience. We’re at an unprecedented point—350 universities now have psychedelic research departments and there’s a surge of interest in this realm. 

Ehren Cruz: You’re right. While this renaissance is accelerating, it's vital that we proceed with caution, respecting the cultural heritage and ethical considerations that accompany these psychedelic experiences. The landscape is changing rapidly, yet we must remain grounded in our approach. 

Raymond Turpin: Absolutely. If taking a psychedelic guaranteed we’d all be better human beings, we’d see a significant shift already. It’s about intention and integration. When individuals enter our ketamine program, I emphasize that it's not the compound that does the work. They may experience relief, but if they don’t take the insights and integrate them meaningfully into their daily lives, they risk regressing back to prior states.

We need to stress that these experiences are glimpses into our deeper selves—windows into a broader identity, which I think of as Jung's concept of the Self. Our inner healing intelligence knows what we need to cultivate balance, and it’s crucial to teach people to value and act on these insights.

Despite the rapid progress we're witnessing, it’s important to educate those interested in this field about responsibility and the scientific grounding required for facilitating these experiences ethically. 

Ehren Cruz: With the anticipation of MDMA’s potential approval and its implications, what do you foresee for the future?

Raymond Turpin: MDMA discussions are indeed exciting. MAPS is preparing to submit their new drug application to the FDA, hopefully soon. These treatments involve significant resources, with extended protocols and trained therapists. Post-approval, I anticipate a shift toward including more varied members on treatment teams, which could help to reduce costs and broaden accessibility.

We have hundreds of therapists trained but lacking supervised clinical experience. The bottleneck in certification will need addressing. We’re looking at our facility to help facilitate this process locally. It’s all about ensuring that eager practitioners have the chance to gain necessary experience without traveling too far.

I also see a bright future for psilocybin, with its wide applicability. We’re just beginning phase three studies, and while MDMA will shine in trauma and relational issues, psilocybin may address even broader patterns.

Ehren Cruz: Thank you for that insight! Understanding the growing role of psychedelics and the significance of collective responsibility in this journey is vital. 

Raymond Turpin: I completely agree. Moving forward, we need to appreciate that these changes in our internal and external worlds are interconnected. As we navigate these challenges collectively, psychedelics may play an increasingly pivotal role in individual and cultural healing. 

Ehren Cruz: The messages you share emphasize the importance of stewardship. It’s vital that we honor these medicines and their histories as we step into this new age of responsibility, fostering not only our individual healing but our shared evolution as a society. Thank you, everyone, for being part of this conversation. 

We will open the floor for questions now. If anyone has something to share, feel free!

## PSA Fireside Chat — Dr. Raymond Turpin & Dr. Chris Bache

**Raymond Turpin: ** Ask yourself, what is the finest that human beings can become? If we look ahead, what is the best that we can be? Imagine that the divine wants us to reach that potential, and it desires even more than that. The question then is, how do we go from our primal origins to that ideal state? It takes time. It's a repetitive cycle, lifetime after lifetime; we accumulate knowledge, wisdom, and hopefully, a deeper understanding, often brought on by our wounds.

We're addressing our past while expanding our potential. Over thousands of years, we've engaged in this transformation. Yet, we tend to think in short-term perspectives—achieving salvation, enlightenment, or nirvana. This "up and out" cosmology has dominated our thinking. However, the divine does not operate under such a schema. Instead, it's about a continuous unfolding and fruition on this planet, deepening our communion with the creative wisdom and joy of the universe. We must hold this in our bodies and maintain it in harmony with other species and all of humanity.

I sense we are at a pivotal moment in history. Each of us can look around and imagine how many lives sit in this room. Each chair represents countless lives lived, accumulating years of experience. What is unfolding historically is a confluence, not only of changes on this planet but a gathering within our souls. Our former lives share their unfinished business—pain, trauma, and issues from this life and others. We must confront these, but as we do, we facilitate integration. 

While the initial wave may consist of pain, underlying it is all the learning, knowledge, and rich textures of relationships amassed over lifetimes. These lives span every imaginable identity and class in society, and they are converging. I believe they are fusing together. In my sessions, I have experienced this coming together, leading to a critical mass and an explosion—an eruption of diamond consciousness from within.

In this state, I was myself, yet I was not only Chris Bache. I felt a profound cosmic communion while maintaining my individuality. I believe this process is happening globally. Every person on the planet participates in the integration of past lives, which I term the birth of the diamond soul. This is the emergence of soul consciousness in our human experience. As we awaken to this consciousness, we recognize our deep history and the relativity of trivial conflicts that we engage in.

We are moving toward an explosion of soul consciousness on Earth. Living from an egoic mindset is no longer viable. While the individual ego is beautiful, we must evolve beyond it. The next stage of consciousness, which I believe is soul consciousness, is essential for survival. Extinction serves as a powerful, transformative motivator, and we are on the brink of that reality.

How long will this transformation take? That’s uncertain. My experiences don’t provide specific timelines, but I know in my bones that it is underway, and we will emerge from this process. We will transform humanity. Initially, it may not seem we’ll succeed; it may look bleak, but that’s the death and rebirth process at play. We must commit radically to this transformation.

The diamond soul is being born in this historical moment. This future human, emerging from this evolution, is stunningly beautiful—beyond words. We catch glimpses of it in Christ, the Buddhas, and other prophets throughout history. We are being guided toward this evolution, though we do not have control over it. We chose to become part of this transition, and we will make choices that shape future generations.

When we reflect on our lives at the end, we don’t seek mere comfort or ease; we desire meaning. What could be more meaningful than participating in humanity's shared transition toward peace? Imagine a species that has collectively healed all divisions and unfinished business from countless lifetimes.

Robert Monroe, known for his writings on out-of-body experiences and the Monroe Institute, described a vision of the future around 3000 AD, observing an empty Bardo—the state where souls reside between incarnations. This emptiness signifies integration; no longer are we fragmented by unrealized potential. If the Bardo is void of fragments, divine intelligence can interface more fluidly with our hearts and minds. 

That is what we are striving for, yearning for. We can feel this urgency in our bones as we touch our personal healing, recognizing it as part of a greater collective evolution toward the birth of the diamond soul in history.

**Ehren Cruz: ** Wow, that was quite a powerful conclusion to our conversation. I almost don’t know how to follow that. But we’ve still got some time to connect and mingle, so please feel free to come up and share your thoughts. I want to express our deep gratitude on behalf of the Psychedelic Society of Asheville for this extraordinary fireside chat. 

Thank you both for being here with us this evening. We encourage everyone to stay engaged. We meet monthly, usually on the final Sunday to discuss various topics, facilitate discussions, share insights on harm reduction, and explore creative expressions influenced by these medicines. We aim to cultivate an open and welcoming community. 

Once again, thank you to Melissa and Joe from Sky Mountain for providing this beautiful setting for our discussion. Let’s continue to build connections and friendships tonight. Thank you all, and have a wonderful evening!

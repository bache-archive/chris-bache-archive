All right, everybody, let's go ahead and get started here. First and foremost, is everyone here? Can you hear me okay? Beautiful. Well, thank you all so much for coming to tonight's fireside chat on Sky Mountain. We have our wonderful guests here today that will be speaking: Dr. Raymond Turpin and Dr. Christopher Bache. 

Before we dive in, I want to extend a big thank you to Melissa and Joe Summerage for allowing us to use this lovely facility for our talk tonight. It's such an incredible venue. A couple of housekeeping items: there are bathrooms straight back by the stairs, and water stations over there with hot and cold options. If anyone needs to stand up and stretch, please feel free to do so. You're welcome to take pictures, but we are capturing a formal video, which we will release through the Psychedelic Society website, so if you can refrain from recording, we appreciate it.

I’d like to introduce myself and a couple of co-founders of the Psychedelic Society and share a bit about what we’re doing here. My name is Ehren Cruz. I'm a psychedelic ceremonial facilitator, a professional certified coach, and an anthropologist by trade. Joining me are Sarah Saleecks, Levine Dan Cao, and Daniel Polk, the original founder who brought this amazing group together. Many of you have participated in this community for over a year, and I also see some new faces.

To break the ice: how many of you are new to psychedelics? Awesome. How many of you have been on your own journey with psychedelics over the past few years? And any tenured psychonauts or deep divers here? Great to see so many hands. How about those who work within the mental health field? Fantastic.

Let's dive into some specific materials: how many of you favor Psilocybin? Okay, some hands there. How about LSD? Many hands. MDMA? Great. DMT or Ayahuasca? Beautiful. Welcome, everyone. This is our tribe.

Before we begin the deeper conversation, I want to set the stage with a little bit of our mission and vision. The mission of the Psychedelic Society of Asheville is to educate, advocate, and create community around the healing and transformational power of psychedelics. We provide support and resources while fostering an informed culture that respects indigenous lineage, scientific research, harm reduction, ethics, and personal responsibility in the intentional use and facilitation of psychedelic medicine.

Consent is our highest priority. Please honor what others choose to share and how they choose to express themselves here. We strive for diversity, equity, and inclusion, making this a welcoming place for everyone, regardless of how you identify. Self-care is incredibly important. Feel free to take a moment for yourself as needed. 

With that in mind, let's take a moment to acknowledge that we are on Cherokee Chilagi First Nation land. We honor the wisdom of our ancestors and recognize the sacredness of this land.

Now, let’s introduce our guests. Dr. Turpin may not describe himself as an elder yet, but you are an elder, sir. Congratulations! Both of these individuals have contributed significantly, not just to our local community, but to the wider psychedelic movement.

Dr. Christopher Bache began his transformative journey on November 24, 1979, drawing on his training as a philosopher of religion. He set out to explore consciousness using LSD, following the protocols established by Stanislav Grof. Over the course of 20 years, Bache conducted 73 high-dose sessions, forming a deep communion with cosmic consciousness. He is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, an adjunct faculty member at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an Emeritus Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and serves on the Advisory Council of the Grof Legacy Training. Please welcome Dr. Christopher Bache!

Dr. Turpin has been studying the therapeutic use of psychedelics since the mid-80s, focusing primarily on trauma. He earned his degrees in psychology from the University of Georgia and the California Institute of Integral Studies. He is a co-founder of the Pearl Psychedelic Institute in Waynesville, North Carolina, and has mentored students in psychedelic therapy. Please welcome Dr. Raymond Turpin!

Let’s dive into where this all began. Prior to your first formal experience, what initially turned you on to psychedelics? What was it about these compounds that sparked your interest?

Raymond Turpin: I would have to go back to probably early 1984, during my freshman year at the University of Georgia. I discovered "Flashbacks," Timothy Leary's autobiography. I was just stunned by Leary's brilliance and insight. He wrote a lot about Psilocybin and LSD. Much to my parents' chagrin, I talked about him all the way to Mississippi for Thanksgiving. 

Then, in October of ’84, I managed to acquire some mushrooms with two friends. We went to a cemetery outside Athens, Georgia, which was a sacred place for us. Laying by a creek during that Psilocybin experience, I had a vision of myself. At the time, I was an advertising major, feeling empty despite the success I envisioned. It was as if a voice was saying, “What are you doing? You're convincing people to buy things they don’t need.” This experience unlocked a part of myself that had been socialized out over the previous years, and I became fascinated with deeper truths I could find through these substances.

Chris Bache: My experience was a bit different. I came out of graduate school and found myself a pre-confirmed agnostic, then discovered Stan Grof’s work, particularly his book "Realms of the Human Unconscious." It lit a fire in me. I understood that to really explore these concepts, I had to engage with the experience directly.

I decided to take on the work illegally, knowing that it wouldn’t be truly understood until later. My focus was on spiritual awakening, though I found a lot of healing along the way. I followed a protocol of high-dose sessions—500 to 600 micrograms of LSD. I didn’t initially trip in a typical sense; I was doing therapeutic-focused work. It’s a rigorous discipline to work at those levels, and it requires spiritual practice to stabilize the experiences.

Ehren Cruz: You both had early experiences that redirected your paths. Can you share a pivotal moment when you felt a significant shift in awareness during your work with psychedelics?

Chris Bache: I can't really point to a single pivotal moment due to the lengthy journey I experienced over 20 years. There were many levels of consciousness and breakthroughs, but one significant period was around 1993-94, during a time of astrological significance for me, which tore open a new level of experience. However, the last five years brought me to what I call the "diamond luminosity" state. Touching that realm made everything else seem less interesting. Achieving that state repeatedly was a phenomenal challenge.

Raymond Turpin: My story is a little different. I found myself devoting my life to studying psychedelics during an era when conventional psychology dismissed them. Reading the old studies on LSD and Psilocybin, I realized they were getting to the core of psychological issues that conventional medicine was not. I faced a lot of skepticism from peers, but the lost potential of these compounds inspired me to stay the course.

It's important to maintain humility when working with these substances. Each session trains you to navigate the delicate balance of insight and therapy. You find reaffirmation in small moments—meeting the right people, having specific experiences—that encourage you to stay on this path.

Ehren Cruz: Your journeys through the dark ages of psychedelics have clearly shaped your perspectives. What motivated you to push forward despite a lack of support, and who were your prominent mentors during this time? 

Raymond Turpin: The unique nature of early psychedelic research kept me going. Understanding how they worked with mental illness in ways that were innovative and transformative was immensely encouraging. Stan Grof was hugely influential for me, and reading “Realms” was extraordinary. When I enrolled in CIIS, I knew I had to learn from the best, and navigating that unconventional path brought me resilience.

Chris Bache: My influences have been varied. Stan Grof’s guidance was invaluable, along with exposure to other great thinkers. Each encounter and learning moment fed my understanding and trajectory. I always sought to deepen my experiences and insights throughout my journey.

Raymond Turpin: Even musicians like Jerry Garcia influenced me. His way of expressing profound insights through music demonstrated that psychedelic experiences mattered, and reaffirmed my commitment to the journey.

**Chris Bache: ** Stan was a huge influence on me, largely because of his powerful intellect. He had done 20 years of research before writing *Realms of the Human Unconscious*, and I recognized the caliber of his scholarship. He taught me many essential things, but the most important lesson was to absolutely trust the consciousness of the universe. It’s about surrendering to the process, allowing yourself to venture into unknown territories and letting the experience unfold, no matter how challenging or inscrutable it may seem. In a safe and contained environment, you need to surrender completely, and it will always catch you in the end. You might feel like you've died a hundred times, but it'll embrace you when you come back.

I suppose I wouldn’t have had the courage to explore some of the places I ventured into without knowing that Stan had already been there and survived to share his experiences. Stan became a friend and colleague, and I was fortunate to have him write the foreword to my book, *Dark Night of the Soul*. He also introduced me to some ITA meetings where I had wonderful encounters with different people. Despite this intellectual launching point, I often felt envious of those who had a shaman mentor or a long-term guide through their Ayahuasca experiences. That just wasn’t my journey; all my mentoring came from the universe itself. 

That has its advantages and disadvantages. I didn't learn anything in an intellectual sense from anyone. Our conversation was more of a communion, an immersion into the soul of the universe—the source of all existence. I’d come back, scribble down my experiences, trying to make sense of them, digesting the larger narrative. However, at the time, there wasn’t a community to share this with. My colleagues in academia were aware of my pursuits, but they didn’t really understand what I was doing. I couldn’t bring this work into the classroom or teach from it, which became particularly challenging for me, as I love to share knowledge.

I was able to teach courses in psychedelic therapy and seminars based on Stan’s work, but I had to hold back my personal experiences. It wasn't until after I retired that I felt free enough to attempt sharing it more widely. I didn’t even try until after the statute of limitations passed, feeling secure that neither Ohio State could fire me nor the federal government could come after me. But that isn’t how it should be. In indigenous cultures, when someone comes back from a deep experience, they share it with the elders because it’s not just about individual visions—it relates to the life of the community.

Raymond Turpin: Indigenous cultures successfully utilized psychedelics for thousands of years because they had frameworks to respect and integrate these experiences. They provided a cultural blueprint for individuals returning from journeys to help them understand and safely process what they had encountered. In contrast, the issues we encountered in our culture, even in the 1960s, stemmed from a lack of understanding and an acceptable framework for these substances. We were seen as criminals for using them.

So now, as we’re in this renaissance period, I believe it’s our responsibility to educate ourselves about these substances and teach others how to use them responsibly. We are still early in this journey, but the communal support structure is vital for helping individuals navigate these profound experiences.

Ehren Cruz: Thank you both for sharing that. As part of my work in harm reduction, I've guided people through high-dose psilocybin experiences. These journeys can be transformative, but they also require adaptation to new ways of engaging with family and friends post-experience. You can’t unknow what you now know, and so establishing a new trajectory for life is essential. Chris, could you speak about how these experiences impacted your family and your relationships, particularly with your wife at that time and how you managed to endure during that phase?

Chris Bache: I had a few strategic advantages: I held a PhD in philosophy with a focus on religious studies and the philosophy of religion. This provided me the opportunity to explore mystical traditions—both Eastern and Western—since I spent a lot of time with the great masters of psychedelic and contemplative experiences. These two genres diverge; psychedelic experiences are temporary, requiring you to maximize their productivity within a limited time frame, whereas contemplative practices allow for more prolonged absorption.

For me, grounding myself in the world while navigating these intense experiences was crucial. I drew from my family life—raising children and committing to my students—as anchors. My partner at the time, Carl, was also a serious meditator, which helped ground me further. Learning from the great masters provided role models for what could be achieved and helped me structure my daily practice to absorb not only the intellectual lessons but the subtle energies psychedelics awaken in the body.

Ehren Cruz: That’s a profound reflection. It’s crucial to understand that once the psychedelic experience subsides, the real work of integration begins; synthesizing those insights into daily life is where transformation occurs.

Chris Bache: Exactly. I learned that it’s not only about discovering profound truths but about maintaining those insights. There’s a difference between the “dying of discovery” and the “dying of keeping.” It's how you hold onto these experiences meaningfully and integrate them into your life.

Ehren Cruz: Dr. Turpin, your work at the Pearl Psychedelic Institute is commendable, especially as one of just two facilities approved for expanded access trials with MDMA for PTSD treatment. How do you reconcile the rigorous therapeutic model with the more ecstatic traditions of a culture you love, like the Grateful Dead? How can both pathways contribute to the larger renaissance we’re witnessing?

Raymond Turpin: It’s a good question, and I believe it’s not only doable but necessary. The medical model we’re pursuing does garner criticism, particularly because of its historical roots, where psychedelic research was largely dominated by a specific demographic. Critics rightly point out that simply confining this exploration to medical professionals risks losing a broader cultural understanding.

I think the medical model is crucial for validating the efficacy of psychedelics in treating mental health issues, and it's essential for integration into our healthcare framework. MAPS chose to focus on MDMA for its potential to be perceived as a socially acceptable option due to its clarity of experience compared to other psychedelics which might lead to disorientation. However, we have the internet today, providing a wealth of information about psychedelics, and there’s no going back. 

While the therapeutic model is vital for research and acceptance, we shouldn’t dismiss the cultural and experiential aspects brought forth by ecstatic traditions. Historically, the use of psychedelics encompassed celebration and community connection. Events like Grateful Dead concerts often served as mass psychotherapy sessions where people would congregate and experience profound connections. This blend of psychedelic exploration with social interaction creates a powerful synthesis that can be transformative.

Being a part of those experiences reshaped my perception of life beyond the mundane routines of daily living, inspiring creativity and deep reflection. While there’s risk involved in those wild environments, the essence of community, celebration, and shared consciousness is crucial. 

Ehren Cruz: Many modern movements owe their genesis to these experiences—bands like Fish and STS9, as well as gatherings like Burning Man, all stem from that radical creativity. There’s a rich lineage extending back to ancient traditions. Chris, how do you view high-dose experiences in contemporary research? Are they justified, and what might the community be seeking in those deeper explorations?

I really agree with you, Raymond, that it's the medical and therapeutic work with psychedelics that is bringing them back into our society. It's so important that we do this well and document the therapeutic capacity. Once we successfully reintegrate psychedelics into society, the question will arise: if they're amplifiers of consciousness, how far can we take this? What's going to happen next? Some people are already pushing boundaries, but in terms of institutional exploration, we're not there yet. However, I believe it’s just a matter of time.

In these altered states, it's not the psychedelic that does the work; it’s consciousness that navigates the experience. The psychedelic acts as an amplifier. If you handle consciousness carefully, you can use it similarly to what occurs during a meditation session. When I engage in this work, I refer to it as my "work sessions," a nod to the Japanese term for a concentrated period of spiritual practice. I can recall specific details of my sessions—exactly what I was doing on particular days and years. 

That said, I honestly do not recommend that people follow my exact path. There are many ways for this experience to go wrong, and I was fortunate. I discovered I had the capacity to navigate various levels of consciousness. Others may not have such resilience. People embarking on this journey need more support. If I were to redo my experiences, I would much gentler with myself, integrating a more nuanced approach, balancing high doses with occasional lower ones, perhaps combining psilocybin with LSD or ayahuasca.

Initially, I thought the goal of this work was personal enlightenment—becoming one with God or dissolving into a cosmic void. However, I learned over time, especially during a deep psychedelic exploration, that the journey is infinite. There is no end point, and it’s more about openness to receiving wisdom and healing energy than about achieving a particular condition of awakening. It’s crucial to live with the experiences we gain. 

Soon, I'll be involved in teaching the integration aspect in a training program. Our conversations around integration at a psychodynamic level are vital, even as we explore spiritual experiences and tap into the divine nature that connects us all. But when we navigate the deeper aspects of psychedelics—transcending time and space—we enter a complex realm. How does a finite being integrate the infinite? This is a question that requires us to re-evaluate our understanding of integration, moving beyond personal unconscious work. 

If we look at the psychedelics utilized by indigenous cultures versus the protocols available today, there’s a case to be made that we are delving deeper than many had before, which introduces a set of challenges. I think we’ll reach these deeper issues eventually, but it will take time—generations, perhaps—to fully ground psychedelics in our culture. This is not short-term work; it's a deep journey towards expanding our communion with the universe.

Ehren Cruz responded, acknowledging the rapid developments in psychedelic research and culture, including the establishment of over 350 university departments focused on the subject and a substantial increase in related publications. He emphasized the ongoing momentum, from celebrity endorsements to the FDA's impending clearance of MDMA for therapeutic use. While this progress is promising, he cautioned that we should approach this evolution with patience and respect for indigenous lineages. He asked for Chris's insights on where things are headed in the coming years, especially given Raymond’s front-line work regarding legality.

Raymond agreed and emphasized that taking psychedelics doesn’t inherently make someone a better person; intention and integration matter significantly. He expressed a concern about educating people on the need for the right ritual work post-experience. When patients join their ketamine program, the first thing he tells them is not to expect the substance to do the work alone. True change involves bringing insights from the experiences into their daily lives; otherwise, regression is likely.

He reflects on the responsibility to educate others—grounding the information in science and tradition. While he sees things moving quicker than he expected, he also recalled times of doubt about progress. Despite the challenges ahead, including how insurance companies will adapt to these treatments following approval, he emphasized the importance of training therapists for MDMA work and overcoming the bottleneck of therapist certification.

As for Psilocybin, he believes it will soon follow suit in applications. LSD, too, is starting to see an increase in interest and study—though it presents unique challenges.

Chris built upon Raymond’s points, emphasizing the broader societal context. He suggested that, as we move toward crises—climate-related and social—there’s a need for collective healing through psychedelics. The current therapeutic processes may not be enough; the future requires profound change on personal and societal levels. 

He urged participants to consider their intertwining internal and external work, recognizing that our personal developments are deeply connected to global transformations. The challenges humans face today echo a profound purification process that cannot be ignored. 

Ehren concluded by underscoring the social responsibility associated with these insights—how to caretake these powerful medicines both individually and collectively and highlighted the importance of harm reduction principles in the psychedelic journey. The audience was invited to participate in a question-and-answer session to further explore these themes.

## Fireside Chat: Dr. Raymond Turpin & Dr. Chris Bache

**Chris Bache: ** Ask yourself, what is the finest that human beings can become? If we look ahead, what is the finest that human beings can be? Imagine that the divine wants it to be like that and even more than that. The question then is, how do we go from baboons or chimpanzees to that? It takes time—a repetitive cycle, lifetime by lifetime. We accumulate more knowledge, wisdom, and hopefully understanding, along with more wounds. 

We're taking care of the wounds and the past while expanding potential, lifetime after lifetime. Thousands of years, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years—we've been in this process. We tend to think in terms of a short-term perspective. The pursuit of salvation, enlightenment, or parinirvana reflects an "up and out" cosmology that has driven us. However, the divine doesn’t think in those terms. It's about a continual receding and a fruition that's taking place on the planet, bringing us into ever deeper levels of communion with the creative wisdom and joy of the universe, holding it in our bodies, in peace and harmony with the other species we share this planet with and every member of the human species.

My sense is that we are at a pivot point in history. Each of us can look around and imagine how many lives have lived through us, how many hundreds of lives are represented in each chair. All those thousands of years of experience are coming together. What's happening is not only a coming together on the planet, forcing the changes necessary, but also a coming together in the soul. All our former lives are converging, and the first thing we will need to deal with is the unfinished business—the pain, the issues, the traumas that stem from this life and others.

As we address these, it makes it easier for these lives to merge. Although the problems may be the first wave, it's also all the learning and the knowledge, all the history and texture of relationships they bring. These lives have represented every imaginable possibility—black, white, different social positions and classes—coming together to fuse. In my experience, when all my former lives came together, there was an explosion. It was as if they hit a critical mass, leading to an explosion of diamond consciousness that broke out of my chest, throwing me into a profound condition where I was an individual, yet not defined by any frame of reference I had known. I was in a deep and profound cosmic communion.

I believe that's what's happening to all of us throughout history. Every continent, every person on the planet is part of this process of integrating all of our lives. This is what I call the birth of the diamond soul—the birth of the soul consciousness within our human incarnation. When we experience ourselves, we do not see ourselves defined by the beginning and ending of this life but instead have a natural, intuitive awareness of our deep history. This leads to a profound social connection and a greater awareness of the relativity of all the conflicts that we get caught up in. 

As we come together, I think we’re moving toward an explosion of soul consciousness on the planet. We cannot live out of egoic consciousness. While individual ego consciousness is magnificent, we cannot afford to operate from that state. We must evolve into a new state of consciousness—soul consciousness—or face extinction. Extinction is a powerful motivational force for transformation.

How long will this take? How fast can it happen? I don’t know. My experiences don’t come with dates or brochures detailing how it will unfold, but I know in my bones that it's happening. I believe we will make it through this process. It might not seem that way for a time; it may look like we’re on the verge of collapse, but that is part of the death and rebirth process. We will have to lay everything on the line and make a radical commitment to this journey. 

The diamond soul is being born in history; the future human is emerging, and that future human is beautifully magnificent. We see glimpses of this in figures like Christ, the Buddhas, and the prophets of history. All of this is emerging from within us. We are being taken there, and we are not in control of this process. Before incarnating, we knew what we were getting into and chose to be part of this evolutionary transition. 

When the end comes, it's not about having a comfortable or easy life but rather a meaningful one. And what could be more meaningful than supporting humanity's collective transition into peace, healing the wounds of our past—both individually and collectively? 

Consider Robert Monroe’s insights; he was guided by his intelligent mentors to a future around 3000 AD. In that time, he found the Bardo—where souls go between incarnations—was empty. We had integrated all those fragmented pieces of experiences into ourselves, becoming whole. If the Bardo is empty, divine intelligence can reach deep within our hearts and minds far more fluidly. That’s what we’re all working toward, what we yearn for. We feel it in our bones, and when we engage in individual healing, we touch this deeper process. Our personal healing is just a part of it, a necessary step toward facilitating the birth of the diamond soul in history.

**Ehren Cruz: ** Well, I think we might have gone over time with that. Honestly, I don't know how to follow that up. But we will be here for some time if you want to connect afterward. Please do come up and share. We’re wrapping up this session, but on behalf of the Psychedelic Society of Asheville, we are incredibly grateful and honored to have had these wonderful guests here this evening. 

Once again, thank you both so much. Please stay in touch with us at psychedelic society avl.com. We have monthly gatherings, usually on the final Sunday, where we explore different topics—sometimes more back-and-forth sessions or harm reduction guidance, insights on engaging with this work safely and ethically, or creative panels discussing how this medicine influences artists. 

We welcome everyone to be part of this community. Stick around for a bit, say hello to each other, and build relationships. Thank you to Melissa and Joe from Sky Mountain for helping create this beautiful setting for our talk. Have a wonderful evening, and thank you all for coming out tonight.

<p>Steve Thayer: Welcome back to Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers, the podcast devoted to exploring the frontiers of psychedelic medicine and what it takes to cultivate a healthy mind, body, and spirit. As always, Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers is brought to you by Numinous. I'm Dr. Steve Thayer, and today my co‑host, Dr. Reid Robison, and I are joined by Dr. Christopher Bache, PhD. Chris is a professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct faculty at the California Institute for Integral Studies, emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. He's the author of several books, but the one that prompted us to reach out to him for this interview is LSD and the Mind of the Universe, an account of what Chris experienced and learned from 73 high‑dose LSD journeys over the course of 20 years.</p>
<p>In today's conversation, we explore Chris's LSD session protocol, the difference between using psychedelics for what he calls cosmological exploration versus spiritual enlightenment or psychological healing, how he processed and integrated very intense experiences, what he learned about reincarnation and evolution at the collective and individual levels, what humans need to do to survive mounting existential threats, what he means by Diamond Luminosity and diamond soul, and much more. Chris's book had a profound impact on me. His disciplined, scholarly approach to psychedelic exploration, combined with his ability to articulate and teach what for most of us would be an overwhelming or ineffable experience, has resulted in a must‑read, in my opinion, for anyone who thinks deeply about questions like, Who are we? What are we doing here? And where might we go from here?</p>
<p>If you've ever listened to an episode of Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers and thought, I wonder where I could find good training on how to use psychedelics in clinical practice, wonder no longer.

<p>Chris Bache: It's a pleasure to be here with you today.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: Why don't we start, Chris, with you introducing yourself to our audience? Share as much or as little as you'd like, just to give us some context.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I'm a retired professor of religious studies. I made my living teaching in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, a state university in Northeast Ohio. What brings me to this program is the book I published three years ago, called LSD in the Mind of the Universe—which is a strange book for a professor of religious studies to have written.</p>
<p>Right at the beginning of my academic career, in 1978, I had just finished graduate work at Brown in philosophy of religion, and I met the work of Stan Grof. I immediately recognized that his research in LSD and psychedelics in general was extraordinarily important—not just for clinical psychology and therapy, but for philosophy, which was what interested me most. Even though it was illegal, I began a quiet, private psychedelic practice that continued for 20 years. I worked for four years, then stopped for six years for reasons I describe in the book, then worked for another 10 years. This was from ’79 to ’99, when I was 30 to 50. I then spent the next 20 years digesting those experiences—trying to absorb them, extrapolate, and clarify the cosmological implications—and then I published LSD in the Mind of the Universe. That’s the brief sketch of what brings me here.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: As I was reading your book, I kept thinking, what a heroic undertaking—heroic in the sense of a hero’s journey. The things you describe are not for the faint of heart. I’ve heard you say you don’t necessarily recommend your protocol to others. Why?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: First, the protocol. Everything I did was within a strict therapeutic framework. I followed Stan’s protocols from LSD Psychotherapy: lying down, eye shades, earphones, very carefully choreographed music to guide the session. I was always in private, protected, with a sitter—my wife at the time, a clinical psychologist—so established in what I call the psychedelic kiva, a sacred container for practice.</p>
<p>After about three sessions at 250 micrograms, I chose to work with very high doses—500 to 600 micrograms—the body saturation point. Naively, I thought the work was about personal transformation or spiritual awakening. The spiritual literature describes one’s karma as ultimately finite, even if it spans multiple incarnations, so I thought, clear the conditioning of my psyche, purify karma, and if I took larger doses, I could go faster—bigger bites of karma each session if I could manage the intensity.</p>
<p>I later found those assumptions were wrong. At this dose level, it wasn’t about personal transformation. With gentler psychedelics or lower doses, activation and healing might remain at personal levels. But with very powerful psychedelics, you amplify consciousness so deeply that what begins as personal work becomes engaged with collective processes—the collective unconscious, the species mind. From there, you’re off to deeper and deeper levels—cycles of death and rebirth, not just ego death. Ego death is only the first of many deaths. As you go through one level after another systematically, you face forms of death more foreign than ego death.</p>
<p>That’s why I don’t recommend the protocol. It’s extremely demanding. It can become the central focus of your life—engaging deep states, navigating, absorbing, integrating them into your life, your social world, and into your body. I also assumed there was an endpoint: enlightenment, union with God, the primal void. I had those experiences and discovered many levels of divinity one can enter into, and even many levels of the pure, fertile void. About 15 years in, I went as deep as I would ever go—what I call the Diamond Luminosity domain. I saw reality far in the distance; a beam of light from that reality hit me and shattered me, even in a very high, subtle state. That’s when I realized it’s an infinite journey. You’ll never get to the end. The depth is too vast.</p>
<p>If I were to start over, I’d be gentler. I’d balance low and high doses, organic and synthetic psychedelics. The real goal is to open yourself to let in as much of the love, intelligence, and wisdom of the universe as you can, then digest it, hold it, draw it into your life, and let it guide you. It’s not about getting to a final destination.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: That’s beautiful, Chris. Thank you for sharing. What do you think the risks are of going straight to those deeper states—higher doses that might bypass some of the lower‑dose healing work? How would you use those dose ranges as tools?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Any work with psychedelics—especially higher doses in a therapeutic protocol—can be challenging, and calls for good psychological screening to make sure the psyche is ready. As you know, some people should never go near psychedelics, and some should work very gently, if at all. I happen to have a constitution that can expand into and then re‑congeal from expansive states readily and smoothly. Not everyone is wired like that. All the clinical cautions apply.</p>
<p>With high doses, one could chase a particular level and bypass others. That didn’t happen to me. I spent my first 10 sessions—about two and a half years—in very grueling work at what Stan calls the perinatal level, the interface between the personal unconscious and the collective or transpersonal. You’re reliving birth, dealing with existential crises, grinding very deeply at that level.</p>
<p>There were personal healings along the way. Often they happened at the beginning and ending of sessions—leaving and re‑entering space‑time—because in the peaks, after the first two or three years, I was in states far beyond my personal consciousness and even beyond space‑time. Later in the work, some personal healings happened very quickly. If I’d been working lower doses, those might have occurred earlier. But I don’t think I was jumping over problems. The things you confront at the deep levels are much more severe than anything at the personal level.</p>
<p>I didn’t come into this with personal trauma. I had a pretty easy start—good parents, good home—nothing beyond ordinary family push‑pull. The deeper wound we all carry is stabilizing within time and space: why we are here, the purpose of existence in this domain, whether we can discover our reason for being here and enter communion with the intelligence saturating existence.</p>
<p>I found my personal wounds were not fully healed until late, because they anchored me in the larger fields of consciousness in a way that allowed me to be used to accomplish some healing of the collective psyche. My personal wound anchored one side of a bridge; the other side was the collective psyche. That bridge allowed my sessions to become a conduit—pulling pain from the collective psyche and transforming it. Had my personal wounds been healed early, that ability would have been compromised. Along the way I learned this function—engaging the collective psyche and bringing a measure of healing—was part of my soul’s work, something I signed up for in this incarnation. I think many people are doing this type of work. There’s nothing especially unique about my choice.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: I’m also curious about the disposition you mentioned. How much is nature versus nurture? How much can you cultivate the ability to expand and hold those states without shattering into overwhelm?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: We can absolutely learn to enter these states more skillfully. Some people have a natural aptitude, but whatever your starting point, careful practice matters. If you enter carefully, process and debrief carefully, you learn how to do it better next time. Integration is crucial—careful debriefing, recording your session afterward, really sitting with the content. It establishes the baseline for your next entry. It’s cyclical. Integrating what you can hold is essential for the next step.</p>
<p>Because my work was driven by highly amplified states, I kept as many variables stable as possible: same set and setting, same substance, same dose, same sitter, same recording process, even the same part of the country. Any variable can change the texture. That’s not bad, but standardizing created a container that allowed my conversation and communion with the universe to deepen over time. Stabilizing the zone of contact allowed the deepening to take place.</p>
<p>Of course, what kind of contact we have partly depends on the headroom of the psychedelic. Different medicines engage consciousness differently and have different ranges. One reason I kept breaking through, over 20 years, one level after another had to do with holding the posture and setting—and the sheer power of LSD. If I had worked with psilocybin, I’m sure there would be overlap, but I don’t think it would have had as much cosmological headroom as LSD did.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: How did your wife feel about the trip‑sitting duty? Kudos to her for that dedication. Was it hard to convince her, or was she with you in this philosophical adventure?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Carol did it out of love for me. She was never particularly drawn to psychedelics—they were too much, too fast in her opinion. She’s a deeply spiritual person. After 24 years of marriage we separated, but we’re friends and stay in contact, especially around our children. She went on to complete her three‑year, three‑month retreat in the vadna tradition. She’s a serious practitioner with a lifelong spiritual orientation. It was of tremendous value to have her spiritual wisdom grounding me while I did this work. But it was never her work. She did it because she knew I wanted to, and we always supported each other’s spiritual paths.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: I’m really captivated by the scientific, careful, deliberate approach you took. By controlling variables, I imagine you could return to the same drill site and auger down—getting a very deep core sample of the cosmos, as it manifested in you and you in it—rather than pockmarking the surface by changing set and setting or constantly changing substances.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I think that’s true. There’s no single right or wrong way to use psychedelics—there are many good ways. I represent one particular strategy. I was trained as a philosopher of religion, with a natural orientation toward precision and analysis. Particularly because I didn’t fully know what I was getting into, I wanted to leave breadcrumbs in case I needed to work my way back out again. It turns out that wasn’t necessary.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: As a trained philosopher of religion, I’ve read you might have described yourself at the outset as an atheist‑leaning agnostic. How did your belief in, or relationship to, the divine change as a result of your experience?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Through all my graduate studies, I basically studied my way out of religion and theism—out of any belief in divinity as I had learned it, by studying world religions and the history of theology and philosophy. I began this work not just agnostic, but atheistically inclined. It was like, put up or shut up, because it didn’t look good. Science has wiped out anything that smacks of traditional religion, because the God of the Axial Age is too small for the universe science reveals—the massive scale, scope, intelligence. It erased the blackboard, and we’re still catching up.</p>
<p>So I brought a mind not adverse to religion but adverse to theology. When you begin to have experiences of the reality the religions have been talking about, that changes everything. You go through cycles of death and rebirth—surrendering your reality inside time and space, dying to that reality, and waking up in another level of reality. Do that again and again, systematically, and the reality of a reality beyond space and time becomes overwhelmingly clear. Your ability to understand, absorb, and taste it becomes second nature.</p>
<p>In all those years and all those levels, I never encountered anything that might be recognized as a deity, or even a personal spiritual guide—common in shamanic traditions. But I always felt I was engaging an intelligence that guided my experiences, interacting with me and feeding me experiences. The boundaries of that consciousness kept deepening as my practice deepened. In that context, I could speak about God, but I don’t like to, because of the connotations in the West. I could say “divinity,” but that still smuggles baggage. I tend to speak about the creative intelligence of the universe. The universe has a mind—indeed, arises out of a mind—and is always sustained and nurtured by a more fundamental reality. You can call it spiritual, or dark energy/dark matter. We now know 96% of the universe is invisible dark energy/dark matter, so it’s not radical to suggest a reality behind physical reality. Our historical concepts of God have been profoundly incomplete. We’re entering a period where we’ll be rewriting that story, and psychedelics have an important role—letting ordinary mortals have first‑hand contact with the vast expanse of spiritual reality that earlier generations would have described as the experience of God.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: So who are we in this story? Are we, as others have said, unique organizations of molecules—the universe experiencing itself—each of us a fractal through which the universe gets to experience itself in a way it otherwise wouldn’t? What do you think we are?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That question has many levels, depending on how we frame it. We are clearly part of the creative experiment that the universe is—an aspect of it, not separate from it. Our body—the cells of our biology—arises out of this evolutionary masterpiece. Our mind, like our body, derives from the universe. We’re taught the universe is a machine that moves with blindness, evolving through random variation and selection, but that’s an incomplete story. Sink into the depths of your mind and you drop out of personal mind into deeper layers—the species mind, then a solar system or galactic mind. As you drop into that, you encounter an intelligence of stunning vastness, with a depth of love and compassion behind it. That intelligence manifests the universe as its own self‑expression. We are fortunate to be cells within this body of divine self‑manifestation, fractally embedded in it, our story part of its story and vice versa.</p>
<p>At a deeper level, add reincarnation. That’s assumed in my worldview, not because of faith but because of the empirical evidence we’ve amassed. My first book was on reincarnation. I think it’s part of how nature functions. We don’t know how it came to function this way, but nature has found a way to fold learning forward—not only at the species level, but at the individual level. Reincarnation is a higher octave of evolution. Once we understand we’re participants in this evolving universe for not just 100 years but for 100,000 years, the plot thickens. The universe is intensely involved in manifesting galaxies, solar systems, planets, life, self‑aware life, and then evolving, reincarnating life. That puts us on a profound co‑footing with creation. Human evolution and individual evolution are two aspects of the same process.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: If you’ll permit me to keep pulling on this thread—it’s preoccupied me my entire life. When we’re mired in the mundane—paying taxes, going to work—and we think of ourselves as a fractal piece of this practically infinite intelligence, with love as its substrate, it makes me wonder: have we always existed in some way as individualized intelligence related to the grander One? With reincarnation, is there continuity to “Steve Thayer” that goes back hundreds of thousands of years that I just don’t remember? Or are we deconstructed and reassembled with new parts each time, with only pieces moving forward in time? What do you think?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
We don't know the answers to all those questions. We don't really know how reincarnation works or what its physics are. Even if we have evidence that reincarnation is a fact of nature, we don't know its nature—how it goes, how it works. But it seems the universe is a learning system, and reincarnation is part of that system. Because our consciousness did not begin with our body—because it goes back farther—we can use a concept like “soul,” something that holds and gathers the learning from all the incarnations we've experienced.</p>
<p>How far back does it go? Nobody knows for sure. Cultures that have believed in reincarnation say it doesn't start with human beings; it starts before human beings. How far before? We're not sure. My sense is that it starts when individuality begins to emerge within the evolutionary matrix. I use the term evolution frequently and believe in progressive development and unfolding, but that doesn't mean I agree with the standard textbook theory of what's driving evolution. When I use the term, I don't mean a reductive, determinist theory.</p>
<p>It's about learning. Somewhere along the way between grasses and chimpanzees—it's hard to think of individual blades of grass having individual consciousness—we usually think in terms of broad classes. But somewhere in the evolutionary process, individuality emerges, and as that individuality emerges, learning deepens it over time. That's when I think reincarnation becomes possible. Classically, people look to animals lower than the mammalian chain—somewhere in the animal life forms. But wherever it emerges, the next question is: what are we underneath these evolved changes?</p>
<p>That takes us deeper than the soul. What is the essence of the soul, the essence of our individuality that makes this evolving individuality possible? In psychedelic work, we find the same answers found in classic mystical traditions. The essence of the individual is the essence of the Divine. The essence of the one is the essence of the totality. We are, in essence, derived from sparks of the Divine, teased out of the unitive matrix of Divinity and given the privilege of individuated existence, which is then polished, refined, and deepened over thousands and thousands of years of going back and forth between spirit and matter, taking us along a developmental process. The essence of what we are is the Divine itself. The manifestation of what we are depends upon how long we've been cooking.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: 
You mentioned karma earlier—how you viewed it going into this work, and how that may have changed. How do you view karma now in this broad perspective?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Simply as cause and effect—karma-vipaka. The universe pulses with cause and effect at all its levels. Here, we're talking about a substrate of cause and effect set in motion by our capacity to choose. We make choices, and we inherit the consequences of those choices. In that new context, we make new choices and then inherit the consequences of those choices. If we've been smoking two packs a day for five years, we're not free to not want the next cigarette, but we are free to set in motion a series of choices that can free us from that addiction. We’re constantly making choices and inheriting their consequences.</p>
<p>One way my thinking has changed since writing Life Cycles, my first book, is that I have a much deeper appreciation of the synergistic relationship between individual development (individual karma) and collective development (collective karma). In the West, we tend to over-personalize karma—telling the story of the individual soul maturing over many lifetimes and reaching enlightenment. I think our species is evolving—pulsing every hundred years in reincarnation—and there is a collective learning process taking place of which our individual learning is a part. The boundary between collective and individual learning is porous, and I have much more sensitivity to collective karma that I might previously have seen as personal karma.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: 
Earlier you mentioned the role psychedelics might be playing in this evolution of consciousness. When we were talking about that place between blades of grass and chimpanzees, what are your thoughts on Terence McKenna's stoned ape hypothesis? Was that an example of the universe between spirit and matter learning as it evolved? Do you view psychedelics as playing a role in history as well?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Terence's hypothesis is interesting. I don't have an opinion on it or any new insights to add. I hold it as an interesting hypothesis without any independent way of assessing it.</p>
<p>I do think we are coming to a make-or-break point in history, and psychedelics have a significant role to play. They're giving us extra awareness at a time when we desperately need it, and a form of accelerated, deepening healing at a time when we desperately need that too. There's a tremendous inner fermentation and detoxification taking place at the collective level as well as the individual level. It manifests in our lives as an up-rushing of karmic content, conditioning, pain, and trauma we've been carrying in our soul history. This isn't just happening to a few people with access; it's happening underneath us in social movements and across the world.</p>
<p>By giving us an amplified experience of our consciousness—and of the consciousness we are part of—psychedelics help us heal and help us manage this purification process. They also give us a wider worldview. One good, deep psychedelic experience of communion with the deep structure of the universe can shatter materialism—the philosophy that matter is the only thing that's real. Huston Smith was right: a mystical experience does not a mystic make, but a mystical experience can an atheist unmake. Psychedelics have an important role to play.</p>
<p>How far will this go? How deep will psychedelic healing reach in our culture? How fast will insights realized under psychedelic communion contribute to the paradigm shift now being driven by multiple disciplines? I don't know. But the fact that LSD was invented in the same decade the nuclear bomb was invented—and the bomb changed the global order—may be a significant synchronicity.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: 
Speaking of this time in human development—and as someone who has dedicated his academic and personal life to exploring what it means to be human—do you have an opinion on artificial intelligence? Some folks say psychedelics are helping us learn who we are, which might be really important if we’re creating something different, but also conscious.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I don't really have an opinion. It never came up in my sessions—I finished them in 1999. I stand on the sidelines as a layperson—and an older one. I'm 74, and this is really a younger generation's work. I watch from the edges. It's developing much faster than I could keep track of. I'm concerned about it, but clearly it's here, it's happening, and it’s going to have a huge impact. I don't know whether it will be a friend or an enemy over time.</p>
<p>I'm more concerned about the ecological cliff we're going over. We can extrapolate: the imbalances we generated in the industrial era are manifesting with catastrophic consequences. The cumulative effect of these ecological crises will keep hitting again and again until we get on top of this—and we’re nowhere near that. This is turning the 21st century into a period of tremendous global instability, unraveling, and crisis. How AI plays into this, I don't know.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: 
On the ecological front, how much of that realization came from your psychedelic deep dives versus life experience? And did you get any insights on how psychedelics or raising consciousness might help us find a better path forward?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Let’s hold the second part and address the first, because this was one of the biggest surprises of my work. First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.</p>
<p>What I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.</p>
<p>There’s a chapter—“The Birth of the Future Human”—where I gather the experiences in my journey that bear on the question: where is humanity right now, and where are we going? It was a complete surprise that this came up in my sessions a long time ago, before I had any ecological awareness—before I had absorbed the information we're all absorbing today. These visions took place between 1991 and 1995. I was completely naive about hitting our environmental limits.</p>
<p>Tucked in around the edges here and there, I began to be given visions of where humanity was in its evolutionary saga. We were coming to a definitive turning point—an evolutionary pivot. We were entering a magnificent period of human history with tremendous blessings, a period of profound transformation. The future of humanity would be radically unlike its present and past. But for the first three or four years I was given no indication of how we would actually get there. Looking around, it didn't look very positive. How are we going to make this transition?</p>
<p>In December 1995, when I was far along in my psychedelic work, I had entered a stage I call the diamond luminosity material—years of exquisitely subtle, sublime work. In a session when I expected to be taken back into that state, instead I was dissolved into the species mind. As the species, I experienced a death and rebirth of the human family—a profound unraveling of life as we had known it.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe, because most experiences are from a self-referential point. It sounds ludicrous to say I described the death of humanity as humanity, but I experienced a tremendous building crisis and unraveling—shattering expectations and systems—until humanity was reduced to the bare challenge of survival. It looked, for a while, like an extinction event: a global systems crisis driven by a cascading series of eco-crises. I wasn't given details, a timetable, or how it would happen—just this deep cultural collective crisis. Then, at its worst, we moved through it. On the other side, we had been changed—radically. There was an opening of the human heart, an opening of compassion, a profound change in what we’d classically call human nature. I would describe it as a shift in the fundamental structure of the collective unconscious—the plate tectonics of the collective psyche.</p>
<p>As we reassembled ourselves, the world was saturated with new values, new perceptions of the good, new social institutions—a huge transformation of the human heart. I was given many instructions on the mechanisms for moving through this crisis faster than we'd think possible, given the pace at which history moves. It has to do with understanding the collective psyche as a unified field. The crisis will be so severe it will shove not only individual psyches into a highly altered, far-from-equilibrium state, but also shove the collective psyche into a far-from-equilibrium condition. We know how physical systems behave when pushed far from equilibrium—chaos theory, etc. I was shown that the human psyche, shoved into a similar state, will exhibit some of the same characteristics: rapid change, new structures emerging from the floor of the collective psyche, and small iterations producing dramatic outcomes. Bottom line: we would move through this crisis much faster than we'd think possible because of its severity and negative impact on lives around the world.</p>
<p>In subsequent sessions, I was given experiences moving into deep time—beyond linear time—experiencing what I call the future human, the archetypal form of humanity. This being is extraordinarily beautiful—magnificent—as far beyond us as we are beyond our earlier Homo erectus cousins: a being with a massive, healed heart and an open mind. Not just a transformation of the heart and mind, but also of sensory experience. We tend to have a mechanical theory of how the senses work, but I was shown that the more consciousness is consolidated in the body, the more refined our sensory experiences become. I had an experience at the end of my journey of vision 100 times sharper than in ordinary consciousness; the same applies to hearing and other senses. This is a pivot to a radically transformed human species—with a radically opened heart, a radically open mind, and a radically augmented physical capacity. I think this is the story of our century: how we make this transition—what I call the birth of the diamond soul.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: 
One follow-up before we get into the birth of the diamond soul. As a professor of religious studies, do any religious or philosophical frameworks line up with what you’re describing? I'm thinking of the Kali Yuga from Hinduism—the dark age of materialism and corruption, the sages retreating but not disappearing, then the turn into the Golden Age with the return of wisdom, intelligence, and compassion. Do any of those line up, or do you apply any frameworks from your other studies?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In addition to what you mentioned, we have Hopi prophecies and a number of indigenous traditions that have been seeing and speaking about this profound transformation for a long time. It does line up. The general perception is that we are in a period of darkness. I would conceptualize that darkness as the conditioning of the past—the karmic patterns that shape the human psyche at deep structural levels—being driven to the surface by an infusion of grace and energy. All the hatreds of history, the divisions of race, gender, nationality, haves and have-nots—all the patterns of splitting the world—are being driven to the surface. These toxicities must come out to make us available to the influx of divine energy, whether you think of it as entering from above or rising from within. There’s something deeply true in these ancient prophecies: we are in the age of the Kali Yuga and coming into a profound new age. When it will hit us and how we get there, I don't know, but there’s a relationship.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: 
As I hear you talk, it feels very true. As a psychologist, I’ve always been curious about the human psyche. When I look at the human organism, I see a being capable of so much more than we tend to produce—capable of great violence and fear-driven behavior, and also great creativity, adaptation, love, inclusion, and compassion. We're such a paradox. As terrifying as it sounds, the maturity process you describe—the next stage of development—does sound like it might require a crisis to force or draw out that next stage. I look at my own psychedelic experiences and those of my clients as almost an exercise in existential crisis—like going through a refiner's fire to burn away the dross so the purity of what you really are can come forward. But because of how intense and confusing it can be, integration can be really hard in day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It can. Once we get into this work deeply, we realize we're playing on a different field than we thought. It's a much bigger game. It's not about our personal life and transformation—we're involved in historic processes of enormous import. If you're going to engage the deep psyche, you're going into the deep end of the pool. The deep water is moving very fast right now; there's tremendous bubbling taking place. Everyone has a certain tolerance for handling the complexity and intensity at that level.</p>
<p>When we come back, we need to record as carefully as we can the nature of our visionary experience—and then take care of ourselves as we integrate it. It took me a year to recover from the session about the birth of the future human—the collapse into the death and rebirth of humanity—and to stabilize it. Even then, you have to practice the arts of grounding if you're going to go deep. Be well grounded at all levels: physically, emotionally, psychologically, and socially with your peer groups. It’s a demanding process.</p>
<p>My understanding of reincarnation is that we get to choose the life we incarnate in. We’re given options and can see what we're going into when we choose our life. That means every person here has chosen to be here in the form they are—and that all of us have chosen to incarnate at this very demanding time in history. We want to be players in this time, for our benefit, for our children and grandchildren around the world, and for the benefit of the Divine itself. The Divine is working. This isn’t just something humanity is doing; this is something nature is doing, whatever the intelligence behind and within nature is.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: 
I've always questioned this notion of choosing to incarnate. The idea that someone would choose to be born with fetal alcohol syndrome, or as a child in a war-torn country with disease and conflict—how does a reincarnation perspective grapple with those realities?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Terrible suffering—babies born without a neocortex, anencephalic children; babies born into violent circumstances, destined to die after a very short life with terrible pain. How can we assert that there is intelligence, let alone compassion, in such a universe? To see the wisdom and the intelligence, we have to look very deep and very wide. On the surface, life can be a mean son of a bitch—cruel and vindictive—decimated by circumstances that crush the human heart.</p>
<p>From a reincarnation perspective, our life did not begin with birth, and it does not end at death; our life is part of a larger story. Why someone would choose a life involving so much suffering may be impossible to answer from within a time-space perspective and from within an individual, almost centric perspective. To glimpse larger patterns, we have to open into a very large—evolutionary and spiritual—perspective.</p>
<p>Most importantly, all of our suffering is preserved, conserved, and used; all human suffering is experienced by the Divine. There is no Divine outside human suffering watching us suffer. Everything humanity suffers—everything the animal kingdom suffers—the spiritual world suffers at a very deep level.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: 
If we are the universe experiencing itself, it's not just the people with awesome lives that the universe is experiencing. It's every instantiation—every life—the ones that suffer and the ones that don't suffer as much.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
And I address this in Lifecycles: human suffering brings us to our knees, and I don't think we have an adequate understanding or explanation of it. In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and experienced the intelligence behind this process, I’ve found myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re ultimately brought to our knees trying to understand it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives you confidence that there truly is a logic to it.</p>
<p>I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. When you look at images of Kali the Destroyer—she is a liberator who brings about enlightenment, but she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other—these things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: in a deeper sense, is the universe paying attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our own development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us as we are in pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: 
That was a beautiful answer, and I appreciate you trying to address it, Chris, because I certainly feel like I’m on my knees. I think I read somewhere—maybe yours or someone else’s—that the Divine is something we can experience but not necessarily comprehend. That concept has brought me quite a bit of peace as someone who’s a self-described truth seeker, really wanting to understand things, thinking that understanding would give me assurance that everything would be okay or help me know what I should or shouldn’t do. Permission to not know all the answers is quite comforting.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: 
Chris, do you have certain people you count as teachers, or who shaped your philosophical and spiritual perspective? And how does one proceed on a path of exploration like this wisely? What are good preparatory philosophies, spiritual frameworks, or systems to check out or try on?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I had the benefit of being a professor of religious studies, and I spent much of my professional life teaching courses in comparative mysticism, Buddhism, and introductory courses in Eastern and Western traditions. I got to study a lot of the masters and learn their stories. They were always my guideposts. Even though my work wasn’t focused on spiritual awakening—we haven’t talked too much about that—the great masters were my touchstones, and I tried to hold myself accountable to them as I conducted myself in this unusual spiritual practice.</p>
<p>Indigenous cultures I have tremendous respect for. I haven’t academically studied them—I have a layman’s reading of a number of books and a deep respect. I appreciate that for people undertaking this type of work, it’s beneficial to do it under the tutelage of an experienced teacher or guide—someone who can help them process what they’re experiencing. That hasn’t been my particular destiny. I’ve never had a teacher or been advised by an elder in a psychedelic community. In this way, the only teacher I’ve personally had has been the universe itself, and she has been a fierce and loyal teacher. She’s broken me down, ground me up, spit me out, and beaten me severely—and she’s also helped me, blessed me, loved me, and taught me more than I ever imagined possible.</p>
<p>When we do this type of work, it’s foolish to do it alone. Those were my circumstances, and I had the constitution to survive it. I had the companionship of my partner, a very wise spiritual woman who helped keep me grounded. And I had the advice of the elders I was studying in my courses. For most people, it’s good to do this work in groups and under the guidance of someone with more experience in these states, because this is new territory. By “guidance,” I don’t mean someone who directs our experience, but someone who helps us enter these states safely and who can help us understand and process our experiences when we come back out of them.</p>
<p>It’s important to have people we can talk to. One of the burdens of my journey was working in isolation. Because it was all illegal, I couldn’t bring it to the office, I couldn’t bring it to campus, I couldn’t talk to my students about it. I’m a teacher—I love to learn and share, and I’m a gabber—so I couldn’t talk about this stuff. That’s not healthy. It’s good to have a community where you can share your experiences and listen to others. As that shared experience grows, we know we’re all in this together. We learn from each other as we go deeper. It’s really important to do this work in a responsible way, with the guidance or tutelage of people who have more experience than you do.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: 
Thank you for that. I know time is whizzing by, but I’m on the edge of my seat to hear anything you could share about the birth of the diamond soul, or that second part of the evolution and ecology of consciousness—where we might focus our intentions on a path forward.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
About halfway through my journey, in the 38th session, in a year of great blessings—just enormous blessings—I was taken into an experience preceded by very intense purification processes, a very intense death-rebirth process. At one phase, I had the experience of all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before and was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives. I’d already written the book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But I began to experience my former lives coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They seemed to hit a critical mass, and when they did, they fused. There was an explosion of energy and all these separate lives fused into one life. There was an explosion of diamond light out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. I was then given a whole lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening. It changed my whole understanding of how reincarnation works and where it’s taking us.</p>
<p>The classic understanding of reincarnation in Eastern cultures is that you incarnate, you self-challenge, you make mistakes, you make progress; you get better, stronger, more compassionate over time until eventually you reach some type of spiritual realization—an awakening or enlightenment experience. Once you reach that, you’re free to leave the system of space-time. It’s an up-and-out cosmology. The religions of the Axial Age of the last 5,000 years are all up-and-out cosmologies: you achieve salvation or enlightenment, and the fruition comes in an off-planet spiritual paradise.</p>
<p>My sessions taught me that’s not an adequate description. It’s a first-stage approximation humanity made when deeper experiences began giving contact with spiritual reality. It stops halfway. What I was shown is that humanity is not simply evolving lifetime after lifetime making small, incremental improvements. Sooner or later, all of our lives come together inside our physical existence. We die and expand into the soul; we incarnate into a narrow egoic experience; we die and expand into the soul; then incarnate again. We know the soul in between our lifetimes. But if we keep this incarnational rhythm up long enough—I have my students do this as a 15-minute exercise, expanding out each “lifetime”—sooner or later the soul wakes up inside our physical existence. This is what I call the birth of the diamond soul.</p>
<p>When the soul wakes up inside our physical existence, there’s a tremendous expansion of heart and mind, and it changes our entire orientation. We focus on the long-term vision, the long-term good, the wide good, because we have an intuitive awareness of the hundreds or thousands of people we’ve been in relationship with through history. We’ve been every race, every religion. We’ve been up and down the economic ladder. We’ve held all the roles in history. When all those lives wake up as a singular consciousness, it radically changes our perception of what’s taking place, who we are, and where we’re going.</p>
<p>When people ask what form the future human will take, we explore all sorts of science fiction. I think it’s much more simple. We’ve been gestating the future human for hundreds of thousands of years through reincarnation. Gestation is long; labor is short and intense. I think we are entering a period of labor. We are desperately trying to grow into the largest, deepest, richest version of ourselves—that is the diamond soul. The diamond soul is being born in history. It’s the form the future human will take.</p>
<p>Imagine if the entire species went through this process—not just a few Christ, the Buddha, Muhammad, and a few privileged saints here and there—but the entire species awakening spiritually to this deeper identity that’s been gestating inside all these years. What an extraordinary species that would be, and what an extraordinary history it would create. We’ve reached a point where we simply cannot run this planet out of egoic consciousness. We either grow up or go extinct. Extinction is a tremendous evolutionary accelerator. Personally, I think this century’s evolving crisis is going to take us to our edge. But my experience is that we make it through. I’ve experienced the future human as both a task to be actualized and an accomplishment already realized. I deeply believe we will make it through these developmental challenges, and when we look back over human and soul history, we will recognize that all the pain and hardship it took to get here has been worth it. We are giving birth to a new child in history, and it will be worth it.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: 
Chris, I’m feeling very grateful to you—for your life’s work and your willingness to share it. I’m glad you decided to come forward and share with all of us, not just your students. You had to do so almost covertly for a long time, just by living the difference, but now through your written work and conversations like this. It means a lot to me personally. Thank you for coming on our show.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It’s an honor to have this discussion with you, gentlemen, and to share these ideas and this teaching with your audience. It truly is.</p>
<p>Reid Robison: 
Thank you, Chris. This has been such a delightful honor and pleasure. We’ll cherish this conversation. Thank you for your generosity in sharing with us.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thank you for your work, gentlemen—thank you for the healing and insight you bring into the world.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: 
Chris, is there anywhere in particular you’d like to point people? A website, any of your current work—where can they find out more about you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
They can contact me through my website, chrisbache.com. It’s in need of an overhaul, but it’s there, and I’ve posted things I’ve written. I’m also all over YouTube—various podcasts and talks I’ve given are there. If the articles I’ve written aren’t on my website, they’ll be on academia.edu under my name; all my most important writings are available there. I’m not doing any structured teaching at present. I may be doing some retreats in the near future, but those are still in the planning stages. Right now I’m doing some talks here and there at conferences, maybe some retreats coordinated by people I’ve been working with individually. Basically, I’m following where the work has gone into the world. I don’t have an agenda. I’m responding to where the book takes me—people read the book, they get interested, like you—and I’m following it out.</p>
<p>Steve Thayer: 
A Chris Bache retreat sounds awesome—I’ll put it on my bucket list tonight. I’ll be looking for it, and we’ll link to your website and places where people can find your work in our episode show notes. Again, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
You bet. Thank you.</p>

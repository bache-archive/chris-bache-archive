**Abstract**

In this lecture, philosopher **Chris Bache** recounts his 40-year exploration of psychedelic

consciousness and the cosmological insights that arose from 73 high-dose LSD sessions carried

out between 1979 and 1999. Building on Stanislav Grof’s frameworks, Bache distinguishes

between therapeutic “psycholytic” work and his own “psychedelic exploration,” describing five

major death-rebirth thresholds: ego death, collective suffering, archetypal reality, causal

oneness, and the domain of diamond luminosity. He outlines a future-oriented vision in which

humanity faces an intense global crisis that ultimately catalyzes a leap into a “future human”

state. Emphasising disciplined set and setting, rigorous journaling, and long integration

periods, Bache argues that psychedelics can grant direct communion with a super-coherent cosmic

intelligence and accelerate both personal and collective evolution. The talk closes with a call

to steward these states responsibly and to ground their revelations in compassionate action.

**CHRIS BACHE**: *\[music, applause\]* Thank you, Swamiji, for guiding us into such a spacious inner

place. I went so deep that I suddenly remembered—I still have a talk to give!

**CHRIS BACHE**: The cosmology that surfaces in psychedelic research is not new. It mirrors the

visions found in the world’s deepest mystical traditions. What is new is the technology—modern

psychedelics—giving fresh access to those timeless states.

**CHRIS BACHE**: It is a pleasure to be with the TimeWaver community again. Last year I spoke

about a manuscript titled *Diamonds from Heaven*. The book is finished and will be released in

November under the publisher’s title *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. For me it will always

remain *Diamonds from Heaven*.

**CHRIS BACHE**: A revolution begins by asking, *What is it possible for human beings to

experience?* The Global Consciousness Project, parapsychology, and psychedelic research all

stretch that question. Ervin Laszlo, who wrote the foreword to my book, demonstrates across

disciplines that a super-coherent cosmic intelligence informs space-time. I contend that, in a

disciplined setting, psychedelics allow progressively deeper communion with that intelligence.

**CHRIS BACHE**: Today’s renaissance in psychedelic science has two main fronts: mapping neural

biochemistry and healing personal trauma—PTSD, depression, and more. Important first steps, yet

only beginnings. Historically, shamanic and mystical lineages teach that personal healing is

merely the launchpad for a far longer journey.

**CHRIS BACHE**: These medicines can shatter the shell of the earth-bound mind so reliably that

the ensuing depths of cosmic communion defy description. By repeatedly dissolving ourselves, we

enter flows of life that transcend all measure, becoming beings who know and do what ordinary

selves cannot.

**CHRIS BACHE**: My own path began in 1979 when I discovered Stan Grof’s *Realms of the Human

Unconscious* and *LSD Psychotherapy*. Grof distinguishes low-dose psycholytic therapy, which

peels the psyche layer by layer, from high-dose psychedelic therapy, which launches one through

all layers at once—often into near-death experience. Spring Grove Hospital limited this to three

sessions. I wondered: if three are safe, could more reveal a larger map?

**CHRIS BACHE**: Quietly, covertly—I had no legal avenue—I embarked on a 20-year project:

seventy-three sessions of 500–600 µg LSD, always with the same clinically trained sitter (my

then-wife), identical setting, eyeshades, curated music, meticulous notes. Four years on, six

years off, then ten more years, all between ages thirty and fifty.

**CHRIS BACHE**: I now call this protocol *psychedelic exploration*. The method is Grofian

therapy; the difference is sheer repetition. I do **not** recommend others follow my exact path.

Today I would interleave high and low doses and balance LSD with more body-anchored medicines

like psilocybin or ayahuasca.

**CHRIS BACHE**: Across twenty years the sessions formed a single conversation. Personal themes

arose mainly at entry and exit; the peaks moved far beyond personal reality. Five core

death-rebirth passages emerged:

* Death of self—complete ego dissolution.

* Descent into collective suffering—an ocean of humanity’s pain.

* Entry into archetypal mind—encountering vast Platonic intelligences.

* Causal oneness—totality without outside.

* Diamond luminosity—a clear light matching Buddhism’s dharmakaya.

**CHRIS BACHE**: The first phase, crossing birth and death, echoed Grof’s perinatal matrices. Ten

sessions over two years culminated in radical ego death. Expecting relief, I instead plunged

into collective agony—wars, slavery, every wound our species carries. For another two years that

suffering deepened until, in session 24, it climaxed and never returned.

**CHRIS BACHE**: On the far side lay *deep time in the soul*: experiencing my entire life—and,

later, humanity’s hundred-thousand-year arc—as simultaneous wholeness. Such states must be

learned; recall improves with practice.

**CHRIS BACHE**: After a six-year hiatus the work resumed exactly where it had stopped, revealing

an intentional guidance. New sessions delivered systematic instruction on cosmic structure—the

“master plan.” I saw humanity as a single organism, our minds fractal facets of one greater

mind, our bodies cells within one body.

**CHRIS BACHE**: Descent into archetypal reality required surrendering even human identity.

Terrifying fiery deaths stabilized consciousness at higher energy densities. There I beheld

galactic-scale beings who shape time-space and evolve life.

**CHRIS BACHE**: In causal oneness came a year of blessings: emptiness, universal song, oceans of

love, and “diamond soul” fusion—past-life filaments coalescing into a radiant individuality far

beyond ordinary ego.

**CHRIS BACHE**: Yet the journey’s purpose was not escape. Over five years diamond luminosity

pressed itself into my biology, demonstrating that transcendence must incarnate, transforming

body, mind, and society.

**CHRIS BACHE**: Throughout, visions of a *future human* recurred: a planetary crisis, rapid

non-linear reorganization, and an accelerated evolutionary leap. Labor pains of a species in

birth, not terminal decline.

**CHRIS BACHE**: *\[applause\]* In closing, these realms belong to everyone, whether reached by

psychedelics or other disciplines. Approach them gently, with rigorous preparation, and let

their light soak into your bones. Thank you. *\[music, applause\]*

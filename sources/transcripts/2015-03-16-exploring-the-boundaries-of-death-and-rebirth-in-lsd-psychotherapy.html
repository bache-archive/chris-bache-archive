<p><em><em>Host: ** 
Good morning. I now have the joy of introducing our first speaker this morning, and I must say, one of my most influential teachers, Christopher Bache. Chris is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for over 30 years in psychology of religion, transpersonal studies, Buddhism, and Eastern religions. For two years, he was the director of transformative learning at the Institute of Noetic Sciences in Petaluma, and is also adjunct faculty at CIIS, where each of his classes feels like being held in a transformative sacred container. His publications include </em>Life Cycles</em>, <em>The Living Classroom</em>, and his groundbreaking work, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>. This morning, Chris will be speaking on exploring the boundaries of death and rebirth in LSD psychotherapy. Please join me in welcoming Chris Bache.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** 
Good morning, everyone. It's a true joy to join you today in the continuing celebration of Stan Grof—an extraordinary lifetime accomplishment as a scholar, a healer, and a pioneer. Like many others in this room, Stan has had a profound influence on my life. He changed the direction of both my professional and personal journey.</p>
<p>The turning point for me came in 1978. I had just finished graduate school in philosophy of religion, which left me an atheistically inclined agnostic, and began my career as a young academic. I was in a time of transition—though I didn’t know it then, I was in my Saturn Return—and I read <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>. In that single reading, I found my life’s work. I was convinced that those who would make the most substantial contributions to my field, philosophy of religion, would soon be writing from an experiential, not just conceptual, basis. Stan was opening up a methodology for exploring the deep psyche with extraordinary potential and solid scholarship. I knew I could trust his work. So I chose to begin what turned out to be a 20-year journey, working with high doses of LSD—from 1979 to 1999. What I’ll discuss today comes out of my attempts to understand my experiences on that journey. My life has never been the same. How do you thank someone for such a gift?</p>
<p>The experience of dying and being reborn is central to holotropic and psychedelic work, yet it remains deeply puzzling. This morning, I’d like to share my attempts to address three basic questions about the death-rebirth dynamic. First: Why does death become as large as it sometimes does in psychedelic therapy? Second: Why does death repeat itself so many times in this long process? And third, and perhaps most difficultly: What is actually dying in the death-rebirth process? Along the way, I’d also like to revise the discussion of death-rebirth that I presented in <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, which I now find incomplete.</p>
<p>I’ll just be giving you bullet points this morning from an article that discusses this at greater length; you’ll find a more complete discussion in a wonderful two-volume book edited by Harold Abram Evans. Many of the speakers presenting here today are included in this work.</p>
<p>So, let’s jump into it: Why does death become as large as it sometimes does in LSD psychotherapy? I wrote <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, in part, to answer this question, so I’ll give you a little background. My first two years of psychedelic work were focused on the perinatal level of consciousness—filled with the usual perinatal symptomatology, extreme existential confrontations, convulsive seizures, and various forms of fetal experiences. Eventually, this culminated in a death-rebirth experience that turned my life inside out and snapped my identity like a twig. I began the day as a white, middle-class, fresh-out-of-the-Ivy-League philosopher obsessed with the meaning of life, and was forced to become women—hundreds of women of color, women with no educational background or philosophical horizons. It was frightening. The inversion of my values, and particularly the loss of my sexual identity, was shattering. It was the perfect hell for a male academic. When I lost the distinctions that had defined my life, I died—and was reborn into a new world, the extraordinarily beautiful world of the feminine, explored under the arm of the Great Mother.</p>
<p>Immediately after this, a new cycle began, in which I was repeatedly immersed in experiences of collective anguish that completely dwarfed those early sessions and shattered all my previous frames of reference. In this second phase, I entered an ocean of suffering that expanded with each session until it eventually encompassed the entire history of the human race. The dying in these sessions was vast and elemental in scale and intensity. To give you a sense: the anguish thickened into a terrible horror acted out around me on all sides. The forms of the horror were so many that there was no way to describe it—disembowelings by the score, mauling of lives, deaths in the thousands, swirling forms so complex, multidimensional, and multithematic that isolated images barely stand out. It was war, savagery, destruction, killing, and anguish—lasting hours. I know many in this room have had similar experiences.</p>
<p>This phase of work lasted four years and 28 sessions: one year of active work, then a six-year break, followed by three more years of active work. My first interpretation was to see these experiences as leading to a deepening—a more complete ego death. I assumed that if any form of death was occurring in a session, it had to be pieces of ego dying. But eventually, this assumption was overwhelmed by the sheer volume and intensity of the collective suffering. These episodes went on for too many years and were too extreme to continue seeing them as simply being drawn in through resonance to unfinished ego death. This forced me to reassess the boundaries and goals of the entire therapeutic enterprise.</p>
<p>The conclusion I came to was that these collective episodes were not primarily aimed at transforming my personal consciousness, but rather at the transformation and healing of the species mind as a whole. In <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, I abandoned the person-centered narrative—that the goal of therapy was the healing of the individual—and adopted a larger narrative by integrating Rupert Sheldrake's concept of morphic fields into Stan’s paradigm. This opened a way to view these collective ordeals as part of a larger process aimed at healing the scars humanity still carries in its collective memory. I think that in these highly energized states, the field of the collective psyche is sometimes activated so intensely that it triggers a collective healing process. Through some fractal flip, I hadn’t imagined possible, the patient in my sessions had stopped being me and had become humanity itself, or some part of humanity.</p>
<p>To illustrate, let me share a bit of vocabulary: Stan’s perinatal matrices organized as a cycle, then building on Rick Tarnas and Stan’s work on correlations between planetary archetypes and the perinatal matrices—Neptune, Saturn, Pluto, Uranus—and an image to suggest the relationship between ego (represented as a little drop at the bottom) and the vast expanse of the perinatal, the transpersonal territory, and the death-rebirth cycle—the interface between personal and transpersonal consciousness.</p>
<p>In <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, I kept the perinatal vocabulary to describe these collective ordeals, but tried to stretch the rationale for their appearance. I proposed that a person’s experience of the perinatal domain could tilt either toward the personal or the transpersonal side of that interface. If your perinatal experience tilted toward the personal, you might experience the loss of your physical identity intertwined with reliving your birth. But I hypothesized that if your perinatal experience tilted toward the transpersonal side, you might experience your death and rebirth in a state of profound fusion with the human species—in which case, the birth canal becomes the birth canal of history. I also suggested there were two tiers of death and rebirth at work: one aimed at personal ego death, another at collective ego death.</p>
<p>At present, though, I’ve shifted to what I think is a simpler, more elegant understanding. My current thinking is that death and rebirth is an archetypal cycle that repeats multiple times as we move through successively deeper stages of psychedelic unfolding—a wheel that, like the wheel of Buddha Dharma, turns repeatedly. Being an archetypal wheel, any one death-rebirth experience can draw from multiple levels of reality, but being a cycle, it repeats in different forms as one moves deeper into consciousness.</p>
<p>So, the essence of my revision to <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> is this: Rather than seeing these episodes of collective suffering (at least in my experience) as a protracted first turning of the wheel of death and rebirth, I now see them as a second turning—a movement at the subtle level of consciousness, whose dynamics are inherently collective, focusing on the collective patient and aimed at collective transformation. In a personal exchange with Stan, he supported this revision, writing: “I feel that for clarity, we should change the terminology and make it clear that the term ‘perinatal’ should be used only for fetal experiences, and not for experiences of death and rebirth on higher levels of the transpersonal spectrum, with no relation to biological birth.”</p>
<p>Let’s move to the next question: Why does dying repeat itself so many times in psychedelic therapy? Returning to my personal story, when this long phase of collective dying and rebirth had ended, it was followed by a series of five overwhelmingly positive sessions that seemed to constitute a megarebirth. I felt overwhelmed by grace, filled with blessings, with a deep sense that I’d accomplished the primary purpose of my incarnation. At that point, after all those years, I hoped that the ordeal of dying would stop eventually; I thought the transition to transpersonal reality would become easier—and I think it would have, if I had stayed within the boundaries of transpersonal experience I had thus far initiated. But for better or worse, the method of exploration I’d chosen was so powerful it kept pushing me beyond my experiential limits. I was working with five to six hundred micrograms of LSD in totally internalized sessions.</p>
<p>To illustrate—while I’m using the language of psychic, subtle, and causal levels of reality, we may have many different maps for charting the vast expanse of transpersonal territory. The principle I want to illustrate is this: Over the next six years and 35 sessions, a third phase opened in my work, in which I was propelled through a series of death-rebirth experiences that drew me even deeper into the divine. I was spun into the radiance of what Buddhists call sambhogakaya, what I came to call the domain of diamond luminosity. I had known light many times before, but this was an exceptionally pure light, a completely different order of reality. Its clarity was overwhelming, its energy so pure that returning to it became my only goal, extinguishing all residual interest I had in exploring archetypal realities that used to fascinate me.</p>
<p>When this phase was over, I counted six cycles of death and rebirth—many deaths, of course, but six seminal breakthroughs. What matters most here is the pattern: death and rebirth is a cycle that repeats itself at successive levels of initiation into the cosmos. No matter how complete and satisfying each rebirth, it is always followed by more experiences of dying as the spiral continues. Death repeats itself not because it fails to “hit the mark” or because ego has survived, but because the Divine is an infinite landscape, with countless levels to explore. Each death is a gateway to what lies beyond.</p>
<p>In his beautiful book <em>The Ultimate Journey</em>, Stan describes forms that death can take at transpersonal levels: identification with ancestors or people from different countries and historical periods, with dying lives or lives threatened; sequences from the collective unconscious can be associated with a sense of personal remembering, which characterize them as past incarnational memories. Death can even be experienced through complete identification with animal or plant life. It’s also powerfully represented in the collective unconscious as mythological motifs, death gods, underworlds, archetypes of death, astral or Bardo realms, the soul’s post-human journey—only Stan could write a sentence like that, and he truly knows what he’s talking about. I wouldn’t have had the courage to go to some of those places had I not known he’d been there before me and returned to tell the tale.</p>
<p>Whatever the level, the core of dying is always the same: complete loss of control, absolute surrender, a disorientation so deep it dissolves reality as we have known it. Rebirth, too, is always the same: awakening inside a new and unanticipated dimension of reality, the birth of a new identity with new capacities, and the experience of absolute grace—of having been given infinitely more than one has given up. Yet within this underlying structure, the details of dying and being reborn reflect the level of consciousness at which the work occurs. The experiential texture—its flavor, function, and what is dying—changes as the process continues.</p>
<p>After one has died and been reborn many times, eventually the concept of death loses its meaning. One learns through repetition that, at the deepest level, it’s impossible to die. The form that you are can end, reality as you have known it can be destroyed many times, but the innermost essence always reemerges—the phoenix always rises. Death becomes simply a measure of the degree of purification being enacted. When purification deepens enough to dissolve the form you are, dying returns to grace you; this is what I call “purification unto death.” During this third phase, I surrendered another assumption: the idea that there is an ultimate end to the cycle, a final death. I no longer believe this is the case.</p>
<p>I believe the progression is endless. The dying stops only when one’s capacity for discovery is exhausted—when one simply can take no more. Let me qualify this: I know it goes against the notion that a complete death equals a final death. When one’s private existence is dissolved, one can enter a state of oneness that is utterly satisfying. One rests in the source of existence—one with all that is. You cannot imagine anything more satisfying. And yet, with repeated immersion in this condition, new dimensions of oneness eventually reveal themselves, and new levels of joy are associated with each. The One exists in many modalities, and can be known in many depths of expression—always one, but at different degrees.</p>
<p>So, what is actually dying? I want to affirm a delicate “both/and” here. It’s the individual who undergoes these deaths—they become part of one’s life story, and thus belong to the individual. On the other hand, these deaths also belong to the universe in ways that transcend individuality. The universe uses these opportunities to heal and commune with itself, beyond the personal. Both perspectives are true and need to be affirmed.</p>
<p>So, what is dying? In the early deaths, particularly, the ego is dying: the constrictions, wounds, illusions, and habits created by our earthly history. But in later sessions, after the ego has surrendered its grip, what exactly is dying then? Often there’s still a strong sensation of dying—but what is it now attached to?</p>
<p>Part of the answer, I believe, is that some aspect of the species ego is dying. When the wheel of death and rebirth is turning at the subtle level, where the deaths are largely collective, what is dying is some part of the species ego—a collective nodule of pain and suffering living in the collective unconscious. When the “patient” shifts from individual to species mind, the pulse of life one experiences is the pulse of human history. We participate not as individuals, but as fractal members of the entire species. The coex (condensed experience) systems resolving themselves are not personal, but collective systems—what I call the meta-matrices of the collective unconscious.</p>
<p>But there’s another level we can move to: what’s dying at these deeper levels? I named it the shamanic persona. All of us have probably noticed, after a session, how we sometimes can’t hold onto all the knowledge, experiences, and insights we had. And yet, when we re-enter the psychedelic state, we find the missing knowledge waiting for us, and we resume our psychedelic identity when the next session opens. This common experience suggests the psyche retains and integrates our psychedelic experiences at levels deeper than conscious awareness. Ego-state psychology has shown this compartmentalization is a common psychological feature—here I’m thinking of Gordon Emerson, John Rowan, and Tom Zinser. Ego-state psychology can help illuminate how our psyche manages the extreme fluctuations that occur in psychedelic therapy.</p>
<p>Specifically, I want to suggest that, through repeatedly opening and closing awareness in psychedelic sessions, a semi-autonomous, state-specific consciousness is formed, retaining and integrating the knowledge and capacities developed. I call this the shamanic persona—a psychedelically generated, state-specific alter ego. There are many variables influencing its integrity, but generally, the better run the session, the more coherent the shamanic persona that emerges.</p>
<p>When one begins to open to deeper levels of transpersonal reality, our earlier psychedelic history must yield to the new territory. Our previous psychedelic knowledge and the identity based on it must surrender control before a deeper mode of knowing can emerge and stabilize. What’s dying in these sessions, then, is sometimes the shamanic persona; its death may feel personal, but it’s not the ego—rather, a deeper individual identity birthed through previous sessions. One shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times; after the transition, the new persona retains the memories of the former and adds to them from this new, deeper level. When an even deeper level opens, the current persona must die and yield again.</p>
<p>Let me add one more layer to the question “What is actually dying?”—I think it’s sometimes a dimension of the cosmos itself. Here I’m thinking especially about deaths at the causal level of reality. What could possibly die at such sublime levels? What need would causal realities have for rebirth? I don’t know the final answers, but I’ll share some intuitions based on years of experience, drawing heavily on Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary-evolutionary cosmology—which resonates deeply with the psychedelic cosmology Stan has described in <em>The Cosmic Game</em>.</p>
<p>Aurobindo’s vision is of a cascading involution of the Divine, generating multiple levels of reality—all divine, but within those levels, a descending scale of self-awareness of divinity, like a series of one-way mirrors: the divine looking down sees all; the divine looking up sees less. At the end of <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, I noted that, in a multilevel cosmology, a death-rebirth event can function as both liberation from below to above, and infusion from above to below. At the threshold, one can feel energy moving in both directions—death-rebirth as ascent and descent.</p>
<p>Suppose we manage to stabilize experience at the low causal level, for a few precious hours in session, becoming a life form that breathes the rarefied air of causal reality, bathing in divine oneness. Then, through further opening, a doorway to deeper levels of causal reality may open, allowing cosmic communion—deep communing with deep. Even a few hours of conscious communion between different levels of transpersonal reality seems to nourish existence itself, as below remembers above and blessings pour downward. This is a cosmic dance—a meeting between deep levels of the Divine, God communing with God.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
So what dies and is reborn at these deeper cycles of death and rebirth—beyond the ego, beyond the species ego, beyond a series of shamanic personas? I think what dies and is reborn is something of truly cosmic proportions. Some dimension God is calling, some dimension that is extraordinarily vast, surrenders, and in that surrendering awakens more completely to itself. Much to our surprise, the divine appears to genuinely appreciate our help in facilitating this communion. Stan, thank you from the bottom of my heart—thank you.</p>

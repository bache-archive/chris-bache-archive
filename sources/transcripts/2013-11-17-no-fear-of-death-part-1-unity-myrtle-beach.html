<p>Okay, welcome, everyone. For those who don’t know me, I'm Margaret Hiller, the spiritual leader here at Unity Christ Church. We’re so grateful to have Dr. Chris Bache back with us today. Chris is a professor with over 30 years of experience in luminous studies and is a former Director of Education at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. He has authored several books and brings a wealth of knowledge to our community. Thank you for being here again, Chris.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Good morning, everyone. It's nice to be back with you.</p>
<p>**Margaret Hiller: ** So, do we need a microphone? </p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Good question! Can everyone hear me? Don’t be shy about it.</p>
<p>**Margaret Hiller: ** I can get the mic if that helps.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I’d love to talk about the topics we’re discussing today. I have a lot of information to share, but the most crucial aspect is to spark your interest in reading some books. Some of you may have read them; others might be new discoveries. The richness comes from diving into the material firsthand. I’ll be summarizing some concepts, but I won’t take you to the depth of individual experiences, which is where the true richness lies.</p>
<p>I teach at a state university in Ohio, where the prevalent worldview is secular humanism—essentially material reductionism. The belief is that the physical world is the only reality, and any speculation beyond that is dismissed. Even in more progressive settings, I notice students frequently arrive with the mindset that we cannot know what happens after death. They may theorize, but ultimately, there is a deep-seated belief that it exceeds our understanding. Up until about 30 years ago, this might have been accurate in Western culture—but not anymore.</p>
<p>Today, we witness the emergence of new disciplines gathering momentum. This convergence of data is changing how we consider life, death, and what happens between. We’re beginning to gain valuable insights into the larger cycle of life—what happens when we die, what precedes our birth, and the entire pattern of life itself. This conversation is an introduction to four research areas that, once explored, can help alleviate any residual fear of death.</p>
<p>The first area is reincarnation research, which I’ve discussed here before. </p>
<p>**Margaret Hiller: ** Hold it up; let’s make sure everyone can see.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Sure! The second area is near-death experiences—exploring what it’s like to die from the inside, rather than just the physical perspective. If reincarnation holds true, there’s a revolving door: birth is the entrance, death is the exit. It’s about understanding the experience of dying from a more profound angle.</p>
<p>The third area involves life-between-life therapy, a specialization within past-life therapy that provides specific insights into the social world we enter after death. We’ll see how Michael Newton’s work in life-between-life therapy aligns with mystical traditions like Tibetan Buddhism and the Tibetan Book of the Dead.</p>
<p>Lastly, we delve into psychedelic research. Although it was deemed illegal in 1969, it has a history of over 1500 years among various indigenous cultures. Today, a new generation of scholars is reigniting this field, providing additional pieces to this puzzle. Each of these areas contributes vital insights into the cycle of life, and I hope to share recommendations for 12 books across these topics, focusing on three key texts from each category.</p>
<p>We’ll go until about 11: 15, take a quick 10-minute break, then reconvene until around for lunch. I get excited and may lose track of time, so please raise your hand if I do. Feel free to interrupt with questions anytime; that’s when the conversation gets rich.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with reincarnation research. I want to recommend a couple of books outside of the three key texts I’ll mention.</p>
<p>**Margaret Hiller: ** I understand you have a book list for us as a handout?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, I want to make your life easier! All the books I mention today will be on that list. The first recommendation is by Ian Stevenson, who recently passed away. He was a meticulous researcher from the University of Virginia, focusing on children aged two to three years old who exhibit spontaneous memories of past lives. He documented hundreds of cases through careful verification, ruling out possible natural explanations. </p>
<p>Stevenson’s work is extraordinarily significant. He’s the Charles Darwin of reincarnation theory, just as Darwin provided empirical insights into evolution. Stevenson offered tangible evidence for understanding reincarnation. </p>
<p>**Audience Member: ** How did he get started with this research?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Stevenson was a traditional academic in medical school, initially writing standard personality textbooks. When he encountered these intriguing cases of past life memories, he decided to pursue this fascinating subject, putting his reputation on the line. His dedication to this research took him internationally, allowing him to collect extensive data.</p>
<p>**Audience Member: ** There was another psychiatrist who recently discussed how he treated someone whose past life memories emerged—he was on Oprah. I think his name is Brian Weiss?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, Brian Weiss is a notable therapist in past-life therapy, but Ian Stevenson focused purely on research—he did not conduct therapy and preferred working with spontaneous memories, avoiding hypnosis as a source of data.</p>
<p>In contrast, Winifred Lucas, another significant figure in this field, dedicated her career to standardizing past-life therapy, producing influential works that have shaped the discipline. Both Stevenson and Lucas expanded the conversation surrounding reincarnation into a broader landscape.</p>
<p>When individuals recall their past lives, we must consider why some people remember and others do not. Stevenson hypothesizes that approximately 60% of his documented cases involve children whose previous lives ended violently. This creates a compelling connection to finish unfinished business, resulting in more rapid reincarnation cycles.</p>
<p>Fascinatingly, these children tend to reincarnate much faster—averaging two and a half years between lives. In studies involving adults, the cycle is often around a century. </p>
<p>**Audience Member: ** Are you planning to discuss channeling as well?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** I hadn’t intended to cover that today, as it introduces a different set of theoretical considerations.</p>
<p>**Audience Member: ** I’ve just started reading your work, and I find children’s past life memories particularly compelling because they seem more credible given their lack of outside influence. Is that where your research focus lies?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Exactly. Stevenson’s work prioritizes children due to the controlled circumstances around their memories, which are tough to explain through regular means. Adults, in contrast, often recall memories through techniques like hypnosis, which can muddy the waters of data interpretation.</p>
<p>Every aspect of our lives is steeped in historical context; our likings and talents reflect paths we've walked in past experiences. As we engage with this material, we might unlock thoughts and memories we've always carried within us, just waiting to be recognized.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Karma has a bad reputation when it's placed within Puritan cultures where a vengeful God lurks in the background. Yet, karma, in essence, is neutral—it simply refers to that which causes. It's a volitional act, a chosen act, generating cause and effect. If you were thrown off a horse and developed a phobia of horses in the next lifetime, that’s cause and effect; it's not punishment. Similarly, if you cheated someone in business and find yourself cheated in a subsequent life, that's karma too. While it has moral implications, the broader understanding is that karma is simply neutral cause and effect. </p>
<p>We've tended to interpret karma strictly as punishment, but my view is that the universe is primarily interested in growth. If you fail a student on a test, you aren't punishing them; you’re merely providing feedback. Anything not learned one lifetime will have opportunities to be learned in subsequent lives. </p>
<p>We also often think of reincarnation linearly—life A leads to life B, and so forth. However, it’s not that straightforward. Life is like a deck of cards; you might have countless lifetimes, but in one life, only a handful of those are truly relevant. Other lifetimes serve as a backdrop, quietly influential in shaping your current challenges. </p>
<p>The common notion that reincarnation offers a chance to "get it right" is too limiting. The universe is concerned with much larger cycles, collaborating on the development of soul giants over billions of years, fostering genius and potential within the human form. It's an ongoing journey of growth rather than simply a quest for correction.</p>
<p>**Margaret Hiller: ** I love the phrase you used during your last visit—reincarnation is the universe’s way of rolling forward information and intelligence. Am I right in recalling that?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Absolutely! The universe operates like an ecology; it wastes nothing. Everything we learn is integrated into future learning. Evolution expresses itself by creating new species and advancing individual consciousness over time. It’s about folding forward our collective learnings, moving us toward new manifestations. Nature is always recycling, incorporating our experiences and wisdom.</p>
<p>**Audience Member 3: ** I've been intrigued by empirical knowledge versus intuitive knowing. Given many are seeking a higher level of consciousness and spiritual development, where does intuitive knowledge fit in—those gut feelings that go beyond what we find in books?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** That’s one of the many qualities we’re developing. Consciousness looks outward and inward. While some focus on external knowledge, others learn to trust their inner voice. Creative artists, intuitive scientists, capable parents—all these roles involve tuning into the inner dialogue arising from one’s circumstances. Our culture leans heavily towards external verification at the moment, but cultivating that inner intuition is critically important. </p>
<p>To illustrate, I’d like to mention the work of Carl Bohm and Anne Marie. Bohm’s first book addresses experiences from a mother whose child had nightmares stemming from past life traumas. Initially skeptical about reincarnation, she was compelled to explore it further to help her child. Through her journey, she uncovered unresolved issues from previous lives that affected her child's present, ultimately finding effective methods to facilitate healing. </p>
<p>Anne Marie’s subsequent work extends this exploration, documenting various cases and insights she's gathered. Her approach is compassionate, and she advises parents to listen and support children with spontaneous memories, assuring them that these experiences are not harmful but part of a self-regulating system.</p>
<p>Additionally, my own book, <em>Life Cycles</em>, published nearly 25 years ago, draws upon Dr. Stevenson’s compelling cases, presenting them in a more accessible way. I argue that overwhelming empirical evidence supports the reality of reincarnation and explore its implications for our lives and identities. </p>
<p>One significant section addresses reincarnation's place within Christianity. Many of my students come from Christian backgrounds and faced cognitive dissonance when they encountered Stevenson's ideas, which are often rejected by their faith. I propose a dialogue on how Christianity might incorporate reincarnation without compromising its principles, given that early communities mused on it. </p>
<p>So, why did Christianity shy away from reincarnation? Gettys McGregor, a Scottish theologian, suggests it was for political reasons, particularly in a time of turmoil within the Roman Empire. Centralized authority became paramount to the church's survival; the belief in reincarnation and karma undermined that authority by suggesting individual accountability for one's journey, independent of clerical oversight.</p>
<p>Today, we find ourselves in a global systems crisis, and it's clear we can't continue as we have. This awareness may be pushing us toward a deeper sense of identity and compassion. </p>
<p>**Audience Member 3: ** That evokes the idea of our perception. Although we forget our past lives, do we carry over a sort of perception—that instinctive understanding from previous experiences? </p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Yes, absolutely. While we may not recall the details of past lives, insights, aptitudes, and affinities certainly carry over. As we reincarnate, the overall consciousness we embody will evolve. Moving forward, I believe that forgetfulness may lessen. Future incarnations might not entail the same amnesia, leading to a clearer, more integrated soul awareness. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal isn't merely to escape but to fully awaken here, integrating our profound heritage into our present so we can create a more compassionate and unified world. </p>
<p>**Margaret Hiller: ** It resembles Thomas à Kempis' idea—that if one knew all, one would forgive all.</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** Precisely! Full awareness leads to forgiveness, a powerful truth that transforms our interactions and experiences. </p>
<p>**Audience Member 2: ** But what happens if we remember everything? Wouldn't that limit our unique experiences?</p>
<p>**Chris Bache: ** That’s an insightful question. If forgetting serves a greater design for growth and learning, then if we no longer need to forget, the rules of the game would change entirely. We’d engage in a different system with new dynamics. The evolution we’re undergoing suggests that by fully awakening to a deeper connection, the human experience could become drastically enriched, fostering a transformed society grounded in collective consciousness.</p>
<p>In that transformation lies the potential for humanity to flourish, akin to enlightened beings, radically reshaping our world for the better. This notion of the “diamond soul” reflects the identity we’ve been cultivating throughout countless lifetimes, aspiring toward greater oneness and compassion in our shared existence.</p>
<p>Chris Bache reflected on the complexities of emotions like anger and frustration. "He'll find his way to it. Sometimes it's very useful, I mean, I value deep, introspective work. So, sometimes it's valuable to trace emotions back to their source, to really explore the history behind that anger. Sometimes, even if it's a true and accurate perception of the world, there can be deeper causes tied to our personal histories. When we uncover and address these causes, we don’t have to let go of the truth; we can let go of the anger. There are many paths into this."</p>
<p>The interviewer chimed in, suggesting, "That couldn't not just be anger, but an elective frustration at what is and what can be. There’s a sense that more people don’t get it, or that we’re not making enough progress in that direction."</p>
<p>Chris nodded in agreement. "My students are angry. They’re trying to navigate their place in the world, but they see it's not working, and it feels like things are getting worse. The sea levels are rising, jobs are disappearing. They're angry. But how do you channel that perception in a way that doesn’t consume you?"</p>
<p>He then proposed a break, stating, "Shall we call it for the first segment and take 10 minutes? We'll be back at 11: 30."</p>
<p>As the discussion transitioned, Margaret Hiller inquired, "Oh, yeah, what happened? What time did you get here?"</p>
<p>Another participant noted, "I had to do an interview. I have three articles due today for Natural Week."</p>
<p>The audience member responded, "You okay? I told Mary to be a little late."</p>
<p>Another voice acknowledged, "Looks like they're recording it. Yeah, it'll be nice to have an audio of it."</p>
<p>As people began to move around, there were several casual exchanges: "Good to see you," and expressions of light embarrassment about the recording situation, reflecting an atmosphere of camaraderie despite the serious topics at hand.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In this wide-ranging conversation hosted by Embercombe’s <em>Contemporary Animism</em> series, philosopher and</p>
<p>psychedelic researcher <strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong> discusses his 20-year program of 73 high-dose LSD sessions</p>
<p>documented in <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe</em>. Interviewers <strong>RACHEL</strong> and <strong>COLIN</strong> explore Bache’s</p>
<p>methodology, his concept of “diamond souls,” and the collective evolutionary crisis he calls the “dark</p>
<p>night of the species soul.” Bache explains how systematic, high-dose work accelerates purification,</p>
<p>opens access to transpersonal realms, and reveals an overarching intelligence guiding human</p>
<p>transformation. The dialogue touches on reincarnation, time, ecological activism, parenting, ritual</p>
<p>practice, and the role individual awakening plays in tipping collective consciousness toward a more</p>
<p>compassionate future. A Q&amp;A with participants probes practical implications, the nature of time, and</p>
<p>ways to live one’s prophetic insights in daily life.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> Welcome, everyone. It’s a beautiful evening here in Devon. Tonight we share an interview</p>
<p>with <strong>CHRIS BACHE</strong>, recorded for our <em>Contemporary Animism</em> program. Chris offers hope at a</p>
<p>moment when our species faces a collective dark night.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> The talk lasts about 50 minutes. Watch as you wish, then stay for discussion.</p>
<p>Chris is Professor Emeritus of philosophy and religion, author of <em>Lifecycles</em>, *Dark Night, Early</p>
<p>Dawn<em>, and </em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe<em>, which outlines his research method. </em><em>COLIN</em>* will</p>
<p>introduce him.</p>
<p><strong>COLIN:</strong> Good evening. A year ago I found <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em> and was struck by its subtitle,</p>
<p>“Steps Toward a Deep Ecology of Mind.” We need a radical, experiential renewal of our relationship</p>
<p>with life. Chris’s work—building on Stan Grof—embodies that radical courage.</p>

<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> In animistic terms, nature is infused with consciousness. How large is that mind?</p>
<p>In 1978, fresh from graduate work in philosophy of religion, I encountered Stanislav Grof’s *Realms of</p>
<p>the Human Unconscious*. My life pivoted. Grof offered a safe, systematic way to explore deep</p>
<p>consciousness—where answers to our philosophical questions reside.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Starting in 1979 I embarked on a 20-year journey with high-dose LSD—73 sessions</p>
<p>following Grofian protocol: eyeshades, music, sitter, complete internal focus. High doses expanded</p>
<p>not only depth but breadth of consciousness, opening dialogue with an intelligence that dissolved</p>
<p>into deeper infinities whenever pressed for form.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> Would anyone using your method reach similar unfoldings?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes and no. Psychedelics amplify consciousness; they don’t dictate content. Early</p>
<p>sessions mirror personal history. Persist past ego-death and individual stories converge into shared</p>
<p>spiritual terrain. Experience is participatory: our seed-mind catalyzes facets of the infinite, then</p>
<p>evolves and catalyzes again.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> Your approach feels like a fast track.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Fast, but no bypassing. Purification that contemplatives stretch over years can</p>
<p>unfold in days—convulsions, vomiting, lifestyle overhaul. These immersions are temporary; abiding</p>
<p>integration requires daily practice. Crucially, the trajectory is not “up-and-out” but transcendence</p>
<p>in service of incarnation: letting more of the universe live through the historical body.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Halfway through, my personal-model shattered. I was drawn into collective</p>
<p>transformation. Former lives fused, igniting a diamond luminosity—an evolutionary template for the</p>
<p>human family. Reincarnation is the higher octave of evolution, generating “diamond souls” capable of</p>
<p>embodying centuries of wisdom, communing with nature, and downloading cosmic intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>COLIN:</strong> Time puzzles me. If linearity dissolves, what of reincarnation?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Drop the arrow and you get multi-incarnation. I’ve tasted modalities where a hundred</p>
<p>thousand years pass in a minute, or where one may incarnate in any century. Yet within spacetime,</p>
<p>linear sequences serve learning. The universe hosts many temporal logics; we navigate several at</p>
<p>once.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> What other qualities mark the diamond soul?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Complete healing of historical wounds, expansive compassion, sensory acuity orders</p>
<p>of magnitude beyond normal vision, and an effortless openness to divine genius. Earth becomes</p>
<p>heaven-in-body. But birth demands the death of egoic culture—our collective dark night. Each of us</p>
<p>carries a piece of the labor.</p>
<p><strong>CAROL:</strong> Should we relax and trust, or strive for specific practice?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Each person’s life is a seed chosen before birth. Courageously living what is within</p>
<p>reach is the practice; it seeds the morphic field for all.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA:</strong> Many haven’t tasted these openings. Does the collective shift really exist?</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS BACHE:</strong> Yes. Individual awakenings feed the web invisibly, just as ancestors nourished us.</p>
<p>When enough seeds sprout, uncommon sense becomes common.</p>
<p><strong>TERESA:</strong> You replace Eastern transcendence with Western evolution. Could time-layers coexist</p>
<p>without goal?</p>
<p><strong>COLIN:</strong> Our task is to rest where we are while plumbing ancestral cognition. Time may spiral,</p>
<p>yet we translate insights into present action.</p>
<p><strong>RACHEL:</strong> We’ve only scratched the surface, but must close. Chris returns later in the program for</p>
<p>deeper exploration. Thank you all for staying the course.</p>

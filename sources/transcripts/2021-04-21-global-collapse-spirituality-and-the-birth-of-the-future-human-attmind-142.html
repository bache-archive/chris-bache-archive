<p>James Jesso: 
Hello everyone. Welcome to Adventures Through the Mind. I'm your host, as always, James W. Jesso. This podcast explores topics relevant and related to psychedelic culture, medicine, and research.</p>
<p>I’m going to start this one off with a question: Have you ever wondered what 76 high-dose LSD sessions over the course of 20 years might teach a person about how to make spiritual sense of a global crisis—and perhaps the collapse of civilization as we know it? If you have, you’re in luck, because that’s exactly what we’re going to talk about.</p>
<p>We’re speaking with Christopher Bache, author of LSD and the Mind of the Universe. Christopher M. Bache is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years; a Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences; adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies; and on the advisory board for Grof Transpersonal Training and the Grof Foundation. He’s an award-winning teacher and international speaker, the author of three books, and he’s been on the show previously—Episode 89, Mapping Consciousness with High Dose LSD—where we talked about his 73 high-dose LSD journeys over 20 years and what he learned about the nature of reality and the universe.</p>
<p>This conversation is a follow-up. It was intended to be a discussion of various themes in the book, but it quickly focused on one particular aspect: while Chris was having experiences of deep time—like experiencing the entire course of human existence as a singular moment—he had a vision of what he called the birth of the future human, emerging out of extreme cataclysm: a long phase of strife, grief, suffering, and challenges that push humanity into its next phase of evolution. Chris considers where we are now to be the start of that.</p>
<p>This interview was recorded in September of 2020. I’ll be honest: it took me a long time to release because I was going through a difficult period, and at some point it became less of an interview and more of a young man pleading to an older man for wisdom to make sense of crisis—personally and existentially. I may have felt embarrassed about that. Either way, now is the time. Some topics may resonate with recent controversies in the 5-MeO-DMT world, but none of this is a response to that—this was recorded months before. Chris’s sound isn’t always great—some banging and knocking in the background—but we did our best to clean it up. Bear with it.</p>

<p>Okay, that’s it for the intro. Stay tuned to the end for a special announcement. Here we go—my second interview with Christopher Bache on Adventures Through the Mind. Enjoy.</p>
<p>So, Chris, I’d been going through an extensive amount of notes. I listened to our first podcast again, went back through notes from your workshop in Vancouver, and revisited the book. I kept wondering, what’s the course here? In our first interview, I’d listened to your talks and followed how you structure your lectures, and used that as a path to walk. I didn’t have that this time. If you’re okay with it, I thought it might be interesting if I pull some passages from your book—things that moved me or felt relevant—read them, and then ask you to speak to them. Would that feel good for you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Sure, that’s fine—great. I’ll tell you, too: once the book came out and we did the first round of interviews, COVID hit, and I stepped back to digest people’s first reactions. I just sent an article to Synergetic Press and to the UK network CyMail—basically a postscript to LSD and the Mind of the Universe—responding to people’s initial takes. In that process, I’m finding another tier of implications. It’s nothing “new,” but the sheer audacity of the claims—about the limits and revised limits of human experience, what we’re capable of, and the import of entering deep intimacy with the consciousness of the universe—is sinking in at a new level. I’m glad to be doing this second bite at the apple. There’ve been a lot of first interviews; this can be something different. I’m happy to see where we go.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Cool. Is that something you feel like getting into right away, or should I use passages from the book as reference points—even for the “second tier” of your considerations?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Let’s do it. I trust it’ll come up where it’s relevant. It’s not a specific set of themes so much as—</p>
<p>Partly it’s the enormity of the vision of history involved, and it seems like we’re getting into that period faster than I thought. And partly it’s the sheer scale of the undertaking. But it’ll surface naturally. I trust our discussion.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
I think it’s here already. This came up for me near the end of the book. I read it during the 2020 lockdown—immersing myself while isolated, with all the existential gravity of the moment. You describe a kind of “rock tumbler” and the future human emerging out of deep strife, struggle, and pain—an analogy to the cleansing process of your psychedelic explorations. As I was reading, I thought, I’d be foolish to think we’re already there despite how bad this is. This is ultimately just a virus. How do you feel about it?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think of it as an overture. It contains some of the key elements of the symphony that’s coming, but only in abbreviated forms. It’s mobilizing us. What’s coming is going to be much worse. If we learn from this—disorienting as it’s been—it will teach us things that help with what comes next. But you’re right: this is act one—just an overture.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
“Stress test” is how I heard it described early on. Of course, it’s evolved beyond the pandemic: the dissolution of what was once thought of as objective reality through multi-level narrative warfare; the collapse of coherent dialogue via social media; populism and nationalism; and also the pushback—Black Lives Matter and more. And still, this isn’t as bad as it could get—or may get.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think you’re right. In fact, let me mention a book I want on the table: Dwayne Elgin’s Choosing Earth. It’s literally a lifetime of research. He’s a social activist who lays out, decade by decade, what he thinks is coming—tracking scientific data on global planetary health for a long time. He sees a time of increasingly tight collapse over the next several decades. He thinks that by 2050 we’ll be more than halfway into the great collapse. I want to have that in the conversation.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
What comes up for me is the immediate, “What do we do? What do I do?”—the impulse to problem-solve and act now—rather than, “How did we get here? What does this mean?” How do we come to understand what’s happening before deciding on action? From where you sit, what are we learning through all this—and what aren’t we learning?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I have to be careful—I’m not on the front line. I have secondhand information from news accounts. But as I watch people respond, we’re learning the fragility of our systems; our interconnectedness; how systems that seemed to function independently are in fact deeply interdependent. We’re learning a lot about supply chains and where our resources come from. We’re seeing that people who have modest jobs, socioeconomically, have very important jobs in maintaining our collective wellbeing. So: interdependence; how quickly life can be turned upside down; how little stability we actually have.</p>
<p>We’re learning something about the limits of patriarchal ego. I think Trump is the embodiment—hopefully the last gasp—of the patriarchal monarchy. We’re learning how ugly ego can be, and where to go or not go in crisis. The polarization, the resort to violence—how quickly we move to violence. We can take almost any issue, no matter how trivial—like masks—and turn it into a trigger for people killing each other. The mirror we’re looking into is not complimentary. It’s pretty ugly.</p>
<p>In so many ways, ego built our culture. By “ego” I mean a level of development that identifies with the body, with self-awareness that stops close to the fingertips and toes—rationally looking out for one’s own wellbeing and that of people nearby, who look like us or are related to us. Ego is important, even magnificent, but a world built by a species operating out of egoic awareness is a divided world—haves and have-nots. We can’t get more extreme than what we’re seeing. In Dwayne’s book, I came across a statistic that five people own as much of the world’s resources as half of the world. You simply can’t have disparities that large. This illness is blasting that into our faces—who’s suffering the most: the poor and persons of color.</p>
<p>This is warm-up. Maybe the first wave was the 2008 credit crisis—it taught us things and pulled liquidity out of the system. We have fewer financial resources to fight with now. This goes deeper—national debt increases. If not the first round, we’re in a significant second round.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
For listeners who don’t know: this conversation is couched in your 40-year journey as a philosophy professor and a 20-year journey with high-dose LSD. The book we’re referring to is about those journeys. What I’m seeing in the world—mostly mediated by screens—is not a place I want to be. I don’t want to be where it appears we’re going; I don’t want to be part of a system that does what it does. I don’t like being part of something that feels distorted. What I see in people’s behavior—shaped by algorithms and isolation and mental health crises—is a lot of toxic behavior and discussion, draped in self-righteous moralism: good versus evil, where “good is me” and anyone who disagrees is the devil to be cast out.</p>
<p>It makes me want to hide away. Yet couching this in psychedelics—as a large, collective process happening globally, not just with humanity but with the planet—it mirrors psychedelic work. When I see these parts of myself in a session, it’s equally ugly. I want to hide from it, and yet one of the things you talk about is learning not to turn away from pain. Not the pain of a hot stove, but this kind of pain. Can you comment on that?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
The starting point of serious psychedelic work is taking complete responsibility for one’s own shadow. You go into a room, close the door, and it’s just you and your mind. You enter the parts of your being that are initially the most daunting—the most frightening and the ugliest, the parts we least want to acknowledge. But the commitment is to take that on.</p>
<p>When we see ugliness manifested in the world by people who haven’t taken responsibility for themselves—who are still externalizing the shadow—the evil and darkness are always “out there.” That’s a very different world. The breakdown I see coming is going to break down that defense: the assumption that we’re the good guys and the others are the bad guys. Eventually we’ll have to come to terms with the fact that we did this. We created this imbalance. We benefited from it. We continue to generate it—in the cars we drive, the lives we live, the lifestyles we aspire to. There will come a time when there’s nowhere else to look. We’ll have to take individual and collective responsibility for the pain that lives within us and around us. That’s a pivot point.</p>
<p>The psychedelic community understands this because that’s how you make progress: by confronting the shadow. When you go into the work, you learn that the more you purify and cleanse, the deeper the reward—the deeper the ecstasy and the teaching. The more you purify, the deeper the communion. Once you learn that, you not only become more comfortable facing the shadow—you actively embrace it. You embrace pain and suffering not because you like them, but for two reasons. First, because you learn that deeper purification brings deeper ecstasy. You don’t like suffering, but you like what’s on the other side. Second, you embrace pain and suffering, even when a lot of it isn’t yours, out of compassion—the same compassion a parent has for their children, a teacher for their students. You embrace it not counting whether it’s yours or someone else’s, because by doing so you help someone—perhaps someone you’ll never meet.</p>
<p>My experience has been that if you’re willing to take on more than your fair share of suffering, you reap more than your fair share of benefit. The universe responds—it can’t help but respond. I think that will happen generationally. This generation, the next, and the one after will go through more than their share of suffering compared to previous generations. After we stop kicking and screaming and take it on, we will experience the blessings that come from deep generosity—that profound existential choice to work with the given, even when the given is terrible, even when it crushes your personal life. You still dedicate yourself to the good of the whole.</p>
<p>In that process, something changes. The more complete the surrender and commitment to the process, the deeper and faster the transformation—individually and collectively. As we move deeper into this and come through it, we’ll learn what every psychedelic journeyer learns: when we confront the shadow, there are riches on the other side of the ordeal, and there’s no other way to get there. Ironically, you end up where you began—except you’re cleaned out. The gunk is gone. You are still you, in the same place—but living a different life because burdens you didn’t realize were compromising you are no longer there, and something new has taken their place. That’s where we’re going. It will take time.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
A lot comes up for me around the complexity—the different ways people and demographics are meeting this moment; the confusion of what’s “good”; whether “embracing the pain” means being around toxic people or getting involved in toxic spaces. I’m trying to listen from a larger perspective, beyond what’s happening right now. In my demographic and local community, we’re not suffering nearly as much as people in the hardest-hit areas, or those in poverty, or those oppressed by systemic racism or sexism—especially systemic racism, police violence, and the rest. Even then, I’m trying not to fixate on small examples that don’t fit the larger generational narrative. Can you speak to how what you just said applies to the acute as much as the big picture?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
You’re right. In my local community, we’re not suffering badly. I’m retired. I haven’t lost my job. I know where my next meal is coming from. Many people don’t. And if we expand the horizon: hundreds of thousands of ecological migrants, fleeing disastrous circumstances; people whose whole lives fit inside a suitcase. The upheaval isn’t far away, even if it’s not right outside our door.</p>
<p>I live in a strange world in that way. We all watch the news and try to keep abreast of larger patterns. But inwardly, because of the psychedelic work—because I’ve been dissolved, many times over many years, into the collective breath of humanity; because I’ve been drawn into the collective shadow work, the dark night of the collective soul; and beyond the collective psyche, outside the Collective Unconscious into larger patterns of time—deep time, evolutionary time, even geologic time—my insides are tuned a little differently.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, when I see human beings, I don’t see them the way others do. I see souls. I relate to people as incarnations of souls, and I tune to the soul quality of a person. In that respect, you can see young people who are truly old in their hearts and minds, and old people who are like children—everything in between. When I think of the people we see on the streets—the folks riding around with weapons—I see souls in one phase of a long evolutionary journey. I have a sense of the large-scale self-education process, and some stage points along the way. I don’t bring that as a model to judge or rank people. I approach people knowing that their entire current incarnation is a short phase of their larger learning process. I can understand the challenges they’re facing within a larger matrix.</p>
<p>The tricky part is that you can get so absorbed in large perspectives that you lose the immediate suffering—the felt sense of privation right here, right now. You have to live in both worlds at the same time: the immediate and the large-scale. My professional work and psychedelic work have focused me on the large scale.</p>
<p>James Jesso: There’s a lot of inner conflict coming up for me as I’m listening to you. Part of me is like, yes—and another part of me is like, does this smaller frame equate to passivity? If this is all part of a larger process, is me just looking at myself actually doing anything? In the big picture, of course it’s doing something—I’m evolving my soul, and by doing good as best I can I help bring goodness into reality that can engage other people’s realities. So on one level I’m like, yes. On another, is that really enough?</p>
<p>There’s a lot of psychedelic rhetoric like, if we gave more people psilocybin or ayahuasca, we’d stop burning down the rainforest; give enough people psilocybin and we won’t vote in authoritarian leaders. That kind of thinking feels foolish—to assume that if I just do the inner work, it will make the big changes we need. And yet, can I do any good in a social movement if I’m showing up with hatred in my heart, anger, projection, looking for someone to blame? Some people are showing up from that place—though I don’t think movements are inspired by it; they’re an appropriate response to injustice. Another layer is, if I say this wrong, will I be canceled because of that blameful, hateful energy in the culture? These aren’t clear questions. I feel like I’m baring my soul here—help me understand.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I understand. If genuine spirituality leads you away from social engagement, I don’t think it’s very mature. Mature spirituality brings us into the heart of all living things; when we contact that heart, we naturally want to help. The natural progression of deep spiritual work, when it succeeds, is social engagement in some form—whatever we’re particularly called to. Medicine, tech, international dialogue—many paths. The important thing is finding our niche, our contribution, and doing it.</p>
<p>And you’re right: when we do it, we’ll probably discover we aren’t as clean as we thought. Then we step back, clean up, and go again. I feel the tension; I’d feel it even more if I were a young man like you. I’m in my seventies. I’ve made my choices. I’m mostly past the active front lines, except as a teacher—I write, I teach, I talk. Others my age are still out there getting the vote out, working tangibly to bring about a better world.</p>
<p>There are no standardized rules for engagement, but we can feel a center line when we’re aligned with our place in the world and the movement—a balance between inner and outer, sheltered and exposed. We’re self-correcting beings. What matters most isn’t rules, but tuning into that point in our center—our connection to the larger intelligence—that keeps drawing us into deeper engagement with itself, and therefore with the fabric of humanity and nonhuman life. A million species are going extinct as we sit here.</p>
<p>James Jesso: I’ve been sitting with your book. The first tab I put in was about one of the greatest risks of psychedelic work: ego inflation. I’m curious, looking at the psychedelic community as a microcosm and then the larger stage—the big characters in media and culture—how you see that. And maybe how it maps onto this collective journey we’re on as a planetary organism facing increasing collapse and crisis.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I’m essentially a hermit. I’m in the psychedelic world because I think and write about it, but I don’t have a lot of living contact with the community. You go to a conference, teach a workshop here and there—your actual circle is small. I pay attention to important books more than the latest articles, and I can’t generalize about “the community.”</p>
<p>In some ways we’re entering a psychedelic period of history. It may start at low dose, but we’re headed toward high dose. In low-dose work, you may engage ego dissolution voluntarily. In high-dose work, you will be engaged whether you volunteer or not—you’ll be put through the meat grinder. Right now we may choose which pain to take on; soon choices will be made for us. We’ll be surrounded by the catastrophic consequences of policies set in motion for decades and centuries. It’s like a hurricane offshore—everyone will be affected. No pick-and-choose.</p>
<p>The great danger of psychedelic work is psychic inflation: we have a deep experience and think we’ve become a deep person; we have a great experience and think we are a great being. That’s a fool’s delusion. If you go in with that attitude, your sessions tend to knock your feet out from under you. It becomes much more basic. To me it’s not about having ecstatic experiences; it’s about doing whatever is necessary so that 48 hours after your session, you’re living a better life than before. You either take a vacation to Italy, or you carry out the garbage. Carrying out the garbage is what gives you a better life two days later. If you do that, you’ll see extraordinary things on the other side.</p>
<p>Why become more conscious if it means taking more responsibility for the garbage in you and around you? For some, psychedelics are about accessing joy—fine. But when joy and insight come through hard work, they don’t inflate you as much, because you know the price you paid. You understand the deeper process and the intelligence that’s teaching you, step by step. Blessings aren’t given lightly; they’re given intentionally. If your work is disciplined and part of a spiritual practice, everything you’re given lays the foundation for future work and gifts. Over years, as you feel that maturational rhythm, the inflation bullshit fades—it’s just ego dancing, and ego is the obstacle.</p>
<p>James Jesso: We’ve danced from global crises to a larger cosmology—this painful churning that might polish us into what you call the future human—and now into direct psychedelic work. Maybe this is trite because it’s so general, but given where we are, from the perspective of your deep work, what does it mean to be a good person right now? What does it take?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It’s a large question. Half a dozen answers pop up and all of them are wrong, so I sift.</p>
<p>In some of my deepest experiences—sometimes even after a session—something falls away. I experience the world as living and breathing as one. My feet feel rooted in the earth like a tree. I look at the grass and feel complete continuity of being with everything around me. We’re breathing the same air, sharing the same moment across species. I feel the pulse of the universe in its utter simplicity, not paying attention to our divisions—species, moods, incarnations. The universe is being itself, and I am part of that—not even communion, which implies duality, but a transparency of being.</p>
<p>From there, my mind opens with a delicious sense of presence—an intimacy with grass. Then my heart opens, and the idea of harming anyone is the farthest thing from my mind; helping everyone is the most natural thing in the world. It’s not “being good.” It’s being alive within oneness. Goodness becomes a compass needle pointing to that truth. Compassion, fairness, justice—they’re aspects, fractal manifestations, of oneness.</p>
<p>So what does it take to be a good person today? A willingness, a commitment, to serve the collective good—beyond the private self—open to future generations, to people and species unlike me. An honest confrontation with what is, to bring about a better life for other beings. It’s simple at its core and gets complicated in the enactment. If it’s not coming from a deep grounding in oneness, maybe there’s something not to trust. Deep goodness comes out of oneness. I don’t know if that addresses the depth of your question; the deepest answer I have is a mystical one in which goodness is a spontaneous arising.</p>
<p>James Jesso: I’ve got a more serious response and a more joking one. The joke is: so we should all take 500 mics of LSD, right? The serious one is about the dance of enactment. I’ve had that experience, and honestly, anywhere from 10% to 99% of the time, I’m not there at all. I’m not grounded in it as I show up in the world. Having a deep experience doesn’t make you a deep person. Touching oneness once doesn’t mean oneness streams from your fingertips thereafter. So what does it look like to have had that experience? Maybe this is about integration—what does it mean to remember, and how do we catch ourselves forgetting?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: We go up the mountain, we see some things, we may be given blessings. Then we come down and have to go to work on Monday morning—over and over again. It’s a matter of constantly engaging, being aware of how you’re engaging, checking yourself, recommitting to doing better, again and again.</p>
<p>For me, much of it played out as a teacher—always loving it, always wanting to do it better, constantly catching myself making assumptions, false inferences, being tired, letting students down one day, coming back to do better the next day, the next week, the next semester. Trying to live up to truths we know.</p>
<p>I’m glad the psychedelic community is paying attention to integration; it’s critical. The term carries us some distance, but it’s hard to live our visions. It commits you to constant awareness of how poorly you may be living them. That’s the nature of the beast. If we live around really good people—those with a deeper instinct for kindness and generosity—it’s easier to face our shortcomings, because we have a measuring stick. That’s why, in Buddhism, spiritual friends and Sangha are pillars of progress.</p>
<p>We don’t walk around in the oneness state, but we practice. Ten years later, we might be in it a little more. And if we ever think we’re really there, ask our young children—our kids will set us straight.</p>
<p>James Jesso: Or as Ram Dass said, if you think you’re spiritually awake, go spend a week with your parents. Maybe it’s the other way around.</p>
<p>As you were speaking, a question formed. It goes back to what you said: if your spiritual practice means not engaging the world, it’s probably not very mature. I agree. So there’s a balance—spiritual friends, but not isolating in only that circle; engaging and being in the world. Right now, so much is mediated by screens and social media. Every interaction is tinged—Is that person a loaded COVID gun? We’re not coming together much. There’s a lot of toxic interaction, charged emotion, embodied tension. We’re exposed to how bad things are, with less of the beauty coming through.</p>
<p>So “being in the world,” whether screen-mediated or not, is happening in this landscape of contortion, where we’re generally not operating from oneness. If we don’t isolate with our spiritual friends—serving only that small circle—and we’re out there trying to be a person of goodness and oneness but encountering toxicity, closed-mindedness, shunning, canceling… how does a person walk this? What does that walk look like?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It’s a good question. It will look different for you than for me, and different for different people and circumstances.</p>
<p>Decades ago, my life was my students. However deep my weekends were, at ten o’clock Monday I was in class at an open-enrollment university in a burned-out steel town—first-generation college students, few opportunities. Front-line education. It was hard work, and we worked hard together. I had to be on my game, engaging their assumptions and biases in religious studies. I used to tease friends who taught three graduate seminars a year while I taught nine quarter courses plus summers. Different worlds.</p>
<p>If you’d asked me then, my hermit side was balanced by my slice of responsibility—helping young people deepen their understanding of the world and themselves. Now I’m in a different time. I’m retired from that world. I buffer myself from a lot of screen time. It’s toxic and confused. Immersing myself in it doesn’t help me maintain the clarity I’m responsible for, so that when I do engage, I can be useful from the space I most appreciate.</p>
<p>I don’t have to engage as much as you do, or as those working nine-to-five on the COVID front lines, riding buses and trains, making decisions about what to say, where to sit, how to breathe. The principle is the same. Mother Teresa worked with the poorest of the poor, dragging people off the streets of Calcutta so they could die with dignity. We engage the world as it is, as we are, in our circumstances. Right now that includes a pandemic and the political polarization it generates. People grab that world from many different places; generalities are hard.</p>
<p>I come back to inner integrity—whether we’re on or off course with ourselves, aligned or out of kilter with our deep being. Even in isolation, I can feel whether I’m living in a way that puts me in position to be of maximum benefit when I give a talk in two weeks. That tuning doesn’t happen on the day; it happens with your life, in tune with your deepest aspirations and truths, so that when called upon you have something that’s yours to give. That tuning happens whether you’re in the subway or at home—it’s just harder in the subway.</p>
<p>James Jesso: What’s coming up for me is how that looks different for different people—and how it looks to me from where I’m coming from, based on where they’re coming from. There are people who feel they’re doing exactly that, and what they’re doing is taking their guns out for walks and screaming at people for wearing masks. Or they think they’re doing that, but they’re propagating neo-Nazi white supremacy. Or they’re doing something emotionally violent and toxic—canceling anyone who disagrees—feeling reinforced in the righteousness of their beliefs by online echo chambers, bonding by bullying someone with a different opinion.</p>
<p>They feel like they’re doing the good thing too. I want to say that me not doing those things is me doing the good thing, and that what they’re doing is not. But am I invisibly making myself a fool to think I understand what goodness is, and that my goodness is more good than their good? Is it all good? Is what they’re doing somehow “good” because goodness exists at a larger scale than our immediate sociopolitical frame, beyond the second- and third-order consequences we can see, into seven generations? If all of this is good, then what does it matter what I do?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Once again, you're pushing into deep territory. In the highest levels of Tibetan Buddhism, in Dzogchen, goodness gets radically qualified. If you're truly aligned with the absolute essence of all things, you're in a different category relative to good and not good. But until you're living in that absolute condition, best to do good, because that's the closest approximation we have to it.</p>
<p>From that perspective, one could profoundly relativize good, and I understand that. My own orientation doesn't go in the direction of “it's all good.” We may think we're doing good, but I'm not willing to say all that we do is good. Injuring other people—physically or psychologically—is a marker of not good. That's a line to draw. Oneness is all-embracing, and the first rule that comes out of that is non-injury.</p>
<p>The people doing the things you describe have been doing them a long time; now it's more public. Where it used to be private and surreptitious, now they’ve been given permission, with social reinforcement and platforms that create echo chambers. But the fact that people are self-selecting and reinforcing different patterns doesn't mean there aren't still choices for goodness to be made. It doesn't eliminate goodness as a reasonable, rational, and spiritually rich criterion for looking at our behavior. Lynching, even if believed to be good, is not good—and a lot of people who did it believed they were doing good.</p>
<p>When we wake up—by whatever means: a passage of scripture, an ayahuasca session—genuine waking up produces gentler people. It produces kinder, more compassionate people. It doesn't produce homophobic people or people inflicting violence on others. Now, that doesn't mean we don't fight for justice or confront injustice with the force required, but the core balance has a gentle, compassionate component.</p>
<p>So the question becomes: how do you confront the not good, knowing people believe they're doing good, in a way that doesn't perpetuate evil or encourage more division? That's very difficult and can only be done person by person, circumstance by circumstance. If I step back and try to generalize, I'm just blowing smoke. It has to be decided by people living in the specifics: whether to protest, counterprotest, how to address violence in the street, and so forth.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Do you think the almost ubiquitous rise of what are often called bad-faith arguments—and the near total destruction of discourse, where conflict is received and responded to as a form of abuse—changes the role of open conversation? What role do you see conversation and open discourse between various expressions of self-perceived good playing in our evolutionary process as humans? And how do you balance that with the understandable limitation of not wanting to give voice or space to hateful, racist, or violent people? What's the balance there in the course of doing good and trying to bring about goodness?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
That’s a huge question, and I have a limited framework from which to respond. My background is academic—in the history of religious and philosophical thought—in a discipline that prizes engagement and discussion, prizes collaboration and conflict as a vehicle for determining greater truth. I've gone through multiple revolutions in my own thinking. The hardest pivot is the first one, when you let go of feeling grounded in reality and realize that what you took as reality is a model of reality. The second, third, and fourth pivots get easier because you realize you're living within a matrix, a paradigm of assumptions.</p>
<p>I went from a conventional Christian to a non-Christian, became deeply informed by a scientific worldview, then challenged some core axioms of reductive materialism through psychedelic work. I've dialogued with students and colleagues for years—disagreeing and still being friends—and allowed students to voice opinions I find abhorrent because it's essential if there's going to be a chance they see the world a little differently. But that's within a frame that sets rules for give-and-take and its limits.</p>
<p>What’s happening today is a very different world than the sheltered one inside a university. As you say, standards are dissolving. Radicalization says everyone has a right to their position and every position is equally valuable. In the end it comes down to might makes right, or the vote of the majority, however coerced or contrived. We’re in a time of paradigm change: certainties are becoming uncertainties; constants are dissolving. Science changed so much—and then changed itself—when it began to point to 96% of reality being invisible dark matter and dark energy. How do we live in a universe like that? All the religions have come together in one valley, and just meeting each other has forced a radical reassessment of truth claims. For anyone paying attention, it opens deep uncertainty: maybe we really don't know what God wants, or what truth is. Maybe we have to look not only in our sacred scriptures but in others’ to approximate something more adequate.</p>
<p>So much is missing right now—self-awareness of our paradigm's limitations, our cultural embeddedness. We're acting it out in a falling apart of values. We can't even count on nature to be what it was: weather, rain, heat patterns are different. Immigration patterns are different. Racial balances are different. People are scared and unstable; they're grabbing and trying to hold on. From one perspective, you can say, good luck with that—it’s going to keep falling apart, keep getting worse. If you're not able to deal with that, you'll suffer enormously. If you keep trying to hold on to old values, you'll suffer terribly and cause suffering that comes back on you. Truth has been a casualty of this process—a felt sense of truth.</p>
<p>But we'll get through it. We have no other choice. We live in a pluralistic society—sexually pluralistic, in a culture of multiple truths, in a world of expanding horizons over and over again. It's uncomfortable, but if we're not good at it now, we better get good at it in the next generation or two, because this isn't going to change. We're not going back to the tried and comfortable world of the past. We’re going into new and uncertain territory, together. We have to grow up.</p>
<p>We have to stop acting and arguing like adolescents. Adults have a longer time horizon and perspective; they can hold their temper and they don't cause injury like adolescents do. It's grow up or die time. We have to stand up and measure up to the higher demands of growing truth—because truth is growing, truth is expanding, and we're trying hard to keep up with it.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
I keep throwing really hard questions at you, and increasingly I’m feeling how difficult this all is. The fact that we’re even asking these questions means we’re in a reality more difficult than just forming them.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
And you’re asking me questions about things I don’t really know much about.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Ask me about the book I wrote! It's funny—I thought I was going to ask you about psychedelics. I feel like I’m in satsang, asking, what does it mean to be a good person? Grace? How do I face the metacrisis?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
We’re all in this together—all your listeners and all the people who aren’t listening. What’s wonderful about this conversation, and the conversations you encourage, is that they push people’s boundaries in a safe and respectful way. They invite more self-reflection and self-awareness—more reading, more learning, less reactivity, and more integration. It's not just the content that’s useful; the mode of the conversation—the disciplined inquiry, the quality of engagement—is itself a model for how we need to move forward. That’s of great value.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Thank you. I recognize that in what I’m trying to produce and in what I consume. I came out of a place where my nervous system was overloaded—playing PlayStation, doing the bare minimum with pre-recorded podcasts, pulling back from generative social discussions in my community. Now I’m trying to surround myself with conversations that help me stay in a different quality of engagement, because otherwise I become whatever’s trending on Twitter or Facebook—maximum attention capture, limbic hijacking, outrage dynamics. I want the podcast to be something different. It’s psychedelic, but really it’s about being someone with a psychedelic perspective trying to make sense of life in real life.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been listening to Daniel Schmachtenberger, trying to find that place between recognizing what’s going wrong and what I’m actually able to do. Rather than trying to solve what’s wrong with the world, ask: what can I actually do? Right now, it feels like this is what I’m able to do.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I understand. I don’t do Twitter or Instagram; I spend very little time on social media. At the risk of separating myself from the pulse of where people are, where I live is not where most people live—and one reason is psychedelics. When I experience what’s happening, it’s within a different historical horizon. Even my concern for suffering is from a different perspective, because psychedelic experiences taught me to recognize different levels of being and soul inside a human body, different levels of soul maturation in a species and historical period, contextualized within an intimate experience of the aliveness of the universe. The universe is alive at its core—in every blade of grass and planetary gyration—and its intelligence is constantly knocking on the back of our minds, asking permission to enter and infuse us with understanding.</p>
<p>To attend deeply to that invitation requires stepping out of the buzz—Twitter, Instagram, the constant feed. If you want to understand where we are in the universe, you go out at night under a dark sky, let your eyes adjust, and listen carefully. It’s the same with inner knowing: stepping back from daily discourse and tuning in deeply. I’ve been blessed with an unusual amount of time to do that without taking on monk’s robes.</p>
<p>My understanding of the challenges we’re facing isn’t based on earthly wisdom. I try to frame it that way, but the deeper sense of what’s driving the social context comes from my psychedelic work—a perspective beyond time-space. At best, time-space is 50%; the rest comes from intimacy with the generative intelligence of the universe. I avoid “the divine” because that triggers culture wars, so I talk about the mind of the universe—an intimacy with the creative intelligence that, to some degree, took me under its wing because I was willing to pay the dues to snuggle up inside there. You never look at life the same way again after you’ve been dissolved into the deepest pulse of life you’ve ever known.</p>
<p>It makes you very sensitive to how much fear drives things. When you’ve dissolved all the fear you’ve been asked to dissolve and entered territories where there is only truth, insight, understanding, love, and compassion, you come back and see how much is driven by fear—fear of dying, fear of loss. If you lose that fear of dying, you live from a different place.</p>
<p>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is a psychedelic memoir—a whole life’s work. I like the title Diamonds from Heaven better because it’s a story of a journey of deepening intimacy. After sessions, even a grocery store can feel like Disneyland—strange and surreal. That’s our work: go into deeper intimacy with whatever drives the universe, then come back and live our lives as best we can. Reincarnation does this—pulling us out into spiritual reality, plunging us back in, over and over. A psychedelic session reenacts that on a smaller orbit: it shatters the earthly life, opens us to what it’s like to die into the great surrounding world, then we come back into time and space. Do that enough times—incarnate enough times—and you cease to relate to the world as before.</p>
<p>Much of the aberrant social behavior we see is, to me, youth—so much inexperience and naivete. Maybe badness, but more than that, something that makes me terribly sad: people not knowing better. At core, I see a soul that hasn’t matured enough to understand the deep reciprocity between human beings, which leads to respect no matter who they are. That’s childishness. Psychedelics grow us up—if we use them carefully, they accelerate maturation. They don’t make us perfect or fill us with eternal truths, but they force us to become more mature if we engage them responsibly.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
That feels like a good place to close. I really asked you to go to the edge of your thinking today on difficult questions. I feel nourished by what came of it, and I trust my listeners will too, or at least that something worthy of discussion will arise. I appreciate your time today, Chris.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
You bet. I trust our conversations—what comes out of them and where they go. I hope they’re useful to the people who tune into your podcast. It’s always a joy to talk with you.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Thank you, Chris. I’m going to show your book here for those watching on YouTube—LSD and the Mind of the Universe. It’s a very good book.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I’m going to put in a plug for a book by a friend of mine. If you’re concerned about the birth of the future human and the historical crisis we’ve entered, and you want deeper understanding, my book gives a psychedelic vision of where we are and where we’re going. But this book—let’s see if it’s showing here—</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Yeah, I see it: Choosing Earth, Humanity’s Great Transition to a Mature Planetary Civilization.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yeah, Dwayne Nelda. It’s not a big book; it won’t take you a lifetime to read. A really fine book on where we are, where we’re going, and how to navigate the times we’re entering.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Very kind book. Cool. Thanks for the suggestion, Chris. Last thing: given how damning we were of social media throughout this interview, are there places on social media you’d like to direct people?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In a couple of months, they can go to chrisbache.com—the website will eventually appear there. I’m so out of social media I haven’t fulfilled my responsibility to get the website done. They can reach me at my university email address, cmbache@ysu.edu, for the time being. But in a couple of months they’ll be able to go to chrisbache.com.</p>
<p>James Jesso: 
Thank you very much, Chris. Looking forward to the next conversation. Okay—thank you for tuning in. Check out Chris’s book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe. I loved it—so many tabs, so many underlines. I also love talking with Chris; he’s got a lot of wisdom.</p>

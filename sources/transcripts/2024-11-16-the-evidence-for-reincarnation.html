<p>Dottie Koontz: 
Welcome, everybody. This is the Vancouver IONS Community Group, and our speaker tonight—I’m very excited to say—is Chris Bache, PhD, back to talk about another of his areas of contemplation, which he wrote about in his book Life Cycles: A Study of Reincarnation. Reincarnation is a topic that people approach with belief, disbelief, or curiosity. Based on my own contemplation in my younger years and subsequent personal experiences, including a past-life regression in my 20s, I’m in the believer camp.</p>
<p>Chris, who spoke here a couple of years ago, was wonderful, and many of you have read his books and appreciated the work he’s done. Chris is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He’s also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an Emeritus Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the board of the Grof Legacy Training. An award-winning teacher and international speaker, Chris has written four books: Life Cycles about reincarnation; Dark Night, Early Dawn on pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy; The Living Classroom, an exploration of collective fields of consciousness in teaching; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe, the story of his 20-year journey with LSD—which is a fabulous book. Chris lives in Weaverville, North Carolina, with his wife, Christina Hardy, a professional astrologer and past-life therapist. So, Chris, take it away—and thank you for being here.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Hi, everybody. It’s nice to see you, and thank you for your warm greetings. They really touched my heart. I hope we have a lot of fun today. Because many of you know my work, I want to show you something I think you’ll like. In 2008 I wrote The Living Classroom. I talked about fields of consciousness and energetic transmission, and I never mentioned psychedelics—nothing about my psychedelic work. Now, Sunni is bringing out that book in a new edition. It’s just out this coming month. It’s inexpensive in hardback, it’s out as an ebook, and it’ll be in paperback in a year. This is the true edition of The Living Classroom. This time they gave me permission to talk about psychedelics. I’m actually saying I was a university professor for 20 years, I was taking large doses of LSD in a therapeutic setting, and this is what happened with my students. This is the theory of classrooms and fields of consciousness that came out of it. It’s a special joy because it puts the final stitch into bringing back together the two halves of my life that I had to separate in order to stay a university professor while doing this work. Now they’re coming back together late in my life.</p>
<p>Before I published on psychedelics, I tackled what I thought was a really important, fundamental question dividing world philosophies: reincarnation. If you believe this is the only life we have, you go one direction; if you believe we have multiple lifetimes, you go another. After graduate school, when I started teaching and reading more widely, I found an amazing body of evidence documenting that this is a true and legitimate part of life. None of my graduate courses had taken reincarnation seriously—neither the Western religions I studied nor the scientific traditions that displaced them in my mind. And here was Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia proving that reincarnation is a fact of life. I had to erase my entire intellectual blackboard and start over. If reincarnation is a fact of nature, then we’re living in a much different universe than I thought. My life since then has been an unfolding understanding of what that’s like. Just as we understand plate tectonics, galaxies giving birth to stars, and planets terraforming, there’s now this understanding that reincarnation is part of how nature carries forward and advances individual learning within certain species. Up to that point, evolution carries forward the learning of groups, but eventually individuality matures, and nature finds a way to fold individual learning forward into cascading accumulations of knowledge, wisdom, and experience.</p>
<p>On my first sabbatical, I wrote Life Cycles. It starts with a chapter on the evidence for reincarnation and then asks: If reincarnation is true, what does it say about our relationships, our families, and larger patterns? Tonight, I’d like to share a lecture gathering the scientific evidence for reincarnation. I gave a good lecture on this topic at a European World Congress on Consciousness—it’s 35 minutes long. I’d like to play that to carry the water for the evidence; I can’t say it better than I did there, and I was younger and had more energy. After 35 minutes, I’ll finish up, and then we’ll have time for questions and answers. Let’s hope the technology gods are with us—fingers crossed.</p>
<p>I hope you’re seeing what I’m seeing—large screen—and I hope the sound works. Now, if I can make this...</p>
<p>If the most important philosophical question one can ask is, Do we survive the death of our body?—which Dr. Van Lommel is asking—I think the second most important is, Do we live once, or more than once? It hinges on time. As a teacher, if I give a quiz, I expect a certain performance. If I give an hour exam, I expect a higher level. If I assign a take-home research paper, I expect higher still—because there’s more time. If this magnificent universe has a purpose, we have to measure that purpose proportionate to the time we have to fulfill it. If we only live once, we might estimate the purpose of existence to be X. But if we live 100 times, 1,000 times, 10,000 times—if our participation is truly open-ended—then we have a very different relationship with the universe and a reason to think about purpose in a completely different framework.</p>
<p>The religions of the last 4,000 years have tended not to value physical existence. The pattern is: achieve realization or enlightenment, then leave—escape Samsara, attain moksha, achieve salvation and depart. That leaves the fundamental question unanswered: What is the purpose of the universe? What is the purpose of my physical existence? But if we come back many times, a different story unfolds. Our understanding of reincarnation is incomplete, just as we’re only beginning to grasp the true depth and breadth of the universe. When we understand that we’re dancing with this universe over extended time, we gain insight into what the universe might be trying to accomplish in us—and what our gift to the universe might be in the continual refinement and compounding of our talents.</p>
<p>I want to talk about the evidence for reincarnation. My first book as an academic was Life Cycles—an indication of how important I think this topic is—and there is good, critical, empirical evidence that allows us to decide it. Fifty years ago this evidence didn’t exist; theologians debated reincarnation endlessly. Today, there’s a different body of empirical evidence that has moved the topic from the theologians’ table to the psychologists’, philosophers’, and psychiatrists’ tables. We can look small—detailed cases—or go large—the broader literature. The joy is in the detailed cases, but in this time I’m going large to encourage you to read at least one book you haven’t read yet and to show patterns emerging in the literature.</p>
<p>Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation by Ian Stevenson changed my life. Like many people finishing graduate school in 1978, I was an atheistically inclined agnostic. My training in philosophy of religion basically made me an atheist. Encountering this book right after graduate school turned my life around; he convinced me there was evidence that we live more than once. Stevenson was the Carlson Professor at the University of Virginia from 1967 to 2001. He wrote 11 books on reincarnation. Among the most important: cases of reincarnation type written over a seven-year period from ’73 to ’84; work on children who can speak a language no one in their family or town speaks—sometimes an ancient language—children who remember previous lives; and his last book, his magnum opus, a 1,000-page, two-volume study of 187 cases of children who not only have detailed memories of their immediate past life but also carry scars on their bodies relating to the death wounds of the previous personality. Continuity of memory is disruptive enough for academics; the idea that a death wound can transfer into the physical body of a subsequent personality drives my colleagues up the wall. But 187 well-documented case histories make a magnificent book.</p>
<p>What do we see in Stevenson’s work? Children around the world with detailed recall of their most recent life. They know their way around towns they’ve never visited. When brought to the place of the previous personality, they recognize people they’ve never met, know their personal history with them, and show appropriate emotional responses—husband to wife, parent to child. There’s a case of a five-year-old showing all the feelings of the husband of a 35-year-old woman. In one case, a child named Parmed, when reunited with the family of the previous personality, was shy around the wife; he wouldn’t identify her until she left the room. Later, he took her aside and said two things: “I’ve come, but you’ve not fixed bindi”—the spot Indian women wear on their foreheads to indicate they’re married—and he criticized her for wearing a white saree instead of a colorful one, since widows traditionally wear white. Essentially, this five-year-old was saying to a 35-year-old woman, “I’ve come, but you’re acting like you’re not married.”</p>
<p>They know the inner architecture of homes they’ve never seen. They identify unpaid debts at the time of death. In one case, the wife asked, “If you’re my husband, where did you put the will? We couldn’t find it.” The boy walked to a kitchen floorboard, lifted it, and pulled out the will from a hidden spot only he knew. Cases like that drive my colleagues at the university right up a wall. It’s hard to deny—but there it is.</p>
<p>Patterns in the data: the average interval between death of the first personality and birth of the second is about two and a half years. The average distance between the two life-places is about 50 miles. These children tend to lose their memories around age eight. We’re looking at a research window from about ages three to eight to document memories. About 90% forget by eight; of the remaining 10%, the vast majority forget when they hit puberty. Stevenson asks why these children remember what most of us forget. He doesn’t know—we need more research—but he offers a hypothesis: roughly 60% died violently in their previous life; the remaining 40% died early, suddenly, or with an acute sense of unfinished business—like a mother who dies shortly after giving birth. Perhaps the trauma of being wrenched from life—violently, suddenly, or with unfinished business—encodes consciousness in a way that draws them back faster and closer than usual. The two-and-a-half years and 50 miles are faster and closer than the population at large.</p>
<p>Reviewing Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation, the Journal of the American Medical Association wrote that Stevenson has painstakingly and unemotionally collected a detailed series of cases in which the evidence for reincarnation is difficult to understand on other grounds. Two years later, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease—major psychiatric journal—devoted an entire issue to Stevenson’s cases and published an editorial explaining their rationale: Our decision to publish this material recognizes the legitimacy of his research methods and the conformity of his reasoning to the usual canons of rational thought. That’s how academics phrase an endorsement.</p>
<p>The philosophical establishment wasn’t going to let Stevenson get away without a fight. His most important critic is Paul Edwards. His book, Reincarnation: A Critical Examination, gathers a series of articles he wrote in 1986–87. Edwards, a major American philosopher and editor-in-chief of the eight-volume Encyclopedia of Philosophy, is the harshest critic of Stevenson. He accuses him of fraud and insufficient rigor, and of failing to prove there was no contact between the two families. But there’s a deeper logic operating: Edwards says reincarnation would represent a crucifixion of our understanding—by which he means secular humanism and the Newtonian-Cartesian scientific tradition. He argues that to believe in reincarnation you must accept six collateral assumptions: materialism is false; mind is not reducible to brain; our identity is more than personality; there is a domain other than space-time; death is an illusion; and there may be a deeper logic to our lives. He calls these assumptions surely fantastic, if not nonsense, and concludes that even absent specific flaws, a rational person will decide either that Stevenson’s reports are seriously defective or that the alleged facts can be explained without reincarnation.</p>
<p>I won’t go into Edwards’s arguments in detail because Robert Almeter has done this for us. Almeter, a major American philosopher and Professor Emeritus at Georgia State University, evaluates five categories of evidence for survival of death and analyzes the Stevenson–Edwards debate. He shows that Edwards does not refute Stevenson; he refuses to look seriously because he’s convinced it must be false. His argument begs the question, assuming precisely what’s in contention: Can consciousness exist without a brain? Because he believes science has proven it cannot, he assumes there must be something wrong with the evidence. If you have a very commanding argument you cannot refute, not accepting it is to act irrationally.</p>
<p>Stevenson’s tradition continues, even though he’s passed on and is now watching from the bleacher seats. Tom Schroeder’s Old Souls—he definitely wins for worst cover in reincarnation research—comes from a Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter and Washington Post editor who traveled with Stevenson to see whether the research would stand up to a reporter’s scrutiny. He looked over Stevenson’s shoulder and came away convinced, as the subtitle says, that this is compelling evidence from children who remember past lives. At the University of Virginia, Stevenson’s work continues with Jim Tucker, who inherited Stevenson’s chair. Tucker’s book is wonderful, very much in the Stevenson tradition, detailing cases and explaining why they can’t be explained by weaker hypotheses like super-psi. Tucker’s book is also easier to read; Stevenson writes and thinks like a lawyer—excellent, very detailed, very dry—while Tucker brings more life to the subject.</p>
<p>Everything so far has been evidence from spontaneous memories—children who spontaneously remember past lives. There’s another body of evidence: evoked memories, brought out by various techniques—massage can evoke a former-life memory, but the most common is hypnotherapy. The following are representative titles from past-life therapy. My favorite book by a single therapist who has worked deeply in this area is by Roger Wilber—an earlier book, Other Lives, Other Cells. He started as a Jungian and ended up in past-life therapy, even though, as you probably know, Carl Jung himself believed in reincarnation in the later years of his life but kept it quiet. It’s a wonderful, intellectually competent book with detailed cases and thoughtful discussion of their implications. Past-life therapy exploded in the ’70s and ’80s, and many therapists were concerned there was no graduate curriculum to establish credentials. Winifred Lucas took on that task with a magnificent two-volume anthology, a compendium of the best work at that time in past-life therapy. If you want one single-author book, I’d read Wilber’s; for a multi-author overview, go to Winifred Lucas’s Regression Therapy: A Handbook for Professionals.</p>
<p>Carol Bowman.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: She was a social worker. She wasn't interested in past-life therapy. She got into it because her son started waking up with very disturbing nightmares. She tried conventional things—worked with him, took him to therapists—but nothing worked. So she did her homework. She looked into past-life therapy, learned the field, and helped her own child resolve trauma carried over from a previous life that was spontaneously bubbling up. She began attracting other parents whose children were having similar problems and eventually wrote a beautiful, very persuasive therapeutic book for parents dealing with traumatic memories surfacing in their children. It had a lot of impact. She wrote a second book—she gets the award for the second-worst title cover on a reincarnation book—Return from Heaven. She was looking specifically at relatives reincarnated within their own families. Now, as a philosopher, that's a weaker body of evidence, because there's so much potential for contamination if you're remembering your grandfather. But as a father, this is interesting, because reincarnation doesn’t just happen across great distances and unrelated families; inside families it’s very common, and it deserves to be looked at.</p>
<p>Next, Michael Newton—two wonderful books. I must confess a special partiality. If you were to pick out one or two books from this entire list, I hope you’d read Michael Newton. He was a hypnotherapist who got into past-life therapy. Then he accidentally discovered that his clients, in deep hypnosis, could not only remember previous lives but also what happened after they died. Basically, they were beginning to describe the afterlife. He didn’t think this was possible, but he followed his clients—good therapist that he is. He took hundreds of people into deep hypnotic regressions, followed them through their former life, their death experience, and then into their memories beyond death. He asked careful questions and kept detailed notes—what was going on, what was it like? Regardless of background—fundamentalist Baptist, Karl Marxist, atheist, hardcore scientific reductionist—people described the same fundamental reality in the after-death state: a world with order, structure, and logic, a social structure where older learners teach younger learners. And it’s a world where people make the choice to reincarnate as a conscious, careful decision, much like selecting courses in college—once you sign up, you’re committed for the whole semester. In the spiritual world, the choice of what life to take is made consciously under the guidance of spiritual helpers and in cooperation with the other people you’ll incarnate with. So before we were born—when we knew more than we know now—we chose the life we’re living. That fact alone bears deep meditation.</p>
<p>Two last examples, not from professionals—amateurs, which makes them interesting. First, Looking for Carol Beckwith. The author, Robert Snow, was the commander of the homicide division of the Indianapolis Police Department—the chief of detectives investigating murders. His opinion has to stand up in court. He’d be the last person you’d think would be researching a former life. But on a lark he did a hypnotic session not oriented toward past lives, and he was hit with a life that appeared to be his. It scared him so much he ran out of the room. He was curious, though, and brought all his detective skills to a systematic search to see if he could identify whether such a person existed. The story of his experience and detective work is told in that short book, Looking for Carol Beckwith.</p>
<p>Lastly, Soul Survivor—you may have seen news clips—by Bruce and Andrew Leninga about their son, James. This is a case of a two- or three-year-old with spontaneous memories and trauma, waking up crying in the night, apparently remembering dying in World War II as a pilot over the coast of Japan. His father, a fundamentalist Baptist, was vehemently opposed to the idea of his son reincarnating. The mother was more receptive. They first wanted to help their son, but the father got involved to disprove reincarnation to protect his faith. In the end, they tracked down the pilot and the story, reunited James at a military reunion with people who had served with that pilot, and James identified people in the group. The father became convinced his son was the reincarnation of this pilot and that reincarnation is true.</p>
<p>Let me finish with two observations. First, what we don’t know. The evidence for reincarnation may be compelling; however, we don’t know how reincarnation takes place or what the physics of rebirth is. We can’t say what the soul is or what it’s made of. How does it come and go from the body? How does it interface with biology and genetics? How does it encode previous learning into our present body, and how does it leave with its learning intact after we die? These are beyond our present grasp. I’m sure we’ll make progress, but before we do we’ll have to stop reducing mind to brain and approach this research with a more multidimensional metaphysical cosmology.</p>
<p>Lastly, a paradox. Ian Stevenson’s evidence is the most powerful for reincarnation. It liberates our thinking at one level but constricts it at another, because the strongest evidence comes from lives that show the tightest correlation. The correlation can be so tight that if you just study Stevenson’s evidence, it can lead to an anemic, underdeveloped vision of what life is like when most of us die. Stevenson’s cases are not typical. These children are coming back very fast and very close to home. Most people spend much more “time” in the timeless condition of the spirit world and have a wider breadth of experiences. So Stevenson liberates us to think about the soul and our existence in a larger framework, but to actually fill in that canvas—to explore more deeply what happens when we die and what the larger circle of life is like, from expanded consciousness to contracted consciousness and back—we need other bodies of data. Michael Newton’s work is important for giving us a larger vision. And this afternoon, when I talk about psychedelic research, I’ll look at another body of data that can expand our understanding of our life in this universe. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Okay, that brings us back. Brings us back.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: Excellent.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I had fun sharing this. It brings back a lot of memories. My thinking on reincarnation has evolved beyond where it was when I wrote Life Cycles. I opened a deeper level in Dark Net Early Dawn when I began bringing in the psychedelic experience, and then in LSD in the Mind of the Universe I offer my most expanded understanding, with the concept of the birth of the diamond soul in history. But it all begins with the question: do we have good, reliable evidence that any hard-nosed skeptic should endorse, whether or not they do? Dottie has a core bibliography she’ll send out—names, places, books I mentioned, plus more. The floor is open.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: If you’d like to ask a question, use the Raise Hand button. Victoria, you’re first. You actually answered one of her questions about how your understanding has evolved. She asks two more: you talk about species reincarnation—could you say more, especially given our current situation? And what do you mean by purification and detoxification, and what does that mean for us individually and collectively?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: When I began my psychedelic work, I thought it was about personal transformation—maybe even personal enlightenment if I got lucky. But the method I used dissolved me so deeply into collective consciousness—into the species mind—again and again that it activated dynamics at a species level. One powerful episode, far down the road, was experiencing what felt like the pulse of life on our planet from deep space—a pulse every hundred years or so, a pulse of reincarnation. I experienced human beings as cells in a super-organism evolving itself through their individual life tasks. Magnificent and beautiful. It deepened my sense that everything we do is part of a larger collective evolutionary dynamic. What we consider private isn’t private; everything is wired into a collective network. That’s true of reincarnation generally.</p>
<p>And regarding purification and detoxification: when we enter deeper, more comprehensive unitive states of consciousness, those pure states churn up the psyche and bring to the surface whatever distorts our capacity to enter that awareness. All the bruises, the sneaky little things—whatever mucks us up—rises to be processed. As we work through them, we clear out the debris, heal, and open to deeper states. Mystics do this, meditators do this, psychotherapy does this—and it’s also true for the entire species. Humanity carries the wounds of its history in collective memory: years of war, plagues, mothers dying in childbirth. Anything not processed by a soul’s present or future lives remains in the collective psyche and holds humanity back—scares us, keeps us small. If humanity is growing into a deeper existential awareness, it has to offload what keeps it small. It has to purify—sweat out the pain and suffering, the vicious wounding of other beings. This is coming to the surface collectively as well as individually.</p>
<p>Viewed this way, certain cultural phenomena look less like isolated individual manifestations and more like the pulse of a deeper process. I think we’re entering a time of exponential growth. Watch out: exponential growth requires exponential purification—exponential detoxification. This is how complex systems evolve. It’s an exciting, challenging time that calls on the warrior within us. It’s going to be hard.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: Briefly, this brings up a lot of emotion for her. It feels like patriarchy needs to be let go of—wrong leaders, perhaps—and that’s huge. Can you give an example of what that means, minute to minute? What does one do?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: We just went through this election. I hope I’m in a safe room; I apologize if I step on anyone’s political toes. We had a choice between a man and a woman—a particular kind of man with a particular worldview and a woman with a particular worldview—and collectively we chose, I think, the worse of the choices. We chose regressively, looking backward, trying to hold on to what we had instead of facing the uncertainty of the future with vision and courage. This will hurt us for years. Decisions will be made; things will get worse. I don’t know whether that’s ultimately bad or good—maybe things will get worse faster than if we had had wisdom at the leadership level. We’ll see. It may be years before we recognize and recover from the political decisions enacted over the next decade under the influence of this election. We hit a choice point between wisdom and foolishness. I’m afraid we didn’t pass this intelligence test in our country. So: fingers crossed and hands folded.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: For me individually, then—keep my focus on the kind of person I want to be, rather than going into judgment, grief, or outrage?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: One of the things about reincarnation is that it gives everyone permission to be at the level of spiritual development they’re at. You lose the habit of judging because you don’t know another’s calling or challenge. You don’t know how old they are—babies or graduate students, so to speak. So I try to be respectfully distant in that way. My focus: do the best I can, help those who see what I see do their best together. I think we’ll make a difference. And as we enter hotter—in the sense of more intense—destabilization, the individual can have a significantly greater impact. From nonlinear systems and chaos theory: as systems absorb more energy, they become unstable, and at those highly energized states, individuals can have disproportionate effects. Butterfly flaps its wings, hurricane in China—the web is interconnected. As we go into this crisis, each individual will have a greater impact than a hundred years ago because the whole foundation is energized. Thank you for those good questions.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: Next, an audience member is preparing an unconventional three-part memoir. They’ve carried wounds across lives and want their writing to make a difference. How do they build and keep their focus in spite of what’s going on around us?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The life of a writer is different. Climb the mountain, close the door, open the windows—hold a deep inner focus for a long time. It took me five years at the computer to write LSD in the Mind of the Universe, three years just to get myself ready to let people in as deeply as I did, and twenty years to gather the experiences in that book. It’s intense. Trust your calling. If writing is your calling—your contribution—buckle in. Take it as far and deep as you can, bring it forward, share it with the world, and then let it go. Drop attachment to results. Do your best and let it go where it will. That’s a great gift.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: He adds that he’s 83—this is a legacy for his family, and he wants the world to understand what it’s missing, especially after a challenging election.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: When the pressure cooker is on, amazing things can happen.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: He says he can do it—he just has to let go of the rest.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Good luck. Fingers crossed. I look forward to seeing what you produce.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: Our next question is from Christopher. As a child he was taught he had sin—and therefore debt. Later, karma—again debt. With reincarnation, karma and rebirth became entwined: since you have karma, you have to reincarnate to keep working on the wheel. Is karma really bound to reincarnation? For those who’ve met the divine presence and incredible love, life feels like an honor. Is reincarnation an act of honor and giving back, or is it bound to karma? And a second part: some say our karma is lessening—being paid down—so perhaps in the future we reincarnate without karma. Your thoughts?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Lot of questions rolled into those couple of questions. Yes, I think of karma. Cause and effect is part of the process. The physical universe has a lot of cause-and-effect running; the spiritual, conscious universe has a lot of cause-and-effect coming. But the question is how we interpret that pattern. I think we’ve been interpreting it too narrowly for a long time. If you listen to past-life therapy, if you read a lot of past-life therapy, you could justifiably come away with the conclusion that life is basically about healing—that we fuck up a lot, we have a lot of fixing up to do—and you could develop a negative perception of what carries over from the past. There’s so much mess-up and cleanup that’s needed when, in fact, I think most people pass their karmic tests. Most of the kids in a school system graduate; they go to the next level. Most people pass their karmic tests. That means we’re bringing into our next life not just liabilities. We’re bringing in assets, skills, relationships that have matured.</p>
<p>But people don’t go to therapists to celebrate their victories; they go to therapists to heal their wounds. That’s perfectly okay, but we have to remember there’s a larger pattern. We have to make sure the story that emerges is not just a story of healing, but a story of investing in human development and growth—challenging ourselves, developing arts, talents, knowledge, the enriching of the human spirit. That is certainly the larger share of what’s happening in reincarnation than simply picking over the bones of a grudge here or there.</p>
<p>If you look at religion, I think there’s been a similar damping down. The religions of the last 4,000 years—the Axial Age—reflected an intensification of access to spiritual reality: yoga, meditation; we were getting deeper and deeper first takes into spiritual reality. And if you have a deep experience of spiritual reality, how could you not think we belong there more than here? Somehow we got marooned here; the job is to get back there, right? Christ will come and save me from my sins; I’m stuck in the mud—get me back there. I’ll become enlightened, awakened, so I can go there. Who wants to be here when you can go there? I understand that. I feel the compassion in that.</p>
<p>But now that we’re beginning to understand how big “here” is—how huge, how old—measured in light years, distances of six million million miles a year in one light year, and we’re measuring billions of light years across—so old that it doesn’t make sense to say, “After all this evolutionary thrust, just after 5,000 years when we began to be conscious, just as we begin to sink down into that consciousness we share with all of life and discover, ‘Oh my God, my life is one with all life’—just then we leave the system and it’s served its purpose.” No, I don’t think so. What came through in my work—and I find many people affirming it—is that it’s about incarnating deeper and deeper. Not just patching up our history, but incarnating the power of spirit—incarnating heaven into our bodies, into our social relationships. It’s about giving birth to this deeper consciousness inside our incarnations.</p>
<p>I think the ego—beautiful thing as it is, the consciousness that holds our lifetime—is giving birth to the soul consciousness in the body: the diamond soul, the consciousness that holds all our lifetimes not as fragments but unified as one, fused in one. When all of our lifetimes—those thousands of years—come together and fuse into a singularity, it gives birth to a consciousness that is more than just enlightened. It gives birth to a magnitude of consciousness that is different. It’s a 100,000-year-old consciousness, and that is becoming the new operational consciousness of humanity.</p>
<p>To get there, we have to let go of all the divisions we’ve invoked—racism, political divisions, national divisions, class divisions—all that stuff we’ve used to keep separate. We’ve got to sweat that stuff out of our pores. I don’t know how long it will take, how many generations, but it is a multigenerational task. Somewhere along the way we go through, gradually, a transformation that looks like what the mystics describe: a death and rebirth, a complete collapse and surrender to forces beyond our control. We let go of self-interest. We take into our hearts the needs of other beings. In this crisis, where we will all become refugees in one way or another, the human heart will be opened, purified, touched. The heart that emerges from this time in history is going to be massive, beautiful, ecstatic, enlightened, prophetic—Christ consciousness, Buddha consciousness, prophet consciousness—an order beyond time.</p>
<p>I think all of us knew what we were getting into when we chose to incarnate in this part of the century. We chose to align with this silver movement, not just for our own benefit—it speeds up our evolution—but to help our children, our grandchildren, through this. We’re all in it together. Karma is part of the webwork. But here’s another thing: when we are privileged to touch the Infinite, the Infinite is like Ali, Ali, income, free—infinite joy, no judgment, infinite capacity to transform karma and wrap it up and throw it away. On the one hand, we have to learn; on the other, we can learn and let go much faster than we think. Let go of these old, stupid, narrow concepts of God that keep us imprisoned in fear and uncertainty. Let that go. This is an extraordinarily powerful time.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you: Robert Monroe—his book Four Journeys; Monroe of the Monroe Institute—was taken into the future, he thinks mid-3000s AD. In that future, when he looked up and saw the Bardo, there was no Bardo anymore—no souls in the intermediate state. Physical reality was open into the luminosity of diamond light. What it teaches us is that the Bardo—our unresolved, unfinished lives—is individual but also collective. We are processing our former lives; we’re processing our karma; we’re growing up; we’re facing ourselves in history. When that happens, we will be much more transparent to the Divine Intelligence, to the Divine Love, to the Divine information that can help us. When we have this kind of access, there will be no technical problem we can’t solve, no social problem we can’t heal. That’s what I think we’re working toward. Thank you. Thanks for the great question, Christopher.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: 
Beautiful answer. So, Janine, you’re next… Janine, do you have a question?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think you’re very much right. Soul retrieval and what’s happening in a historical situation are very similar. In soul retrieval, we retrieve alienated, split-off portions of our soul. To do that, we have to heal those portions and integrate them—welcome them back into unity. I think the same thing is happening in our historical process. We are retrieving our souls from the whole period of history when we thought we were egos and made decisions based on our private, separate existence. Now we have to retrieve all those pieces—what was injured in us and what we did to others—so we can grow into a fully manifesting soul.</p>
<p>Sounds like it, doesn’t it—unified theory. I’m all for unified theory. One of the advantages of being retired and getting old is I don’t have to keep up with the literature anymore, so I’m really behind on it. But Irvin Laszlo’s work, the Akashic field, field theory, chaos theory—work in fields—yes, absolutely. Fertile ground.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: 
Thank you… Norma, you’re up next. What’s your question?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Well, you know, your experience of getting lighter and lighter and kind of disappearing—that speaks to me. That’s my experience, too. I find that the older I get—and I’m 75 now—the thinner my arms get and the weaker my skeleton gets. It’s like it’s softening and falling off. As it falls off, the memories associated with it get loose and fall away. I find it much easier to move into egoless places than I used to, just because my skin is wrapped a little looser—my mind, too. As we get older, it gets easier to step into that in-between place. And when we get to the very end, it’s a big release, and we go light to light.</p>
<p>You know, all my life I’ve told my children, when they were little, “It’s a great life—and in the end, you get to die.” Death is something to look forward to. Death is graduation. Death is coming home. If there were one thing I wish I could give to people, it’s: give up your fear of death. If you fear death, you’ve got your metaphysics upside down. Birth is when the hard stuff begins. You should warn the child: you’re beginning first grade. Death is graduation—joy and celebration. All of our mythology that makes death hard and difficult goes deep—nonsense. For 99.9% of people, it’s a spontaneous rushing into the arms of the Divine, rushing home. If you’re clear on what birth and death are, then you take death into your heart and celebrate it: a life coming to fruition. You’re bringing everything you’ve learned back to your core soul, all of your decisions back to your core soul. Wow—it’s graduation. Bigger than joy and sorrow.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: 
Thank you, Norma. I guess it’s my turn, because Paul here has a question. As you’ve talked about reincarnation: is reincarnation, from your perspective, strictly related to humanity on Earth, or does it serve a different or broader role in the universe?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Good question. In my writing, my work really focuses on human consciousness. People ask, “How come you don’t get deep into animal and plant consciousness like other shamans?” It’s a good question, because I know there are fields of consciousness related to the plant and animal kingdoms. I think the reason is that, for me, humanity represents the greatest threat to all life on the planet. My work has been about trying to work with human consciousness in the belief that if we can heal humanity, all other forms of life will be safer from us.</p>
<p>Cultures that believe in reincarnation tend to agree on one thing: it doesn’t begin with human beings. They look to higher mammalian forms, higher life forms among animals, as a bridge into human consciousness—learning the basics. My sense is that individuality is the seed kernel that makes reincarnation possible. I don’t look at a field of grass and say there are 10,000 individuals there; that’s more of a collective identity. Somewhere along the way, these complex collective identities give birth to more and more individual self-awareness. My dog—I tend to think my dog’s pretty individuated. Somewhere along the way, reincarnation begins as learning and following, and it begins before human beings, I think. But nobody knows exactly where or how. It’s an organic developmental process.</p>
<p>I also think that once you reach certain thresholds, there’s not much point in incarnating at a lower level. As a general rule of thumb, once you can function as a human being, there’s not much point in coming back as a dog because you’re at a quantum jump higher. I don’t want to make rigid rules, but it’s like school: once you can do calculus, we won’t send you back to algebra for credit. You could do it if you want, but we won’t give you credit for it. With incarnation, we go through developmental stages, and once you can function at that stage, naturally you want to function at that stage and higher.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: 
Thank you. I have one more question related to that. Of all the books I’ve read on reincarnation and past lives, I’ve not seen one where there was a reincarnation from or to another planet or star system. Do you have anything to say about that?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I’d say, why not? Once you understand that the dynamic principles of evolution are playing themselves out in other solar systems and galaxies, and you run the numbers, it’s kind of like: there’s got to be intelligent life out there. If we can incarnate, then they can incarnate. Distance is immaterial. There are people who have conscious recall of having been a life form on another planet. I can’t remember her name, but there’s a woman who does past-life therapy with a major focus on helping people integrate incarnations from other planetary lifetimes. Do a little digging around. I personally don’t have conscious recall of such, though I was at a spiritual workshop where a teacher had recall that he, I, and one other person there had shared another planetary system in another incarnation. So I say: okay, why not?</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: 
We have time for one last question—unless you’d like to have a last say.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Let me draw a few things together. Reincarnation doesn’t end the questions; it begins a rich vein of questions. It opens possibilities because it relieves us from the terrible burden of time. When we ask, “What do we want to be? What do we want to become?” we should be thinking in terms of 10,000-year increments, not 100. Do you want to become a Beethoven? A Mozart? A great poet, a great artist? We have unlimited time. The universe wants us to develop all the talents latent within this human form.</p>
<p>The diamond soul is going to function at a much higher level of sensory experience—vision more refined, intense, clarified; all the physical senses. It’s not just an open heart or an open mind, but the entire physical body animated into higher orders of self-realization. The Divine is shoving together—think of it as green reality—earth and light, pure light, spiritual reality. We’re forging more and more into each other until we become green—spiritual beings filled with light, radiating with light. It will take time, but the pace is picking up.</p>
<p>When the child is born—when we succeed in bringing this new awakened consciousness into the world—like every mother, we’ll look at that child and say, “It was worth it.” It was worth it to give birth to this magnificent being—this Christ child, this Buddha-awakened child—to humanity. Not just here and there for a few special people, but for all of humanity everywhere.</p>
<p>And don’t you know, the women are the key to getting us through this crisis. Men have had their chance; we’ve screwed it up. Women have to exercise a greater share of power—reclaim the power they’ve been denied—and bring it fully forward. Any man worth his salt will be glad when that happens, because we’ll know that half of us is now showing up fully, and we are stronger when we’re all together.</p>
<p>That’s basically the message of reincarnation. We are constantly growing deeper community, not just deeper individuals. We have blended all the races in our body. We’ve blended cultures and religions in our body. They’re all here. We are the living consciousness that incorporates the future human—which is transnational, transracial, transreligious. So many false identities are going to fall away quickly as we make this transition.</p>
<p>Here’s one sweet last thought: we’re going to find that 99% of the work has already been done. We are just waking up. The fetus isn’t gestated in the day of labor. Labor has been long. Most of the work has already been done. It’s just the last bit—the last waking up, the last time around—opening and letting this birth take place. I think this is the century. It’ll happen this century. It has to. We don’t have time not to. Thank you very much for giving such a big slice of your day and having this time to spend together. I hope you take the work out among your friends—share the book, share the work. It’s a real honor. Thank you.</p>
<p>Dottie Koontz: 
Thank you, Chris. That was fabulous. If you want to unmute yourself and say goodbye to Chris and everyone else—thank you all for coming. This has been wonderful.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thank you. Thank you. Bye.</p>

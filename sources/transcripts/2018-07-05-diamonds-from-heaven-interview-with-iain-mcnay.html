<p>Iain McNay: 
So hello and welcome again to Conscious TV. I'm Iain McNay, and my guest today is Chris Bache. Hi, Chris.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Hi, Iain.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
We found Chris quite recently—he was giving a lecture in London. I read his short bio that came along with the lecture details, and I thought, what a fascinating chap. So I invited him, and he very kindly agreed to come along and talk with us today. Chris has written three books—I only have two here, but one is <em>Lifecycles: A Study of Reincarnation in Light of Contemporary Consciousness Research.</em> Then there's this one, <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind</em>, and <em>The Living Classroom: Teaching and Collective Consciousness</em>. He has a new book, which isn't published yet, called <em>Diamonds from Heaven: A 20 Year Journey into the Mind of the Universe</em>. So, Chris, let's start with the questions you had. You worked for many years lecturing in comparative religions, psychology to some degree. But there were questions that were burning inside you.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Well, I was trained as a philosopher of religion. Philosophers of religion are concerned with exploring the deeper questions of existence—the meaning of life, the structure of the universe, the limits of human consciousness. These are the questions I was trained to pursue in graduate school. Then I joined Youngstown State University, and just as I started there, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof in psychedelic research, particularly in his book <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious.</em> This was in 1978. As soon as I read that book, I was so deeply impressed with the caliber of the research and the mind behind it that I knew I wanted to do this work.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
And the questions you had were questions with a variation about consciousness—what it is, what its potentials and patterns are, what its boundaries are. These are slightly different from the usual “Who am I, what am I” type questions. These must have been working in you for some time.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
For a time, yes. There were two people I met my first year of teaching. One was Ian Stevenson and his work on reincarnation research, which opened up a whole new world for me. I finished graduate school as an atheistically inclined agnostic. Ian Stevenson opened up reincarnation. Stan Grof opened up the opportunity to actually experience deeper dimensions of consciousness, and by entering those dimensions, to experience deeper dimensions of existence itself. That felt like the opportunity of a lifetime—what philosopher wouldn’t want to do that? The problem, of course, was that this was 1978, and the substances had been made illegal in the United States. The first generation of work was over, and we were forty years away from the renaissance of psychedelics that's taking place now. So I made a difficult choice—I decided to split my life. In my public life, I was a university professor: I taught, published, served on committees. In my private life, I began a private, twenty-year journey using Grof’s methods—high-dose LSD therapy, seventy-three sessions over twenty years. I worked for four years, stopped for six, and then worked very intensely for ten years. So overall, from 1979 to 1999, I did this work. But because it was illegal, if I had talked about it, I would have lost my job. I had to keep quiet about it, and it wasn't until after I retired, and after the statute of limitations had passed—because I don’t do this work now—that I was finally able to talk openly about what one can learn about consciousness and the universe by following this particular method of exploration.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
I think the interesting thing is, you went into it as an adventure, but you went into it in a disciplined, organized way. The sessions were all laid out. I think your first wife was supporting you in the sessions. From what I've learnt by talking to you and reading, the sessions themselves were organized, but not by you—they were sequential. I didn’t know so much about psychedelics before. I know lots of people who've been on LSD trips, but it tended to be just for adventure, not a serious study. You approached it as a serious study, didn’t you? And you talk about a big difference between doing it that way and doing it for recreation.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I’ve never taken LSD and gone to a concert or stayed up talking with friends. This was a very specific methodology—completely internalized. It's Stan Grof’s psychedelic therapy, as he describes in his book *LSD Psychotherapy: * you’re totally isolated from the world, in a private space, lying down, wearing eye shades, listening to carefully selected music. My first wife was, and is, a clinical psychologist—she was my sitter. You take the medicine and then surrender completely, letting it take you where it will. I did this work in contrast to current research in the renaissance of psychedelics, which is mostly focused on healing, and with much lower, gentler doses and substances. I did this work as a philosopher. I wanted to explore the deep structure of consciousness that Stan had documented in his early work, and the structure of the universe itself. If you’re willing to submit to this intense destructuring of consciousness, you go through—not just one death and rebirth—but a series of deaths and rebirths, deeper and deeper, into what we might call the mind of the universe, the mind of the cosmos, the mind of God. In my experience, I never controlled what happened in the sessions. I would try to set intentions, but working at these high levels, which I don’t recommend…</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
Really, because it was 500, 600 micrograms?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes, I was working at five to six hundred micrograms, which—now, looking back—I really don’t recommend in sustained work. I’d be much gentler on myself if I were to do it again. At the time, I was young, and I took care of myself, very good care. Everything was methodical. I kept detailed records within twenty-four hours of every session, making a complete phenomenological record, tracking all variables and dates. I studied the sessions over years, because these are complex experiences. What I found was that if you open yourself deeply, you enter into a conversation with the universe, and the universe is interested in deepening your experience. It takes you in and teaches you, trains you, softens what needs to be softened, breaks what needs to be broken, to allow you to enter more intimately into the deep structure of reality.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
But doesn't it take a certain courage from you as a human being to allow that to happen, since you've got no idea where it really leads?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It does. This is one of the great gifts that Stan Grof gave me—reading his work, I learned to trust the process. If you submit to it—let it take you where it will—no matter how terrible it becomes, no matter how inscrutable, if you surrender to it, it will always culminate. It will take you through a breaking point, and then it will catch you. You die, and then you awaken into a different condition, a different reality, as a different being in a different dimension of existence.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
So what do you mean that you will die—what does that actually mean in a tangible way?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
In order to experience intimately the deep nature of reality, you can't take your ego into that reality and have a transpersonal experience. The only way to enter these realities is to become a “citizen” of those realities. Our time-space identity—just by the conditioning of time and space—keeps us small. In order to enter vast expanses of reality, we have to let go of what keeps us small. So you go through a psychological death—ego death is very common.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
So ego death—it’s a death of a construction of who we think we are, who we’ve become through our conditioning?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Exactly. I was a white male, highly educated philosopher concerned with the meaning of existence. The universe broke me by turning me into the exact opposite of all of those things. For hours, I experienced being female, being poor, being women of color, being women with no interest in philosophy—which is perfectly fine, except it completely negated my sense of who I was. When I finally yielded and allowed myself to become a woman, it took me into the most marvelous experience of hundreds of women’s lives. It gave me the experience of being feminine that I wish every man could have.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
And when you say “you” during these adventures, what is the “you”? Because if the ego dissolves, what is the “you” that's having this experience?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
That's one of the linguistic puzzles every mystic has to address. The “I” is not this “I,” but it is continuous with this “I.” The first death is the death of ego. There's continuity of awareness and memory, but discontinuity of capacity. When you die and wake up in a different reality, you remember who you are, but you are not who you were as a time-space human being. You literally become a different kind of being. For six to eight hours at a time, Chris Bache gets shattered, and you learn how to be a different kind of being. Once you stabilize consciousness at this post-egoic level, and after various purification and transformative processes, if you keep pushing deeper, it will ask you to surrender even more, to give up something more fundamental than your personal identity. When you do and wake up in that next reality, you're not Chris Bache anymore, not even who Chris Bache died into—you are a different entity. When you come back, there's a thread of memory, but you're literally remembering having been different beings or different dimensions of being.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
So is the transformation happening within the trip, or after you come back—or both?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
It’s both. And I want to say this—there’s a lot of discussion about psychedelics and enlightenment: do psychedelics lead to enlightenment? Are they counterproductive or productive? These adventures were not aimed at enlightenment; I mean, they started that way. I started because I was interested in enlightenment—I thought I could do these sessions, ego would die, and I’d get to enlightenment faster. But that changed quickly. After my first ego death, instead of personal transformation, the story opened up into a story of deep collective transformation. I began to enter what I call the ocean of suffering—what the Buddhists call the hell realms—deep suffering still living within the collective psyche. This went on for two years, over many sessions and years, involving so many people that it eventually shattered my perception of what was going on. It wasn't aimed at my personal transformation but at the transformation of some aspect of humanity’s collective unconscious. After that culminated, I entered into archetypal reality. In that phase, I had to cease to be a human being. I discovered that there is a human identity deeper than your individual identity. Just as I had to die as Chris Bache to become something larger, I had to die as a human per se and go completely outside of any frame of reference of humanity to move into what I determined were different dimensions of archetypal reality. Every step deeper is a step into much more intense energy. In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness. But I found that if I went back again, systematically—about five times a year—over time you go through a purification and clarification process. You learn how to stay conscious at levels of reality where, at first, you could not remain conscious—you have to practice.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
To give it context—you did seventy-three trips over twenty years. I would never say “trips”—what word do you use?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Sessions. Seventy-three sessions over twenty years. Each session, no matter the gap, was sequential. At the end of one session, the next session would often start where the previous one left off.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
Approximately so—you might need several layers down to see the overarching story.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes, it's like keeping a dream journal. There is a logical flow you can identify, but sometimes you must go several layers deep before the logic becomes clear.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
And you took the time in between to integrate and absorb what had happened. Also, you mentioned last night that your body had to adapt—the energy during the session is so powerful. You've got the absolute coming into a finite vessel, which has to be able to accommodate that energy. That was quite a big thing, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Huge. Every step deeper is more intense. When you go into these states, you open into vast fields of consciousness, and the energy is just immense—it runs through your system. You have to prepare your body to go into those states, and after the session, you have to help it absorb the experience in a healthy manner. You have to stay clean—in your habits, in your meditation, your yoga, structural aspects of your body. I discovered that my system had a natural capacity to let go, and I never had trouble coming back—there was a natural congealing. But you have to monitor your system carefully. I would have a session, write it up, then take two or three months to absorb it, ponder it, follow its teachings—because it gives you teachings. Then I would open up again, and the process would repeat itself.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
There are also layers of conditioning you're letting go of—not by effort, but by allowance in the sessions, yes?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Exactly—I surrendered. The universe, or creative intelligence, takes me in. Usually, the first half of a session is spent in intense purification; then it reaches a peak, and you’re drawn into the second half: an ecstatic experience, a deeper immersion into the divine, and a series of teachings. Then the system slowly closes down.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
And do you remember all those teachings when you come back?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I do, though I should qualify that—there are many layers. You go through the death-rebirth cycle, and if you stop there, you stay at that level. But if you keep pushing—and with high-dose LSD work, there’s huge power, always pushing you to your edges. When you break into a new level, often recall is hard at first; you get pieces, aspects, but they don’t always cohere. Your account will have gaps. But if you go back again and again, you train yourself to stay conscious at that level. Through continued purification and effort, eventually, you’re able to maintain coherent cognition at that level, and the pieces begin to cohere—you get a more stable and clear vision. That’s one difference between therapeutic work and “tripping”—if you just trip, you may touch these places, but if you want sustained, conscious experience at various levels of reality, you have to pay your dues, work to be conscious at that level. When you do that, you come back able to bring it all back. When I wrote my accounts, I used a technique: the day after a session, I would play the same music used during the session, in the same order, and write up the experience. That put me “one foot in, one foot out”—helping me remember more, and I could get it down in print. With careful attention in the session and afterwards, you can retain it.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
One of the things I particularly liked—maybe it’s in your <em>Dark Night</em> book—is that you stress you cannot fully awaken individually. You had the realization that, at the absolute level you were visiting, it is all one. So when you come back to the human vessel, it exposes the myth that someone can awaken individually while others aren’t. How can that be, that an individual awakes yet another does not?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
The metaphor I like to use when teaching my students is that of leaves and the tree. Imagine leaves being individually conscious, yet they are manifestations of the consciousness of the tree. So we are individually conscious, and there is a narrative of individual evolution, but if you really dig deep and ask “what is an individual?” then you encounter the collective psyche—the consciousness of the planet, the galaxy, and then deeper, as you say, the absolute, what I call my belovedness. Individual awakening is a mistaken inference. It’s true that if you don’t work individually, you make no progress, but when you do, you're actually drawing many people's consciousness into your work. So it’s impossible to put a boundary on awakening; the universe doesn't even think in terms of individuals—it's interested in awakening the entire species. Not this religion, that continent, but the whole human family into evolutionary progression. I began to realize I wasn’t doing these sessions for personal work or healing, or even personal transformation.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
It started with the questions, but the adventure led you far beyond those initial questions.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
And then beyond even collective transformation—it became an adventure in knowing the universe, an adventure in being drawn deep into intimacy with the creative intelligence, into causal reality, into oneness, into śūnyatā, emptiness, the fertile void, into the <em>sat-chit-ananda</em>—existence before existence. One adventure after another, deeper and deeper. I have an acute sense that the universe loves to be known—the universe wants to be known. We are part of its knowing. When we return to source, when we begin that journey back to point of origin, we are met by a massive supreme intelligence, extraordinary compassion and loving beyond imagination. And it is so happy that part of itself has come back to experience and know it. It wants to show you creation, show you what has been going on. The universe has been working for billions of years, and we are just now—over the last few thousand years—beginning to open deeply enough to consciously participate and see the creative process. It’s so happy when we do that.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: 
Do you have a view on this: your adventure took you to this knowledge, this experience, but there are other people who go the path of contemplation and meditation, and have very similar experiences. Do you feel that your way was different—not just in substance but in realization and knowledge—from the contemplative path?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
No, I think the cosmology that came out of this work isn’t different from what you see in the great contemplative and spiritual traditions. All honor to the great masters who've done this through the power of their own daily practice—they were always my teachers and masters. What they describe and what I experienced seem to fit hand in glove; there's nothing new there. The only difference is the method—someone with modest spiritual capacity, if they have enough determination and courage to submit to the regimen, might have a temporary experience of these things. As Huston Smith said, “A mystical experience does not a mystic make”—you can’t use these experiences to maintain that consciousness permanently. It would be nice if you could, but by going back and forth, and doing the daily practices, hopefully more and more of it internalizes in your being and you grow.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: You grow. One of the interesting things was that midway through this event, you wrote <em>The Living Classroom</em>, which was about what was happening with you and your students. You don't mention psychedelic experiments at all in this book, and yet, something very special was happening between you and your students. Do you want to talk briefly about that?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I wrote <em>The Living Classroom</em> toward the end of my teaching career, and I don't mention psychedelics at all because it's not about psychedelics—it's about consciousness. The backstory is that I was teaching while also doing my private work, never talking about my psychedelic experiences with my students. I kept a firewall between my professional life and my personal work. But over time, I noticed my students were being activated by my private work. When I went into deeper states of consciousness or experienced some death-rebirth process, they were spontaneously being activated in their own lives in ways that paralleled what was happening in my practice.</p>
<p>Another thing started happening: when I lectured and needed an example to make a point, I’d pause, think, and use an example that came to mind. Students started coming up to me after class, saying, "It's funny you used that example—that's exactly what happened to me this week." At first, I thought it was coincidence, but it kept happening, and the deeper I went in my work, these synchronicities began to touch very deep pieces of their lives. It was as if there was a radar connecting me to where they were hurt or needed healing or an idea.</p>
<p>When students heard their lives being brought into the room, they couldn't help but get deeply involved. As this happened more regularly, I realized I needed to understand it. As an educator, I had to figure out how to work with it—whether to protect them or build barriers, or if I could teach authentically in a way that was safe for them and true to myself. That’s what <em>The Living Classroom</em> is about. Consciousness, in its natural condition, is boundless and doesn’t have firm boundaries. There is private consciousness, but ultimately, it’s like a lake—a stone thrown in sends ripples outward.</p>
<p>I developed strategies for working with consciousness in groups and discovered there’s a field energy at play. I’d read Rupert Sheldrake on morphic fields and always thought of them in terms of whole species. But I found that fields congeal around courses, around students in a room. If you teach the same course year after year, a field congeals and becomes stronger, reflecting the learning of all students who’ve taken the course. That field accelerates learning for new students years down the road, and once you know it’s happening, you can work with those fields cooperatively, strategically—it’s a whole different modality of pedagogy. Instead of a Newtonian pedagogy, you might call it a quantum pedagogy.</p>
<p>For example, I found it important to close those fields at the end of a course. When you open a room to the energy of these fields, students get deeply touched and activated. But at the end, I noticed students lingering, wanting to talk, and realized something was wrong: they were still caught, still connected to the field with nowhere to take it. So not only do you open and work with these fields skillfully, you have to close them skillfully—both socially in the room and in a kind of shamanic, spiritual practice—to avoid encouraging dependence. I want my students to be independent, to take learning to their next course, to integrate what comes next, to find and create their own field. I want them to be free in the world. There's a lot of learning in that.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: I think there's an interesting example you use in <em>The Living Classroom</em> about when a student would ask you a question. If you didn't reply straight away and just opened up for a few seconds, it was like a door would open and a whole new dimension to the answer would come.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, that's right. I found if I paused and didn’t just say the first thing that came to mind—because most questions are ones you’ve heard before—if I stopped, I’d visualize a little blank door in my mind, and a piece of paper would come through. I’d read the paper, and it would be a different answer. When I tried it, suddenly the eyes of the student would light up, the energy of the room would shift, and we’d go in a new, novel direction.</p>
<p>My teaching became a dialogue between thorough organization—I do a lot of notes, very organized—and improvisation. My understanding is that the improvisation coming through the deeper consciousness connection was what happened when my mind was put into the context of our collective mind. The teaching grew out of a dialogue between everyone present.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: You also talked about how the students were changing you. There's a quote from the book: “Over the years, the students broke me down and rebuilt me.” That’s quite radical—to say the students broke you down and rebuilt you.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I was always blessed with really good students who were willing to engage deeply with the questions I asked, and we danced together. In that process, they opened my heart and invited me into their lives—not as a counselor, but in intellectual and philosophical inquiry. They taught me about this hidden territory in the room, about what can happen when good people of good heart come together for this adventure.</p>
<p>They did break me down. At first, I thought when a student asked a question and I had an answer, it was because of a recent experience, book, or session. I thought: “I do the work, and the universe uses my knowledge to seed knowledge in someone else’s life.” But then I realized I had it backwards—sometimes I was having those experiences or reading those books because a questioning student was coming to me in the future, so my learning was actually being seeded by their desire to know. Once you let go at that level, you see it’s really a collaborative enterprise—your learning and teaching are deeply embedded in theirs. The boundaries of self dissolve; it becomes a dance of presences in the room. When life uses you in that delicious, cross-fertilizing way, it’s the sweetest feeling in the world. You’re part of something larger, and both you and your students release into it. They took me there—I could not have gone there by myself.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: Then at some point, a great sadness came upon you on your adventure. As years passed, you found yourself entering a deep sadness. Your enthusiasm for life faded, you began to feel separated and marooned, and you reached a point where you realized you were just waiting to die, to return to your beloved.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes, that was after I stopped the journey. Let me fill in a little blank before what happened after the journey. In the book, <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>, I tell the story of ego death, moving into the ocean of suffering, into the archetype of reality, then into causal reality, with these wonderful unitive experiences. I was completely satisfied at that point—to merge so deeply. But there were still five years ahead in the journey. I went through another cycle of death and rebirth, and was taken into a domain of light—so clear, exquisitely clear, beyond imagination. Buddhism calls it Dharmakaya, the absolute reality of clear light.</p>
<p>Over five years and 26 sessions, I was taken into this reality only four times. In between, there was tremendous purification. In these states, you dissolve into light, take on the qualities and boundlessness of light—you dissolve in the crystalline nature of the Divine. I don’t mean divine in any conventional or theistic sense, but I have no other vocabulary for it. In each of those four adventures going deeper, the divine began to come deeper into my body. I was handled carefully and broken down, and then this consciousness brought me to the end of my work, gave me an overview of all my sessions, showed me the whole pattern, and gave me my final instructions. I didn’t know it was over until it called it. I knew then I had to stop.</p>
<p>The primary reason I stopped was because it became too difficult to come back from the light. It was so painful to return to time and space after dissolving into infinite light. Light comes in many layers, but the “diamond light” is particularly deep. I stopped my sessions, thinking that because I’d always integrated my sessions carefully, I’d be able to enjoy the fruits of that labor. But over time, a deep sadness settled in. I was suffering from a loss of communion—a longing for the light, and I didn’t have the spiritual maturity or capacity to incarnate that light into my physical existence. I realized I was just waiting to die so I could return to the light. I took care of my students and family, did my duties, but in my heart of hearts, I was waiting to die.</p>
<p>Over the years, I realized this was not right. Something must have gone wrong. I reexamined the whole process and saw that I was suffering from too much God, so to speak. Since the physical universe is also the divine, I’d lost balance—between transcendence and immanence. I’d plunged so deep into the transcendent that I lost my foothold in the immanent divine, which is incredibly valuable. I had to make a concerted effort to congeal my life, to come to terms with being where I was, and to continue spiritual practice so that the light could enter more deeply into my body and consciousness. It’s an ongoing process, a work still in progress.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: You also talk about, in the book—which isn't published yet, <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em>—the fact that human things like family were so important to you in helping you find pleasure again in human things. You were almost blown away by what was there, but there’s so much beauty in the human realms. Somehow, as you say, these things are wonderful in and of themselves.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely. My family was always my rock—my students and my family. I have three children, and no matter where I was on Saturday, on Monday I was with my classes and always with my children. Like these flowers on the table—what magnificent expressions of creation. The diamond luminosity, the light, is magnificent, and we have a huge hunger to touch these realms, but the physical world is the manifestation of that reality in tangible form. Nature has been a tremendous balm for me: the starry sky, being in the woods, being with people.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the sadness was that in our culture, I wasn’t allowed to talk about these things. In traditional cultures, you bring your visions back to the elders, who help you understand them, because your visions aren’t meant just for you—they’re collective. But in my culture, I wasn’t allowed to talk about my sessions, couldn’t bring the visions back, couldn’t teach from them or share with colleagues. That sickness of silence added to my sadness and isolation. Living in a psychedelic closet is as injurious as living in any other closet—you have to deny a part of yourself to live in your culture.</p>
<p>Writing <em>Diamonds from Heaven</em> was my step back to the world, sharing these visions, doing what I was meant to do: to be a teacher, to share, to bring these experiences forward in hopes they’ll be useful and helpful to people. It’s not my experiences that matter—what’s important is that all of our experiences of transcendent reality be put on the table, looked at together, so we can see what’s important and what’s not. I don’t own these experiences.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: You also say in one of the books that at the end of the 20 years, you were told, or you felt, it would take 20 years of integration. And actually, the 20 years is up next year.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It’s getting close.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: It might take 20 lifetimes.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes. After I’d done the sessions, my meditation spirit told me, “20 years in, 20 years out”—that it would take 20 years to absorb them. Now that I’m coming close to those 20 years, I think that might have been optimistic. These things run so deep sometimes it feels like it will take many lifetimes to absorb them. I have basic questions like, how do you integrate infinity into finite structures? Some of my experiences involved going far into what I call deep time—outside time and space, deep into the future, different dimensions of time. How do you integrate those breadths into Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday consciousness? In the end, where I am now, I don’t think you can. The only thing we can do is integrate our finite existence into the infinite. We do our practice, we surrender, and make ourselves available, doing everything we can to respond to the needs of the present. Hopefully, through that, the infinite becomes a deeper living reality in our conscious awareness.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: As I was saying last night, it’s not just the experiences you had—which are amazing—but for myself, even when I have an understanding or realization, it can take years to properly integrate it. Sometimes it just hangs around in a form I can’t fully absorb. On the spiritual journey, people often give themselves too hard a time, thinking they must move on or be clear. But as you found out, it’s a process. It takes time—you can't force these things. You can do the meditation, support yourself, but it happens in its own time.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: It does. It’s a slow and gradual process. You can’t cheat nature. It takes time. You can push it a bit, but in the end, you have to let nature take its course.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: Okay, Chris, I’m looking at the clock—and nature’s taken its course—and time is very up.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you so much, Iain. It’s been so good to have this conversation with you. Thank you for it.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: Thank you for coming along to Conscious TV. I’ll mention your new book, which should be out sometime next year: <em>Diamonds from Heaven: A 20-Year Journey into the Mind of the Universe</em>. And then your three books already out: <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, <em>The Living Classroom</em>, which we talked about halfway through the interview, and your first book, which I haven’t actually read—<em>Life Cycles: A Study of Reincarnation in Light of Contemporary Consciousness Research</em>. If you’re interested, there is a lot to read. You don’t have a website yet, but there’s a lecture you did in Prague, about an hour long, which gives lots of details of your psychedelic adventure.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The International Transpersonal Conference, last September in Prague.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: Yes, there’s a lot to follow, and I’d like to explore this more on Conscious TV. If you have ideas of people we should interview, get in contact. Thanks again, Chris.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, Iain.</p>
<p>Iain McNay: Thank you for watching. I hope we see you again soon. Goodbye.</p>

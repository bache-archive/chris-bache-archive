<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Well, here we are again for our third discussion. We typically gave the topic for this discussion as limitless time, because we now want to bridge into the deeper questions surrounding reincarnation. The deeper perspective—where is reincarnation taking humanity? Where is this constant learning and recycling creating new platforms in our incarnation experience? Where is it going? What might the deep future look like? And most importantly, how might that understanding shift how we engage our life, right here, right now?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> Yeah, very deep questions to follow. Where should we begin?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Well, I think we should acknowledge that each of us has a deep experiential basis that we're bringing to this discussion. We're not simply thinking about it or philosophizing about it. We have deep convictions born out of unusual experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> It's true. It's what brought us together to do these dialogues, I think. I was just explaining the difference between knowledge and wisdom. While we've explored strains of knowledge, wisdom is different. It's the opposite in a way, because, for me, wisdom comes through revelation. It comes through listening. It's passive and receiving, whereas knowledge is active—you go after it, chase it, hunt it. With revelation, it's not information in the usual sense; it's cellular. My experience has given me a cellular understanding of what's coming for humanity, and it's hard to hold that. I'm sure you relate to that, Chris. Not everyone else has it, which puts me in a more relaxed state than most people I know because I have this knowing that everything's going to be fine, and I can't explain that knowing. I know that many people listening will resonate with that and have had breakthroughs and visions. So, I think it's really good for us to acknowledge that we carry this other dimension. Through your work, I mean, tell us a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> I completely share what you're saying, because I do carry unusual knowledge, as you do. At the beginning of our series, we talked about the evidence for reincarnation, and I was in my professorial mode, intellectually digesting this evidence. In the second conversation, there was a blending of that type of knowledge and the wisdom that arises in my psychedelic work. In today's discussion, I feel squarely within that other side of my life. I'm a visionary Shaman, a psychedelic visionary. My understanding comes from conscientiously engaged non-ordinary states of consciousness, again and again, purifying and taking me deeper into what I experience as the universe itself and its intention, into time, into deep time, giving me experiences never intended just for me but to hold and pass on. Anyone who has these deep experiences knows they're never just for us. We hold them for the larger collective. Like you, I have a feeling for what's happening in history, and where we're going, which gives me calm and relaxation, even as we enter difficult times.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> Yeah, I think so. We both have that knowing that birth is an intense event. We're coming to a birth point, contractions occurring, similar to individual awakening, which comes through contractions. There's condensing, intensifying of shadow material, and then an opening up. The contractions come closer until there's an epiphany that shakes the core of your being, igniting something within your DNA. I think that's what's happening on a planetary level as well. Your writings, Chris, especially in your book on the mind of the universe, describe this process beautifully. What neither of us can do is fill in the details. We'd like to give a bit of backdrop, empathize with the intensity of the suffering here, and present the knowing that gives people more than hope. There's a purpose to events currently on our planet, whenever you're watching this, because one can only imagine more events occurring as this canal opens up.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Yeah, you described the in-breaking of the vision and being drawn into the deep experience of revelation. Deep visions can't fit into small containers. When nature or the divine invites us into a deeper experience, it has to purify us, and you describe that contracting process. It's our past, everything about us keeping us small, being burned up inside to allow ourselves to be shattered. In my context, it's the death-rebirth cycle, dying to everything within us holding us, being reborn into a larger world. That can happen again and again, taking us deeper. It's like any spiritual path—there are no shortcuts. It's exacting and demanding, but the fruit is personal and collective, expanding around us. We're part of a lineage that asked for more and paid the price for it. My work started as personal healing or transformation but opened up into collective vistas, being drawn into the collective psyche, experiencing reincarnation as a species journey. Our entire species evolves through reincarnation, and we're coming to a crescendo, a profound breakthrough. You've described it as a birth, which is correct. It involves a change from one state to another, like a child from water to land. We are growing from egoic awareness to soul awareness, as past lives become integrated. Eventually, they hit a fusion point, and the soul becomes one. Then there's an explosion of light and individuality, with a higher-order sense of communion with the universe and the divine. If humanity is going through this process, which my visions show repeatedly, it represents a new foundation for the human story, as profound as when we evolved 200,000 years ago. This change will alter the archetypal architecture of the collective unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> Yeah, beautifully said. It brings a few thoughts. Many drawn to this material have likely said yes to transmuting more shadow material, more than one lifetime's worth. I remember the dark days when shadow inside me seemed insurmountable. Happily, it lightened over years. I say this to encourage people to continue their transformation and not to lose hope. We've taken on more because we're capable of it. If you feel that weight, it's because you have the capacity and love great enough to burn through it. When looking at birth or such periods, a completely new emerges, and continuity breaks. You can't see beyond the break, it emerges from all the elements, compresses, and expands. What's coming bears no resemblance to what we have now, and we cannot imagine it with current understanding. You never see a break in continuity until it happens. Humans assume continuity, but crux points smash everything, starting a new epoch with different technology. We're the technology—our DNA holds undreamed capacities. It's crucial to grasp that what's coming bears no resemblance to what has been.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Yes, I completely agree. This happens in a psychedelic session too. I affirm what you're saying about the weight practitioners experience. It's past lives' karma and collective karma. Great beings have taken on responsibility for humanity, engaging darkness from our collective history. We have to move quickly through this transformation, no getting stuck in the birth canal. Many souls incarnating now saw and chose this work, the work of birthing new humanity. You're right, it's a discontinuity. In a session, deep pain seems endless, but after surrender, there's waking in a new reality, not an extension of the old. It's catapulting into something new. In my sessions, being taken into the future, I've seen humanity coming to a turning point. The past's pace doesn't measure the future's. After this historical shift, we'll operate differently, generating a new civilization from a new psycho-spiritual structure. We've damaged nature at the egoic level of consciousness. A healed heart and mind, open to deeper communion, lives differently. Knowing the world you leave is the one you return to compels better care. We're called to a new relationship with the Earth, carrying problems and insights inside. Our work focuses on the inner dance. Others focus on outer change. All are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> So true. The inner transformation you've described reminds me of Shakespeare's comedies and tragic comedies, where everything goes wrong, and act four is chaos. Yet, a magical resolution occurs in act five, triggered by a strange attractor, resolving everything quickly. It's a bit similar to now—long, slow build-up and then a sudden cataclysmic energy resolves the mess unexpectedly. You've spoken of speed, seen in systems like water boiling. You add heat, slowly, until rapid boiling and transformation occur. Simple metaphor, applicable throughout nature and now. Scientists predict quicker change and destabilization. We say this not to alarm but to prepare. The structure must decline as the new emerges. We can't repair the old system, though we shouldn't stop trying. Hearing all this might lead to inaction, but it's not compassionate. Compassion involves passion—standing for justice and meaning. An awakening being works towards what's right. Align with your soul's core, destiny, and you'll always be safe.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> That place of alignment, yes. The way that speeding up process worked itself out in my sessions had to do with understanding the field dynamics of consciousness. I have just enough understanding of chaos theory and non-equilibrium systems to grasp what physicists or chaoticians understand. When a system gets more and more energy poured into it, it reaches a state of non-equilibrium, or far from equilibrium. In this condition, like water getting more and more energy, we come to a tipping point, a bifurcation point where the system has too much energy to maintain its current structure and flips into a different organizational pattern. It goes through this bifurcation point, chooses a different future, and flips into a higher organizational pattern. When physical systems reach non-equilibrium points, extraordinary things can occur—they can produce new particles and orders of coherence within themselves that would have been impossible at a lower energy state.</p>
<p>In my visionary experiences, I saw that all of humanity is like fractal nodes within a unified field, a field of consciousness. The human unconscious, the collective unconscious, is a field that reflects all of our individual experiences. When enough experiences become untenable and so painful that individuals reach out for a different solution, it's not just the individual ordeal of transformation happening; it's a collective one. We've never experienced anything comparable to what's coming at us now. Past hurricanes or natural disasters have affected parts of the world but not the entire globe. The imminent global crisis, driven by the ecological crisis, will affect all continents and people, pushing humanity into a different experiential field.</p>
<p>The collective psyche is going to be energized by all this disruption. It will begin to boil beneath us, beneath our individual minds. In evolution, there are multiple levels at play; I think of at least two. We incarnate over and over, living 100 years at a time, and underneath these cycles, a learning process takes place—this is often referred to as the soul. The individual ego incarnates, but the soul grows, suffusing our lives. The same thing happens collectively: each generation adds to a deep, collective archetypal structure. This structure is reaching a high energy state, and I think it's coming to a point where the sheer energy of our suffering, despair, and anxiety will drive us through a breaking point. We'll be flooded with a different kind of common sense, different priorities, values, and experiences of each other.</p>
<p>To go as far as we need to save ourselves and the planet, we need to understand the dynamics of the collective unconscious and how fields operate in non-equilibrium systems. This is what comes through my visionary experiences repeatedly. We're approaching a crisis that builds in intensity until it seems all is lost, with disruption, loss of control, and deep challenges. But as it worsens, it starts to pass. We pick ourselves up, rise to the challenge, and are profoundly changed. Emerging from this period of history, we discover a fundamentally new way of being conscious—a new organization of our consciousness. Possibilities will emerge much faster than we predicted. This transformation is the rebirth of humanity. In my work, I call it the birth of the future human—a demarcation of a different kind of human being emerging now.</p>
<p>Our history is creating this phase of reincarnation coming to fruition. We can glimpse the future by looking at the great beings of our past—the saints, prophets, and incarnations like Christ and the Buddhas. These beings are prototypes, leading us toward a higher existence. I think we are becoming a species of Christ, Buddhas, and prophets, with the same magnitude and scale of heart. It's unclear how long the transition will take. The ecological crisis will deepen for generations, at least three or four, before peaking. But we'll come through it, not in thousands of years, but within a few hundred. The 21st century is key—it’s where we’ll make the decisions that shape our future.</p>
<p>In non-equilibrium systems, individual changes can lead to massive outcomes. The metaphor of a butterfly wing in China setting off a hurricane elsewhere illustrates this. The impact of individuals grows exponentially in non-equilibrium systems. Beings who achieve a wholeness within themselves can tremendously catalyze those around them, aiding others in reaching deep experiences as well.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> Thank you. I love listening to you when you go off on a transmission. I was thinking, if you were to ask what one event could change everything quickly on this planet, what might it be? The answer inside me is seeing through the veil of death. The moment one sees through it, fear is no more—it just isn't. The intensification of energy you're talking about, all the suffering and love pouring into this one point, has the power to pierce the veil of death. In my teachings through the Gene Keys, I've seen that more people will experience their consciousness transcend life, birth, and death as this boiling process happens. The consciousness retains memory across these cycles. That's pure awakening. A being at that level emanates enlightenment—it’s contagious, and the transmission of wisdom, love, and awakening electrifies those around them.</p>
<p>As more experience this awakening, the veil will break down, and fear will leave the planet, person by person, generation by generation. Deep inside, I believe this will allow children to be born awake, without carrying humanity’s wounds or having to undergo the same journey. Those children are us—they're our future vehicles. They'll be born through awakened ones, providing clear conduits for enlightened souls to enter. This is how awakened consciousness will colonize the gene pool, like a virus of love, spreading non-denominationally across various places, in unexpected communities. </p>
<p>I recall Jesus saying, "When I return, I will return like a thief in the night." I've pondered this for years, realizing its truth: it's hidden, everywhere, and unstoppable. This new human is among us, sensed by many. One thing I loved in your book, Chris, is the image of all these meditating Buddhas and one human standing among them—the future human. This symbol represents the end of the journey toward spiritual awakening through shadow transformation. That being stands firm, no longer needing practice beyond living. This new humanity starts with layers of creative expansion and playfulness, exploring levels and dimensions through a new way.</p>
<p>As the age of suffering ends, we have a new field: bliss. We've learned enough from suffering—now is our chance to learn from bliss. It's bliss as deep and layered as suffering, with dimensions to explore. Holding onto this during challenging times helps. Remember, 21st century seems pivotal—the one not to miss. It's important to bear these insights as we navigate intense periods.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Let's look deeply into the future of this future human. Whatever transformation we're undergoing, we're giving birth to a new order of human capacity for however long it takes—hundreds of years, if needed. The human story doesn't stop; this is just a new platform for further development. We've evolved through suffering, which has been a great teacher. Now, like our growing understanding of death's role in cosmology, we're moving past these fears. If I could give one thing from my sessions, it would be the loss of fear of death. If you're afraid of death, your cosmology is upside down—it’s graduation, respite, reward.</p>
<p>During this period of transformation, we'll live from bliss and creativity, taking time to unfold these potentials. Nature is leading us through this metamorphosis, much larger than any individual, setting a new beginning. But we’re here for a long time—another million, billion years—so we must look beyond current imaginings. We're on the threshold of birthing a different kind of humanity, establishing a new platform for future evolution. This significant undertaking surpasses just fixing the past; it's a cascading effect into a vastly different future.</p>
<p>If our nature is truly infinite—as Brahman is Atman—reincarnation provides time to unfold and activate our infinite potential. Carefully qualifying my statement, I'd say we are learning to become creators on a scale previously unimagined.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> Indeed. In my understanding, our evolution involves distinct races or species evolving on this planet. We've been through epochs, with continuity breaks so vast we may have forgotten them. Each epoch transcends and remembers more of what came before. This may be humanity's cresting stage, leading to harmony with Gaia, becoming stewards of Gaia, inseparable from all life forms. We've yet to see Gaia in her full flowering. As humans, our roles are to weave back together Gaia's creatures and neurological pathways, unique to each creativity, forming a tapestry of wholeness.</p>
<p>Processes will continue, closing the arc of time until time itself dissolves. A joke of mine is that reaching heaven stops time, offering infinite time. Humanity then transcends, shifting epochs, leaving this sphere. Our consciousness moves elsewhere as animals and rocks rise, interconnected with everything. Consciousness awakens in layers, moving beyond the time-space continuum. We're part of something grander—galactic awareness. Gaia's our playground before entering a galactic realm. These fractal waves of awakening and creativity continue. Staying present, we never leave freedom, even amidst crisis. Our purpose within suffering holds grace and purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> I love hearing you go deeply into this. This earth, part of a galaxy, part of superclusters, participates in a universe interconnected with larger universes. Humanity undergoes tremendous transformation alongside other species throughout the galaxy. Affirming all this, we must pay attention to growth opportunities in our time. We chose our incarnations deliberately, right now, at this birth moment in history. We chose to be here for a positive outcome. So, it's not about finding your path—it's recognizing you're exactly where you can do the most good. Responsibility and action lead to profound alignment, even within suffering.</p>
<p>Turn to deep presence, despite distractions beckoning us elsewhere. By committing fully now, we meet larger opportunities for joy, collaboration, and transformation. The meta universe, pouring energy into the present, meets us in that moment. Heaven, galactic structures, meet us in collaboration with destiny. We began with reincarnation evidence yet our communion with the universe fuels our journey. This deep sharing of divine joy is what we can pursue and let permeate our remaining years. Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> Chris, thank you. There's nothing more to add. I think we've covered it.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> Maybe not here and now, but another place, another time, we'll wind it up and launch. I love our discussions and what happens when we get together.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> Yeah, me too. And I think our various different communities will hopefully come together and explore these things in new and creative ways. That's certainly my intention—to continue this dialog in all kinds of different ways and to invite others into this dialog, to explore, create, and come up with proactive, creative roots forward in the world, depending on what is coming to us. There's a lot of great genius being drawn to these kinds of discussions and communities. When geniuses come together, they are capable of so much. And I know many, many hearts are wanting to come together and be of service, as you said, to be of the greatest service. So I think there will be opportunities for lots of things in the times ahead. I really want to personally thank you for being a great inspiration to me. You're confirming many of my deeply held knowings and matching me along the journey, sometimes just pushing me a little bit further as well. I really appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bache:</strong> And likewise, it works both ways. Much love and blessings in your work. It's just a joy to spend time with you. It truly is—it opens me up. It invites me forward. I receive much from our conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rudd:</strong> Likewise, absolutely.</p>
<p>Audience: ** You.</p>

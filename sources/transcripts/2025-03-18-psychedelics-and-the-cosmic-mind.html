<p>Emmy Vadnais: Hello and welcome. I'm Emmy Vadnais, co-host with Jeffrey Mishlove. Our topic today is psychedelics and the cosmic mind with my guest, Chris Bache, professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University in Ohio, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. Chris is author of four books: Life Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life; Dark Night, Early Dawn; The Living Classroom: Teaching and Collective Consciousness; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven. Chris is joining us from just north of Asheville in Weaverville, North Carolina. Welcome, Chris. It’s a great joy to have you with me on New Thinking Allowed today.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Thank you, Emmy. It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: We’re going to discuss your deep exploration of yourself, your spiritual journey, and the cosmic mind through 73 LSD sessions between 1979 and 1999, which you outline in LSD and the Mind of the Universe. Before we get into what you experienced and learned, can we talk about the last 10-plus years, where the taboo around psychedelics seems to be shifting—the types of psychedelics out there and why people use them? Today we’ll focus specifically on cosmic exploration.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: There is a worldwide renaissance of research taking place in psychedelics. At the forefront of that research is therapeutic healing. That’s what’s bringing psychedelics back into the intellectual and clinical community—the capacity of these amplifying substances to bring forward the personal unconscious, unearth its wounds, and assist, deepen, and accelerate healing from trauma, PTSD, depression, and related issues. A second, overlapping use is promoting spiritual awakening—awakening to our deeper nature beneath the personality and deepening our experience of the wisdom, intelligence, and consciousness of the universe. That’s why I got started: to deepen my spiritual awakening. But the protocol I used was so strong and evocative that within a few years I was having experiences far beyond therapeutic healing or spiritual awakening. Over time, I came to understand I was engaged in cosmological exploration—a systematic attempt to explore the deep structure of spiritual reality, the consciousness of the universe itself. I’m not a clinician; I’m trained as a philosopher of religion. What interested me in Stan Grof’s early work was the capacity of these substances to lay bare not only personal issues but to enter into deep communion with the consciousness behind existence.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Can you give us an overview of the different types of psychedelics, just to list a few? We’ll primarily talk about your experience with LSD.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The primary ones that come to mind are LSD, psilocybin, MDMA—though that’s more an empathogen than a classic psychedelic—5-MeO-DMT, salvia divinorum, and San Pedro. There are derivatives off many of these as well, little tweaks along the way.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: And we should say upfront you’re not recommending that people engage in the same process you did or advocating their use per se. Is that right?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Absolutely. A large percentage of the population shouldn’t be doing psychedelics at all. These are very powerful amplifiers of consciousness with tremendous evocative potential. No one should venture into these waters without really good, high-quality professional guides to keep you safe. My protocol was high doses of LSD—500 to 600 micrograms. Looking back, I think, what was I thinking? That was ridiculous. But I had a deep hunger to explore the nature of existence, and working at these high doses took me on the adventure of a lifetime. Still, it’s very demanding work requiring concentration, safeguards, and a lot of time to assimilate. Knowing what I know now, I strongly recommend against the protocol I used. If I were doing it again, I’d work with lower doses, be much gentler with myself, and peel back the layers more gradually.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: What was the impetus for you to embark on this deep exploration with high doses of LSD?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I had just finished graduate school and started my academic career. I was then a fairly convinced, atheistically inclined agnostic. Then I encountered two people’s work: Ian Stevenson, whose research on reincarnation convinced me it was a simple fact of life; and Stanislav Grof. I read Grof’s Realms of the Human Unconscious in 1978, two years after it came out. I recognized it had tremendous significance not only for psychotherapy but for philosophy of religion and consciousness. I knew that if I was going to make a contribution in this field, I had to undergo my own therapeutic exploration. Very uncomfortably, I decided to break the law in what I hoped was a disciplined, restrained way and began a series of sessions that, much to my surprise, lasted 20 years. I worked for four years, stopped for six, then worked another 10, finishing in 1999. I spent the next 20 years digesting, analyzing, sifting, and sorting these experiences, and then wrote LSD and the Mind of the Universe in 2019, 20 years after I stopped my sessions.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Can you give us a sense of what your sessions were like—how you began, your sitter, and how you set up set and setting?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I followed the protocol established by Stan, reflected in Realms of the Human Unconscious and clarified in LSD Psychotherapy. I was always in a room, separated and protected from the world, with no interruptions—by myself with my sitter, who was my wife at the time, a clinical psychologist who studied the literature with me. I lay down with eye shades and headphones—classic deep introspection—using carefully curated music to support the opening, peak, and closing. The idea is to profoundly energize the unconscious and then create an environment where the energies rising can be engaged cleanly. If you stay in contact with the physical world—dialoguing with friends or going to a concert—that’s fine, but it’s not what this work is about. You amplify the unconscious and create a controlled environment that allows you to follow whatever arises to its very bottom.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: If I recall correctly, it was typically on Saturdays because you had an important day job teaching at a university, and your sessions lasted about eight hours each?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Pretty much. I’d start early morning and finish by late afternoon or nighttime—eight to ten hours with a carryover tail, but a good hard eight hours. It’s a major commitment. I eventually developed spiritual protocols I adopted in the weeks leading up to and following a session—especially the day or two before and after. With very high doses of LSD, you tap into very deep levels of the universe, and it takes time for body, mind, and subtle energy to process. So it’s not just the day of; it’s several days before and after.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: You also took meticulous notes from your sessions, much of which is in your book.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes. The first step of integration is an accurate phenomenological description of exactly what happens. Integration is the foundation of future sessions. If you don’t integrate thoroughly and conscientiously, you’re less likely to have as deep an experience next time. There’s a circle: you open, then you integrate what you experience, which lays the foundation for a deeper opening in your next session.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: It seems like they built upon each other.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: In my experience, they did. I standardized my sessions as much as possible, eliminating variables—same substance, same dose, same set and setting, same sitter, even the same part of the country. Changing variables changes the subtlety of the interface between your mind and the universe’s mind. By standardizing, you create an environment of sustained communion or dialogue with deeper consciousness. Treating that contact point with clarity, my experience was that the consciousness I was engaging took me deeper in a systematic fashion—like a series of graduate courses in consciousness—a rigorous, systematic expansion of my frame of reality.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Why did you choose this path versus, for example, meditation or other spiritual practices that can lead deeper into these realms?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I’d been meditating since college, in a couple traditions, and as a professor of religious studies I had a solid grounding in the world’s spiritual traditions. I taught psychology of religion, transpersonal studies, and comparative mysticism. I initially thought these sessions would help me break through obstacles in my contemplative practice. What I found was a protocol of spiritual exploration that took me deeper than I imagined possible. After a couple of years, I developed an aptitude for working in these states. I never stopped meditating—I always meditated, did yoga, and various practices. In fact, the deeper you want to go with psychedelics, the more important a daily spiritual practice becomes to anchor and absorb what you unleash. Psychedelics gave me access to states you can reach with meditation, but typically only with many lifetimes of practice. I differentiate between the path of temporary immersion—working with psychedelics, immersed for hours at a time—and the path of presence—contemplative presence—which is slower but tends to produce abiding transparency. They’re complementary approaches, but different.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Let’s begin with your very first session, just to give the audience a taste of what led you to keep coming back.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: The most significant thing in my first session was entering a phase where I couldn’t remember who or what I was—what I did for a living, even whether I was a man or a woman. It was a complete interruption of the stream of self-knowledge. Frightening and jarring, but ultimately helpful: it showed me it would be pointless to try to stay in control. If you can’t control your self-knowledge, that’s as basic as it gets. This work requires radical surrender to whatever arises. That lesson saved me time and energy later when more demanding experiences opened. There’s a tendency to hold on to reality as you know it. In this work you have to let go completely and go where it wants to take you. Don’t waste time trying to maintain control.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Before we go further, have you come to understand what LSD is doing to human physiology and the nervous system? Many people think of consciousness as tied to the brain. I recently spoke with Jill Bolte Taylor, the Harvard neuroanatomist who wrote My Stroke of Insight. She described our personal sense of identity as being just the size of a peanut in our brains.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I follow the scientific discussion—the biochemistry of LSD, how it affects brain structure, default mode network interruption, and so on—but I’m not drawn to that conversation. I’m not primarily a scientist. I’ve taken more of a psychological approach: whatever the mechanism, these substances amplify and hypersensitize consciousness, allowing you to experience dimensions of mind—and eventually reality beyond mind—that are usually filtered by our space-time focus.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Where we can feel trapped inside our bodies or what most people consider a primarily materialistic world, which we know is not the whole picture.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Yes. I basically work within the frame I acquired from Stan Grof and earlier researchers, describing the dynamic qualities of psychedelic consciousness. I’ll let the scientists sort out physiology. Often the physiological discussion is carried out within reductive metaphysical assumptions, which isn’t helping our conversation right now.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: You mean the conversation in general—we’re having a good conversation, right?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: I mean attempts to correlate brain physiology with experienced states of consciousness. Those discussions often rest on metaphysical assumptions that lean toward thinking physical reality is the dominant, determining reality of experience. But when you look at what emerges in psychedelics, that restrictive framework is shattered.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: I just wanted to touch on it because some listening may think, “This is just your brain on drugs.” That’s been discussed with near-death experiencers as well, but research shows there’s more going on. We can get into the veracity of these experiences later. Can you take us further into your sessions to give us a taste of what that was like for you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That’s hard because of context. Some very influential books were based on a limited number of psychedelic experiences. Aldous Huxley wrote The Doors of Perception after one mescaline experience. Huston Smith wrote his reflections after taking LSD six times. Michael Pollan’s helpful book was also after a handful of experiences. The challenge with my work is how long the journey was and how many layers of consciousness opened. It’s not simply opening 73 times to the same interface. There’s a cycle of death and rebirth that reproduces itself. Death breaks you free of one level of reality—physical reality initially—and takes you into a nonphysical spiritual reality. You work there for a while, and if you work consistently, you go through another death and rebirth into another level, where you learn that level’s rules, and so on. Focusing on any one level leaves out many others. Eventually, when putting the whole together, I distinguished five broad categories my sessions fell into: personal mind—your personal unconscious and story; collective mind—the collective psyche, humanity’s species mind; archetypal mind—which for me was more Platonic than Jungian, dimensions outside time and space and outside the collective psyche; causal levels of reality—where oneness becomes the dominant reality; and beyond that, diamond luminosity—a particularly clear dimension of light I worked with in the last five years. My experiences lay out as a sequential journey from personal mind to collective mind, archetypal mind, and so forth.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: I’d love to discuss each of those levels. What I recall as common themes were letting go, and a lot of pain and suffering to reach deeper levels of consciousness. Can you share what that was like for you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: In the early stage at the level of personal mind, the pain and suffering took the form Stan Grof discusses as the perinatal level—sometimes reliving birth and confronting the fundamental existential questions of life in physical reality. Is there meaning, order, design, intelligence? At the physical level, everything we love will be destroyed at death. Is there any reality beyond death? You have to face the deepest levels of metaphysical angst until your identity is crushed and shattered. That’s easier for some than others, but you must surrender your time-space identity to gain access to the next level. At that next level, I continued a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence—so deep and prolonged, encompassing so many hundreds of thousands of persons over thousands of years, that I concluded it wasn’t a cleansing of my personal psyche. Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective. Then further deaths and rebirths followed, where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness with God or the mind of the universe, our historical consciousness is too small—if you want to literally experience it, not just think it. To immerse yourself in communion with these levels, your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity. Eventually you enter levels where it would misrepresent things to say “Chris Bache went and had those experiences.” Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved, for these levels of consciousness to manifest inside my awareness. The fact that I remember them doesn’t mean my personality was present when they were had. You lose yourself, enter communion with the universe, and when you come back you gather the experiences, and my personality synthesizes and integrates them. It’s a pulsing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: What are some of the teachings you received?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped in Western religious and philosophical traditions. Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Going back to your experiences, it seems that death, rebirth, and a purification process happened in many, if not all, of your sessions. What did you come to understand was the reason for that?</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: First, the general structure of the sessions, as you experienced them—what did that look like?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: Every session had a rhythm, with variations. The early hours were spent in a deep purification process—intense confrontation. If you surrender to it, it reaches a culmination: a death-rebirth process. Then you’re spun into transpersonal, ecstatic places for the remainder of the session, and that runs its course. The next session—no matter how many months apart; I averaged about five a year—starts you right back in purification and carries you forward into the ecstatic portion.</p>
<p>The purpose of the purification and the purpose of the death is simply cleaning—just cleaning. When you eventually come to a deep experience of your fundamental identity—your divine, infinite nature—it gives you a different perspective on what kept you from realizing it all those years. It’s the tight conditioning of the psyche associated with time-space consciousness. That has to be softened and released to move into these expansive places.</p>
<p>So the death-rebirth cycle is actually a purification cycle. I learned that death is an intense stage of purification. Once you’ve died many times, you learn it’s impossible to die. What you are cannot die. The structure of your life can die. Reality as you have known it can die. But the phoenix always rises: the essence of the person emerges in a different reality with new potentials and capacities. The form can die, but the essence cannot. Once you know that, you understand that the experience of death—which kept coming up in my sessions—was an advanced stage of purification. When purification reaches a critical point and begins dissolving the fundamental structures of what you had known as real, you hit the death-and-rebirth point, and death comes back to grace you again.</p>
<p>From my perspective, experiencing death or even horrendous suffering in a psychedelic session is an exciting stage in the work. It’s not something to avoid. People worry about having a “bad” session, but I think that’s a misunderstanding of the depth of consciousness and the power of this technique. The deeper the purification, the deeper the ecstatic immersion. You begin to welcome the purification, the challenges—even the “bad” sessions—to actualize a more intimate experience with divine consciousness. That assumes a completely controlled environment and thorough preparation. You can have a bad session for bad reasons—wrong place, wrong time, poor set and setting. Those are not what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: I’ll share that when I was in high school, some friends wanted to do LSD, and I didn’t partake; I was the sitter to help everyone have a good experience, which they did. But you’ve said a “bad trip” isn’t necessarily bad—it can be part of the process, provided one has prepared and knows what they’re getting into.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: Psychedelics amplify consciousness. Some people take them looking for a good afternoon: a little more openness to life and love. They keep the fundamental parameters of their personality, just softer and more expansive, which is perfectly fine. But if you want a deep dive—exploring the deep structure of existence, transcending space and time, moving into the deep future—that requires a carefully laid-out strategy. I’m not suggesting my way is the only beneficial way. As a philosopher, I was looking for depth of immersion and understanding, and that takes serious work.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: While we’re on death and rebirth—surrender and purification—what is it that dies and is reborn? I know you outline a few areas in your book.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: This became a real intellectual issue for me. When you experience dying and being reborn through multiple levels of reality, it raises the question: what is actually dying? You can have deep experiences of dying years after ego-death, and it’s not simply the ego dying over and over. It’s a different kind of death.</p>
<p>In the appendix of LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I suggest four levels to begin addressing that question. First, our personal ego can die. Second, some aspect of the collective ego—the collective psyche—can die. Third, what I call the shamanic persona can die. That’s a complicated concept. When you’ve been on the journey a long time, each time you move into psychedelic space, you resume your shamanic persona—the living integration of all your psychedelic experiences to that point. Let’s say, after 20 sessions working at the level of the collective psyche, what I called the ocean of suffering, you stabilize a psychedelic identity that integrates your transpersonal experiences beyond physical consciousness. If you are going into a still deeper level of consciousness than you’ve ever lived before, that shamanic persona has to die—surrender—to allow a new category of experience, and a deeper shamanic persona, to emerge. So in advanced sessions, it’s not the egoic self dying; it’s the psychedelic self.</p>
<p>Fourth—and this is more subtle—what dies is some dimension of consciousness itself. In my late work at very deep levels of divine communion, I had the experience that the divine level I was in would come to a crescendo and open into a higher level of divine communion than had been actualized up to that point. Sri Aurobindo says the Divine looking down sees all the levels it has manifested, but it’s a one-way mirror: we, as the Divine looking up, tend to see only the level we’re at. That means even at deep levels there are aspects of divine consciousness that cannot see still deeper levels. Somehow, when we do this work, we can facilitate a communion between two different levels of divine consciousness, far beyond space-time and personal reality. There is a celebratory joy when the Divine wakes up to a still deeper level of itself—when the higher infuses itself more deeply into the lower. So one way of thinking about what dies in very advanced stages is that some aspect of divine consciousness itself is transformed.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: And yet, according to your experiences, that death precipitates a rebirth—with consciousness itself as well? The Divine itself?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: Yes—though we’re rushing into an area where angels fear to tread.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: We’re trying to put language to experiences that many, like near-death experiencers, often call “ineffable.” I understand there’s a language barrier.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: There is, but for me the bigger issue is laying the foundation—putting the prerequisites in place—so people can understand the language needed to describe these phenomena. It’s not everyday language or experience; it requires a conceptual reframing to describe realities far beyond our ordinary sensate life.</p>
<p>In many ways, it’s not that different from near-death experiences. I feel the greatest correspondence and collegiality with people who’ve had deep NDEs, because those are the closest correlate to my deep psychedelic work. If you work with psychedelics in a focused way over long periods, you can access the same dimensions of consciousness that someone accesses in a Near-Death Experience (NDE). The difference is that most people have an NDE only once in their life. With sustained psychedelic work, you can go back multiple times, and because you can, you’re taught more nuances about how this all works in the interplay of consciousness.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Can you help expand the conceptual framework a bit—what that experience has been like for you?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: Let me narrow it to one example. Four or five years into the work, I began to get systematic access to archetypal reality. Every time I entered a session, I entered a level of reality I knew was more real than space-time—the primary reality. Space-time was secondary. I encountered vast beings I couldn’t wrap my mind around, beings responsible for creating space-time and its fundamental conditions. To access these realities, everything I knew about human history and thought had to fall away. The entire collective psyche had to fall away to enter levels that humanity as a whole has not experienced, or only very few have.</p>
<p>Even in archetypal reality, you’re dealing with profound consciousness, but there’s still dualism—a sense of self and other. When I went beyond archetypal reality into causal reality, all dualisms dissolved. You experience the world—whatever aspect you’re encountering—as a unified, single entity, a single consciousness. Plotinus says, “The world breathes as one.” There’s a radical transparency where you encounter the wholeness of life that doesn’t negate differentiation; it affirms it, as different manifestations of a single, undivided whole we call God, the Divine, or the One. That’s a different category of experience altogether from archetypal reality.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Why is it termed archetypal reality for those unfamiliar with archetypes?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: I use “archetype” in two senses. Jung talked about archetypes as primary themes of human experience that become concretized in forms—wise old man, wise old woman, trickster, shadow—the dominant themes of the collective psyche. The second sense is Platonic: Plato’s discovery of a level of reality beyond time and space altogether.</p>
<p>I experienced both, though not as Plato described them. He thought of archetypes as unchanging prototypes within the mind of an unchanging, infinite being. I experienced them as living entities—but living on a vast scale of time and space far beyond anything we know within time and space. What is shared is that for something to manifest in time and space, it comes out of the oneness through these fundamental intermediate structures—super-intelligent, super-powerful—focusing energy down into manifestation.</p>
<p>When I experienced the collective psyche and a lower level of archetypes in Jung’s sense, I didn’t meet “wise old man” figures. It’s not that I don’t think those exist, but what I experienced was humanity as a single organism, over and over, with metameridians that wove our individual lives into the life of the species. Our minds are woven into the collective mind—there are seed crystals within it. Even our bodies and diseases are part of the body of humanity evolving over long periods. So “archetypal” here means trans-individual motifs within the human psyche. In the Platonic sense, there are metaphysical archetypes that inform the manifestation of time and space itself.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: At the causal level, you mentioned this is where you connect with divine intelligence, or what we perceive as God. People may wonder: did you discover that there is a God?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: I tend not to prefer “God” language because I know the history of world religions—the theologies, cultural limitations, abuses, and crimes committed in the name of God. I’m not talking about anything like that. I use “the Divine,” but even that carries time-space assumptions. On the one hand, I want to affirm that there is a profound generative intelligence manifesting as time and space—that time and space are not independent of the Divine but, in classic Hindu thinking, are the manifestation of the Divine’s body. I affirm a very wide vision of the Divine. But because I’ve gone so deeply into the future and beyond space and time so many times, my sense of this cosmic principle can’t fit inside the theologies of the world’s religions. It’s much larger. I can call it God, but then I have to qualify: it’s not this, not that—not what you mean by God here or there.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: In the monotheistic traditions, many think of God as an individual being in whose form we’re made. Did you connect with a being or beings—angels or other divine entities? What was that realm like?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: In all the years of work, I never encountered a divine being who said, “I’m God.” It wasn’t like that. I would enter deeper levels of consciousness and experience communion with a consciousness that knew me, taught me, showed me things, crushed me, and brought me forward into still deeper levels. I would internalize the energy of those levels. I was with this consciousness, but it never crystallized into a personality of God. It kept getting larger, deeper, more vast.</p>
<p>I think many theologies of God are based on early encounters with an infinite intelligence far too large to be concretized in the historical lineages of world traditions. It’s infinite. In the deepest level I entered—the diamond Luminosity, which occupied me for the last five years—when I was dissolved in the luminous “body” of the Divine, my visual field suddenly turned 90 degrees. A window opened, and I saw reality far in the distance with a light in it. A beam of light came out of that reality and hit me. Even in the diamond Luminosity, this light was so powerful it shattered my mind. It took minutes to recover. That’s when I realized: it’s an infinite progression. The Divine is truly infinite. Even using this powerful method, I would never reach the end.</p>
<p>When I began, I thought the purpose was to reach a final state—enlightenment, oneness with God, the primal void. I had known oneness with God at many levels and entered the primal void several times, learning there are different depths of the void. Now I understand it’s not about reaching an endpoint that magically transforms your life. It’s about opening and letting the love and intelligence of the universe—the Divine—into you, as much as you can bring in, hold, and distill into the fabric of your earthly existence. It’s about deepening the ongoing communion between ourselves in time and space and this larger spiritual reality.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Very beautiful. Can you share more about the diamond Luminosity?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: Light surfaces many times in psychedelic work. Every time you go through death-rebirth, people often encounter light in many forms. I had encountered it at many levels. After ego-death, after the ocean of suffering, after archetypal and causal realities—about 15 years in—I had been given so many spiritual treasures that I felt existentially satisfied. I had experienced radical Shunyata—emptiness of self—oneness of all existence. Then I went through yet another death-rebirth cycle and accessed a dimension of light so pure and clear it stunned me. It became my sole objective to return.</p>
<p>Once you touch what I’m calling the diamond Luminosity, it’s so far beyond anything I’d previously touched that I lost interest in archetypal or causal realities. I wanted to get back there. It is breathtakingly pure, and the associated ecstasy is staggering. Over the next five years—26 sessions, one-third of my entire journey—I accessed it only four more times. Between those sessions were deep purification, more learning, more teaching.</p>
<p>As I look at the world’s spiritual literature—Buddhist literature is what I know best—they call this Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality, the foundational reality of time and space. All galaxies, the Big Bang—everything emerges out of this crystalline light. It is pre-samsaric—an extra-samsaric reality outside the cycle of space and time, outside physical reality, and outside the bardos of postmortem existence. Touch it once and you’re hopelessly in love with it. It illumines everything. I understood the Buddhist claim that a single touch can undo hundreds of years of living in the shadows of karma, because its impact is so penetrating and transformative. Just touching it changes your understanding of existence and what it means to be alive.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Is this also what you refer to in your book as the Beloved?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: Everyone has to find a word for this transcendent reality. Some say God, the Divine, the Absolute; Taoism calls it the eternal Dao; Jewish mysticism calls it Ein Sof, the great nothingness. I call it my Beloved because, in a path of temporary immersion, you move into intimacy with this reality and then come back out—over and over. It becomes like a love relationship, but one that dissolves the “bodies” of the two beings. The communion is profound.</p>
<p>I adopted the vocabulary that felt natural: the Beloved. It manifests at early, middle, and advanced stages. In the end, you recognize you’re always in dialogue with a profound creative intelligence which, interestingly, feels more like a “she” to me than a “he.” I associate the feminine side of God with creation, and the masculine with radical transcendence. The primal One divides into two: one stays outside space-time; the other manifests space-time and all life within it. For me, the Beloved is the feminine side of the Divine—the Divine Mother.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: Yes—light is a theme in your experiences. How much of a role did love play for you?</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mishlove: Eventually, a very large role. In some sessions I was blessed with experiences of cosmic love—not like anything I’ve ever known. It shattered and overwhelmed me. I experienced that existence was generated not only by sheer power—think of the Big Bang—but by love, a profound cosmic love. The act of creation itself is love—not anything like human love, but the very fiber of the Divine. You can think of love and oneness as two sides of reality: if the world is truly one, love is the emotion of oneness—oneness asserting itself in a world of duality.</p>
<p>This surprised me. Of the four yogas in Hinduism—Yana (the path of knowledge), Raja (meditation), Karma, and Bhakti (loving devotion)—bhakti was the one I identified with the least. I’ve always been more intellectually and meditatively oriented, not bhakti oriented. And yet I began to have profound bhakti experiences that led me to speak of the Beloved in a lover’s vocabulary.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: How much is love the fabric of the Divine?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Anything I say at this point is going to be inadequate to the reality itself. Please forgive my hubris in daring to describe the nature of the Divine. We could describe the divine nature as infinite knowledge, infinite power, infinite love—all equally true—and I’m sure there are other qualities we could add. The challenge of understanding the love aspect of the Divine is that life, as we experience it, is often dirty, nasty, mean, and cruel. Any suggestion that the world, with all of its pain and suffering, is a manifestation of a supremely loving consciousness is horrendously difficult to reconcile, and I understand that as a philosopher of religion. The only way of overcoming that challenge is to understand the deep structure, the deep intentionality manifesting in creation—in our evolving universe, in the project of the universe. You have to radically expand your time horizon. The human condition, as we currently know it, is just a small dot in a long developmental process that has been going on for 13.7 billion years and will continue for 13.7 billion more. As Sri Aurobindo said, we are a transitional species, actualizing ourselves within a long developmental trajectory.</p>
<p>If we think, “Well, God must not be real, because I could have done a better job creating a universe—one where children don’t die and terrible things don’t happen,” that assumes we know what the divine intention is, what the project of existence is. We are like children in a playpen, just beginning to get a grip on the enormity of the project of existence. Really since Hubble and modern cosmology, we’re beginning to understand the size, depth, and texture of it. I think psychedelics are like the Hubble of psychological insight; they give us experiential access to the depths in which consciousness exists. That only gets us to the beginning of beginning to comprehend the project. What will humanity be 5 billion years from now? A million years from now? Even 100,000 years from now? The Divine seems to think on that scale. We have to stretch ourselves to think on that scale.</p>
<p>So the problem of suffering really challenges our understanding of the role of love in the divine nature. But once we have experiential access to some of the deeper trajectories of the Divine intent, things begin to make more sense. I think the Divine is creating a masterpiece. Refined, elevated, potentiated human experience is a masterpiece of creation that takes thousands, millions, billions of years to orchestrate and bring forward—especially since it’s not being done to us. We intentionally cooperate and participate in this creative process. It’s something we carry forward in the very fiber of our being. We have to grasp the scale of things to even begin to understand our present circumstances.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
At the same time, it sounds like you found that Atman is Brahman—that we are part of the Divine, and the Divine is part of us.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes—and there’s very little that’s new in the experiences I lay out. The vision of reality, the cosmology that emerges out of psychedelic work, is fundamentally the same as what emerges out of the deepest, most refined levels of the world’s mystical traditions. We’re not bringing something radically new to the table. What we have is a different protocol, a different strategy for accessing these very deep levels of reality, which yield deep insights into the structure of existence. But you’ll find the same fundamental cosmology in the great spiritual traditions.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
Since you brought up the Hubble telescope, and we’ve been talking about consciousness, what did you discover about our universe—the physical universe, space, outer space? Did you traverse that aspect in your sessions?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I wasn’t taken on journeys into our galaxy or other galaxies—that just wasn’t part of the work for me. Other people may have those experiences. I was given a session I called the “Cosmic Tour,” where I was shown many things, much of which I couldn’t reproduce when I came back into time-space consciousness, because I didn’t have the vocabulary or intellectual tools to articulate them. I’ve often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics to better articulate some of what I was given. But I didn’t spend a lot of time traveling within time and space. It was more a matter of going underneath time and space and into the underlying deep structure that informs our experience.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
I recall in your book that you were shown the universe goes on and on, essentially. Is that right?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
There are two different models: one is that it’ll keep expanding forever; the other is that it reaches a maximum expansion and then contracts—a pulsating universe expanding and contracting, then re-expanding. I don’t have an answer to that question. Clearly, the universe is on a tear, going on for billions and billions of years. That’s a deflating insight if you think a human being is simply a 100-year-old being; then we’re sand on the beach beside the ocean—we don’t get to participate in that deep future. But if reincarnation is true—and I think there’s plenty of factual evidence that it is—and if our essence is indestructible, and we roll over what we’ve learned into continued learning over thousands and millions of years, then we actually get to participate in this divine unfolding. It’s our future. We are co-participants—eternal participants—in this eternal process.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
In your experiences, you talked about the birth of the future human. Can you shed a little light on what that is about?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
There’s a chapter in the book called “The Birth of the Future Human.” I think it may be the most important chapter, and it completely surprised me. I thought my work was a personal journey—healing, awakening. Then it broadened into an individual’s insight into the deep structure of our lives. But starting around 1990 through 1995, I began receiving a series of internally consistent visions about humanity’s evolutionary destiny: where we were in our journey, that we were coming to a turning point, a crescendo that would catalyze a tremendous transformation inside humanity—a true before-and-after moment in time. A profound spiritual transformation was coming to a head. This kept repeating itself in my work in different ways, but I didn’t know how the universe was going to pull it off.</p>
<p>About a year and a half later, in the middle of the Diamond Luminosity work—so at a very deep level—I was taken far into the future. I had died and dissolved into the human psyche. So when I say I was taken into the future, it’s not so much that Chris Bache was taken; it’s as the human family. I experienced the human family in a trans-temporal, time-expanded state and, in an accelerated way, the death and rebirth of the entire human family. I experienced a profound geopolitical crisis seeded by cascading ecological crises—a fundamental loss of control, an unraveling of life at the basic level. A global crisis so deep that no one could isolate or protect themselves from it. It was going to bring humanity to our collective knees.</p>
<p>But just when the crisis reached its peak, we moved through it. There was a beginning of a lightening. When we picked ourselves up in the post-crisis period, we discovered we had been profoundly changed. Something had opened us at the very center of our being. One way of talking about it is the birth of oneness. Oneness, instead of being a private mystical experience for a select few, was born within the human psyche as a whole. We tapped certain depths of our nature that allowed us to stop being enemies with each other. The divisions of history—race, class, religion, national identity—were transcended. We began to experience a fundamental oneness at the core of our life and all life. This led to a creativity that reinforced itself as we created new social forms and structures.</p>
<p>Over time, I came to understand pressure was building in the collective psyche, taking humanity through a collective death-rebirth process—an irreversible shift in the collective psyche. I think of it as a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche, so any child born after the transition would operate within a psychic field fundamentally different, more elevated, more spiritually informed than what we’ve known. This isn’t simply a crisis with economic, industrial, political, or civic ramifications; it’s a revolution in the fundamental structure of the human psyche—a revolution in human nature.</p>
<p>I think we’ve entered this process. We’re in the very early stages. The 21st century will be pivotal in going through this transformative crisis. I wasn’t given names, dates, places—what I was given was the core experience of what it will feel like to go through a collective dark night of the soul, a collective ordeal that awakens an underlying revolution in the human psyche, a spiritual opening. I’m not alone in this insight; many spiritual teachers, indigenous people, and psychedelicists have tapped into it. It’s a flow of history we can tap in different ways. Mystical traditions have glimpsed this dynamic. We’re at a critical turning point, and the 21st century is pivotal. If we just look at the scientific data on the ecological crisis—well, I won’t go into the science—but clearly we cannot continue operating on Earth the way we have. We don’t have enough resources. Inequality is too extreme. I don’t think we can continue to govern the Earth out of the psychological structure of the ego. The ego is magnificent, but fundamentally divided and cut off from the foundation of existence and from each other. We need to evolve into a post-egoic level of consciousness to have the wisdom to rise to the challenges the ego has created over its multi-thousand-year history. I think we will. We’re going to go through unbelievable suffering in the centuries ahead, but I believe we come through it, because that’s the nature of my experience. Humanity does make this evolutionary—</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
Pivot? Well, I know there’s more you can share about this topic, and we’ll do a whole other conversation about the birth of the future human—and reincarnation. Can you share why you stopped these LSD sessions in 1999?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I talk about this in the last chapter, “Coming Off the Mountain,” and I boil it down to two reasons: pain and heartache. Psychedelic states open you to huge flows of energy. It takes years to manage them. I realized I was running so hot that even months after a session, I was permanently uncomfortable in my body because of the energy running in my subtle energy system—my Qi, my Prana. That told me it was time to let my body calm down and find a new equilibrium.</p>
<p>But the main reason was heartache. Once you dissolve into the Divine Light, into Diamond Luminosity, into the crystalline nature of consciousness at a very deep level, coming back into time and space is difficult. You lose your zest for living inside time and space when you know how much more is available outside of it. Going in and coming out, again and again, became too painful. Eventually, my beloved and I agreed I would not return to these states until I could stay there forever. That lies behind my stopping. I had to focus on internalizing the gifts I’d already been given, rather than trying to acquire more.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
You’ve been in communication with Stanislav Grof and Ralph Metzner, pioneers in psychedelics and consciousness exploration. Have you shared your experiences with them, and what have they shared with you?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I’ve been in dialogue with both. I shared my sessions with Stan, and he quotes from them in his books—sometimes anonymously, later identified as mine. Stan graciously wrote a beautiful foreword to my book Dark Night, Early Dawn, my first major book on psychedelic theory. Our projects are different but complementary. Stan is a therapist and world healer; he’s worked with thousands of individuals and organized thousands of session reports into an understanding of the vast landscape of these states. My work has been an individual journey, penetrating deeper and deeper into the universe. Ralph, whom I love dearly and who has since transitioned, gave me feedback on LSD in the Mind of the Universe before I published it. I consider them close colleagues and good friends.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
So they were supportive of your process?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
Of course people listening may ask, How much can we trust these experiences? I know you had a correspondence with Kenneth Ring, cofounder of the International Association for Near-Death Studies. What can you share about that and the trustworthiness of your experiences?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
That’s a really important question. How do we know we aren’t simply exploring some hidden corner of my personal unconscious—or even the collective psyche? I understand how radical my assertions sound. How do we know we can trust these experiences to be what I suggest? Ken Ring and I had a dialogue about this. He’s a wonderful scholar and a good friend. After he read LSD in the Mind of the Universe, we exchanged letters on precisely this issue: How trustable are deep psychedelic experiences? How do we know they aren’t better understood as manifestations of the personal or collective psyche, rather than having the metaphysical, ontological ramifications I attribute to them?</p>
<p>Ken worked me over pretty hard—asking hard questions, which I loved. We decided the dialogue was worth sharing, so we wrote an essay called “Are Deep Psychedelic Experiences Trustable?” and published it online; if you Google that title, you’ll find it. In it, I address the issue directly and bring in other people’s experiences that provide levels of objective verification. Many psychedelic experiences yield verifiable data because they relate to events in time and space. The deeper cosmological experiences cannot be verified in that way, but the existence of verifiable experiences lends credibility to the deeper ones. I bring in a lot of evidence in the footnotes and literature speaking to the trustability question.</p>
<p>Most of our doubt is understandable, but it often comes from not having personal experience of these states and from trying to understand them within a metaphysical framework based on physical sensation and ordinary mental experience. The framework is smaller than it needs to be. It’s like near-death experiences: we needed tens of thousands published before the medical community began to take them seriously. They didn’t want to interpret them as indications of spiritual reality; they wanted a purely physical explanation. I think that’s true for psychedelics too. We need a more sophisticated ontology—metaphysical understanding—to even have a framework for these experiences. That’s why I didn’t rush into print. After stopping in ’99, I spent 20 years digesting, analyzing, looking at others’ experiences and metaphysical systems, putting the pieces of the puzzle together before publishing LSD in the Mind of the Universe.</p>
<p>What we want is not just one person’s experiences, but a critical protocol involving many people’s experiences—putting everything on the table to find what’s idiosyncratic and what’s common ground. We’re in the early stages. Psychedelics aren’t going away; we’ll be using them for decades and centuries. The challenge of collective verification of the visions that emerge in these states is just getting started.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
It sounds like you’re suggesting we need more research in this area, which can be tricky because of taboo and legalities—though studies on psilocybin and other psychedelics suggest that’s beginning to shift.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I think it is beginning to shift. The psychedelic community is demonstrating, with increasingly convincing research, that these substances have tremendous power to heal—that’s what’s bringing them back into public discussion. Over time, we’ll find that the same amplifying qualities that allow for therapeutic impact, if we continue to apply these methodologies, open deeper and deeper levels of consciousness. When we get deep enough, we begin to harvest the philosophical and cosmological significance. I gave a talk at the Herodotus conference at Oxford last fall called “Seizing the Philosophical and Cosmological Significance of Psychedelics.” We’re not there yet, but we’re going there.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
Well, Chris, I know this is a very large topic, and I’m excited we’ll have another conversation. Is there anything you want to share today about psychedelics and the cosmic mind?</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
I want to return to the cautionary words we shared at the beginning. This is deep, challenging, demanding work. You don’t try to climb Mount Everest without the best equipment and guides. You don’t go deep into the psyche without the best equipment and context. I affirm the importance of a rigorous protocol—first to survive the encounter, and then to distill experiences into increasingly clear, articulate insights that aren’t lost. Once you’ve taken the cautions and done your due diligence, I think we’re at the cusp of a new chapter in the philosophy of consciousness and our understanding of existence. Why is human existence the way it is? What’s going on underneath the surface? What is the nature of the intelligence manifesting the body of the universe and the intelligence manifesting inside our hearts and minds over time? This is the beginning of a whole new chapter of philosophical and spiritual reflection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I want to leave your viewers with a sense of excitement about this pivot point—a profound deepening of our understanding and experience of the deep structures of reality, and the opportunity to enter into conscious communion with the source of our existence. Previously, this may have been the privileged domain of very advanced contemplatives, but now we have a new modality that allows even ordinary human beings to have a touch-taste of these experiences, which can be life-changing.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
And for people to know the risks and the benefits, because each person might have a different response to these substances.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Yes. There are screening criteria—and more criteria being developed—to make sure people who do this work are safe, and that only those who should do this work, do this work.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
Chris Bache, thank you so much for being with me today—thank you for going beyond the beyond and bringing it back for all of us. I’ve really enjoyed our conversation and look forward to our next one.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: 
Thank you, Emmy. I’ve enjoyed our conversation too. Thank you for the work you’re doing. We need all the wisdom we can get in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais: 
Yes—and for those watching or listening, thank you for being with us, because you are the reason we are here. Book three in the New Thinking Allowed dialogue series is UFOs and UAP: Are We Really Alone? Now available on Amazon.</p></body></html>

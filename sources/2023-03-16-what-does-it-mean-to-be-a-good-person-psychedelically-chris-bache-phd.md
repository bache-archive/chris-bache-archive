**Abstract**

In this excerpt from *Adventures Through the Mind*, Chris Bache reflects on what it means to be

a “good person” from the vantage of deep psychedelic practice. He describes moments in which a

transparent oneness opens—feet rooted in the earth like a tree, intimacy with grass, and a living

sense that all beings share one breath. From that ground, harming anyone feels unthinkable and

helping everyone simply arises. Goodness, he suggests, is a compass pointing toward oneness, with

compassion, fairness, and justice as its fractal expressions. The host presses on the challenge of

enactment and integration—how fleeting experiences become lived ethics when ordinary life resumes.

Bache answers with humility: constant self-checking, recommitment, apprenticing to better examples,

and practicing within community (sangha). Integration is lifelong work; progress is gradual, and

family reliably punctures spiritual pretensions. Humor and realism temper the ideals throughout.

**HOST:** Given where we are, and given your deep psychedelic work, what does it mean to be a good

person right now? What does it take?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yeah, that’s a large question. Many ways to answer it pop into my mind, and all of

them are wrong, so I’m sifting through layers. *\[applause\]*

**CHRIS BACHE:** In some of my deepest experiences, something falls away and something opens. I

experience the world truly as living and breathing as one. My feet feel rooted in the earth the way

a tree is rooted. I look down at the grass and feel complete continuity of being—different species

sharing the same moment in time, the pulse of the universe in utter simplicity.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In that transparency of being, my mind opens into a delicious sense of presence,

an intimacy even with grass. My heart opens, and the idea of harming anyone is the farthest thing

from my mind. Helping everyone is the most natural thing in the world. It’s not “being good”; it’s

being alive in oneness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Goodness is a compass needle pointing toward that fundamental truth of oneness. Its

derivatives—compassion, fairness, justice—are fractal manifestations of oneness in circumstance.

**CHRIS BACHE:** So, what does it take today? A commitment to serving a good that isn’t private—a

collective good that includes future generations and species unlike us. It’s an honest confrontation

with what is, to bring about a better life for other beings.

**CHRIS BACHE:** At its essence it’s simple; enacting it is complicated. If action isn’t grounded in

oneness, maybe there’s something not to trust in it. My deepest answer is frankly mystical: in

oneness, goodness just arises—like the spontaneous upwelling you feel when you encounter beauty.

**HOST:** I have a joking and a serious response. The joke is: should we all just take 500 mics of

LSD? The serious part is about the dance of enactment. I’ve had that oneness, and yet most of the

time I’m not there. A deep experience doesn’t automatically make a deep person. How do we remember?

How do we catch ourselves forgetting? Maybe this is a question about integration.

**CHRIS BACHE:** We go up the mountain, receive blessings, and then Monday morning we go to work.

Over and over, it means engaging how we’re showing up, checking ourselves, and recommitting to do

better—again and again.

**CHRIS BACHE:** For me, much of it played out in teaching. I loved being with students, always

wanting to do better, and constantly catching myself—making assumptions, drawing false inferences,

being tired and letting them down one day—then coming back to do better the next day, next week,

next semester.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Integration is rightly getting more attention, but the term only carries us so far.

It’s hard to live our visions. It commits us to sustained awareness of how poorly we’re embodying

what we know to be true—and to keep trying anyway.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Being around genuinely good people helps. Their example makes it easier to face our

shortcomings: “They’re doing this better; I can learn.” In Buddhism, spiritual friends—sangha—are a

pillar of progress.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Practice and practice and practice. Ten years later, maybe we’re in it a little

more; ten years after that, a little more. And if we ever think we’re there, ask our young children.

They’ll set us straight. *\[laughter\]*

**HOST:** Or, as Ram Dass quipped, if you think you’re enlightened, go spend a week with your

parents. *\[music\]*

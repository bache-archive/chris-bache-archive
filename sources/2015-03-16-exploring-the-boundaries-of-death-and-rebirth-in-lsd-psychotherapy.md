**Abstract**

In this talk honoring Stanislav Grof, CHRIS BACHE reflects on a twenty-year journey with high-dose LSD (1979–1999) and examines why death and rebirth become so prominent, why they repeat, and what is actually dying in psychedelic therapy. He recounts early perinatal crises that shattered his identity and opened a profound immersion in the feminine, followed by years of collective anguish that seemed to encompass human history. Reassessing his earlier framework in Dark Night, Early Dawn, Bache proposes that death–rebirth is an archetypal wheel that turns at successive depths—personal, collective, and transpersonal—with each “death” functioning as radical purification and gateway. He introduces the “shamanic persona” to explain how state-specific identities form and must themselves surrender as deeper realities open. Drawing on Rupert Sheldrake, Rick Tarnas, Sri Aurobindo, and Grof, he suggests the cosmos uses such openings for species-level healing and divine communion.

**HOST:** Good morning. I have the joy of introducing our first speaker and one of my most influential teachers. CHRIS BACHE is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for over thirty years in psychology of religion, transpersonal studies, Buddhism, and Eastern religions. He served as Director of Transformative Learning at the Institute of Noetic Sciences and is adjunct faculty at CIIS, where his classes feel like sacred, transformative containers. His publications include Life Cycles, The Living Classroom, and Dark Night, Early Dawn. This morning he will speak on exploring the boundaries of death and rebirth in LSD psychotherapy. Please join me in welcoming CHRIS. *\[applause\]* *\[music\]* *\[applause\]* *\[music\]*

**CHRIS BACHE:** Good morning, everyone. It is a joy to join you in celebrating Stan Grof’s extraordinary lifetime as scholar, healer, and pioneer. Like many here, Stan changed the direction of my professional and personal life. The turning point came in 1978. I had just finished graduate school in philosophy of religion as an atheistically inclined agnostic and begun my academic career, unknowingly in my Saturn return. I read Realms of the Human Unconscious and, in that one reading, found my life’s work.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I became convinced that the most significant contributions to philosophy of religion would be written from deep experiential foundations, not merely conceptual speculation. Here was a rigorous methodology for exploring the psyche, grounded in solid scholarship. I trusted it. I chose to begin what became a twenty-year journey of high-dose LSD work from 1979 to 1999. What I share today grows out of trying to understand those experiences. My life has never been the same. How do you thank someone for a gift like that?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The experience of dying and being reborn is central to holotropic and psychedelic work and also deeply puzzling. I will address three questions: Why does death become as large as it sometimes does in psychedelic therapy? Why does death repeat itself so many times? And what, in fact, is dying?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I will also revise the discussion of death–rebirth I gave in Dark Night, Early Dawn, because I now find it incomplete. I can only give bullet points here; a fuller article appears in a recent two-volume anthology edited by Harold Ellens, which includes many speakers from this gathering. *\[slides\]*

**CHRIS BACHE:** First: Why does death become so large in LSD psychotherapy? My first two years focused on the perinatal level of consciousness. Sessions were filled with classic perinatal symptomatology—existential confrontation, convulsive seizures, and fetal motifs—culminating in a death–rebirth that snapped my identity like a twig. I began the day a white, middle-class, Ivy-trained philosopher obsessed with meaning and was forced to become women—hundreds of women—women of color, women without educational privilege, women without philosophical horizons. The inversion of my values, especially losing my sexual identity, was shattering—the perfect hell for a male academic. When the distinctions defining my life dissolved, I died and was reborn into the exquisitely beautiful world of the feminine, under the arm of the Great Mother.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Immediately, a new cycle began in which I was immersed in collective anguish that dwarfed those early sessions and shattered all my frames of reference. I entered an ocean of suffering expanding session by session until it encompassed the entire history of the human race. The dying was vast and elemental. One excerpt gives the flavor: the anguish thickened into a terrible horror acted out on all sides—disembowelings, maulings, deaths in the thousands—forms so complex and multi-thematic that isolated images barely stood out. War, savagery, destruction, killing, and anguish for hours.

**CHRIS BACHE:** This phase lasted four years across twenty-eight sessions—one year of active work, a six-year break, then three more years. At first I interpreted these episodes as deepening ego-death. I assumed if death was present, pieces of ego must be dying. But the sheer duration, intensity, and collective scope eventually overwhelmed that assumption. These episodes went on too long and were too extreme to be explained as resonance to residual personal material.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I concluded that these ordeals were not primarily about transforming my personal consciousness but about transforming and healing the species mind. In Dark Night, Early Dawn I integrated Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic fields into Stan’s paradigm and adopted a larger narrative. In highly energized states the collective field can be activated so intensely that it triggers collective healing. Through a fractal flip I had not imagined, the “patient” ceased to be me and became humanity itself—or some segment of it.

**CHRIS BACHE:** *\[slides\]* To sketch vocabulary: Stan’s perinatal matrices can be pictured as a cycle at the interface between personal and transpersonal consciousness. Drawing on Rick Tarnas and Stan’s work correlating planetary archetypes with perinatal matrices, you can imagine glyphs—Neptune, Saturn, Pluto, Uranus—circling that threshold. Ego is the drop; transpersonal reality is the ocean; the perinatal portal is their boundary.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In Dark Night, Early Dawn I kept the perinatal vocabulary but stretched its rationale. I proposed that one’s perinatal encounter could tilt toward personal or transpersonal. Tilt personal, and you might relive biological birth intertwined with loss of physical identity. Tilt transpersonal, and you might die and be reborn fused with the human species—so the birth canal becomes the birth canal of history. I posited two tiers operating here: one aimed at personal ego-death, another at collective ego-death.

**CHRIS BACHE:** My present view is simpler and, I think, more accurate. Death and rebirth are archetypal cycles that repeat as we move into deeper stages of psychedelic unfolding. Like the Buddha-dharma’s wheel, they turn multiple times. Any single death–rebirth can draw elements from multiple levels, but as a cycle it recurs in new forms at deeper dimensions. So I now see those collective ordeals as a second turning of the wheel taking place at the subtle level—a movement inherently collective, aimed at collective transformation, with a collective patient.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In private exchange, Stan supported this revision, noting that “perinatal” should be used for fetal experiences, not for death–rebirth on higher transpersonal levels unrelated to biological birth.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Second question: Why does dying repeat so many times? After the collective phase ended, five overwhelmingly positive sessions followed—a kind of mega-rebirth. I felt flooded with grace and blessings and sensed I had accomplished the primary purpose of my incarnation. I hoped the ordeal of dying was over, and it would have been if I had stayed within the transpersonal ranges I had already entered. But the method I used—fully internalized sessions at five to six hundred micrograms with eyeshades, music, and the full set—kept pushing me beyond my experiential limits.

**CHRIS BACHE:** *\[slides\]* Over the next six years and thirty-five sessions, a third phase opened, propelling me through further death–rebirths into the Divine. I was spun into what Buddhists call the sambhogakaya—what I came to call diamond luminosity. I had known light many times, but this was different: exceptional clarity, energy so pure that returning to it became my only goal. It extinguished residual curiosity about previously fascinating archetypal terrains. This was another order.

**CHRIS BACHE:** When this phase was over, I counted six seminal breakthroughs—many deaths, but six turning points. The pattern taught me that death–rebirth repeats at successive initiatory levels. Each “complete” rebirth is later followed by new dying as the spiral turns. Death repeats not because we missed something and ego survived, but because the Divine is an infinite landscape. Each death opens the next horizon.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In The Ultimate Journey, Stan details forms of death at transpersonal levels: identifying with ancestors, people of different cultures and eras, past-life memories, animals and plants, mythic underworlds, eschatologies, death gods, astral and bardo realms—the archetype of death in many guises. Knowing that he had gone there and returned gave me courage to continue.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Whatever the level, the core of dying is the same: complete loss of control, absolute surrender, disorientation so deep it dissolves reality as known. And rebirth is the same: awakening into an unanticipated dimension, a new identity with new capacities, and the felt grace of receiving infinitely more than one gave up. The specific flavor reflects the level where the work is happening.

**CHRIS BACHE:** After many deaths, the very concept of death loses meaning. One learns, through repetition, that at the deepest level it is impossible to die. Forms die; realities shatter; but the innermost essence re-emerges. The phoenix rises. “Death” becomes a measure of the depth of purification. When purification reaches so deeply that it dissolves form, dying returns us to grace. Purification unto death.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I also surrendered the assumption that there is a final death. One can enter Oneness that is utterly satisfying—resting in the Source, one with all. Yet with repeated immersion, new dimensions of Oneness reveal themselves and new joys unfold. The One exists in many modalities; always One, differently expressed. The progression feels endless. Dying stops only when one’s capacity for discovery is exhausted.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Third question: What is actually dying? A delicate both-and is required. The individual undergoes these deaths; they become part of one’s life story. And yet they also belong to the universe; something larger is using these openings to heal and commune with itself.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Early on, ego is dying—constrictions, wounds, illusions, habits formed by Earthly history. Later, after ego’s grip has loosened, what is dying? Part of the answer is species ego. When the wheel turns at the subtle level, the deaths are largely collective. What dies are nodes of pain and suffering embedded in the collective unconscious. The “patient” shifts from individual to species mind; the pulse we live in those hours is the pulse of human history. The COEX systems resolving are not personal but collective—what I call the metamatrices of the collective unconscious.

**CHRIS BACHE:** There is another layer: the shamanic persona. After sessions, we often cannot hold all the knowledge consciously, yet on re-entering we find it again, as if waiting. Ego-state psychology shows that compartmentalization is common. Drawing on Gordon Emmerson, John Rowan, and Tom Zinser, I suggest that repeated openings form a semi-autonomous, state-specific consciousness that retains and integrates psychedelic knowledge and capacities. I call it the shamanic persona—a state-specific alter-ego. The better run the session, the tighter and more coherent this persona tends to be.

**CHRIS BACHE:** When deeper levels open, our earlier psychedelic identity must surrender. The knowledge and identity built at one depth must die so a deeper mode of knowing can stabilize. Often what feels like “me” dying is not the everyday ego but this shamanic persona yielding to a deeper one. A second persona arises that retains the first’s memories and adds the new depth; later it too must surrender when a still deeper horizon opens.

**CHRIS BACHE:** One more layer concerns what dies at causal levels. What could die in such sublime terrain, and why would causal realms need rebirth? Here I lean on Sri Aurobindo’s involution-evolution cosmology, which resonates with psychedelic cartographies and with Stan’s The Cosmic Game. The Divine cascades into multiple levels, all Divine, but with a descending scale of self-awareness—like one-way mirrors: looking down sees all; looking up sees less.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In such a multilevel cosmos, a death–rebirth can function simultaneously as liberation from below to above and as infusion from above to below. At certain thresholds you feel energy moving both ways. Suppose we stabilize briefly at a low-causal level, breathing its rarefied air of Oneness. Further surrender opens a doorway to a still deeper causal. A communion occurs: deep communes with Deep. Different levels of transpersonal reality come into conscious relation. Even for hours, that remembering and blessing nourishes the weave of existence. It is a cosmic dance—God communing with God.

**CHRIS BACHE:** So beyond ego, beyond species ego, beyond successive shamanic personae, what dies and is reborn can be something of truly cosmic proportion—some vast dimension of the Divine surrendering and awakening more completely to itself. And, much to our surprise, the Divine seems to genuinely welcome our help in facilitating this communion.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Stan, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. *\[applause\]* *\[music\]* *\[music\]*

## Key themes

- Death–rebirth as an archetypal cycle that repeats at successive depths of reality.

- Transition from personal ego-death to collective species-level purification and healing.

- Reframing “perinatal” to fetal experiences; higher-level deaths belong to transpersonal domains.

- The “shamanic persona” as a state-specific identity that must itself surrender as depths open.

- Collective COEX systems and morphic fields as mechanisms for species-mind transformation.

- Diamond luminosity (sambhogakaya) as a distinct order of radiant, purifying light.

- Endless progression: the One reveals new modalities; dying ceases only when capacity is spent.

- Multilevel cosmology (Sri Aurobindo) where death–rebirth mediates ascent and descent.

- Psychedelic practice as a conduit for divine-to-divine communion in the fabric of existence.

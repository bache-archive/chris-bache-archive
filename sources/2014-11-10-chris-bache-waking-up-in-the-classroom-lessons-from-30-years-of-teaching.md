Chris Bache delivers a candid, high-energy talk on what three decades of front-line teaching taught him

about learning fields, improvisation, and spiritual responsibility. Framing his book *The Living

Classroom* as a “second Saturn return” summation, Bache recounts starting at Youngstown State in 1979,

surrendering his career plans, and committing to “full-contact” pedagogy with open-enrollment students.

Running parallel was his deep psychedelic practice, which he kept private, even as its aftershocks

spilled into class as synchronicities, intensified attention, and collective catharses. He distinguishes

class fields from course fields, outlines practical ways to open, tend, and close them, and shares

karmic cord-cutting and compassion practices to protect students. In Q&A, Robert McDermott and Rick

Tarnas widen the frame to cultural and astrological currents. Bache speaks vulnerably about “coming

down off the mountain,” letting go of marijuana to fully ground, and his vision of a future human born

through collective purification and embodied love.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Feel how that shifted the energy? We don’t have time to mess around anymore.

Let’s get to the serious stuff.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Rick asked me to talk about teaching, as if I’d found secret knowledge in

30 years in Ohio. I’ll just share what I have, then you decide. We’ll keep it lively and get to

discussion, because that’s where the juice is.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Robert is here—among his many works he wrote the preface to *The Living Classroom*,

which was an honor. I’ll hit a few bullets, then give the backstory.

**CHRIS BACHE:** This book was my second Saturn-return project. I began teaching in 1979; it came

out in 2008. Before sabbatical I asked in session space which book to write—psychedelics or classroom.

The answer was clear: write *The Living Classroom* first. Grants arrived. Doors opened. The idea’s

time had come.

**CHRIS BACHE:** When I came to Youngstown, it broke my heart. I hadn’t done seven years of grad

school to teach in a Rust Belt town without grad students. I tried to leave. Meanwhile I discovered

Stan Grof’s work, started my own sessions, and my mind radicalized. The department had hired a

traditional philosopher; suddenly I was writing on perinatal dynamics and transpersonal theory.

**CHRIS BACHE:** After four years there, a job opened and went traditional. I surrendered. I said,

“Okay, life wants this. I’ll become the best teacher I can.” That choice shaped everything.

**CHRIS BACHE:** One third of *The Living Classroom* is student essays. Youngstown also gave me

gifts: freedom to innovate, many non-traditional students, and a quiet place for deep practice.

I did four intense years of psychedelic work, paused six, then ten more.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Teaching open enrollment is full-contact. You motivate, you challenge, you make it

a dojo. Thirty percent drop after week one because I’m clear: if you only want an easy humanities

credit, this isn’t it. But if you offer substance, students work and open their hearts.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I split my life. Professionally I did the usual professor things. Privately I did

deep Grofian work. In Ohio you don’t announce that your professor drops acid. I kept quiet. Mind,

however, doesn’t split just because I do.

**CHRIS BACHE:** One day a student asked a question. Instead of answering from habit, I waited.

A “door” opened in the back of my mind and a new answer arrived on a “slip of paper.” I tried it.

The room lit up. I learned to blend prepared content with improvisational intuition.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Then synchronicities escalated. I’d reach for an example and it would match a

student’s life exactly. The deeper my sessions went, the more often this happened. It wasn’t planned.

It was like lightning. I even put a warning on the syllabus: *This course may be dangerous to your

psychological equilibrium.* They thought I was joking.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I realized I was teaching on two levels. For most, it was information exchange.

For a second group—often the ones who took everything I taught—just being in the room became

transformational. Clarified states are contagious; negative states are contagious. Our spiritual

ecology doesn’t allow private realization.

**CHRIS BACHE:** This forced a paradigm shift. It wasn’t only “my energy” resonating with theirs.

Students started showing up in each other’s dreams. A social organism emerged. Sheldrake’s morphic

fields clicked for me—not only over centuries, but in 15-week classes.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I distinguish the *class field*—the living, outer ring of this cohort—from the

*course field*—the long arc created by everyone who has ever taken this course with this teacher.

Sometimes the new class starts where the last one stopped. The learning curve shifts. Adapt or the

energy dies.

**CHRIS BACHE:** You can work with fields before day one. When I get the roster, I do reconciliation

practices—asking forgiveness, offering forgiveness—and cord-cutting to clear old karma. Later I learned

Tibetan *chöd*—“cutting.” I also tune the syllabus to the field that’s forming.

**CHRIS BACHE:** During term, I use behind-the-scenes practices and in-class structures—guided

visualization, café conversations—to strengthen healthy coherence. At the end, I *close* the field:

celebrate, assess, empower students as individuals, and release the bond. Without closure, some stay

psychically attached and drift.

**CHRIS BACHE:** “Waking up” in the classroom is discovering transparency—shunyata as see-through.

No one holds their own being alone. When the wind of life moves through the leaves, teaching happens

and there’s no “me” doing it. It’s a joy to be used by something larger.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The circle of learning runs both ways. Often I don’t help students because I learned

something last week. I learned it last week because their future need was already pulsing through me.

We don’t own our careers. Our passions interweave with theirs from the start.

**CHRIS BACHE:** My later sessions went into collective reincarnation—we as a species, not only as

souls. Then into diamond luminosity. The intimacy with the Divine became so deep that returning hurt.

I couldn’t share that material with undergrads. I began to lose my voice from holding back.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Life reshuffled—divorce, *Dark Night, Early Dawn* published, a stint at IONS,

then back to Ohio until my kids finished college. I had to come *all the way* down the mountain.

For me that meant ending an over-attachment to marijuana. It kept me half-hovering. My vow was to

ground fully so I could finish my work and serve clearly.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I still practice—Vajrayana, Zen—but I don’t try to live in diamond luminosity.

Some beings can. I couldn’t without harming my earthly commitments. Sometimes you can have “too much

God” for a time-bound life.

**ROBERT MCDERMOTT:** You can see why writing the preface was easy. Thank you. And yes, we once sat

for each other in holotropic breathwork. Deeply bonding.

**RICK TARNAS:** A note on the etheric transparency you chronicled. The 1990s rode the Uranus–Neptune

conjunction—boundary-dissolving, synchrony-rich. The texture shifted later under Uranus–Pluto’s

intensity. Fields breathe with the zeitgeist.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. At my peak the transmission felt like a lightning rod. Later, subtler. Practice

builds circuitry; when the amperage lowers, the circuits remain, but you have to cooperate more.

**AUDIENCE:** Teaching sixth- and seventh-grade poetry terrified me. Your book helped me trust the

field. It formed. Do fields scale cosmologically?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Fields are natural phenomena—group minds emerging from a unified mind. Museums have

fields. So do malls, newsrooms, and militias. Nature isn’t moral in that sense; *we* choose which

fields to amplify and which to leave.

**ROBERT MCDERMOTT:** I’d say fields are “negative” relative to love and evolution when they divide

and harm. Our task is to transform them.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Agreed. Youngstown taught me that. Some places are where bad karma comes to work

itself out. Practices can help lift fields—confession, forgiveness, cutting cords, compassion.

**AUDIENCE:** Quantum leaps? Tipping points?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Nonlinear systems show sudden re-patterning far from equilibrium. A species-level

near-death could catalyze exponential change. Field dynamics make rapid shift conceivable without

changing seven billion minds one by one.

**AUDIENCE:** Coming down the mountain and marijuana?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Neptune gifts openness; its shadow can be addiction. Marijuana is a mild psychedelic

and a euphoric. For me it kept me from full landing. I asked the Divine not to take me back into the

most ineffable states until I could live there without leaving. Then I chose to ground.

**AUDIENCE:** The future human?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The archetypal cradle of the human psyche is shifting. After a collective dark night,

a being emerges whose heart is healed, mind radiant, body green to its roots, and whose communion with

cosmic intelligence is embodied—no escapist cosmologies. When it is born, the long pain will feel

worth it. Our work is to hold that vision through the contractions.

**Abstract**

In this two-hour live stream, host **JEFFREY MISHLOVE** and co-host **EMMY VADNAIS** welcome philosopher

and psychedelic researcher **CHRIS BACHE** for an in-depth exploration of “diamond luminosity,” the

hyper-clear light state he encountered during 73 high-dose LSD sessions (1979-1999). Bache details

his Grof-inspired protocol, ego-death ordeals, integration practices, parallels with near-death

experiences, and his vision of humanity’s evolutionary “labor.” Audience questions range from safe

psychedelic use and meditation to suffering, reincarnation, and signs of the emerging “future

human.” Throughout, Bache emphasizes disciplined preparation, compassionate service, and the

possibility of birthing a soul-centered civilization despite looming planetary challenges.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** *\[off-air chatter\]* Okay, we’ll shut that window and I’ll share my screen.

Is it minimizing? There we go. As of this moment announcements are going out to our followers,

and they’ll be logging in. They’ll hear everything we say, and their screens will look something

like this—little thumbnails of us.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** In just a minute I’ll start the countdown timer. For those joining, welcome!

Let us know in the chat where you’re watching from.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** Some viewers of the archive wonder why they must sit through ten minutes of

pre-show talk. Once we start the timer YouTube automatically makes the recording public. We could

download, edit, and re-upload, but then we’d lose this URL that’s already shared everywhere.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** And Zoom’s local recording isn’t the highest quality. If we re-edited, I’d want to

drop in book covers whenever a name is mentioned—that would delay release. It’s easier to remind

people they can fast-forward.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** Typically, by the end of the day three or four times as many people watch the

archive as attended live. How many years have I been doing this? I started interviewing in 1972,

but the YouTube channel is now ten years old.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** I first saw Jeff on public television back in 1987 when I was thirteen. Even then

he was interviewing amazing thinkers—Jacques Vallée, John Mack—on UFOs, consciousness, spirituality.

Those programs shaped my career in holistic health and intuition.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** From 1986 to 2002 we were syndicated on public TV. Funny thing: I was guided

into media by a dream at a time I didn’t even own a radio or TV. I was a long-haired Berkeley hippie

who thought broadcast media were phony—until that dream upended my life.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Another example of the deep wisdom of the world communicating through us.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** Emmy and I have streamed live on YouTube for about five years now, every two

or three weeks. Chris, how did you step into public speaking on these topics?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Early on I kept my LSD work under tight wraps. Only after publishing *Dark Night,

Early Dawn* in 2000 did I begin presenting at conferences and teaching at CIIS. I didn’t fully go

public until I retired from Youngstown State in 2013. *LSD and the Mind of the Universe* came out in

2019; that formally brought me out of the psychedelic closet.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** *\[timer beeps\]* We’ve got about a minute before the program officially begins.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** Looking back, that dream urging me to broadcast and my early LSD experiences

primed me to act when opportunity knocked.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** *\[addresses chat\]* Welcome, everybody! Jeffrey Mishlove here with my co-host

Emmy Vadnais and our honored guest Chris Bache. Chris is professor emeritus of philosophy and

religious studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct faculty at CIIS, emeritus fellow at the

Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. His books

include *Life Cycles*, *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, *The Living Classroom*, and *LSD and the Mind of

the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*. Chris, we’re delighted you’re here.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you. It’s a pleasure.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** To start, could you share a bit of your background? You’ve mentioned that you were

the last person anyone would expect to write a book about 73 high-dose LSD sessions.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I grew up in Mississippi and initially trained for the Catholic priesthood, earning

degrees in theology and New Testament studies. Ultimately celibacy and I didn’t get along, so I

shifted to philosophy of religion at Brown. The psychedelic sixties passed me by entirely. When I

began teaching in 1978 I discovered Stanislav Grof’s *Realms of the Human Unconscious*. If his

claims were true, psychedelics had profound philosophical implications. Despite my discomfort with

breaking the law, I committed to a private, tightly circumscribed research program using Grof’s

protocol—eyes-shades, music, sitter, high dose.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** Your “day job” remained conventional academia while your “night job” explored

deep psyche.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Exactly. I worked intensively for four years, paused six, then resumed for another

ten, completing 73 sessions between age thirty and fifty. Then I spent twenty years digesting and

integrating before publishing the book.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** Readers often feel they’re traveling with you because you included detailed

session notes.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That was deliberate. Before we can debate philosophy we need a thick description of

what actually occurs in deep sessions. I had to lose my academic voice and cultivate a new

narrative style.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** Listeners keep asking about near-death experiences.

How close do your LSD sessions feel to NDEs?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The phenomenology overlaps strongly.

Near-death experiencers get one immersion; I had dozens.

Repeated entry turns a flash revelation into an extended dialogue

with the cosmic mind.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** Some viewers wonder why you didn’t hike in nature on LSD.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Nothing wrong with that,

but my goal was inner cosmology.

Eyeshades, darkness, and music eliminate external input.

All energy flows inward, opening deeper strata of psyche.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** Describe the mechanics—dose, setting, music.

**CHRIS BACHE:** After three medium-dose openers

I settled at 500–600 µg—right at the body’s absorption ceiling.

Morning start, yoga, prayer, then ingestion.

Carol—my wife and sitter—managed a pre-scored playlist.

I lay motionless under eyeshades.

The next morning I replayed each track, writing until every memory

anchored on the page.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** Why such high doses?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I replicated Spring Grove’s late-stage cancer protocol,

but extended beyond their three-session limit.

Back then I assumed “more sessions = deeper data.”

Today I’d choose gentler ranges and mix synthetics with organics.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** Viewers ask legal and safety questions.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I never encourage breaking the law.

Ketamine is currently legal; MDMA and psilocybin will follow.

Always test street substances through anonymous labs.

And remember: meditation, yoga, breathwork can reach similar depths

without legal risk.

### Diamond luminosity

**EMMY VADNAIS:** The title of this episode comes from your phrase

“diamond luminosity.” What is it?

**CHRIS BACHE:** In my final twenty-six sessions I was catapulted

into a hyper-clear, crystalline light—far beyond earlier light visions.

Buddhists call it *Dharmakāya*, the clear light of absolute reality—

the womb of the Big Bang.

It has nothing to do with physical diamonds,

though *Vajra* and Diamond Sutra imagery overlap.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** What core lessons did you bring back?

**CHRIS BACHE:**

1\. A single intelligent love underlies everything.

2\. The universe is that intelligence’s body.

3\. Love is the motive force of creation.

4\. Reincarnation is fact; evolution spans eons.

5\. The aim isn’t escape but birthing a soul-centered Earth.

6\. Ego must die, yet individuality refines rather than vanishes.

7\. Humanity now enters labor to deliver its collective soul.

### Audience Q&A

**EMMY VADNAIS:** *\[reading chat\]*

“What population should avoid psychedelics?”

**CHRIS BACHE:** Anyone with unstable physiology or psychosis risk.

Amplifiers magnify what’s latent.

A strong support network and screening are essential.

**AUDIENCE (ROBERT BUSHMAN):** What is consciousness? Infinite fractal?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Consciousness is the knowing field itself—borderless.

Our brains gate a slice of that field.

Depth practice widens the aperture.

**AUDIENCE (GREASY SLICK):** Have you tried DMT?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes—N,N-DMT, 5-MeO, San Pedro, MDMA, ketamine.

Powerful, but short windows.

LSD’s long arc allows deeper cleaning and integration.

**AUDIENCE (CELIA FUNK):** Does “diamond” mean actual gemstones?

**CHRIS BACHE:** No—metaphor for ultra-clarity.

**AUDIENCE (FIRST DEACON GEMINI):**

Difference between ego death and derealization?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Derealization is pathological detachment.

Ego death is sacramental surrender—temporary dissolution

within a safe container, after which ego returns transparent.

**AUDIENCE (MEGAN SALAR):** What’s your daily practice?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Morning meditation, Vajrayāna *chöd* for clearing,

evening soul-integration prayer.

Teaching itself became a spiritual art.

**AUDIENCE (PABLO GERALDA):** First-time advice?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Build meditative stability first.

Use legal avenues.

Test substances, secure an experienced sitter, prepare integration.

**AUDIENCE (FABIAN FABIUS):**

How do we square creating paradise with the need for suffering?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Zoom out to galactic time.

Humanity is an unfinished species—maybe 5 % complete.

Suffering is the crucible forging soul maturity.

As we evolve, collective suffering will decline.

**AUDIENCE (XANDER):** Any synesthesia?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Rare for me; I internalize fully under eyeshades.

Others report rich cross-sensory blends, but it’s not my focus.

### Birth of the future human

**EMMY VADNAIS:** You write about a “diamond soul” fusion of lifetimes.

**CHRIS BACHE:** After session 45 all prior incarnations spiraled into me,

igniting a white-light explosion.

I realised the soul eventually incarnates *whole*,

not as a fragment.

That synthesis marks the future human—compassionate, visionary,

devoted to planetary service.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** Signs we’re approaching that pivot?

**CHRIS BACHE:** People who live for others—Gandhi, King,

but also anonymous teachers, nurses, volunteers.

Service is the soul’s signature.

We are gestating; labor will be painful,

yet a soul-centered civilization can emerge.

### Closing remarks

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** A hopeful vision to end on.

Chris, thank you for sharing your journey.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** Yes—deep gratitude for the wisdom and the hope,

even if the coming labor may hurt.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Pain can be eased if we cooperate with the process.

Many bodhisattvas—like everyone behind this program—

are already midwifing the birth.

**JEFFREY MISHLOVE:** To our viewers: subscribe to the free newsletter,

download the first eight issues of *New Thinking Aloud* magazine,

and stay tuned for daily videos.

**EMMY VADNAIS:** Thank you all for being here—

you’re the reason we do this.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Blessings on the journey, everyone.

*Stream ends.*

*Abstract — 141 words*

In this **Portals of Perception** conversation, host **Aviv Shahar** interviews transpersonal philosopher

**Chris Bache** about the revelations of his 73 high-dose LSD sessions, chronicled in *LSD and the Mind of the

Universe* (aka *Diamonds from Heaven*). Bache recounts dissolving into the “mind of the universe,” meeting an

immeasurable, compassionate intelligence, and witnessing humanity’s impending dark-night-and-rebirth process that

will birth a “diamond soul” future human. The dialogue ranges from cosmological purpose, collective karma, and the

fusion of transcendence and immanence to practical integration and embodied spirituality. Shahar probes how memory

functions as a living intelligence, why suffering is built into evolution, and how each person can become a conscious

partner in cosmic creativity. Bache closes with grounded counsel: purify mind and body, act for the greatest good,

and recognize today’s crises as the labor pains of planetary awakening.

**AVIV SHAHAR**: Welcome, Chris. *Portals* explores the future human and the changes already under way.

We decode what is emerging at the edge of experience.

**AVIV SHAHAR**: You taught philosophy and religion for 33 years and wrote *The Living Classroom*, *Dark Night,

Early Dawn*, and *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*—your “Diamonds from Heaven.”

I have never taken psychedelics; my work uses naturally arising states.

I invited you because of the rigor and depth of your inquiry. Welcome.

**CHRIS BACHE**: Thank you, Aviv. It’s a pleasure to be here.

**AVIV**: After an academic career, books, family, and twenty years of radical research, what portal are you in now?

**CHRIS**: Publishing *Diamonds from Heaven* felt like finishing my life’s work.

Since then I’ve followed the conversations it sparks, tended my North Carolina garden,

and practiced systematically remembering each of the 73 sessions to embody their realities.

**AVIV**: Ervin Laszlo’s foreword names three premises:

a\) intelligence pervades the universe,

b\) that intelligence has purpose,

c\) humans can access it.

How do these live in you?

**CHRIS**: They’re foundational. My early scientific worldview saw a purposeless machine cosmos.

The sessions shattered that: I communed with an intelligence vast and compassionate,

guiding evolution across lifetimes, planets, and galaxies.

I avoid the word “God” and speak of creative intelligence saturating existence.

**AVIV**: You say the universe enjoys our conscious participation—why?

**CHRIS**: At depth there’s no true duality; Atman is Brahman.

The totality delights when its fractals awaken and converse.

**AVIV**: Session 6 showed you a “community of explorers.” Lesson?

**CHRIS**: History’s great thinkers form a fellowship.

Systematically expanding consciousness, documenting it, and integrating across disciplines

lets ordinary people enter terrains once reserved for elite mystics.

**AVIV**: Conditioning shapes experience or only interpretation?

**CHRIS**: Both. Early filters color content, but sustained practice dissolves them.

Consciousness is a seed crystal dropped into an infinite lake; purification changes what precipitates.

**AVIV**: Session 19 felt like coming home beyond space-time. Insights?

**CHRIS**: I learned reincarnation patterns, galaxy formation, and an indescribable peace.

The intelligence said: “Space-time was never meant to entrap so many.”

**AVIV**: Why is suffering woven into evolution?

**CHRIS**: It’s a voluntary burden—labor pain for creation.

When the full arc is visible, the cost is judged worthwhile.

**AVIV**: You describe a transcendence–immanence split: “he” and “she” seeking reunion.

**CHRIS**: Part of intelligence stays outside time; part dives in.

Humanity now midwifes an alchemical marriage—divine light embodied in matter.

**AVIV**: Your sessions moved from personal to collective trauma and future vision.

**CHRIS**: After two years my work processed oceans of collective suffering,

then revealed a planetary dark night birthing the diamond-soul human.

**AVIV**: Diamond luminosity—dharmakaya—followed.

**CHRIS**: Four encounters with hyper-clear light, each after severe purification.

The light implanted in my body, hinting at future human physiology.

**AVIV**: Today’s meta-crisis is an initiatory crucible?

**CHRIS**: Yes. We face a bifurcation: extinction or evolutionary leap.

No victims—only volunteers incarnated to assist the birth.

**AVIV**: Stabilizing that vision must be hard.

**CHRIS**: A year of recovery. I now carry deep respect for every soul alive.

**AVIV**: Practical bridges?

**CHRIS**: Embrace embodied spirituality: purify mind, heart, body;

serve the greatest good; treat social transformation as sacred practice.

**AVIV**: Viktor Frankl showed meaning transforms suffering; your work scales that to the cosmic.

Thank you for your generosity.

**CHRIS**: And thank you, Aviv, for your noble inquiry.

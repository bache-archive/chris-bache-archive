In this conversation, Chris Bache outlines the method and meaning of his

two-decade, high-dose LSD practice that informed *LSD and the Mind of the

Universe*—a journey he preferred to title *Diamonds From Heaven*. Beginning

with animistic assumptions about an ensouled cosmos and inspired by

Stanislav Grof’s framework, Bache describes carefully sitted, music-assisted

sessions that progressively dissolved personal identity and opened into

deeper, interactive layers of universal mind. He argues that psychedelics

amplify consciousness rather than supply content, leading from personal

healing to shared transpersonal territory. Key revelations include the

coherence of spiritual realities across traditions, reincarnation as an

evolutionary engine, and the emergence of the “Diamond Soul,” a fused

wholeness of many lifetimes. With Colin’s questions on time, Bache explores

nonlinear modalities and “multi-incarnation.” He frames our civilizational

crisis as a collective dark night birthing a more compassionate, embodied,

and perceptive human species.

**RACHEL:** “Diamonds from Heaven”—your book was published as *LSD and the Mind

of the Universe*. Was that title the publisher’s?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. The publisher chose that title, but while writing I always

called it *Diamonds From Heaven*.

**RACHEL:** Beautiful. I’ve been a fan of your books for years. Colin and I talk

about your work often—*Reincarnation* was wonderful, and then the next book,

and then the LSD book. Many here don’t know your research method. I’d describe

you as an explorer of the outer reaches of the cosmos, seeking the truth of

reality and what it means to be human. Could you start by describing your

method and what your work has been?

**CHRIS BACHE:** In the animistic community we share the sense that nature is

infused with consciousness—with mind and soul. We now know how vast the

physical universe is; the question becomes, how large and deep is the universe’s

mind?

Fresh out of graduate school in philosophy of religion in 1978, I encountered

Stanislav Grof’s *Realms of the Human Unconscious*. That book pivoted my life.

I saw his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but to

philosophy. He offered a way to safely and systematically explore the deepest

levels of consciousness, where answers to my philosophical questions lay.

In 1979 I began what became a 20-year journey with LSD—the substance Grof used.

If I were doing it today, I might use a more diversified medicine palette, but

I worked with LSD and chose very high doses for reasons too involved to detail

here. That choice profoundly affected depth and breadth. The field of

consciousness expanded with the state itself.

I followed a Grof-informed protocol: total isolation, a trained clinical

psychologist as sitter, controlled home environment, inward focus, and carefully

selected music to amplify states. At these levels, you essentially shatter the

mind; it dissolves into subtler aspects of reality. It became a systematic

exploration of what I call the mind of the universe. I sometimes say “the

Divine,” but that term carries cultural overlays I prefer to avoid.

I worked for 20 years, keeping careful records, then spent another 20 digesting.

These experiences are complex and interwoven, orchestrating many levels in tidal

surges. Sessions picked up where the last left off, progressively deepening. It

took years to understand what the universe was showing me. I felt a systematic

encounter with an intelligence that orchestrated my experience in dialogue with

me—not personified, never deity-form, and, when pressed, dissolving into deeper

layers of infinity. That cumulative story is what I tell in *LSD and the Mind

of the Universe*.

**RACHEL:** Would you say this is an objective reality—that anyone using a

similar method could reach the unfolding you did? Or is that impossible to say?

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s possible to say yes—and to qualify that yes. Grof’s work

integrates thousands of cases; my experiences fit comfortably within that larger

matrix.

Psychedelics amplify consciousness; they don’t give you an experience. Because

each mind has a different history, what is amplified at first is individual,

which is why these tools are powerful for healing. But if you continue—press

to the limits of your time-space identity and move through ego death—you open

into spiritual reality less tethered to your personal story. There, experiences

begin to overlap and converge.

These realities are interactive. The mind we bring acts as a seed catalyst,

crystallizing a certain set of experiences from the universe’s infinite

potential. As we integrate and are purified, the seed-mind changes, catalyzing

deeper disclosures. Once you understand this participatory cycle, the universe

discovered is coherent and consistent across contemplative, mystical, and

near-death traditions—though depth matters. What seems ultimate at one level

opens into a deeper level where things change.

**RACHEL:** What excites me is practice. Many paths require long repetition to

find the cracks in ourselves. You used a different, faster route—not easy, and

not one you’d recommend broadly—but it seems you reached edges of the map

similar to, and perhaps beyond, contemplative practice. Is that fair?

**CHRIS BACHE:** It is a fast track, but one that permits no bypass. A

compressed labor is not easier—just more intense. The purifications and

detoxifications required to acclimate to subtler, clearer realities can be

extreme—convulsions, vomiting, profound somatic releases—and they demand

systematic lifestyle purification, just like traditional paths.

Also, I emphasize this is not abiding realization but temporary immersion.

Great contemplatives abide; these sessions offer temporary access and seed

experiences. You must nurture those seeds in daily embodied practice.

Historically, such practices sometimes fed an up-and-out cosmology—escape

into transcendence. What emerged in my work was different: transcendence in

service of incarnation—opening to as much of the universe as possible and

undergoing the transformations that let that energy live in history. I began

with a personal model; it shattered. I was drawn into a collective

transformation, and insights arose into our evolutionary trajectory as a

species.

**RACHEL:** Let’s talk about aliveness and intelligence. Is everything animate?

How layered and deep is that intelligence?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The universe is alive and intelligent at every scale and in

interwoven layers—biospheric intelligence, planetary rhythms, incarnational

processes. At one point I entered radically dilated time—not timelessness, but

vast dilation—and dissolved into my human family, experiencing reincarnation as

a collective pulse: generations incarnating, living, dying, returning. What I

once thought of as individual karma revealed itself as exquisitely tuned

collective karma, history expressing collective transformation through our

individual lives.

Deeper still, I experienced the universe breathing as a single organism. When

the world is One, the private self pops—life runs through you and you through

life. Late in the journey, I was taken into “deep time” and shown stars of

light shooting out of time-space—“Diamond Souls,” the fruition of

reincarnation: diamond-pure capacities exploring spiritual dimensions newly

available through evolution.

**RACHEL:** Before the evolutionary story, a word on reincarnation. You wrote

earlier on it. Why do you believe it’s real?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I see overwhelming empirical evidence. Ian Stevenson at the

University of Virginia documented hundreds of young children worldwide with

spontaneous memories of recent past lives. His work has been challenged, but it

holds up. Add past-life therapy that heals present trauma through past-life

access—this looks like an empirical fact of life.

Living in a reincarnation universe changes how you see. Children can be old in

soul, elders young. Early on, psychedelics taught me karma’s nuts and bolts.

Later, that became ground for experiencing the human family evolving through

reincarnation. It’s the higher octave of evolution—evolving individuals within

species. And not only humans; somewhere down the chain, reincarnation likely

engages.

Where does it take us? Each soul’s purpose is specific, and humanity’s learning

is vast. One grows into strength; another grows out of defense. Eastern

traditions often teach awakening to Divine essence and exiting—moksha. In my

sessions, something else occurred: former lives streamed into me, wrapping like

filaments on a spool until they fused. A diamond luminosity exploded from my

chest. I was shown that incremental progress across lives culminates in fusion:

a being on Earth awake to hundreds of thousands of years of lived history. That

being’s heart, mind, relationships, and bond with nature are vastly expanded.

This is not merely individual. The species is birthing the Diamond Soul. We can

no longer afford a world built by fragmented egos. We are entering a profound,

tumultuous birth that will feel like death—the old egoic culture dissolving so

something more whole can emerge. This is plate-tectonic change in the collective

psyche. Those born after will live within a different collective matrix. Part of

the work is reawakening to the divine presence we stripped from nature.

**RACHEL:** For first-time listeners, it’s a lot. I’d like to bring Colin in,

because he often says we need a new cognitive framework to reanimate ourselves.

Colin?

**COLIN:** Chris, it’s an honor. Your books—especially *Dark Night, Early

Dawn*—were tectonic for me. I grew up within a traditional indigenous culture

in southern Africa, with a cosmology shaped by wilderness. Now I also live in a

post-industrial frame. It feels like two cognitive systems inside me that I

must reconcile.

I’m full of questions, especially around time. Reincarnation here isn’t named

explicitly, yet it’s implicit. Our usual frame presumes sequence—past to

future. What happens if we remove that arrow? How would we understand

reincarnation without linear time?

**CHRIS BACHE:** If you eliminate the arrow, reincarnation looks like

multi-incarnation—many lives active simultaneously, interacting in ways that

confound linear logic. I’ve tried to live in that model and find it unworkable

for ordinary life.

Robert Monroe suggested an evolved soul can incarnate in any period—soul

forward is not time forward. My experiences included many modalities of time:

my whole lifespan present at once; a hundred thousand years lived in a minute.

The universe seems to host multiple temporal modalities. From its perspective,

the “future” can be shown as already happened and yet to happen.

Still, within space-time there’s an approximate linear arrow that serves the

soul’s learning. Life chops learning into pieces; we can’t do it all at once.

The Diamond Soul on Earth holds many time-moments in present consciousness, but

development continues. In a million years we’ll be farther; the universe is

only warming up. Individuality and time are great gifts of the physical

universe, nested within more fluid metaphysics of time.

**RACHEL:** When we reach the Diamond Soul—beyond remembering and wholeness—what

else does it bring?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Soul consciousness is what we return to when we die—the

accordion of large and small. Over millennia, the large wakes up within the

small. Temporarily, I was given Diamond Soul states and saw its archetypal

imprint: a human completely healed of history’s wounds, with profound communion

with nature and with others, and an open mind able to enter deeper communion

with universal intelligence. The genius of the universe holds answers to our

limited questions; the Diamond Soul can download more.

It’s not only heart and mind. The senses are amplified. In my final, 73rd

session, I was granted “Diamond Vision.” For about ten minutes, sight became

thousands of times sharper—gradients of color and precision I’d never imagined.

Then it receded. I realized sensation is a conscious process. The more

consciousness infuses the body, the more its innate capacities bloom—touch,

hearing, seeing—all by orders of magnitude. It is heaven on Earth in the body,

without leaving embodiment. This isn’t up-and-out; it’s bringing it in, changing

the body to sustain ecstasy as normal.

The labor is severe. Our past will be stripped away; what we think essential

will be lost. Mystical and psychedelic traditions agree: the small must be

ground to dust so the new can awaken. Historically we’re entering a collective

dark night—not merely a “hard time,” but an intense purification preceding

illumination. In this ordeal, the old will not survive, but something more

beautiful, ecstatic, competent, and connected will be born. We are becoming a

species of Buddhas and Christs—not exceptional outliers, but a baseline of

transparency to the essential condition that has always been here. The universe

has always been one and intelligent, and we have always been empty of a

separate self; we simply distracted ourselves. We are waking to the paradise

already present.

**RACHEL:** I find your vision profoundly hopeful as we face ecological and

social crisis. It was one of the most inspiring books I’ve read—certainly of

last year, perhaps of my life. I know Colin agrees. It’s wonderful to hear—

Chris Bache joins host Jef Baker for a wide-ranging Bicycle Day discussion on

Bache’s twenty-year journey through seventy-three high-dose LSD sessions, the

methodology he adopted from Stanislav Grof, and the insights captured in *LSD

and the Mind of the Universe*.

Bache explains his rigorous recording and integration process, the importance

of music as a mnemonic trigger, and why recall becomes critical at 500–600 µg

doses.

He contrasts LSD’s “clean,” culture-light territory with plant medicines

steeped in ancestral use, outlines five nested levels of consciousness—from

personal through “diamond luminosity”—and shares visions of a collective

species-wide death-rebirth leading to the “future human.”

The conversation closes with reflections on integration, the perils of psychic

inflation, and psychedelics’ role in catalyzing a new cosmology suited to the

civilizational crises of the twenty-first century.

**JEF BAKER:** *\[Intro music fades\]* Author and psychedelic explorer Chris

Bache has documented insights from seventy-three high-dose LSD sessions

conducted over twenty years. Following Stanislav Grof’s protocol, he went on a

life-changing journey into deep communion with cosmic consciousness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s a pleasure to be with your community again. My new book,

*LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, distills those sessions. Writing took five

years after decades of note-taking and digestion.

**JEF BAKER:** Your integration process—writing within twenty-four hours while

replaying the session music—really struck me.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Recall is a serious issue at 600 µg. Listening to the same

music in sequence lets me “stand at the edge of the well,” re-entering just

enough to capture the ineffable.

**JEF BAKER:** You always worked eyes-shaded, with a sitter, completely

internalized?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. Three medium-dose warm-ups, then only high doses—about

500–600 µg—over seventy-three sessions. Safety and isolation were paramount.

**JEF BAKER:** Why such large doses?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Initially, time was scarce in a dual-career family. I thought

I could move through personal karma faster. Soon the content exploded beyond

the personal into collective and trans-personal domains.

**JEF BAKER:** You’d change your protocol today?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’d mix high and low doses, balance LSD with psilocybin or

ayahuasca—be gentler. Back then, starting in ’79, knowledge and access were

limited.

**JEF BAKER:** You describe two phases in every session: cleansing then

ecstasy.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Exactly. Intense purification peaks, a death-rebirth, then

ecstatic transcendence. Depth depends on how thorough the cleansing is, both

in the session and across the entire series.

**JEF BAKER:** You map five core platforms of consciousness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Personal, collective, archetypal, oneness, and diamond

luminosity (Dharmakaya). Each requires a different death. Entering archetypal

reality meant dying as a human being to access forces shaping space-time.

**JEF BAKER:** Deep-time visions led to insights on humanity’s future.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Starting around session 55 I experienced our species’ death

and rebirth—a dark-night crisis birthing the “diamond soul.” Post-crisis

humans awaken to soul-level identity, unlocking vast compassion and communion

with cosmic intelligence.

**JEF BAKER:** Are we in that labor now?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I believe so. The ecological and systemic unraveling is a

collective purification. It’s painful but purposeful—an evolutionary

threshold.

**JEF BAKER:** Where do psychedelics fit?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Therapeutic research opens the door, but mystery-school work

is essential. Psychedelics reconnect us to deeper mind, Earth consciousness,

and the universe precisely when materialist worldviews fail.

**JEF BAKER:** You caution about integration after stopping in ’99.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Integrating sessions differs from integrating an entire

journey. I drifted into longing for death to regain transcendence. It took ten

years to ground fully in the world of immanence.

**JEF BAKER:** Final advice?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Respect the medicines, integrate thoroughly, beware psychic

inflation, and remember: the divine wants to be known—ineffability is

overrated.

**Abstract**

In this wide-ranging lecture at TimeWaver Summer World 2018, philosopher **Chris Bache** surveys modern empirical research into reincarnation and its far-reaching implications for human purpose. He argues that whether we live one life or thousands radically alters the universe’s “moral geometry,” much as the length of an exam shapes a teacher’s expectations. Drawing on Ian Stevenson’s meticulous case studies of children who recall previous lives—and carry birthmarks that match fatal wounds—Bache reviews statistical patterns, academic endorsements, and fierce critiques. He then expands the evidence base through hypnotherapeutic “life-between-lives” work, therapeutic regressions, and dramatic lay accounts such as *Soul Survivor*. Concluding, he calls for a multidimensional cosmology that transcends materialist limits and invites deeper inquiry into consciousness, the after-death state, and the soul’s evolving partnership with the universe.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

The good news—after me comes lunch, so I’m the last barrier between you and a meal. I see a tired audience, so let’s wake up. *\[invites the crowd to stand and stretch\]* All right, back down.

If the most important philosophical question is **“Do we survive bodily death?”**, then the next is **“Do we live once or many times?”** Everything turns on time. As a teacher I grade differently on a quiz, an hour-long exam, or a take-home paper. Likewise, the universe’s purpose must be assessed against the time we’re given to fulfill it. One lifetime suggests a modest goal; thousands imply something vast and open-ended.

Religions of the last four millennia often dismiss physical life—achieve nirvana, then escape. That leaves the universe’s purpose unanswered. But if we return repeatedly, a richer story emerges. Our talents compound, and our gift back to the cosmos grows.

Today I’ll outline the evidence. My first academic book, *Life Cycles*, signaled how seriously I take the topic. Fifty years ago theologians debated reincarnation without data. Now psychology, psychiatry, and philosophy have hard cases to examine.

Let’s start big—patterns in the literature. **Ian Stevenson’s** *Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation* changed my life. Fresh out of graduate school, I was an atheistically inclined agnostic. Stevenson convinced me we do live more than once.

Stevenson, Carlson Professor at the University of Virginia, authored 11 books: multivolume case reports, studies of children who speak unlearned languages, and a monumental two-volume work on 187 subjects who not only remember past lives but bear birthmarks matching lethal wounds of the prior personality. Continuity of memory is challenging enough; continuity of scar tissue sends academics up the wall.

Typical findings:

• Average interval between death and rebirth—about **2½ years**.

• Average distance between the two birthplaces—**50 miles**.

• Memories surface around age three and fade by eight; puberty erases most residual traces.

Why do these children remember? Stevenson notes 60 % died violently; the rest died suddenly or with unfinished business. Perhaps trauma “encodes” consciousness, pulling it back sooner and nearer.

Peer response? *JAMA* called the evidence “difficult to understand on other grounds.” A leading psychiatric journal devoted an entire issue to it, praising Stevenson’s rigor—cautiously, as academics do.

Enter philosopher **Paul Edwards**, who labeled Stevenson’s work “a crucifixion” of secular humanism. Edwards insisted that accepting reincarnation entails six “fantastic” assumptions: mind independent of brain, a non-spatiotemporal realm, death as illusion, and so on. Failing to refute the data, he simply declared it inadmissible. Philosopher **Robert Almeder** exposed this as question-begging: if you won’t examine threatening evidence, you’re acting irrationally.

Stevenson’s torch now passes to **Jim Tucker** at UVA, whose accessible books confirm and extend the findings. Pulitzer-winning reporter **Tom Shroder** shadowed Stevenson in the field and emerged a believer, despite the worst cover art in the genre.

Beyond spontaneous memories lie **evoked memories**—unfolding under hypnosis, bodywork, or trauma. Classic resources include **Roger Woolger’s** *Other Lives, Other Selves* and **Winifred Lukas’s** two-volume *Regression Therapy*. Social worker **Carol Bowman** turned therapist when her son’s wartime nightmares revealed a past life; her books guide parents facing similar crises.

Hypnotherapist **Michael Newton** accidentally discovered that clients could recall not only past lives but the intervals between them—the after-death state. Across hundreds of sessions, regardless of cultural background, subjects described a structured, educational spirit world where incarnations are consciously planned in cooperation with guides and future companions. Before we were born, *we chose* this life. That insight alone merits deep contemplation.

Two lay cases show detective-level verification:

• **Robert Snow**, commander of Indianapolis Homicide, reluctantly traced vivid regression images to a 19th-century painter named Carroll Beckwith.

• **James Leininger**, a preschooler, relived the fiery death of a WWII pilot; his skeptical Baptist father investigated to disprove reincarnation and instead confirmed dozens of details.

Despite compelling data, mysteries remain. What *is* the soul? How does it couple with genetics, store memory, and depart with learning intact? Until we relinquish mind-equals-brain reductionism and adopt a multidimensional cosmology, progress will be slow.

A final paradox: Stevenson’s “tight-bond” cases free us to think beyond a single life, yet risk shrinking our vision because they spotlight quick, local returns. Most souls, Newton suggests, tarry far longer in the spirit world, gathering experiences unrepresented in those rapid rebounds. To paint the full canvas, we must integrate multiple data streams—spontaneous recall, therapeutic regressions, psychedelic research, and more.

Thank you. *\[Applause\]*

**HOST:**

Chris, once again, thank you. You show how this knowledge can transform every minute we live. The three speakers this session fit together perfectly—core existential questions with a scientific basis. We must bring this evidence to society and shift consciousness. I look forward to your next lecture.

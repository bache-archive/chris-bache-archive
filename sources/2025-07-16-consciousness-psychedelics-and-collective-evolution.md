**Abstract (≈135 words)**

Journalist-author Daniel Pinchbeck hosts philosopher Christopher Bache, parapsychologist David Luke

and integral scholar Jeremy Johnson for a sweeping conversation on how psychedelics illuminate—and

perhaps accelerate—humanity’s collective metamorphosis. Bache recounts twenty years of 500-plus µg

LSD sessions that propelled him through personal, collective and archetypal purgations into a vision

of a post-collapse “diamond luminosity” species. Luke surveys empirical psychedelic science—neural

hyper-connectivity, trauma resolution, eco-awakening—and warns against the cognitive prisons of

rigid materialism. Johnson introduces Jean Gebser’s integral consciousness, framing today’s

poly-crises as the sunset of the mental-rational era and the dawning of a multidimensional,

time-transparent humanness. Throughout, the panel weighs preparation, shadow work and the ethics of

mind-expansion amid imminent ecological reckoning.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Hi, everybody—it’s wonderful to see so many curious faces. I love meeting the clan drawn to the same

mysteries as our presenters. Very briefly: I spent my career teaching philosophy and religious

studies at Youngstown State in Ohio—Eastern thought, mysticism, comparative spirituality. But what

brings me here isn’t my syllabus; it’s the psychedelic work I kept quiet for two decades. Only after

retirement could I publish the book I’m drawing from today. *shows cover on screen*

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:**

This volume tells the story of seventy-three LSD sessions between 1979 and 1999. Following Stan

Grof’s method—headphones, eyeshades, music—I worked entirely in isolation but at very high doses,

five- to six-hundred micrograms. I don’t advise replicating that protocol, yet it shattered every

mental boundary and revealed strata of reality beyond space-time. Imagine a nuclear explosion: as

the fireball rises, invisible atmospheric layers become visible. Systematic psychedelic practice—be

it Indigenous or contemporary—likewise uncovers levels ordinarily out of reach.

In broad strokes, I passed through five terrains: personal mind, collective mind, archetypal

realities, causal oneness, and finally the diamond luminosity—what Buddhism calls *dharmakāya*, the

clear light. Transitioning between levels demanded repeated deaths and rebirths, each deeper than

simple ego dissolution.

Two episodes matter most for today’s theme. First, the “ocean of suffering.” After multiple ego

deaths I plunged into vast reservoirs of collective trauma—hundreds of thousands of lives spanning

millennia. I’d entered psychedelics thinking I was healing *myself*; this experience obliterated that

model. My sessions became a drainage channel for humanity’s unprocessed pain. Everything we do in

deep states reverberates through the species.

Second, persistent visions of humanity’s trajectory. In “deep-time” consciousness I was shown that

our species stands at a before-and-after threshold. Ecological collapse triggers a systemic

implosion—our collective dark night—yet on the other side emerges a transformed human with expanded

heart and transparent access to cosmic mind. Those sessions, decades ago, shape how I interpret the

pandemic and the rolling crises of this century.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Thank you, Christopher—truly profound. A question upfront: what **is** LSD in this story? Beyond a

chemical catalyst, does it carry intentionality or entity-like presence?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:**

The atomic bomb and LSD appeared in the same decade—hardly coincidence. LSD is an amplifier and

catalyst, cleaner than ayahuasca or psilocybin because it lacks millennia of cultural overlay. At

high doses it drives consciousness toward cosmological ceilings.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

You invoke Buddhist frames and reincarnation. Any reflections on how past-life dynamics fit, perhaps

in light of quantum ideas from Amit Goswami?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:**

Empirical evidence for reincarnation—Stevenson’s child cases, past-life therapy—is overwhelming.

Evolution folds forward group learning; reincarnation folds forward individual learning. In one

session all my former lives fused into a single being, exploding in diamond light and projecting me

into an identity beyond previous reference.

**DIANA (audience):**

Can similar insights arise without psychedelics?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:**

Absolutely. Meditators write me describing parallel experiences. LSD merely amplifies consciousness;

consciousness itself performs the work.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Earlier in *Dark Night, Early Dawn* you predicted a compressed interval when civilization unravels as

the new human emerges. How should people practically prepare? Are psychedelic explorations a

necessary training ground, or can we lessen the destructive impact ahead?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:**

Collectively we’re confronting our shared shadow. One task is rigorous personal work—psychotherapy,

meditation, psychedelics if appropriate—to dissolve inner darkness and invite light. Socially we

must engage the outer shadow in politics, ecology and culture.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Beautiful. Let’s bring in David Luke to widen the lens.

**DAVID LUKE:**

Thanks, Daniel, and thank you, Chris—always inspiring.

I’m a psychologist and parapsychologist focusing on altered states. Whether dreams, meditation or

psychedelics, they sit on a continuum; psychedelics just crank the volume.

Biologically, studies at Imperial College show psychedelics induce hyper-connectivity—brain regions

that rarely communicate become chatty. Cognitively we see synaesthesia, divergent thinking and

creativity. Psychologically they reconnect us to the unconscious—shadow material, past­-trauma—for

integration and enhanced wellbeing.

Sociologically they boost openness, empathy and compassion, leading to pro-social behavior. My

surveys reveal lasting ecological impacts: most users shift diet toward local or plant-based foods,

garden more, and engage in environmental activism. Spiritually, those who score high on mystical

experience scales show the best outcomes in addiction and depression studies.

All this hinges on substance, set, setting, preparation and integration.

**DAVID LUKE:**

John Lilly captured it: *“In the province of the mind, what one believes to be true either is true or

becomes true—within limits.”* Beliefs can liberate or imprison. Our scientific culture is hamstrung

by dogmatic materialism, funding only questions that fit the paradigm. We need agnosticism and

plurality—multiple worldviews coexisting, especially in a so-called post-truth era.

Second Lilly insight: the mind is infinite. Evidence from parapsychology—precognition, telepathy,

clairvoyance—shows consciousness transcends space and time. Physics increasingly echoes these

findings.

Third: everything is connected. Psychedelics and psi phenomena expose that unity, though beliefs may

constrain how far we experience it.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

You also study ecological outcomes. Could you share a headline or two?

**DAVID LUKE:**

Sure: “Psychedelics Increase Gardening” may be my favorite. But seriously, we see measurable upticks

in eco-behavior—from diet changes to career shifts—following transformative experiences.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Speaking of transformation, DMT often produces entity encounters. Any evidence these are more than

brain fireworks?

**DAVID LUKE:**

Data are scarce because academia funds what it can neuro-reduce. Yet survey work suggests consistent

motifs—elves, clinical-style dissections, dispassionate observers. Johns Hopkins found that among

atheists who met entities, fewer than half remained atheists afterward. Rigorous ontology studies are

needed, but the question is worth wrestling.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Fair enough. You’re connected to Imperial’s DMT program. What’s brewing?

**DAVID LUKE:**

We’re planning slow-infusion protocols—extended breakthrough states while recording brain activity

and phenomenology, even testing synchronized participants in separate rooms for shared visions and

EEG correlations. It’s ambitious but overdue.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Before we pivot to Jeremy Johnson, quick practical question for both of you: how should newcomers

prepare for psychedelic work, and what about the shadowy or “dark” side?

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:**

Think of a Hopi *kiva*: a sealed chamber for deep work. Choose isolation, a trusted sitter, rigorous

spiritual practice, body care, and thorough post-session debriefing. Dark passages are purifications;

their gifts lie on the far side.

**DAVID LUKE:**

Basics: know your substance, dose, purity, setting, intentions. Integration is non-negotiable.

Macro-dosing isn’t for everyone; micro- or mini-dosing, lucid dreaming or meditation offer gentler

doors. Yet challenging experiences aren’t inherently “bad”—they often yield the most growth.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Excellent. Jeremy, could you weave in Jean Gebser’s integral perspective on our civilizational

crossroads?

**JEREMY JOHNSON:**

Thank you, Daniel, and thanks to everyone here—this dialogue is already rich. Jean Gebser maps five

structures of consciousness: archaic, magic, mythic, mental-rational and integral. Each reaches a

crisis that triggers a mutation. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries mark the mental-rational

structure’s sunset and the dawn of an *integral* presence he calls the “ever-present origin.”

Gebser isn’t a linear developmentalist; he’s phenomenological. Integral consciousness intensifies

clarity, allowing earlier modes—mythic rhythm, magic participation, even timelessness—to *co-present*

in the now. Past, present and future interpenetrate. He invites us to live the “night-time sky” of

psyche again, not just discuss it abstractly.

We might say our poly-crisis is the birth pangs of a temporally transparent human, capable of

simultaneously communing with ancestors and listening to the unborn.

Gebser called the new mode *diaphany*—transparent consciousness. It doesn’t discard the

mental-rational; it renders it translucent so magic, myth and mind shine through together.

Such clarity is urgently needed as linear progress narratives collapse and climate grief

intensifies. Psychedelics, dream practices and contemplative arts can act as *integral

technologies*, helping us taste this multidimensional presence.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Powerful. Your point about “listening to the unborn” resonates with Chris’s deep-time visions.

If the integral is emergent, do we *cultivate* it or does it happen *to* us?

**JEREMY JOHNSON:**

Both. Integral erupts spontaneously—think of modern art’s time-bending or quantum physics’

non-locality—but it also asks for disciplined attention: somatic awareness, shadow work,

aesthetic practice, dialogic spaces like this one. We can midwife the mutation.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:**

Jeremy, Gebser’s map mirrors what I saw in LSD sessions. The diamond luminosity felt like the

integral’s full flowering—transparent, all-time-at-once. Your language gives it cultural

coordinates.

**DAVID LUKE:**

And the research shows psychedelics reliably catalyze “integral glimpses.” Our challenge is

making those glimpses stick—turning state into trait.

*​\[A new window opens; a silver-haired elder appears.\]*

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Perfect timing—Joti has joined us. Joti, would you gift us an Indigenous elder’s perspective

on this collective passage?

**JOTI:**

Thank you, relatives. *\\bows\\*

Among my people we say the longest journey is from the mind to the heart. When you take the

sacred medicines without the heart, you may see worlds but you cannot *enter* them. The Earth

Mother is contracting now—labor pains for a new dream. The medicines are her midwives, but

the prayer must be service to all beings, not curiosity alone. Remember to feed the fire,

sing the songs, share the harvest.

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Gratitude, Joti. That grounds everything we’ve discussed.

**AUDIENCE QUESTION (CHAT):**

*“What about microdosing—tool or trend?”*

**DAVID LUKE:**

Current controlled studies are mixed; expectancy effects are huge. Yet even if placebo plays

a role, people report mood lift, focus and subtle eco-attunement. My caution: don’t let

microdosing become a bio-hack substitute for deeper relational work.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:**

From the macro-dose side, I’d add: microdosing can be useful *between* larger journeys,

helping weave insights into daily life—if approached ceremonially, not as caffeine 2.0.

---

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

We’re near time. I’d love one sentence from each of you: What single practice sustains you

through this “great turning”?

**JEREMY JOHNSON:**

Daily *aesthetic contemplation*—reading poetry aloud at dawn.

**DAVID LUKE:**

Dream journaling; it keeps the imaginal dialogue alive.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:**

Silent meditation with an unconditional *yes* to whatever arises.

**JOTI:**

Placing my bare feet on the soil each sunrise and saying, “I remember.”

**DANIEL PINCHBECK:**

Beautiful. Thank you Chris, David, Jeremy, Joti—and everyone watching. May our inner work

seed the regenerative future. *\\virtual applause fills the chat\\*

Humanity is in labor: that is the central image guiding this rich two-and-a-half-hour

Wisdom Keepers gathering.

After a centering visualization that expands from the cosmic to the intimate, host **Bas**

and co-host **Mayo** welcome philosopher of religion **Chris Bache** and social visionary

**Duane Elgin** for an unscripted “dance” between psychedelic cosmology and

planetary systems thinking.

Chris recounts the decades-long, high-dose LSD practice that revealed collective

reincarnation, the dark night of the species and the birth of the “diamond soul.”

Duane weaves in fifty years of futures research, describing our adolescent civilisation’s

looming rite of passage and the urgency of choosing Earth over collapse or authoritarian

futures.

Together they explore voluntary simplicity, media as the nervous system of a maturing

species, and practical compassion.

A lively Q&A follows, touching on the trustworthiness of psychedelic insight, the role of

young people, morphic resonance, and day-to-day ways to “take suffering out of the

world.”

The session closes in a shared field of gratitude and resolve.

**BAS:** Welcome, everyone. We have two-and-a-half hours together.

Tonight we’ll settle in with a meditation, then

a dialogue between Chris and Duane—two different angles, two paradigms, one dance.

After about ninety minutes we’ll open the circle for questions and, finally,

look ahead to creating more wisdom-keeper circles.

**BAS:** *invites participants to close their eyes and feel their intention*.

**BAS:** *Guided visualization transports the group from the galaxy to each

person’s body, ending in music and silence.*

**MAYO:** *after meditation* These conversations combine our energies into one essence.

Please keep sharing in your own neighbourhoods so we can co-create reality together.

**BAS:** Before the dance begins:

—**Chris** is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and

Religious Studies, Youngstown State University, author of *LSD and the Mind of the

Universe*—“Diamonds from Heaven.”

—**Duane** is author of *Choosing Earth*, former

staff to the U.S. Presidential Commission on the American Future, honoured for

pioneering work in sustainable, spiritual culture.

### Setting the stage

**CHRIS BACHE:** My voice is rough with a cold, but this material is too important.

Duane and I have been brothers for twenty-five years.

Common ground: the universe is saturated with intelligence and compassion, yet

life hurts. To see the wisdom behind suffering we must look very deep.

**DUANE ELGIN:** Thank you, brother. Early in life I shifted from medicine to

social healing. One framing I use: ask any audience which life stage humanity’s

behaviour reflects—toddlers, teenagers, adults, elders. Across decades, three-quarters

say “adolescents.” We are in a rite of passage.

**CHRIS:** Reincarnation is not only personal—it’s a collective driver.

Individual and collective karma interweave; therefore our dark night is a collective

event. My psychedelic work showed humanity pulsing in and out of time-space,

each cycle woven into a larger karmic agenda.

### The coming compression

**DUANE:** We are in overshoot: climate, extinction, resource depletion.

No, we can’t avoid the crisis now; we missed that window fifty years ago.

Our task is to move through it with courage and new understanding.

**CHRIS:** The grounds of civilisation are shaking. Without deep structural insight

we’ll collapse into despair or destructive ideologies.

### Living universe & media

**DUANE:** My 30-year study, *The Living Universe*, argues modern science

misreads reality as dead matter. A living universe implies psychic capacities are

ecological. Mass media, now in every hand, is the nervous system of our species.

We must use it to reflect new priorities.

**CHRIS:** In high-dose LSD sessions I shattered shells of consciousness:

ego death, species death-rebirth, visions of a future humanity of Buddhas.

Session 55 (1995) showed the collective dying, a narrow passage, then an upwelling

of creativity—the birth of the future human.

### Three futures

**DUANE:** I see three pathways: functional collapse, authoritarianism, or

transformative maturation. Only the third honours our freedom.

**CHRIS:** My deepest visions reveal the transformation as a *given* from “deep

time,” yet the cost in human suffering is up to us. Everyone must show up at

maximum exertion—and relax into the larger process.

### Practical compassion

**MAYO:** What practical steps cultivate compassion?

**DUANE:** 1) Watch animal-rescue videos; let your heart break open.

2\) Withdraw legitimacy from consumerism; embrace voluntary simplicity.

3\) Use media to grow networks of care.

**CHRIS:** Take suffering out of the world—now. Every private realisation radiates

outward. Do what is right in front of you with courage.

### Audience highlights

**TODD:** College cohorts already start from higher consciousness; optimism is

justified.

**HENRIK:** How do you know LSD visions aren’t delusion?

**CHRIS & DUANE:** Cross-cultural wisdom, parapsychology, and

rigorous scholarship ground these insights; see *The Epistemic Value of Psychedelic

Experience* and *Choosing Earth*.

**SUE:** Has collective consciousness declined?

**CHRIS:** We are detoxifying; apparent decline is the surfacing of trauma for healing.

**DAVID:** Memes, not genes, matter now. Let’s form circles.

**EVE:** Every thought broadcasts into the morphic field—become a student of your

own mind.

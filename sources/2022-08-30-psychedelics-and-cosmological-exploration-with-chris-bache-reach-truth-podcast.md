**Abstract**

In this wide-ranging conversation, philosopher and psychonaut **CHRIS BACHE** recounts his 20-year, 73-session journey with high-dose LSD in a therapeutic, Grof-inspired protocol. He distinguishes three aims of psychedelic work—therapeutic healing, spiritual awakening, and cosmological exploration—and explains why his project focused on the last. Bache describes cycles of purification and breakthrough, from perinatal ego death to confronting vast fields of collective suffering and beyond into archetypal reality, the One Mind, and the “diamond luminosity.” He outlines his evolving view of reincarnation, culminating in the emergence of a “diamond soul,” and shares visions of a coming civilizational crisis that could catalyze a new human—homo spiritualis/luminens. Throughout, he emphasizes careful set and setting, lifelong integration, the complementarity of disciplined meditation, and a grounded life of service, compassion, and ecological responsibility.

## Part 1

*\[music\]*

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Hi friend, thanks for joining me.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Glad to be here, Tasshin. Thank you for the invitation.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** My pleasure. I’ve been devouring your books—three of the four in the last month—and I’m excited for this conversation. To begin, would you share your background and life story, anything biographical you’d like to include?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I made my living as a university professor at a modest university in northeast Ohio. I’m a professor of religious studies. I earned a theology degree from Notre Dame, studied New Testament criticism at Cambridge, and completed a PhD in philosophy of religion at Brown. I’m classically educated, raised in Mississippi. After graduate school, when I began teaching at Youngstown State University—where I taught for 33 years—I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof, a pioneer integrating psychedelics into psychotherapy. That meeting was a turning point. Publicly I kept doing what professors do, but privately I began a 20-year journey with high doses of LSD in a therapeutic protocol developed by Grof and early researchers, exploring not only my own mind but, as best I can tell, the consciousness of the universe. I did the work from 1979 to 1999, then sat with and digested it for another 20 years before publishing *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. So I’m a university professor who also moved in the underground psychedelic world.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Beautiful. You’ve hinted that your younger self might not have predicted this path—straight-laced, analytical. What were you like before you started?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I began intending to be a Catholic priest, in seminary for three years of high school, then theology at Notre Dame. Very conventional. By the end of graduate school, a hard-edged, atheistically inclined agnostic—philosophy of religion and science had wiped my theological slate clean. That’s how I entered this work. LSD opened me to a broader understanding. I’ve also been a meditator since college—first in Vipassana and Zen, later settling into Vajrayana—but that deepening came after the psychedelic work had begun. I’ve raised three kids, been married, paid mortgages—the standard life. And I look like an accountant. I was designed to be an undercover agent.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** What captured you about Grof’s work?

**CHRIS BACHE:** If what he reported was right, the implications for philosophy—not just therapy—were enormous. Here was a method granting first-person access to dimensions of consciousness, and through them, dimensions of reality described in the world’s spiritual literatures. It’s a path of temporary immersion; we mustn’t confuse it with the path of abiding presence cultivated in contemplative traditions. But it gives temporary access to awareness far beyond ego and spacetime, challenging our culture’s materialist metaphysics. That woke up my philosopher’s ears.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** When you decided to adapt his protocol for your own use, what did it look like practically?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I followed a strict therapeutic protocol. You’re totally isolated from the world. No talking, no walks, no concerts—protected by a sitter who manages logistics and music. With eyeshades and headphones, you turn entirely inward. Psychedelics amplify the unconscious and allow subtle levels of mind to come forward; if you meet them conscientiously, a deep cleaning and healing begins. It was a full-weekend arc—intense Saturday sessions from early morning into evening, with days of preparation and integration on either side, including body care and spiritual practice. After a few medium-dose sessions, I chose consistently high doses—500–600 micrograms—seventy-three sessions across twenty years, about five a year: four early years, a six-year hiatus, then ten very active years. That’s not a protocol I recommend today; I’m not against occasional high doses, but doing it repeatedly and aggressively is another matter.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Can you explain psycholytic versus psychedelic protocols?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Psycholytic work uses low doses to gently peel the unconscious in layers. High-dose psychedelic therapy is far more evocative. Grof’s early clinical work with terminal cancer patients used a few high-dose sessions to precipitate near-death-like experiences to ease death anxiety. High doses tend to blow past the personal layers and drive consciousness into more radical states. I thought, wrongly, that if three sessions were safe, more would be better—“eating my karma in fewer, larger bites.” That model proved incorrect.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Did you sense it would become a long-term endeavor?

**CHRIS BACHE:** No. I hoped to clear meditation blocks and accelerate awakening. But once the cosmos opened, I was hooked. Deep practice becomes your life; you wrap your life around it. Teaching and family kept me grounded—dishes to wash, students to teach—complementing the work.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** You distinguish therapeutic, spiritual, and cosmological projects. How do they differ?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Therapeutic healing works the personal unconscious—PTSD, depression, addiction, death anxiety. Spiritual awakening aims to realize one’s essential nature and the unified field of consciousness. Cosmological exploration goes beyond both: deep time, deep space, archetypal realities, origins—territory one doesn’t need to traverse to wake up. It’s like an extreme sport—demanding, requiring safeguards—and it’s different from spiritual realization per se.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** How did you aim sessions toward cosmological exploration?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Beyond choosing dose and set-and-setting, you don’t aim—you surrender. High doses generate processes too powerful to steer. Let consciousness take you wherever it will, no matter how inscrutable or painful. Understanding comes after the fact, session by session, and across sequences—like a dream journal—where one session often picks up where the last left off. I use “kiva” as a metaphor: in the Southwest, a ceremonial pit where participants are sealed in all night. In session, you isolate similarly so what arises comes from within or through you, not from external triggers.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Why should people treat your findings as more than inner adventure—as statements about reality?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Replicability and convergence. First, other explorers using sufficiently powerful methods report strikingly similar landscapes. Put our testimonies on the table together and a common ground emerges—Grof synthesized thousands of sessions and mapped much of it. Second, these cosmologies converge with those articulated in mature contemplative traditions. Interpretations vary, but phenomenologically, they align. The method is unusual; the realities encountered are not unique to psychedelics.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Some elements felt novel to me—like linking reincarnation to collective evolution.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The first two-plus years took me through the perinatal level—the interface between physical and spiritual consciousness—reliving birth, death fear, and culminating in ego death. I expected unfettered access to spiritual reality. Instead, the purification restarted at a deeper register: vast, Dantean landscapes of collective suffering—ordeals far beyond my life—spanning about two years. Eventually I realized this wasn’t my personal material. I was tapping collective fields—festering pain in the human species’ psyche—war, famine, violence—aggregated in the collective unconscious. By making such tracts conscious, something seemed to lift from the species—analogous to personal healing. That crescendo opened into still deeper levels and taught me that death-rebirth cycles repeat at successively deeper strata: personal, collective, and beyond.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** What levels did you reach beyond personal and collective?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Looking back, I describe five overlapping bands: personal mind, collective mind, archetypal reality, the One Mind where the universe moves as one, and the “diamond luminosity,” a hyper-clear light corresponding to Dharmakāya in Buddhism.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Your view of reincarnation evolved. What is it now?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Philosophically, reincarnation matters because it bifurcates entire worldviews. Today we have robust empirical indicators—from Ian Stevenson’s work with children’s past-life memories and from past-life therapy—that support reincarnation as a fact of life, though we don’t yet understand its mechanics. The classic Eastern model centers individual learning—choice, consequence, maturation across lives—and I used that frame in my first book, *Life Cycles*. In deep work, I encountered an added layer: a species-level intelligence integrating our incarnations. There are collective choices and a collective project. In a pivotal session, healed former lives flowed into me as filaments of light and fused. An explosion of diamond light from my chest catapulted me into an identity beyond any I’d known—the birth of what I call the diamond soul. Reincarnation isn’t just linear, individual growth; at some point our lifetime stream aggregates into a single operative consciousness, born in history. Souls live on earth differently than egos do, with kinship to thousands of prior lives and to the Earth we will inherit again.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** How does this relate to earlier teachings, especially Buddhism?

**CHRIS BACHE:** First, honor to the great contemplatives—the path of abiding presence remains the gold standard for stabilizing realization. Psychedelic work is temporary immersion and requires long practice to integrate. That said, like all traditions, Buddhism has had patriarchy and, in places, a subtle disparagement of the body and nature. While profound strands affirm that samsara is nirvana, popular renderings still tilt “up and out”—escape to an off-planet paradise. Historically understandable, but incomplete. The deeper project is to awaken and embody heaven on earth.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** You found a home in Vajrayana?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Through my first wife, Carol—my sitter and a clinical psychologist—I connected with Vajrayana teachers at Tara Mandala. I’ve adapted practices to integrate my memories. In classic terms, we distinguish samayasattva (constructed visualization) and jñānasattva (invoked living presence). My living memory of diamond luminosity functions as a potent samayasattva—often more effective for me than thangkas. Having “died” many times, I feel at home in post-mortem terrains; practice becomes preparation for death, and I’m comfortable navigating what follows.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** You use “deep time.” What do you mean?

**CHRIS BACHE:** After the collective purifications, each session’s second half brought ecstatic teachings. I began experiencing my entire life, start to finish, as a whole—like every moment a branch on one tree. Old age, middle age—themes spanning the whole—simultaneously present. Initially I couldn’t retain it; with repeated access I learned to stabilize it. Later, dissolving further, I encountered time in 100,000-year swaths, and perhaps larger. It’s not a disembodied ego peeking in; your ego dissolves and a deeper being experiences time differently. Physics now speculates about dimensions with different temporal modalities; experientially, at the edges of spacetime, time becomes porous.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** What does it feel like?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Extremely clear once acclimated. At the personal level, themes and the deep structure of one’s life are obvious—what will consume you, what matters. At the species level, dissolving into humanity across deep time, aspects of our developmental future come into view—held paradoxically as both “yet to be” and “already so,” which lends a peculiar certainty. It raises free-will questions, of course.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** How did it shape your sense of free will?

**CHRIS BACHE:** We have conditioned freedom. If we couldn’t truly choose, there’d be no genuine learning. Meditation reveals layers of conditioning; we patiently let them exhaust, and clarity dawns. Psychedelic work can be like one extended ngöndro—purification peeling away conditioning so freer choice can emerge.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** What visions did you receive about humanity’s future and our time?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Beginning around 1991, I was given “visions of awakening”—humanity approaching a before-and-after turning point, a period of intense purification so we could receive and integrate a spiritual infusion. Creation itself presented as an act of love; all suffering unfolds within that love and is something we volunteered to shoulder. In December 1995, I dissolved into the species in deep time and experienced the death and rebirth of humanity: escalating ecological crises cascading into a global systems crisis, structures unraveling, life slipping beyond our control. At the nadir, a storm passing; then we rise to rebuild as different beings—something in the human heart broken open, self-centeredness stripped away. This is not just cultural renewal; it’s a tectonic shift in the collective psyche. I think it marks the historical birth of the diamond soul—a next iteration: homo spiritualis, homo noëticus, homo luminescens. Gestation is long; birth is convulsive and risky. We’re in the very early stages. We need a guiding vision, or the pain could drive despair.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** How does “diamond soul” relate to “diamond luminosity”?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The diamond luminosity is a cosmological level—beyond archetypes and deities, beyond the bardos. The diamond soul is that quality of light manifesting within individuated existence—akin but at slightly lower intensity. There are many degrees of light. I touched the pure diamond luminosity only four times across five years, each preceded by arduous purification.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Your description suggests a new human—almost a species shift.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Many have named it—homo noëticus, homo spiritualis, homo luminescens. Nature is driving the process; we’re cooperating. A bit like the rapid brain expansion ~100,000 years ago, but now at the level of consciousness.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** You borrow Grof’s COEX systems and extend to meta-COEX. What are they?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The psyche clusters experiences into systems of condensed experience—COEX—around themes like abandonment, anger, fear. We melt them layer by layer down to seed events, which can include birth and past lives. At the collective level, I’ve encountered meta-COEX systems—massive thematic clusters holding the species’ traumas: war, famine, gendered violence, death fear. When I was “in the ocean of suffering,” I believe I was cooperating with the lifting of these meta-COEX layers. This is the natural terrain of bodhicitta—the only sane motivation for deep practice.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** What is the species aiming at?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Growth—becoming more than we were. Near-term, awakening to our creative essence and learning to consciously manifest destiny rather than inherit it unconsciously. If our nature is the creative principle, we are learning to create—responsibly—within time and space.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** This contrasts with “escape” models—less about leaving, more about evolving and embodying.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Exactly. What we “escape” is constricted consciousness, not time and space. Fully understood, samsara is nirvana.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** What is your everyday consciousness like now?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’m not cruising the cosmic planes. Integration is lifelong—and I suspect we don’t yet grasp how encounters with the infinite reconfigure us. You can’t integrate infinity into the finite; you integrate the finite into infinity, which returns you to basics: remove whatever keeps you small. I likely pushed harder than was wise. The suffering wasn’t the problem; the ecstasy was—beauty and intelligence so overwhelming that ordinary life can feel desiccated. I’ve had to make lifestyle choices to manage living memories. If I began again, I’d be gentler.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** What would gentler look like?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Fewer high-dose sessions. Balance LSD’s cosmological reach with earthier medicines like psilocybin or ayahuasca. Anchor everything in daily practice. Abandon end-state fantasies. In my 50th session, even within the diamond luminosity, a still-higher light shattered my mind. It’s an infinite progression. Open, integrate, be patient.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** What would you recommend to someone inspired to follow?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Don’t do it the way I did. Go slow. Always work in a therapeutic modality with impeccable set and setting. Recognize that your work affects everyone around you—family, students, colleagues. The risks are real—opening prematurely, failure to close—harms that can take years to mend. Psychedelics are not an end-run around spiritual discipline.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Some won’t heed that, but your work can satisfy their existential curiosity—like seeing Earthrise.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Exactly. The picture can be enough for many who will never make the trip.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** What do you make of the psychedelic renaissance?

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s overdue and exciting. The clinical focus is the necessary first stage—demonstrating safety and efficacy, mapping neural correlates. But the philosophical implications are enormous. We call them “hallucinogens” as if the contents aren’t real; better to say “mind amplifiers.” A mystical experience does not a mystic make, but it can unmake a materialist. Risks remain: pharmaceutical attempts to monetize by stripping “the magic,” and over-medicalization. Access to these states is a human right. I foresee non-clinical centers—ideally in nature—where trained guides support deep exploration, with medical backup nearby. We should learn from Indigenous ceremonial wisdom and retain sensible screening.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Any advice for coming generations?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Evidence suggests we choose our incarnations. We are where we belong in this challenging time. Transformation will require everyone—healers, artists, builders, organizers. The question is courage: becoming the humans the world needs—more compassionate, just, and earth-honoring—doing inner practice and outer work to clear what keeps us small.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** Thank you for speaking so clearly about this and for your time.

**CHRIS BACHE:** We’re entering a hard period—decade by decade more difficult—as we inherit the costs of an extractive economy. I hope in practice people taste enough of the universe’s wisdom and love to meet it without despair. This is a call to heroic sacrifice and actualization, and the universe supports sincere steps toward the larger good. In the end, we want meaningful lives. This era will offer that meaning. And thank you, Tasshin, for these conversations helping us know and become more.

**TASSHIN FOGLEMAN:** It’s an honor and a privilege. Thank you.

**Abstract (≈130 words)**

Philosopher of religion **Chris Bache** joins **Manda Scott** on *Accidental Gods* to explore how decades of

high-dose LSD sessions revealed a looming evolutionary pivot for humanity. Bache frames today’s political

polarisation and ecological breakdown as a “collective dark night of the soul” that will culminate in the

*birth of the future human*—a soul-centred species arising from near-extinction pressures. He maps five

progressive visionary terrains (personal, collective, archetypal, causal, diamond luminosity), explains the

“diamond soul” archetype in which many reincarnational threads fuse, and argues for psychedelics as a new

methodology for philosophy. The conversation stresses disciplined containers, long-term integration, and

embodiment, warning that psychedelics amplify whatever is present. Bache concludes that losing fear of

death liberates the courage required to navigate humanity’s unprecedented transition.

**MANDA:** Chris, welcome to the *Accidental Gods* podcast. How are you, and where are you on this

slightly grey December day over here?

**CHRIS:** Hi, Manda. It’s a pleasure to be with you. I’m in Weaverville, North Carolina, just outside

Asheville. It’s sunny—going to be a lovely afternoon in the mid-40s °F.

**MANDA:** Weather envy! But you’re in a swing state—must have been entertaining?

**CHRIS:** *laughs* Let’s not go there. Too painful.

**MANDA:** You’ve written inspiring books. People assume you hold “the answers to everything.” You don’t

see it that way, right?

**CHRIS:** Correct. I’m still learning.

**MANDA:** From where you stand, what feels most alive at this civilisational inflection point?

**CHRIS:** Recent elections were disheartening for liberals like me. Worldwide conservatism worries me,

especially when it denies climate change. In ***LSD and the Mind of the Universe*** I describe a

*collective dark night* preceding the birth of the future human. Today’s chaos dismantles obsolete

assumptions so deeper spirit can emerge.

**MANDA:** 2025 feels pivotal. No ideology overrides biophysical reality. Inner—and collective-inner—

shifts seem essential. Could you give the elevator-pitch of your journey?

**CHRIS:** Sure. Hired as a professor in 1978, I was an agnostic. Grof’s book changed my life. Between

1979-1999 I conducted 79 high-dose LSD sessions underground—an aggressive protocol I don’t recommend. I

then spent two decades integrating and wrote ***Dark Night, Early Dawn*** and ***LSD and the Mind***.

**MANDA:** You couldn’t speak openly for fear of losing your job.

**CHRIS:** Exactly. I loved teaching but disclosure in the ’80s-’90s risked termination. I retired early

so the work could finally surface. Psychedelics aren’t merely therapeutic; they’re a revolutionary

research method for philosophy—*psychedelic philosophy*.

**MANDA:** Many try to shortcut enlightenment with ayahuasca weekends. Your path shows the steps matter.

How did you structure the work?

**CHRIS:** Integration is everything. Each session required a week: meticulous prep, skilled sitter,

eyeshades, curated music, then detailed journaling and reflection. Over time I saw a layered progression

through five landscapes: personal unconscious, collective psyche, archetypal mind, causal oneness, and

diamond luminosity. Breakthroughs are endless—there’s always light beyond the light.

**MANDA:** You reached a point of *waiting to die* to return to unity.

**CHRIS:** Yes. My transcendence overpowered embodiment. Publishing and speaking healed that split.

**MANDA:** Physically you endured brutal purges—burst eye vessels from vomiting.

**CHRIS:** Repeated death–rebirth cycles purify. Eventually you realise the self cannot die; only forms

dissolve, and death itself becomes grace.

**MANDA:** Why choose LSD over mushrooms?

**CHRIS:** In 1979 ayahuasca was rare. LSD, Grof’s main tool, offered a high cosmological ceiling;

psilocybin feels earthier.

**MANDA:** How did academia react?

**CHRIS:** Consciousness researchers welcomed it; mainstream journals ignored it. I chose to let history

decide.

**MANDA:** Your students had psychic spill-over without knowing your practice.

**CHRIS:** Classrooms became living laboratories of shared mind—documented in *The Living Classroom*. The

2025 edition finally admits psychedelics drove those effects.

**MANDA:** Summarise the “future human” vision.

**CHRIS:** My work shifted from personal to species-level healing. In a 1995 session the *species mind*

showed a near-extinction unraveling followed by a re-constellation—humanity reborn with a “diamond soul”

identity integrating many lifetimes.

**MANDA:** Practical guidance for listeners in 2025?

**CHRIS:** Recognise your soul chose this incarnation; do what’s within reach; embody what Earth needs;

heal trauma in all directions.

**MANDA:** Should everyone use psychedelics?

**CHRIS:** No. They amplify what’s present. Some need gentler paths. For those called: pure substance,

rigorous setting, group support, long-term integration. The biggest hazard is psychic inflation.

**MANDA:** Why did you stop after 20 years?

**CHRIS:** Energy overload and heart-ache returning from divine light. Restarting would require years of

momentum, so I devoted myself to integration instead.

**MANDA:** Final thought?

**CHRIS:** Lose fear of death—it’s graduation. Fearless living is essential for the turbulent passage

ahead.

**MANDA:** Chris, thank you.

**CHRIS:** Thank *you*, Manda. *The work continues.*

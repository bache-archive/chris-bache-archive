**Abstract (≈140 words)**

Broadcast live from the I Am Awake Foundation Center, this episode of *Conscious Living Radio* brings

together host **MARK KARAN**, conference co-organiser **STEPHEN GRAY**, and philosopher of religion

**CHRIS BACHE** to explore the collective and personal impacts of high-dose psychedelic work.

Bache recounts his 20-year series of 73 LSD sessions, guided by Stanislav Grof’s protocol, and the

visionary revelations that followed—most notably humanity’s impending “death-and-rebirth” chrysalis

and the emergence of the “future human.” The conversation ranges from timelines for global

transformation and ecological crisis to the catalytic role of individual practice, reincarnation and

the “diamond soul,” and the importance of integrating head, heart, and body. Audience questions probe

christology, Teilhard de Chardin, collective care, and the accelerating impact of individual action

within non-linear systems. The session closes with reflections on the Spirit Plant Medicine

Conference as a ceremonial empowerment hub and a call for participants to embody courage, compassion,

and cosmic playfulness during this pivotal century.

### Transcript

**MARK KARAN:** Hello and welcome to *Conscious Living*. I’m Mark Karan, broadcasting live from the

beautiful I Am Awake Foundation Center, where consciousness research and transformational work take

place. Today’s episode is spear-plant-medicine-focused, and I’m joined by my good friend and

conference partner **Stephen Gray**. Stephen, always a pleasure.

**STEPHEN GRAY:** Thanks, Mark. I’m delighted. We’re airing on 100.5 CFRO-FM in Vancouver and have run

this program locally for over 15 years. I’m thrilled about our guest today, Chris Bache, whom I hold

in immense respect for the work he’s done on behalf of us all.

**MARK KARAN:** Absolutely. Stephen, why don’t you introduce Chris?

**STEPHEN GRAY:** With pleasure. Chris Bache is professor emeritus of philosophy and religious

studies, formerly at Youngstown State University. Early in his career he encountered Stanislav Grof’s

high-dose LSD protocol—500 – 600 µg per session—undertaking 73 sessions across 20 years. Each

session involved headphones, eyeshades, and a qualified sitter. The following day he’d replay the

music and meticulously transcribe his visions. He’s the author of *Dark Night, Early Dawn*,

*The Living Classroom* (a new edition is forthcoming), and *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*,

sub-titled *Diamonds from Heaven*.

**STEPHEN GRAY:** Chris, feel free to correct any nuances. My two-part opening question: first, did I

get the synopsis right? Second, you once suggested humanity’s renaissance might take hundreds of

years, then later thousands. Given the accelerating crises and simultaneous spiritual

re-connection, how are you seeing the timeline now?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, Stephen and Mark. Your summary is generous. I’d strengthen one point:

these were less “messages” than deep immersions into trans-temporal states—“Deep Time.” Around year

twelve the visions pivoted to humanity’s evolutionary crisis: a karmic canyon leading to a

before-and-after event reshaping the collective psyche. In 1995 I experienced that crisis as the

species itself—an excruciating global systems breakdown triggered by cascading ecological collapse.

Yet on the other side lay an unleashed creative contagion, birthing a profoundly transformed human.

No dates were given; I rely on scientists for tempo. The 21st century is pivotal. We have perhaps

three or four generations—labor is short and life-threatening. I’m convinced we succeed, but the

question is: how many children will die before we come to our spiritual senses?

**STEPHEN GRAY:** Powerful. You also imply nonlinear dynamics: small perturbations gain enormous

influence. That elevates individual responsibility.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Exactly. As crisis energy rises, history shifts from linear to nonlinear behaviour.

Individual actions—both light and shadow—magnify.

**MARK KARAN:** Given that, what can individuals and groups practically do? How do we move from “me”

to “we” to “many”?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Others are better with specifics. From a reincarnational view, every soul chose to

incarnate now, fully aware of the turbulence. The deeper question isn’t *what* to do but whether we

have the courage. The essence is a pivot into Oneness: healing the heart, entering ecological

balance, embodying spirit in matter. Become the being Earth needs, and you enter synergistic

relationship with everyone doing the same.

**STEPHEN GRAY:** Beautiful. Could you sketch the “future human”? Without a signpost, as Yogi Berra

said, *we might end up somewhere else*.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Our prototypes are the great saints across traditions. What’s new is scale:

individual enlightenment is passé; it’s collective enlightenment or extinction. Humanity is entering

a collective dark night—purifying the “sins of our fathers,” which are ours because we are our

fathers. Reincarnationally, all past lives are converging. In one session they fused and exploded in

diamond light, birthing a 100-thousand-year-old identity: the “diamond soul.” The future human lives

from that integrated, compassionate awareness, consciously remembering thousands of lifetimes,

openly communing with cosmic intelligence while deeply rooted in body and Earth.

**MARK KARAN:** That’s breathtaking, Chris.

**STEPEHN GRAY:** Indeed. Let’s open the floor.

*Audience Q&A begins.*

**JACOB:** Your book articulated stages I feel myself entering. How does your journey relate to

christology? Did you experience Christ-avatar states?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Christianity and Buddhism shaped me most, though teaching world religions made me a

universalist. The Christ archetype, for me, transcends Jesus—an impulse mirrored in every lineage.

In my sessions I rarely met individuated beings—no angels, machine elves, or spirit guides. The work

ground me to dust and merged me with the fabric itself. So christology informs my frame yet

didn’t manifest as discrete forms within the visions.

**JACOB:** And Teilhard de Chardin?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Striking overlaps. Teilhard foresaw the noösphere and evolutionary pivot through his

geologist’s lens. His insights didn’t *cause* my visions but help interpret them.

**JACKIE H:** Are psychedelics accelerating collective shifts? Some meditators use low-dose 5-MeO-DMT

as a nature-of-mind ally. If you ran a workshop, what would you train?

**CHRIS BACHE:** A wholehearted yes to accelerating practice—but remember there is no private

spirituality. Every act registers in the species psyche. Classical bodhicitta rituals—dedicating

merit to all beings—remind us. Our healing, insight, and compassion infuse the field, just as our

harm does. My workshop would focus on that ethical, collective dimension rather than dosage.

**MICHAEL K:** You carry hope. Will inspiration spread faster in the collective than before?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Nonlinear crisis amplifies everything—truth and lies alike. Yet nature tilts toward

growth. Individuals who embody the future human act as catalytic seeds, radiating subtle influence.

Contemplative communities have known this for millennia.

**MICHAEL KRAUSS:** *\[off-camera, technical note\]*

**MARK KARAN:** Thanks, Michael. As we wrap up, a reminder: the Spirit Plant Medicine Conference is

more ceremony than conference—an empowerment hub. Join us virtually or in person. Chris, Stephen,

any closing words?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I love this intimate gathering. I’ll premiere the new edition of *The Living

Classroom*, finally telling how psychedelics shaped that work. I hope to see many of you there.

**STEPHEN GRAY:** Please share this talk widely. Encouragement and collective prayer are essential

as material challenges intensify.

**MARK KARAN:** My deep gratitude to you, Chris, Stephen, Michael, and our audience. Until next time,

take care of each other.

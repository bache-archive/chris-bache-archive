In this conversation, Dr. Chris Bache explores how to interpret deity-like entities that appear in psychedelic

states, particularly on DMT. He suggests that when consciousness opens into dimensions of infinite compassion,

intelligence, and creativity, the mind may clothe these qualities in culturally familiar religious forms. Such

encounters can also involve deities outside one’s personal background, pointing to the presence of “collective

thought forms”—psychic structures built by millennia of devotional attention. Bache differentiates between meeting

a spiritual principle in a culturally shaped garment and encountering the garment itself, emphasizing that both

implicate the collective psyche. He further proposes that deeper journeys often move beyond entity-populated,

granular realms into vaster, less individuated fields of consciousness. Alongside sacred forms, powerful secular

aggregates—like greed or anger—operate similarly as collective thought forms.

**HOST:** At an integration circle, someone told me he encountered Ganesh, the elephant god of Hinduism. After your journeys, how do you understand the meaning of meeting a deity in a particular form?

**CHRIS BACHE:** When we experience realities beyond our ordinary consciousness and tap qualities like infinite compassion, infinite intelligence, and infinite creativity—qualities long associated with deities—it is not surprising that our psyche matches the phenomenology of the experience with the qualities of deities we know. Sometimes, however, we meet deities that are not part of our lineage and perhaps not even in our awareness. They can appear completely out of left field, yet take the recognizable cultural form of a deity—Ganesh, Jesus, Mary, the Prophet Muhammad, and others.

**CHRIS BACHE:** My understanding is that when we engage entities identifiable in our historical traditions, we are engaging either a collective thought form or a spiritual being wearing the “clothes” of that collective thought form. By a collective thought form, I mean that when millions of devotees for thousands of years meditate, pray, and offer devotion to a named form—enshrined in scripture, art, and statuary—they generate a robust structure in the collective psyche. I do not minimize these forms; they are extraordinarily powerful. The same is true of secular thought forms like greed, power, and anger; they are also very potent in our system.

**CHRIS BACHE:** So when we encounter a deity in a particular form, we may be meeting a spiritual principle beyond form that is wearing a collective garment, or we may be meeting the garment itself. Either way, the collective psyche is implicated, and that is perfectly normal and good.

**CHRIS BACHE:** At the same time, it is possible to go beyond all collective thought forms and beyond human history. As one does, those forms tend to fade. There is much discussion of entities—especially because DMT and related substances often expose people to them—and I am not suggesting such entities are unreal. For me, entities reflect levels of reality. As one goes deeper, the granular quality of many individual beings yields to levels that are less granular, with fewer distinct beings, and then opens into vast tracts of consciousness that are less individual and less entity-like. At least, that has been my experience.

**HOST:** That resonates. It feels like a matter of levels, and seeing where you go makes it clear that at some point the entity dissolves and becomes something different.

## Key themes

- Deity encounters as cultural “garments” for transpersonal qualities.

- Collective thought forms (egregores) shaped by millennia of devotion.

- Sacred and secular aggregates (e.g., greed, power) as potent psychic structures.

- Entities as markers of depth: from granular multiplicity to vast, less individuated fields.

- Possibility of moving beyond human history and collective forms.

- Phenomenology of mystical states shaping perceived imagery.

- Validity of entity encounters without committing to literalist interpretations.

- Level-dependent ontology across psychedelic states, especially with DMT.

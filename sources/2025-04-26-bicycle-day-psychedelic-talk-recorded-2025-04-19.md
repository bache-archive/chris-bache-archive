**Abstract:**

In this profound keynote delivered on Bicycle Day 2025, philosopher and transpersonal scholar Dr. Christopher Bache explores the deepest frontiers of psychedelic consciousness. Drawing from his 20-year, 73-session high-dose LSD journey, Bache shares insights on healing, spiritual awakening, cosmological exploration, and the emergence of the Diamond Soul—a new level of human identity integrating all incarnations. He warns of the risks of going too deep too fast and emphasizes the importance of rigorous integration. Bache also addresses humanity’s collective dark night and evolutionary transformation, urging listeners to transcend fear of death and embrace the vast intelligence of the universe. This talk is a culmination of decades of inner research and a call for collective spiritual maturity in the face of planetary crisis.

**HOST (INTRODUCTION):**

Before I welcome our first esteemed keynote presenter, I want to share a quote from Albert Hofmann after his first psychedelic experience:

\> "The psychedelics gave me an inner joy, an open-mindedness, a gratefulness, open eyes and an internal sensitivity for the miracles of creation. I think that in human evolution it has never been as necessary to have the substance of LSD. It is just a tool to turn us into what we're always supposed to be."

Now, I want to welcome Dr. Christopher Bache, professor emeritus at Youngstown State University, adjunct professor at CIIS, and fellow of the Institute of Noetic Sciences. He is the author of *Life Cycles*, *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, *The Living Classroom*, and *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. Please welcome Dr. Christopher Bache.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

What an honor to be with you today, celebrating Bicycle Day, and gathering as a psychedelic community. It’s a time to reunite, to plan for the future.

You might look at me and think, "He doesn’t look like he’s done a whole lot of LSD." I think the Divine designed me as an undercover agent for the psychedelic revolution. You can get away with a lot in a university classroom if you look like an accountant.

If I looked on the outside like I think on the inside, I’d probably look like Jerry Garcia.

It’s been 82 years since Albert Hofmann’s famous bicycle ride. Think of how far we've come. The number of people using psychedelics regularly, and the diversity of how and why we use them, is remarkable. The testimony of the community is more important than any individual’s because there are so many ways these medicines affect us.

Right now, the psychedelic renaissance is focused on healing. That’s how psychedelics are being legitimized—by showing their ability to heal emotional wounds, traumas, even wounds of the soul.

This is vital. But to me, healing is only the first step into the ocean of consciousness. Beyond healing lies creativity, insight, and spiritual awakening. But these are still only mid-depths.

What I want to share today is about using psychedelics for cosmological exploration—going to the deepest levels of reality to understand the structure of existence itself.

My journey began 45 years ago. I was a freshly minted academic and agnostic. But then I read the work of Ian Stevenson and Stanislav Grof. Stevenson convinced me that reincarnation was a fact of life. Grof’s *Realms of the Human Unconscious* changed everything.

I began psychedelic work to explore philosophy of religion from the inside. I followed Grof’s protocol: total isolation, a sitter, curated music, and high-dose LSD—500 to 600 micrograms.

I don’t recommend that now. If I were starting over, I’d work with lower doses and other medicines like psilocybin or ayahuasca.

Over 20 years, I averaged five sessions per year—four years on, six years off, then ten intense years. From age 30 to 50. My second Saturn cycle was steeped in this work.

I didn’t publish *LSD and the Mind of the Universe* until 20 years later, partly because I would have been fired. The good people of Ohio don’t want their professors doing LSD on weekends.

None of my students knew. Close colleagues didn’t really understand. But these sessions shattered my consciousness. And that’s dangerous unless you're deeply prepared.

Astrologically, I have a chart suited for it—Neptune openness and strong reconstitution. I learned to navigate this terrain and became interested not in therapy or art, but in the universe itself.

I wanted to commune with the intelligence of the cosmos and be taught.

If I had degrees in physics or astronomy, I might have understood more. But with my training in philosophy and religion, I focused on the big existential questions—suffering, identity, reincarnation.

Psychedelics helped me transcend time and understand deep time—vast spans far beyond linear human thinking. The Divine works in galactic timelines, not personal projects.

We are a transitional species. Everything is in motion. The question is: where are we going?

But we must integrate. Integration begins with remembering. You train yourself to recall and digest these deep experiences. With repetition, clarity increases.

That’s one reason *Diamonds from Heaven* took 20 years to write. It just takes that long to understand.

Too often, expectations are shaped by people who’ve only had a few sessions. But deep work requires many cycles of death and rebirth.

I identified five levels of consciousness I moved through:

1\. Personal mind

2\. Collective mind

3\. Archetypal mind (Platonic, not Jungian)

4\. Causal reality—pure oneness

5\. Diamond luminosity—hyper-clarity, dharmakaya

The last five years of my journey were focused solely on reaching diamond luminosity. Out of 26 sessions, I reached it four times. But once touched, I lost interest in anything else. That reality is more real than this one.

After stopping my sessions, it took 10 years to re-commit to living fully in time and space.

You can go deeper than is wise. You can have too much God. And that can affect your ability to live well here.

Eventually, I saw where reincarnation is taking us. I experienced all my past lives fusing together—an explosion of light, the birth of the Diamond Soul.

That’s our trajectory. A being who remembers and integrates all their incarnations. We can’t run this planet on egoic consciousness anymore. Ego is beautiful—but insufficient for the challenges we face.

We’re entering a collective dark night of the soul. A civilizational death and rebirth. The outcome? Oneness. Compassion. A new humanity.

Finally, let me say something about death.

My wife Christina died six weeks ago from cancer. She was a psychonaut. She wasn’t afraid. She knew where she was going.

Her death was a celebration. That’s what psychedelics can give us.

If I could give one gift from my journey, it would be:

**Please lose your fear of death.**

Death is not defeat. It’s returning home. Birth is the hard part.

Eighty-two years after that bicycle ride, we are just beginning.

Thank you.

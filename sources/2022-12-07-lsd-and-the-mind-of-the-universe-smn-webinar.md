Chris Bache joins the Scientific & Medical Network to outline the philosophical and spiritual stakes of his

20-year, 73-session, high-dose LSD exploration. Host David Lorimer frames the conversation around Bache’s

books *Dark Night, Early Dawn* and the award-winning *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, praising their

relevance to today’s collective crisis. Bache details the demanding protocol he followed, moving from

perinatal cleansing through archetypal realms, causal oneness, and the “diamond luminosity” beyond the

Bardo. He emphasizes the participatory nature of psychedelic cosmology, the looming birth of the “future

human,” and the necessity of collective purification. Audience questions probe terminology, cosmological

scale, and the role of suffering. Bache reflects on post-journey challenges—existential sadness, enforced

silence—and calls for rigorous, collaborative psychedelic science. The session closes with a mutual

invocation of courage, creativity, and love amid apocalyptic change.

**DAVID LORIMER:** Welcome, everyone. I’m tuning in from the Cathar region of southwest France.

I’m delighted to host Professor Chris Bache, whose passion is the philosophical

implications of non-ordinary states—particularly psychedelic ones. His books *Dark Night, Early Dawn*

and *LSD and the Mind of the Universe* speak directly to our collective moment. Chris, a very warm

welcome.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, David. It’s an honor to share the experiences chronicled in

*LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. Tonight we’ll ask whether everyone can—though perhaps not

everyone should—access the cosmic mind through psychedelics. My 73 high-dose sessions, conducted

between 1979 and 1999, unfolded five strata of reality: personal, collective, archetypal, causal,

and diamond luminosity. *Ego death* was only the opening act; deeper deaths followed as species

identity and archetypal frameworks dissolved.

The work revealed three broad uses of psychedelics—therapeutic healing, spiritual awakening,

and cosmological exploration. I pursued the third, adhering to a stable protocol: 500–600 µg,

eyes-shades, curated music, the same sitter, exhaustive notes. That stability clarified the “window”

and allowed a coherent map to emerge.

**DAVID LORIMER:** Your lineage rests on Stan Groff’s methods, yet you pushed beyond the original

therapeutic frame.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Right—eventually I called it *psychedelic exploration* to avoid confusion.

The journey’s heart was a devastating *ocean of suffering* embracing humanity’s entire history,

followed by ecstatic immersion in *deep time* and an *initiation into the universe*.

Archetypal reality then stripped away human identity; causal oneness delivered a

*benediction of blessings*; and finally diamond luminosity revealed an extra-samsaric

radiance—yet even that proved only a waypoint. Session 50 exposed an “absolute light,” showing the

infinite depth of the Divine.

**PAUL:** When you say “universe,” I picture galaxies. What do *you* mean?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I struggle with language. “God” carries baggage; “Divine” feels evasive.

By “universe” I point to the conscious intelligence birthing space-time. The images of nebulae keep

me humble; I know I’m touching only facets of an endless mind.

**BERNARD CARR:** Did your encounters transcend the terrestrial? Were they truly cosmic?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Absolutely. After species death, I operated outside the collective psyche.

Diamond luminosity lies beyond archetypes and the Bardo itself—pure, pre-manifest light.

**DAVID LORIMER:** Your vision of a collective dark night and the birth of the *future human*

feels timely.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The 21st century will likely be our species’ purifying death: a nonlinear

systems crisis forcing an evolutionary leap. My task is to testify, not to time it.

**AUDIENCE MEMBER:** Why must learning come through suffering?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Forgetting and remembering appear woven into evolution. The universe is a

diamond-maker; pain fractures the old lattice so new brilliance can form.

**DAVID LORIMER:** Final reflections?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Integration remains an open experiment. Holding memories of infinity inside

a time-bound life is daunting, yet I wouldn’t trade the adventure for anything.

**Abstract**

On the winter solstice of 2020, coinciding with the rare Saturn–Jupiter “Great Conjunction,” philosopher and

psychedelic scholar **Christopher Bache** reflects on humanity’s collective passage through crisis. Invited by

**Stephen Gray** of Spirit Plant Medicine, Bache frames the pandemic, ecological upheaval, and social turmoil as a

global “dark night of the soul” that will catalyze an evolutionary leap. Drawing on decades of high-dose LSD

research, he describes nature “turning up the heat,” forcing both individual and collective shadows to surface.

Bache envisions a coming “diamond soul” era in which the distilled genius of countless lifetimes fuses into a more

integrated, compassionate humanity. He urges listeners to embrace hardship, release fear of death, and align with

the creative intelligence animating the cosmos, trusting that today’s convulsions herald profound spiritual

renewal.

**STEPHEN GRAY:** *\[music fades\]* Welcome, everyone. I’m calling on our friend and colleague Chris Bache to share

some words. Chris, thanks for joining us—it’s late where you are. If you care about humanity’s fate, read his book

*LSD and the Mind of the Universe*; it’s truly stunning. Over to you.

**CHRISTOPHER BACHE:** Thank you, Stephen. Am I coming through? Good.

It’s a pleasure to be with the community on this winter solstice—Saturn conjunct Jupiter, both entering Aquarius.

A hopeful marker. After a hard year, many long for 2021 to bring change.

I’d like to speak softly about our collective transformation.

*Shows image of Earth.* The planet is entering convulsions. We have set in motion events that will lead us through

a dark night of the collective soul. Ecological data confirm, and my visionary work echoes, that turbulent times

lie ahead. Yet rising energies are pulling humanity toward an extraordinary evolutionary phase—a Great Awakening

that will alter the archetypal architecture of the psyche.

When nature turns up the heat, deep purification begins. We must face our individual and collective shadows. The

ecological crises before us are manifestations of a civilization built on ego, now rebounding upon us.

To grasp this fully, step back further—into the presence of the universe’s creative intelligence. The galaxies

behind me pour out unimaginable power and genius. That same genius birthed this moment and placed us here to

participate consciously in a milestone century. We will leave it profoundly changed.

Who is undergoing this transformation? Not a one-hundred-year-old self, but a being of a hundred thousand

years—layered like a samurai sword folded ten thousand times. Every talent and habit arises from a deep history.

As the outer world seeks planetary integration, our inner world calls all former lives into present awareness.

Submitting to the fire of deep attention purifies the past and initiates intimacy with the cosmos.

From this century, I foresee the birth of the *diamond soul*—all prior incarnations fused into a single, luminous

consciousness. Not a privilege for a few, but a destiny for the species. Indigenous traditions, saints, and modern

psychedelic explorers converge on this vision.

The pandemic unraveled us swiftly, yet it is only an overture. Harder times are coming. If we face them with clear

devotion—asking, “What highest good can I bring?”—we accelerate personal and collective evolution. The era of lone

saviors is over; our calling is collective salvation for children, grandchildren, and all life.

As the future human emerges, hearts will open to one another and to the divine heart that holds all existence.

Clear minds will welcome cascades of insight, scientific and spiritual alike. Having passed the longest night, we

walk toward increasing light—though darkness will return in its cycle.

This journey is vast; it will span lifetimes. Thus fear of death must fall away. Death is no ending, only a

punctuation. The same luminous universe met in sacred medicine space greets us when the body falls away—leading

into cascading ecologies of light.

Thank you for sharing this special night with me.

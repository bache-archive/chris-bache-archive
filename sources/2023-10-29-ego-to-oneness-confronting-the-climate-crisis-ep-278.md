**Abstract**

Psychiatrist Bernard Biteman hosts a wide-ranging dialogue on the climate crisis as a portal for human

transformation. Dan Siegel outlines interpersonal neurobiology’s view of mind as an emergent, self-organizing

process of energy and information flow within bodies and relationships. Integration—differentiation plus linkage—

yields well-being; its breakdown drives chaos and rigidity across personal and societal “pandemics,” including mass

extinction. Siegel contrasts Newtonian time-bound reality with a timeless quantum realm, sharing how his Wheel of

Awareness practice reliably evokes experiences of unity and love, and argues for shifting from the “solo self” to an

“intra-connected” identity (mWe). Chris Bache affirms these insights from his decades of deep psychedelic practice,

describing field-consciousness, classroom field effects, and time-transcending glimpses that humanity survives our

present ordeal. Together they explore coincidence, collective fields, bifurcation dynamics, and the role of love,

leadership, and culture in catalyzing the great turning now required.

**ANNOUNCER:** Welcome to Connecting with Coincidence with psychiatrist Bernard David Biteman, MD. Dr. Biteman founded

The Coincidence Project, encouraging people to share coincidence stories. To learn more, search “Connecting with

Coincidence” to find his book, Psychology Today blog, and podcast interviews. And now, your host, Bernard Biteman, MD.

**BERNARD BITEMAN:** Welcome to Connecting with Coincidence. I’m Bernard Biteman, a psychiatrist who studies meaningful

coincidences. My book, *Meaningful Coincidences: How Synchronicity and Serendipity Happen*, is linked below on YouTube.

Today, we face a planetary problem many avoid—the sixth mass extinction, driven this time by us. Unsustainable land,

water, and energy use, and the resulting climate change, are central drivers.

We’re joined by two smart, big-hearted guests meeting here for the first time. First, **CHRIS BACHE**, professor

emeritus of religious studies at Youngstown State University and author of *The Living Classroom* and *LSD and the Mind

of the Universe*. Chris undertook 73 high-dose, carefully structured LSD sessions exploring consciousness. Also with

us is **DAN SIEGEL**, clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA, co-founder of the Mindful Awareness Research Center,

and executive director of the Mindsight Institute. His new book, *IntraConnected*, explores how our identities and

belonging interpenetrate. I’ve asked each to share how they understand what’s coming for humanity and what we can do.

Chris wanted Dan to go first—so, Dan, you’re on.

**DAN SIEGEL:** Thanks, Bernie. By training I’m a scientist, physician, and psychiatrist who researches relationships

and the developing self. About 30 years ago I began weaving sciences together in a consilient framework—what E. O.

Wilson called “consilience.” Our field, interpersonal neurobiology, invites all ways of knowing—sciences, contemplative

and indigenous wisdom, arts—into one conversation. We’ve published over 80 books in the Norton Series.

We view the mind as broader than the brain—an emergent process of energy and information flow that is both embodied and

relational. Complex systems science shows such systems self-organize. Optimal self-organization arises through

integration—differentiating parts and linking them. When integration is strong, life exhibits the FACES flow:

flexibility, adaptability, coherence, energized vitality, and stability. When integration is impaired, systems

devolve into chaos or rigidity.

Attachment research, trauma studies, and contemplative science all converge here. Integrated relationships promote

integrated neural connectivity; mind training like mindfulness and compassion increases integration; psychiatric

disorders show impaired integration. So integration is the basis of well-being.

Now, consider our many pandemics: biodiversity loss and species extinction, racism and social injustice, COVID-19,

polarization and misinformation, loneliness, screen addiction, and the climate disaster. These show chaos and rigidity

at scale. I propose a root cause: how modern culture constructs the self. Driven by a need for certainty, we form a

“solo self”—identity confined to the individual body, or to individuals like “us.”

*IntraConnected* offers mWe—me plus we—as an integrated identity of self and belonging. Indigenous teachings and

contemplative traditions have long invited fluid, verb-like being within the whole. Science can join them. If we build

an intra-connected identity, we act for the larger body because it is who we are—like caring for a stubbed toe because

it’s part of you. This is realistic idealism: a path by which humanity can choose actions for the greater good.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Beautifully put, Dan. Though I lack your scientific background, my experiential path aligns with what

you describe. In my psychedelic work, the ego ruptured and reconstituted into progressively larger fields of

consciousness—psychic, subtle, causal—each dissolving into the next. I often wished for PhDs in physics and astronomy

to assimilate what opened, but I was simply taken into field-consciousness, taught how these fields self-organize.

*The Living Classroom* came through in one ten-minute download during a session and then took years to unpack and

research. Practically, those insights reshaped my teaching. From these experiences I also carry a conviction—not

scientific, but experiential—that we make it through this historical crisis. In deep states, time becomes permeable.

One can encounter humanity’s death-rebirth from the future as “already happened.” That makes no sense in linear time,

but trans-temporal states allow it. Precognition hints at the same permeability.

**BERNARD BITEMAN:** Time’s fluidity has become a public conversation. Dan?

**DAN SIEGEL:** Consilience helps here too. Independent indigenous traditions and contemplative lineages—some using

plant medicines—arrived at the same systems conclusions. Science asks us to doubt and test assumptions. In clinical and

educational settings I developed the Wheel of Awareness: we distinguish the hub (pure knowing) from the rim (known

sensations, feelings, thoughts). With over 50,000 people worldwide, when attention rests in the hub, common reports

include dissolving of separate self and time, profound connection, love, and a sense of infinity.

Physics offers a helpful map. In the Newtonian macro world, the second law of thermodynamics yields an arrow of time.

In the quantum micro realm, equations need no “t”—it’s timeless. The hub experience seems to align with this timeless

domain. The 2022 Nobel Prize recognized quantum entanglement’s non-locality; spatial separation doesn’t impede

relations there. This frames why contemplatives, psychedelics, and wheel practice can yield unitary, timeless love.

One story: a parliamentarian did the wheel, then told me, “I’ve never felt so much love.” He hadn’t shared in the group

because, he said, “If I said ‘love,’ they’d think I was weak.” I asked whether he leaves love out when crafting laws.

He ran to his colleagues. If leaders dismiss love as weakness, we’re in trouble. Joanna Macy calls for a “great turning”

from business-as-usual—the solo self chasing material acquisition—toward a quantum change in consciousness. mWe doesn’t

erase the individual; it integrates me with we.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That coheres with my classroom experience of mind’s porosity and collective fields. Individual minds

cohere into fields; courses generate fields over years—what we might call morphogenetic fields. Without planning it,

I began filling lectures with spontaneous examples that matched students’ current struggles. As my practice deepened,

access to the class field deepened—zeroing in on wounds and blocks. I started teaching “quantumly,” taking

responsibility for mind-to-mind influence even before class convened and learning to catalyze and harvest collective

intelligence—drawing on World Café methods and inviting written reflection. *The Living Classroom* includes student

essays; psychedelics stay offstage there because the core is consciousness itself.

**BERNARD BITEMAN:** In therapy and in dance I also sense relational fields—little units of togetherness. There’s a

responsibility in what we think and feel inside those fields. Dan?

**DAN SIEGEL:** Exactly. With colleagues at MIT like Peter Senge and Otto Scharmer, we study generative social fields.

We identify teachers who reliably evoke them; they can’t articulate “how,” so we film and analyze. Michael Faraday was

mocked for invisible electromagnetic fields; now our world runs on them. As my friend the poet John O’Donohue said,

a mystic believes in the reality of the invisible. Science should too.

Entanglement may explain specific relational sensing—“I knew at the moment my loved one, 10,000 miles away, was ill.”

It isn’t spooky “faster-than-light” travel; in the quantum domain, separation doesn’t function the same way. Karen

O’Brien’s *You Matter More Than You Think* carefully applies quantum insights to social change. We can honor linear

macro realities—stop at red lights—and also live from universal, timeless awareness.

Business-as-usual arises from the solo self: “I’m just a body; meaning comes from things.” It fuels acquisition, factory

pollution, ads that tell you to buy more, and planetary damage. A quantum shift in identity liberates us from that

lethal lie. mWe integrates me and we, allowing actions that serve the living whole.

**BERNARD BITEMAN:** Coincidences are daily reminders that mind and environment interweave. A song I sang matched a

truck’s tone across the river—a playful joining of “inside” and “outside.” Dan, please clarify interconnected versus

intra-connected.

**DAN SIEGEL:** On a systems retreat with John P. Milton’s Way of Nature, after a three-day solo in the forest, my own

experience wasn’t “between me and the forest” (inter). It was “within the whole”—I was creek, tree, sky, and this body.

I tried to type “intraconnected”; the word processor kept “correcting” it. We lacked a term for subjective experience,

agency, and perspective of the whole. So I wrote *IntraConnected*. Practically, across the lifespan, modern culture

overbuilds a noun-like separate self. The invitation is to integrate inner (me), inter (we), into intra (mWe)—identity

as the integrated whole.

**BERNARD BITEMAN:** I like moving from intra to inter—being the whole and also the part in relationship.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The ancient spiritual message now meets scientific voice. The finite ego is a functional, limited self,

not ultimate. As the Buddha saw, no fixed self exists anywhere. In deep transparency, life’s wholeness dissolves our

beginnings and endings into communion. If we stabilize and culture this experience, we gain a foundation for a new

planetary culture.

I suspect the intensifying global crisis compresses our collective psyche. Extinction pressure drives evolution. We

must birth a more inclusive identity—what I’ve called the diamond soul: a refined individuality, transparent to the

field, in continuous feedback with it. The faster we move, the fewer children suffer. Environmental science suggests

decades of difficulty, but this ordeal releases something splendid in the human heart. Same divine nature, higher

expression.

**BERNARD BITEMAN:** As we close, I see our shared mission: help people oscillate from “just me” to me-with-others and

me-as-Gaia—so they can feel the love already here. Final words?

**DAN SIEGEL:** Cultural evolution is real, and everyone can lead pervasively—one person, relationship, and

conversation at a time. As Margaret Mead said, never doubt a small group can change the world; it’s the only thing that

ever has. Grounded in indigenous wisdom, contemplative practice, and science, we can shift identity from solo self to

mWe. The question isn’t can we—we can. The question is will we. We will, because we must.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I agree. The crisis will hyper-stimulate humanity’s collective field, pushing it far from equilibrium

into nonlinear dynamics. Chaos theory suggests bifurcations where small perturbations can shift outcomes. New forms can

emerge—latent capacities crystallizing from depth. That magnifies each person’s influence as crisis intensifies. Our

choices matter more than ever.

**BERNARD BITEMAN:** May those listening join us in facilitating intra-connection that is also inter-connection and a

healthy me. Dan, Chris—thank you. We can do this.

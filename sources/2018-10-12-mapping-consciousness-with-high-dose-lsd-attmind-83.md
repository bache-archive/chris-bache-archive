**Abstract**

Host **James W. Jesso** welcomes philosopher and psychedelic researcher **Christopher M. Bache** to discuss Bache’s

twenty-year program of seventy-three high-dose LSD sessions aimed at mapping the furthest reaches of human

consciousness. Bache recounts the disciplined method behind 500–600 µg sessions, his progressive initiations

through personal, collective, archetypal and non-dual domains, and the shattering brilliance of the “diamond

luminosity.” He explains the cycles of purification and ecstasy, the ocean of collective suffering, encounters with

deep-time evolutionary intelligence, and visions of a post-catastrophe “future human.” The conversation explores

differences between LSD, psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT, the burden of secrecy in an anti-psychedelic culture, and the

challenge of integrating infinite realities into finite life. Bache closes with reflections on love, loneliness,

ongoing integration, and his forthcoming book *Diamonds From Heaven*.

**JAMES JESSO:** *\[testing mic\]* Great, audio’s good. How are you today?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’m well—looking forward to our conversation.

**JAMES JESSO:** *\[Music\]* Hello everyone, welcome back to **Adventures Through the Mind**. Big thanks to the Spirit

Plant Medicine Conference, November 2–4 in Vancouver. Today’s guest, **Chris Bache**, will present there and I’ll be

attending. Follow the link in the description—tickets help cover my travel. Win-win!

**JAMES JESSO:** Chris is professor emeritus of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct

faculty at CIIS, and a Fellow at IONS. His work examines the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states,

especially psychedelics. He’s written *Life Cycles*, *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, and *The Living Classroom*—with a new

book, *Diamonds From Heaven*, due in 2019. About forty years ago he decided it was a good idea to take very high doses

of LSD… seventy-six times over twenty years—to map consciousness. Today we’ll explore what drove him, what happened,

and what he learned.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I finished grad school in ’78 as an atheistically inclined agnostic. That year I read Stan Grof’s

*Realms of the Human Unconscious* and instantly felt I’d found my life’s work. The Controlled Substances Act had

already shut down research, yet Grof convinced me the work could be done safely. I resolved to split my life in two:

publicly teach philosophy; privately launch a long LSD exploration—eventually seventy-three sessions between 1979 and

1999, each 500–600 µg. High dose let me plunge deep despite limited opportunities—a dual-career marriage, two kids.

What began as personal enlightenment shattered that model and became something far larger.

**JAMES JESSO:** Early on you faced multiple deaths and rebirths. Can you outline the phases?

**CHRIS BACHE:** For two years I relived birth trauma and perinatal death—until my personal self was crushed. Then I

was reborn into the collective psyche, wading through an “ocean of suffering” spanning human history. On the ecstatic

side I witnessed my life as a simultaneous whole, then received vast cosmological teachings. Another death pitched me

beyond species into archetypal reality—immense living forces beyond Plato or Jung. Later I entered causal, non-dual

realms… and finally the “diamond luminosity,” an indescribably clear crystalline light Buddhists call the absolute

clear light. I reached it only four times—about once a year in the last twenty-six sessions.

**JAMES JESSO:** People on 5-MeO-DMT claim the “ultimate” non-dual. Your take?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Those flashes are genuine, yet brief. After fifteen years I thought I’d reached the end—until the

50th session pivoted me 90° into a light beyond the diamond. I realized depth is infinite; talk of ultimates is

premature.

**JAMES JESSO:** How did purification feel as you left time-space itself?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The deeper the level, the higher the energy. You must surrender every pattern that keeps you small.

It’s terrifying, yet blessings always match the ordeal. Eventually you seek the cleansing because you trust what lies

beyond.

**JAMES JESSO:** Differences between LSD and psilocybin?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Psilocybin is body-grounded, sweeping through tissues and emotions. High-dose LSD catapults upward,

sometimes leaving the body behind, driving toward the “cosmological ceiling.” Later I used mushrooms and ayahuasca to

help integrate, grounding that celestial charge.

**JAMES JESSO:** Why stop after 1999?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Two reasons: pain and heartache. The energetic load burned my body. More importantly, returning to

separation after union with the divine became unbearable. I vowed not to re-enter that depth until I could stay.

**JAMES JESSO:** And integration?

**CHRIS BACHE:** You can’t pack infinity into the finite; you must integrate the finite into infinity—moment by moment.

Silence imposed by prohibition hindered me. Writing *Dark Night, Early Dawn* helped, yet real healing began when I

could finally speak openly in *Diamonds From Heaven*. Now transcendence and immanence weave together; the loneliness

eases.

**JAMES JESSO:** Where can listeners find you?

**CHRIS BACHE:** My earlier books are on Amazon; *Diamonds From Heaven* comes from Inner Traditions in 2019. A website

is on the way.

**JAMES JESSO:** Wonderful. Thank you, Chris.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, James. Great questions.

See you next time.

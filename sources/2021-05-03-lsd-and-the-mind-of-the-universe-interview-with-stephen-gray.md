### Abstract

In this inaugural episode of *StephenGray Vision*, writer-activist **Steven Gray** speaks with philosopher of religion

**Chris Bache** about *LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*. Bache outlines the disciplined,

20-year program of 73 high-dose LSD sessions that catalyzed his visionary map of humanity’s collective evolution.

He describes successive stages—from perinatal cleansing through archetypal, causal, and “diamond luminosity”

realms—culminating in revelations of a coming species-level death-and-rebirth. The discussion covers session

protocol, sitter responsibilities, music curation, and the need for daily spiritual practice. Bache and Gray reflect

on global crises as collective “labor,” the emergence of the “future human,” and the role psychedelics can play in

building a compassionate planetary culture. The conversation offers both practical guidance for deep psychonauts

and hopeful context for non-users engaged in humanity’s awakening.

**STEVEN GRAY:** *\[music\]* Welcome, everybody, to the very first episode of the **StephenGray Vision** YouTube channel—

also available as an audio podcast on Anchor. The purpose of this series is to explore the possibilities of an

awakening humanity. I’m thrilled to launch with Professor **Chris Bache**. Before Chris speaks, let me read a short bio.

**STEVEN GRAY:** Christopher M. Bache is Professor Emeritus in Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State

University, adjunct faculty at CIIS, and a Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. An award-winning teacher,

his work probes non-ordinary states, especially psychedelics. His books include *Life Cycles*, *Dark Night, Early

Dawn*, *The Living Classroom*, and—most recently—*LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, subtitled *Diamonds from Heaven*.

Chris, thank you for inaugurating this series.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s a pleasure and an honor, Steven. I’m delighted to join your maiden voyage.

**STEVEN GRAY:** Let’s start with a concise “highlight reel.” In maybe five minutes, can you recount why you undertook

your 20-year LSD journey and sketch its arc?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Sure. Trained as a philosopher of religion, I was drawn to psychedelics for their capacity to probe

the mind’s depths. Over 20 years I completed 73 sessions at 500–600 µg—far beyond today’s therapeutic doses. The

protocol followed Stanislav Grof’s high-dose guidelines: eyeshades, headphones, indigenous-leaning music, a trusted

sitter—my then-wife Carol—and complete inward focus.

The journey unfolded in stages:

* **Perinatal catharsis (≈2 years):** Processing birth, death, and existential terrors; culminating in ego death and

entry into early spiritual realities.

* **Dark night (≈2 years):** A pivot from personal to collective purification—engaging millennia of species-level

trauma.

* **Archetypal immersion:** Learning how the human family lives as a single being within mythic dimensions.

* **Causal reality:** Boundaries dissolved; the universe pulsed as one life-form. I received a “benediction of

blessings.”

* **Diamond luminosity (final 5 years):** Four visits to a hyper-clear light—what Buddhists call the *dharmakaya*.

After a culminating vision of humanity’s trajectory, the universe “wrapped up” our work in 1999.

Spirit then told me, “Twenty years in, twenty years out,” meaning it would take two decades to integrate. Indeed,

the book appeared 20 years after my last session.

**STEVEN GRAY:** The book is stunning. For listeners who want the detailed linear narrative, I recommend your 2018

TimeWaver talk “Diamonds from Heaven.”

On safety: what are the essential elements of your protocol?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Isolation, a qualified sitter, meticulous set and setting, and music that tracks Helen Bonny’s

five-stage arc—ascending activation, crisis, breakthrough, peak, and re-entry. Indigenous chants proved more

powerful than Western classical pieces because unfamiliar languages prevent cognitive anchoring. The sitter’s job is

to protect, manage bodily needs, monitor music, and discourage premature externalization. Experience helps, but above

all the sitter must be steady.

**STEVEN GRAY:** You’ve said you *wouldn’t* repeat the journey the same way. Why?

**CHRIS BACHE:** High-dosing alone is taxing. Today I’d intersperse lower doses, alternate substances like psilocybin

or ayahuasca, and integrate more somatic practice. I also learned the path has no final terminus; the universe is

open-ended. A gentler pace would honor that.

**STEVEN GRAY:** Many seekers won’t pursue such extremes. What guidance can you offer the broader community?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Whether or not one ingests psychedelics, consciousness does the work. Key principles:

1\. **Clarify intention** and create a “clean kiva.”

2\. **Retain and integrate**—journaling, art, or music strengthen the learning loop.

3\. **Daily spiritual practice** grounds energy and insights.

4\. **Long-term engagement** requires life stability; your circle is affected too.

5\. **Courage with discernment:** Depth exploration suits certain temperaments; it’s not obligatory for awakening.

**STEVEN GRAY:** Let’s pivot to your recurring vision of a collective death-and-rebirth. You saw no dates, but sensed a

species-level labor analogous to childbirth.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. From 1985 onward I was shown humanity approaching a decisive “before-and-after.” I experienced

it *as* the collective psyche—waves of agony followed by an explosive upsurge of compassion and clarity. Out of the

crisis emerges the “future human,” forged by the fusion of all past incarnations into a diamond soul. Ecological

breakdown appears to be the trigger, but the process ultimately births an enlightened planetary culture.

**STEVEN GRAY:** You view COVID-19 as a rehearsal, not the main event.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Correct—an early contraction teaching cooperation, truth-telling, and resilience we’ll need for

deeper challenges.

**STEVEN GRAY:** Your perspective is hopeful. You trust the universe wouldn’t bring us to labor if we weren’t ready.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Exactly. When fear rises, I remember the intelligence that carried life this far. The invitation is

to grow up—shifting from egoic adolescence to soul-centric adulthood.

**STEVEN GRAY:** Beautifully said. As we close, where can viewers find you?

**CHRIS BACHE:** My papers are on Academia.edu under “Chris M Bache.” Soon my website—*chrisbache.com*—will host news

and resources. Email remains *cmbache@ysu.edu*.

**STEVEN GRAY:** Thank you, Chris. Your clarity and generosity set the bar for this series.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, Steven, and blessings on your project.

**Abstract**

In this conversation, Sandie Sedgbeer and Chris Bache explore reincarnation through research, therapy, and

first-person inquiry. Bache outlines how past-life therapy and Ian Stevenson’s work with children’s verified

memories grounded his book *Life Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life*. He distinguishes the soul of a

single lifetime from the capital-S Soul or “oversoul” that holds all incarnations, reframing identity beyond the

current personality. Topics include why recall often centers on the most recent life, how traits and traumas can

bridge lives, and the purpose of repeated incarnations as evolutionary learning that ultimately serves creation

itself. They discuss the bardo, mediums and “front images,” heaven and hell as educative feedback rather than

eternal fates, collective trauma, Christianity’s ambivalence toward reincarnation, interlife planning described by

Michael Newton, and reports of non-Earth lives. Bache closes by affirming reincarnation as a richer frame that

deepens responsibility, compassion, and meaning.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Welcome to *What Is Going OM*, where we explore new thought from the edge of mind and

consciousness. I’m Sandie Sedgbeer.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Today we’re talking about life after death, heaven and hell, and reincarnation. My guest is

CHRIS BACHE, professor emeritus of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University, adjunct

faculty at CIIS, emeritus fellow at IONS, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. He is the author of

four books, including a personal favorite, *LSD and the Mind of the Universe (Diamonds from Heaven)*, and *Life

Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life*, which synthesizes testimonies, consciousness research, and

near-death studies.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Chris, welcome back to the show.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Hi, Sandie. It’s a pleasure to be with you.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** *Life Cycles* has been called the first book to both describe rebirth dynamics and explore

the ramifications of a reincarnational worldview. It was published about thirty-five years ago. Where were you in

your LSD work then, and how did that journey inform the book?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I began psychedelic work after my first year as an academic. I worked four years, then stopped

for six. During that interval I did three years of past-life therapy, uncovering former lives, and I wrote *Life

Cycles*. By then my sessions had given me personal insight into karma, but not past-life recall in a psychedelic

context—those came via hypnotherapy. The real foundation was studying Ian Stevenson and other pioneers who

documented validated memories in children and adults.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** You share powerful cases. One that struck me, from Helen Wambach, involved a five-year-old

girl diagnosed with childhood autism who showed reading and math skills she’d never been taught. She wouldn’t

communicate but “force-fed” her therapist with a baby bottle to convey how she felt. When understood, she came

into herself—but lost the reading and math. How do you read that?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Our lives are longer and more continuous than we assume. We don’t start as a blank slate. We

begin each life with history—knowledge, attitudes, traumas, virtues—blending into the new start. I’m simplifying,

but there’s real carryover we can see when we look at children with fresh eyes.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Why do accounts so often focus on the last life?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Stevenson’s sample is unusual: children with spontaneous recall of the immediately prior life.

They tend to reincarnate quickly—on average two and a half years—and nearby. Population studies of adults show

longer intervals and wider geography. In therapy, pain may originate in the most recent life—or several lives back.

I think of former lives as a deck of cards. We may have fifty-two lives, but only a handful are “active” in this one,

drawn from different centuries to form the present composite.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** In the book you distinguish “soul” and “oversoul.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** For Western readers used to “soul” meaning the essence of this lifetime, we need a larger term

to include all lives. I borrow “oversoul.” In practice I collapse the distinction and use capital-S Soul for the whole,

and small-s soul for the consciousness integrating one incarnation. Many call the oversoul the higher self.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** I found an article by Alex Lickerman arguing that the real question isn’t evidence but

identity. Does reincarnation change what “I” am?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. Identity expands. I accept this body-mind as my current identity, and in mystical openings I

accept a universal identity. The Soul is intermediate—still individuated because histories differ, yet its essence is

the same divine ground. The Soul is the metaconsciousness holding, say, a hundred thousand years of experience.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** It’s hard to imagine that an infinite oversoul is “me.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s hard at first. It gets easier with practice—especially experiential access. When you open to

awareness predating this body and meet other lives with the uncanny quality of being you while other than you,

and you work with several such lives, your mind and heart dilate. Eventually it’s hard to think smaller again.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Why do we reincarnate?

**CHRIS BACHE:** To learn, to grow, to become more. It reframes the purpose of existence. If we live one life,

meaning must fit within decades. If we live many, development is open-ended. Imagine God saying, “Help me grow

this universe.” Incarnation becomes direct participation in creation, moving toward heaven on earth—embodied,

luminous awareness. Enlightenment is a stage within a much longer arc.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** But if we’re sparks of God and know everything when we die, why return and “forget”?

**CHRIS BACHE:** We don’t forget everything. Conscious recall narrows, but what we’ve known is built into our

unconscious and capacities—like gifted children who can’t explain where skills came from. We re-express that

knowledge and expand it. By life’s end, we’ve incarnated more of what we carry.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** How can mediums bring through loved ones if those souls are in the bardo—or already

reincarnated?

**CHRIS BACHE:** A simple model: after death we return to the Soul, review, assimilate, and exchange the small

identity for the large. If I die and want to see my father, his Soul can meet me, presenting the “front image” I

knew as my dad, then deepening into soul-to-soul exchange. Mediums may contact that persona for compassionate

communication, but we shouldn’t assume that persona is the soul’s post-death state.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Another common question: with more people alive now, where do the extra souls come

from?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Think of a campus that grows though the town is much larger. We’ve no reason to think the

number of souls is small or fixed. Perhaps billions wait to incarnate as openings arise. The spiritual universe dwarfs

the physical. Robert Monroe emphasized that the physical is a slice; most reality is nonphysical.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Monroe also suggested some humans evolved from higher animals.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Many reincarnation traditions hold that the process correlates with the birth of individualized

consciousness in the animal kingdom and extends before the human.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Regressionist Linda Backman, trained by Michael Newton, says more people now access

non-Earth lives.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Theoretically, why not? If life is abundant and reincarnation trans-local, crossover is conceivable.

I’ve no personal experience of that, but I respect those reports.

*\[Mid-show break and sponsor messages\]*

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** I’m attached to this personality. I don’t like the idea that she disappears, like an actor

shedding a role. Could I reconnect or even bring “her” back?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Nothing essential is lost. We take not only memory but a vivid, living version of our earthly

experience—“in technicolor and stereo,” as NDErs say. The Soul can crystallize any of its lives’ forms, or integrate

them. To me it isn’t sacrifice; it’s trading up from a bicycle to a starship.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Sometimes I feel spiritually unimpressive for someone who’s lived millennia. Could I ever

become like a guide or angel?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Your essential nature already is that. Also, don’t judge a soul by appearances. Like a student

switching majors, a seasoned soul can look like a beginner in a new curriculum. And look at your work—amplifying

spiritual dialogue at a time the world needs it. I think there are more bodhisattvas than we recognize.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Some teachers warn not to go to the white light or you’ll be trapped in cycles. Your view?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The light is a homing beacon. Follow it as far as you can. People naturally stop where they’re

comfortable—one of many bardo levels—and later choose to reincarnate. Training increases comfort so you can go

“all the way,” into what Buddhists call extra-samsaric reality. I’ve touched that, and it changed my life.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Why was reincarnation removed from Christianity? In the first centuries it appears; then

under Justinian it’s gone.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s complex. Did Jesus teach reincarnation? Some Gnostic texts say so; whether they reflect the

historical Jesus is debated. Early Christianity had multiple streams; some affirmed reincarnation and women’s

clerical leadership—both later filtered out. Geddes MacGregor argued reincarnation isn’t inherently at odds with

core Christian teaching. Historically, the Church centralized authority amid imperial collapse. Mediation by clergy

became the model of salvation. From a reincarnational view, that constrained individual spiritual autonomy.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** You devote a chapter to the “hidden phase” between lives.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That’s why I named the book *Life Cycles*. If you only study birth-to-death, you miss half the

cycle. There’s a fairly patterned process after death. Michael Newton’s work maps it well: life review,

assimilation, re-immersion in the community of souls, rest, then focusing on the next curriculum with guidance.

We’re shown options and choose challenges suited to growth and service. Then—hello, newborn.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Rough stats say about 57% believe in life after death; 12–44% (varies by country) believe in

reincarnation; about 75% believe in heaven—and hell. How do you see heaven and hell?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The Buddhist framing helps. After death, what we are is mirrored back. Generosity returns as

heavenly experience; harm returns as hellish experience—not punishment, but education. It’s a stage in debriefing.

Beyond it there’s a “heaven of heavens”—infinite love, knowledge, and bliss—within which the human drama is a

small part. I do not accept an eternal hell. There is accountability, but no cosmic parent condemns a child

forever.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I have spent long stretches in hell realms in my work—torturous, collective suffering. My take is

that the human species retains its unprocessed trauma in the collective unconscious. Those clusters can feel like

hell, but like personal trauma they can be metabolized. Some in the early Church may have misread encounters

with collective shadow as a metaphysical doctrine of eternal damnation.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** Is there room for reincarnation in Christian thought?

**CHRIS BACHE:** If reincarnation is established as fact—and I think the case is strong—Christianity can integrate

it by expanding the age of the soul. One can retain Jesus’s unique salvific role if desired, or situate him within a

communion of awakened beings aiding humanity. Most importantly, maturation unfolds over many lives, not one.

That dissolves cruel implications of a single lifetime determining eternity. Jesus speaks to souls, not just

personalities.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** You end with the “web of life,” an ongoing dialogue across lives and between lives.

**CHRIS BACHE:** After living and teaching in this frame, the old siloed view feels unnatural and spiritually thin.

Reincarnation doesn’t answer everything, but it opens deeper questions—and richer answers.

**SANDIE SEDGBEER:** We’re out of time. Chris, thank you for a fascinating conversation.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, Sandie.

**Abstract (140 words)**

Philosopher Chris Bache recounts his twenty-year, seventy-three-session program of

high-dose LSD research conducted under Stanislav Grof’s therapeutic paradigm.

Speaking to the TimeWaver community, he explains how he kept his academic career

at Youngstown State University separate from his clandestine inner quest,

painstakingly recording each session and later analyzing the material

phenomenologically. Bache traces his passage through perinatal death-rebirth,

an “ocean of suffering” that he interprets as collective human trauma, and a

series of transpersonal breakthroughs into psychic, subtle, causal, and finally

“diamond luminosity” (dharmakaya). Along the way he receives sweeping visions

of humanity’s evolutionary crisis and future “species-level rebirth” into a

higher form of consciousness. Bache closes with reflections on integration,

existential grief, and the need to balance transcendence with immanence while

participating courageously in the troubled decades ahead.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Thank you for welcoming me to TimeWaver Summer World. Stanislav Grof, whom

Martin mentioned, co-founded transpersonal psychology with Abraham Maslow and

pioneered the clinical use of psychedelics. When I encountered *Realms of the

Human Unconscious* in 1979, I was a new junior faculty member and immediately

sensed that psychedelics would pivot both psychology and philosophy. Trained

as a philosopher of religion, I decided to pursue experiential—rather than

solely intellectual—knowledge of how the universe works.

Over twenty years I completed seventy-three high-dose LSD sessions in Grof’s

method: eyeshades, carefully chosen music, total isolation, and a trusted

sitter. Outwardly I remained a university professor; inwardly I embarked on a

hidden pilgrimage, recording every session within twenty-four hours and later

analyzing the data against other fields of knowledge.

Most people know the difference between low-dose psycholytic therapy and

high-dose psychedelic therapy. Early Spring Grove trials allowed a maximum of

three LSD sessions for terminal patients. I reasoned that if three were safe,

more could be safe. Multiple sessions, however, opened challenges unimagined

in those early studies. Looking back, I call what I did **psychedelic

exploration**: the therapeutic protocol used in far greater number, with

meticulous documentation—four hundred pages of raw notes, even astrological

transits correlated with phenomenology.

### Crossing the perinatal plane

My first ten sessions, spanning two years, dismantled my ego. At the ninth and

tenth the universe “snapped me like a twig,” reversing every identity I clung

to. I lived the lives of poor women of color across cultures. Gender, class,

and academic pride dissolved. Only after surrendering did I discover the glory

of womanhood—conceiving, birthing, laughing at bewildered husbands—and learned

that beyond personal history gender does not exist.

### The ocean of suffering

For another year I was plunged into a vast collective agony—wars, famines,

injustice. Initially I thought this was a deeper layer of ego death; later I

understood the sessions were siphoning trauma from the collective human psyche

for transmutation.

### Deep time in the soul

Emerging from that ordeal I experienced my entire life—beginning to end—as a

single, completed pattern. Returning repeatedly, I learned that states once

ineffable can become cognitively coherent through diligence and purification.

### Initiation into the universe

Six years after a pause, the work resumed at the exact point it had stopped,

demonstrating the precision of the guiding intelligence. I was taken into

cosmic classrooms—“You and I Creating,” “The Cosmic Tour,” “The Council of

Elders”—and shown humanity’s evolutionary trajectory.

### Archetypal reality

After an immense collective cleansing I entered high-subtle and low-subtle

archetypal domains. At the Platonic apex I encountered vast living forms that

shape space-time. At the Jungian layer I felt the species incarnating itself

generation by generation, a numinous yet devastating vision of humanity as a

single organism learning through billions of lives.

### Benediction of blessings

Eighteen months of archetypal work gave way to a year of overwhelming grace:

Shunyata’s transparency, the fertile void, cosmic love, and the first eruption

of “diamond luminosity” as prior lifetimes fused into a single white-hot

presence—the *diamond soul*. I realized reincarnation is steering us toward an

eventual awakening where the *soul* lives consciously on Earth.

### Visions of the future human

From session 23 onward I received “visions of awakening,” culminating in

1995 with a panoramic near-death event for the species. I witnessed a global

dark night—an ecological and cultural systems crisis—followed by an explosive

flowering of intelligence, creativity, and solidarity. Humanity, I was told,

is “built for speed” and poised to birth an unprecedented collective being.

### Diamond luminosity

In the final five years I entered the “diamond light” four times. Each entry

was preceded by torturous purification and followed by deeper absorption. In

session 50 my field pivoted ninety degrees; beyond the diamond light lay an

even more transcendent “absolute light,” revealing that the divine journey is

endless. The goal is not a finish line but an ever-expanding capacity to host

the infinite.

### Integration and caution

I ended the work in 1999, partly due to physical overstimulation, partly due to

heartache—an existential grief at leaving the divine realms. A decade of

grounding taught me that excessive transcendence can eclipse the immanent

divine manifest in the physical world. Our task is to balance heaven and

earth, serving the labor of planetary rebirth already under way.

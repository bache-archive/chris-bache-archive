**Abstract**

In this second Edge of Mind conversation, Andrew Holecek and Chris Bache dive deeper into Bache’s

twenty-year, high-dose LSD practice and the philosophy it revealed. They explore openness and

contraction as the “combustion cycle” of awakening, ego death as training for physical death, and

the rhythms of surrender that move awareness through personal, collective, archetypal, and

extrasamsaric domains. Bache differentiates contemplative “slow-bake” realization from

cosmological exploration catalyzed by psychedelics, recounting his encounters with the “diamond

luminosity,” clear light mind, and the intuition of an infinite progression beyond any final

omega point. The dialogue turns practical with integration, risks, and constitutions required for

this work, then widens to reincarnation, voluntary embodiment, near-death research, and a

species-level inflection—an ordeal that could seed the emergence of the “future human” rooted in

compassion, creativity, and shared responsibility.

# Part 1

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Welcome everybody to our ongoing Edge of Mind podcast, where I have the honor to spend more time with this remarkable thinker and explorer, Chris Bache.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Today we’ll continue unpacking aspects of his journey introduced in part one. A brief bio, then we’ll jump right in.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Chris is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years, a Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and on the advisory board for Grof transpersonal training and the Grof Foundation.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** An award-winning teacher and international speaker, he is the author of several books and, last I recall, living in Portland. Are you still there?

**CHRIS BACHE:** We’re in Weaverville, North Carolina now.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** I’m glad I asked. Chris, thank you again for returning to unfold more of the implications of your journey.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s a pleasure to be with you today, Andrew. Thank you for the invitation.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** I was rereading the latter chapters of *LSD and the Mind of the Universe* and also *The Living Classroom*. There is rich interconnectivity between them.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** I’d like to start with a narrative close to my heart: openness and contraction. Using your language, it feels like the combustion cycle of the path.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** We can feel openness and contraction somatically, not just as concepts. Perhaps we can begin here, letting this theme dilate into the diamond luminosity, the climax of your book.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Good place to start.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In my experience, psychedelics—and specifically LSD, my primary medicine—amplify consciousness. When consciousness is amplified, quiet signals get loud. You become aware of more.

**CHRIS BACHE:** How you meet what emerges is decisive. If you engage the shadow consciously—fears, habits, constrictions—and trace them to their roots, they resolve. With each resolution, consciousness opens into more spaciousness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Letting go of what holds awareness small—especially the time-space, historical ego—reveals deeper dimensions of what you truly are.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Continue and you pass through multiple layers. At certain points you must surrender not only personal identity but identity as a human being, and even the time-space frame itself.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Experience flows beyond time and space. This is natural. LSD accelerates what nature already does.

**CHRIS BACHE:** At birth, consciousness contracts into an individual identity. At death, it expands into deeper spiritual awareness. Sessions intensify this contraction–expansion, letting you burn off more karma than usual. Meditation works similarly.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** My running definition of meditation is “habituation to openness.” Etymologically, the Buddha is the “opened one” as much as the “awakened one.”

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** How early did this become apparent in your journey? And how did it help you go further?

**CHRIS BACHE:** It began in my first session. I couldn’t remember anything about myself—name, work, even whether I was male or female. Identity was gone.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Frightening at first, then identity returned later in the session. That initial shock taught me the cost of ego death. It is a real death.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It trained me in surrender. If you can’t control self-identity, you learn to let go. As stakes rose, I knew surrender was the key.

**CHRIS BACHE:** About two and a half years in, the individual ego inverted and collapsed. A death was followed by rebirth into a deeper state.

**CHRIS BACHE:** After two years immersed in the ocean of suffering—the unfinished pain of humanity—another death catapulted me beyond the collective unconscious into archetypal reality.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The pattern repeated: death, opening, deeper light. Even light showed gradients—levels of purity and clarity.

**CHRIS BACHE:** A caution: in psychic and subtle domains, the sensation can be of getting larger. Later, it reverses. Vast fields of light contract into the present and explode awareness.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I began to wonder whether “psychedelics” as mind-openers miss that they are also mind-contractors—into the present, present, present—until you drop into a different order of presence.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Beautiful. In Vajrayana, there is language about the “fourth moment” accessible only through the present moment. Healthy contraction becomes the portal to the timeless.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Another frame: your path differs from contemplative slow-bake realization. Yours is temporary immersion. The experiences are revelatory, but not the same as stabilized realization.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. Apples and oranges. An enlightened experience does not make an enlightened being. Experience has a beginning and end. Realization abides.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Deeper states are also more open states. They show how we construct the self moment to moment. The ego is a process, not a product.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Does that reflect your discovery?

**CHRIS BACHE:** It does, especially early on when understanding your personal contractions is helpful.

**CHRIS BACHE:** But my work became cosmological. I left not only the personal ego but deeper strata to explore how the universe constructs reality—how archetypal fields structure time-space, how oneness manifests as multiplicity, how the fertile void births time and space.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I often wished for a PhD in physics. The universe can only communicate what we can understand.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Integration then is ingestion, digestion, and metabolism. Too much opening without enough digestion can mimic psychosis—an “eating disorder” of the soul.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The work carries risks and needs careful supports. But I did not feel on the psychosis edge. The opening unfolded systematically, peeling layers safely.

**CHRIS BACHE:** If integration had failed, I would have paused. For me, there was always a comfortable congealing after opening. Constitution matters. One needs a strong enough self to be no one.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Toward the end you stopped after 73 sessions. Your system was running hot. The feast exceeded capacity to digest in this lifetime.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That’s fair. Not because I failed to ride the winds, but because I rode them too long.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Our traditions often underestimate the dimensions of the divine. Even skillful use can open intimacy with the universe beyond time and space. Coming back became too painful. I chose to stay and digest.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** You write movingly about longing for death as return to the beloved. Why will dissolution at death be easier or different than now?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I don’t think it will be different. If I died now, the training would serve. Spiritual and physical deaths are intertwined.

**CHRIS BACHE:** There is the domain of light and the green, manifest world—dharmakaya and nirmanakaya. They interpenetrate. Death is an intersection between modes.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’ve been taken through dying many times. I’ve studied the bardo confusions and addressed many. I may be wrong, but I expect death to be joyful and easy. Clinging has softened.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Let’s rebrand language. “Psychedelic” can be loaded; “entheogen” helps. “Death” could be “transition.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** In the diamond luminosity chapter, after many deaths, the concept of death loses meaning. You learn you cannot die. Form dies; you do not.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Repetition breeds familiarity. The Tibetan word for meditation means “to become familiar.” Die often and you befriend the process.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** His Holiness the Karmapa said at the moment of transition, “Nothing happens.” To reach that is cherished.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Agreed. Though my most extreme strip-down came in the 70th session. Context matters. Depth can be demanding even with surrender.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** If death is the grand opening, then we have something to look forward to. Near-death research shows how one encounter changes lives.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. One clear touch can dissolve thousands of years of wandering. People recognize reality’s objectivity. It is hyper-real.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Another theme: to become one with the universe, first become one within. Befriend the shadow and stop outsourcing it to the unconscious.

**CHRIS BACHE:** When you move into intimacy with life, unintegrated pieces surface to be healed. Oneness with life deepens oneness within, and vice versa. Integrity blossoms.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** And we must relinquish “private enlightenment.” Everything we do for others is our awakening.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. Service dissolves the last spiritual shadow.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** With your permission, let’s turn to the light—diamond luminosity. Would you walk us through?

**CHRIS BACHE:** This transition came 15 years into the work. I had passed ego death, the ocean of suffering, archetypal reality, and received profound blessings—oneness, shunyata, cosmic love, and insights into reincarnation and humanity’s future.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I had experienced many forms of light. Then, after a full death process, the next session dropped me directly into fruition and into a luminosity beyond any before.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I called it the death state. A swirling disc appeared containing all moments of my life. I fell from the center to touch one facet, instantly dying into luminosity, then returning to the center. Over and over, until coming and going ceased and I abided in that clarity.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Ecstasy, yes, but more than that—clarity. Breathtaking clarity. The context within which all thought and feeling occur, yet itself only clear.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Touching it for one second dissolves ages of samsaric shadow. I understood this as extrasamsaric reality. At first I thought sambhogakaya; later I recognized dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Of course I wanted to return next session, but I wasn’t taken back for a year. Five sessions of purification followed, then diamond luminosity again. This repeated: about a year of intense work, then re-entry.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The second immersion was deepest. My cosmology inverted. Far in the distance was a reality of light more exquisite still. A ray struck and shattered me. I called it absolute light—beyond diamond luminosity.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In an instant I realized there is no end state. It is an infinite progression. Death keeps returning as we push.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Later immersions did not go “deeper” but compressed diamond luminosity into my being, dissolving bodily structures, crunching into the cellular level in fierce purification.

**CHRIS BACHE:** This culminated in initiation into Buddha-nature, the pure nature of mind—embodied diamond luminosity, the abiding foundation of existence without beginning or end.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** *\[Music\]*

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Thank you for trusting us with that. Using Buddhist nomenclature risks shrink-wrapping the mystery, yet it orients us—dharma-dhatu, dharmakaya, clear light mind.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I use terms to point, but stay humble before the great contemplatives.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Another frame helps. The universe is 13.7 billion years old; Earth about 4.5. Self-awareness emerged gradually. Only a few thousand years ago did we develop technologies of mind to access the universal within.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Awakening is real, but it is the tip of an exquisite iceberg. If we look 100,000 years ahead—a blink in cosmic time—surely deeper capacities will flower.

**CHRIS BACHE:** So we honor categories and also refuse to ossify them. Openness keeps us in intimacy with the beloved and the light birthing the world each second.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** You used “extrasamsaric.” Do you mean beyond the bardos and cycles?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Beyond bardo patterns into a world of light. Individuality there is translucent, not annihilated. Liberation stabilizes individuality rather than extinguishing it.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Where does the light go when post-session reality returns? How does it relate to appearance?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The light doesn’t go anywhere. It manifests the world. Physics says matter is light—quarks, fields, energy. Deep mind finds light; deep matter is light. Two doors to one house.

**CHRIS BACHE:** When clear, the world is a miracle—genius at every scale. When clouded, the mind casts shadows.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Is the return to form a dissociation or a healthy differentiation?

**CHRIS BACHE:** There’s a pathological way and a happy way. In the happy way we return as a human bubble among countless bubbles, essence shared, forms diverse. Kinship deepens responsibility.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Let’s touch samadhi. Why does it end? Why not abide forever?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Some beings stabilize abiding clarity. For most of us, habits of embodiment reassert. If your aim is awakening, you can cultivate abiding transparency.

**CHRIS BACHE:** If your trajectory is cosmological exploration, the burden is temporariness. Breakfast still awaits.

**CHRIS BACHE:** A healthy way back trusts the wisdom of the universe and accepts human limits without inflation.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Then the aim is ending involuntary rebirth. Openness becomes so familiar that, at death, you abide as openness. Rebirth becomes voluntary, out of compassion.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That’s fair. Involuntary incarnation ends; voluntary embodiment begins. Long term, I believe we all become tulkus.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In one session, former lives streamed into me until they fused. A diamond light burst from my chest. Individual consciousness actualized to a degree I’d never known—the birth of the diamond soul.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I think humanity is gestating this collectively. We transition from escape-oriented moksha to awakening here. The “future human” is more peaceful, compassionate, creative, and insightful.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** To my ear, “growing down” into embodied integration complements “growing up.” Yet I struggle with optimism. Evolution stumbles. The winds don’t feel favorable.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Outside my visionary experience, I have no reason for optimism.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Beginning in the early 1990s, visions came unbidden: a turning point and a collective awakening.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In my 55th session, instead of diamond luminosity I dissolved into the collective psyche across deep time and experienced a global systems crisis—billions dying, an unraveling that felt like extinction.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Then the storm subsided. Survivors rebuilt with compounding freedom, insight, and values—a species-level death and rebirth.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In the 70th session, I was shown the archetypal structure of the future human. It brings me to tears even now.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I was also shown a mechanism. The collective psyche will enter a highly energized, non-linear state—far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Creativity will surge; change will accelerate beyond linear forecasts.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It will likely get very hard. We will lose hope repeatedly. A deeper vision can help us endure and act.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Let’s end with prescriptions. What can we do?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Duane Elgin’s *Choosing Earth* lays out the next five decades soberly and offers grounded actions for a safe landing. He gives the book away.

**CHRIS BACHE:** From a reincarnational view, each of us chose to be here now with the talents and challenges we carry. We are standing where we need to serve.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Make the commitment that your life counts toward the good, then look around. All talents are needed—medical, political, creative, practical.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Do spiritual practice. Face the shadow. Build community. Learn to do more with less. Share. Restructure social and political life away from ego.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Any final thread from *The Living Classroom*?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Consciousness is unified from the start. Everything we do radiates in a 360-degree field. Teaching and life have quantum qualities, not just atomistic ones. Strengthen the sinews that bind us to all life.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Conversations change lives. Thank you for your bravery, heart, and capacity.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, Andrew. Love and blessings.

**ANDREW HOLECEK:** Love and blessings. Until next time.

# Key themes

- Openness–contraction as the engine of awakening; LSD as an amplifier of consciousness that reveals and resolves

shadowed contractions through surrender, enabling deeper stabilizations of presence.

- Distinction between contemplative “slow-bake” realization and psychedelic cosmological exploration: temporary

immersion vs abiding realization, experience vs integration.

- Sequential descent and ascent: personal ego death, the ocean of collective suffering, archetypal domains,

emptiness, cosmic love, and recurrent initiations beyond time–space.

- Encounters with diamond luminosity (clear light mind / extrasamsaric reality), subsequent vision of an

“absolute light,” and insight that awakening is an infinite progression beyond any omega point.

- Integration ethics and risk: the necessity of strong constitutions, careful supports, and congealing after

openings; differentiating transformative stripping from destabilizing psychosis.

- Dying before dying: ego death as direct training for physical death; near-death research, fear dissolution,

and the stance that “nothing happens” in transition.

- Reincarnation reframed: ending involuntary rebirth, moving toward voluntary embodiment (tulku dynamic), and

the “diamond soul” as fused continuity of lifetimes.

- Nondual physics and phenomenology: light as foundation of matter and mind; individuality liberated rather than

erased, grounding kinship and ecological responsibility.

- Species pivot: visions of global crisis leading to non-linear, far-from-equilibrium transformation and the

emergence of the “future human.”

- Practical injunctions: shadow work, service, community, sharing, political maturation, and Duane Elgin’s

*Choosing Earth* as a pragmatic guide to a “safe landing.”

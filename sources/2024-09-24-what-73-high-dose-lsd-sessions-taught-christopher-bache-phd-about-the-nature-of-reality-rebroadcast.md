*Part 1*

Chris Bache joins hosts Steve Theer and Reed Robinson on *Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers* to discuss

insights from 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over two decades. He outlines his rigorous

Grof-informed protocol—eye shades, curated music, trusted sitter—and explains why very high doses

(500–600 µg) shift the focus from personal therapy to cosmological exploration and collective

processes. Bache describes cycles of death and rebirth beyond ego death, deep integration practices,

and how standardized set and setting allowed a progressive deepening of contact with transpersonal

realms. He reflects on reincarnation, karma as cause-and-effect across lifetimes, and the synergy

between individual and collective healing. Looking ahead, he shares visionary material about a global

crisis catalyzing the “birth of the future human,” culminating in what he calls the Diamond Soul—an

awakening of the reincarnating self within embodied life. He also touches on psychedelics’ role in

cultural transformation and the urgency of ecological challenges.

**STEVE THEER:** Welcome back to *Psychedelic Therapy Frontiers*, the podcast devoted to exploring the

frontiers of psychedelic medicine and what it takes to cultivate a healthy mind, body, and spirit. As

always, the show is brought to you by Numinus. I’m Dr. Steve Theer, and my co-host Dr. Reed Robinson

and I are joined today by Dr. Christopher Bache, PhD.

**STEVE THEER:** Chris is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at

Youngstown State University, adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an

emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy

Training. He’s authored several books, most notably *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, which

recounts what he experienced and learned from 73 high-dose LSD journeys over twenty years.

**STEVE THEER:** In today’s conversation we explore Chris’s session protocol; the difference between

using psychedelics for cosmological exploration versus spiritual enlightenment or psychological

healing; how he processed and integrated intense experiences; what he learned about reincarnation and

evolution at individual and collective levels; existential threats facing humanity; what he means by

Diamond Luminosity and the Diamond Soul; and much more.

**STEVE THEER:** If you’re seeking training in psychedelic-assisted therapy, Numinus offers several

**STEVE THEER:** Chris, thank you so much for joining us.

**CHRIS BACHE:** It’s a pleasure to be here with you today.

**STEVE THEER:** To start, would you introduce yourself and share the path that brought you to this

work?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’m a retired professor of religious studies. I taught in the Department of

Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, a state university in northeast

Ohio. Early in my academic career—around 1978—I encountered Stan Grof’s work and recognized its

extraordinary importance, not only for clinical psychology but for philosophy, which was my main

interest.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Though illegal at the time, I began a quiet, private psychedelic practice. I worked

intensively for four years, paused for six, then continued for another ten, totaling twenty years of

sessions from ages thirty to fifty. After that I spent two decades digesting and clarifying the

cosmological implications, which became *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*.

**STEVE THEER:** Reading your book, I thought, “What a heroic undertaking.” You’ve said you don’t

recommend your protocol to others. Why?

**CHRIS BACHE:** First, the protocol: everything I did followed a strict therapeutic frame aligned

with Grof’s *LSD Psychotherapy*—lying down, eyeshades, carefully curated music, and always a trusted

sitter. My sitter was my then-wife, a clinical psychologist. The container was sacred and stable.

**CHRIS BACHE:** After a few sessions at 250 micrograms, I chose to work at 500–600 micrograms—the

upper, body-saturation range. I initially assumed the work was about personal transformation and

purifying karma. I thought higher doses would process more material faster.

**CHRIS BACHE:** That assumption proved wrong. At very high doses, consciousness is amplified so

deeply that what may begin as personal healing is drawn into collective processes—the species mind,

archetypal and causal levels. Ego death is only the first of many deaths. This path is extremely

demanding and becomes a central focus of one’s life. It’s not about reaching a final destination; the

journey is effectively endless. If I began again, I’d work more gently, balancing low and high doses,

and organic and synthetic medicines. The goal is to open to love, intelligence, and wisdom, to let it

reshape your life—not to “arrive.”

**REED ROBINSON:** What are the risks of going straight to those deep states at high doses? Do you risk

bypassing important healing that lower-dose work might address?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Any higher-dose therapeutic work requires careful screening. Some people shouldn’t use

psychedelics; others should proceed very gently. My constitution allowed me to expand and re-cohere

smoothly, but not everyone is wired that way.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In my case I didn’t bypass. The first ten sessions—about two and a half years—were

grueling perinatal work: reliving birth, existential crises, deep clearing. Personal healings happened

throughout, often at the beginning and end of sessions as I left and re-entered time-space. Later,

some healings occurred rapidly. If I had stayed lower dose, those might have surfaced earlier.

**CHRIS BACHE:** A key insight: my personal wounds anchored one end of a bridge to the collective

psyche. That anchoring allowed my sessions to become a conduit for transmuting some portion of the

collective pain. Had my wounds resolved too quickly, that conduit might have closed. I came to feel

this bridging was part of my soul’s work in this life.

**REED ROBINSON:** How much of the ability to enter and hold these states is temperament versus training?

Can people cultivate it?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Both. We can learn to enter non-ordinary states more skillfully if we prepare, proceed

carefully, and integrate thoroughly. Integration—detailed debriefing, journaling, and living the

teachings—sets the baseline for the next session.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I minimized variables across twenty years: same substance, dose, setting, sitter,

recording process—even the same region. Standardizing the contact zone let the conversation with the

universe deepen progressively. Different medicines have different headroom; LSD has broad

cosmological reach. With psilocybin I’d expect overlap but perhaps less “ceiling.”

**REED ROBINSON:** How did your wife feel about long-term trip-sitting?

**CHRIS BACHE:** She did it out of love. Psychedelics weren’t her path—they felt too much, too fast. She

was and is a deeply spiritual person. After twenty-four years we separated but remain friends and co-

parents. She later completed an intensive multi-year retreat in her tradition. Her wisdom grounded me

while I did this work, though it was never her work.

**STEVE THEER:** I’m struck by your rigor. Controlling variables feels like returning to the same drill

site to core deeper. Many people keep changing set, setting, or medicine and “pock-mark the surface.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** There’s no single right way—many good ways exist. My training inclined me toward

precision and analysis. I also wanted breadcrumbs in case I needed to find my way back out.

**STEVE THEER:** You’ve written that you began as an atheist-leaning agnostic. How did these experiences

shift your stance toward the divine?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Graduate study led me out of traditional religion and theism. But repeated, structured

journeys through death-rebirth into transpersonal realities make the existence of realities beyond

time-space undeniable—existentially, not just philosophically.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I never met a deity or personal guide. I felt guided by an intelligence whose scope

deepened as my practice deepened. I avoid the word “God” due to baggage. I speak of the creative

intelligence of the universe: mind within and prior to matter, sustaining the cosmos we know. Our

historical concepts are profoundly incomplete. Psychedelics are helping us rewrite them from lived

contact.

**STEVE THEER:** So who are we in that story? Are we the universe experiencing itself—fractal

expressions of a nearly infinite intelligence?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes, that’s a good frame. Our bodies arise from an evolutionary masterpiece; our minds

arise from the universe as well. As we drop beneath the personal psyche into species, planetary, and

galactic fields, we encounter a breathtaking intelligence saturated with compassion.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Add reincarnation—not as belief but as an empirical hypothesis supported by evidence.

I see reincarnation as a higher octave of evolution, folding learning forward at the level of the

individual soul. Individuality seems to emerge somewhere in the evolutionary arc—certainly by

mammalian life—allowing iterative refinement across lifetimes.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Beneath the soul lies essence: the divine itself. We are sparks teased from unity,

polished over thousands of cycles—spirit into matter and back again—until that deeper identity awakens

within embodied life.

**REED ROBINSON:** How do you see karma now?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Karma is simply cause and effect shaped by choice. We make choices and inherit

consequences; then we choose again. My view has shifted toward the synergy of personal and collective

karma. Our species is evolving through reincarnational pulses; the boundary between individual and

collective learning is porous.

**REED ROBINSON:** Any thoughts on McKenna’s “stoned ape” hypothesis?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Interesting, but I have no special insight. More broadly, I think we’re at a make-or-break

turning point. Psychedelics can accelerate healing and widen worldview. It’s not incidental that LSD

and the nuclear bomb appeared in the same decade; that synchronicity has always struck me.

**STEVE THEER:** Do you have a view on artificial intelligence?

**CHRIS BACHE:** My sessions ended in 1999; AI never appeared in them. From the sidelines, I’m concerned

but open. What most concerns me is the ecological cliff we’re approaching—cascading imbalances

driving global instability throughout this century.

**REED ROBINSON:** How much of that realization came from your sessions versus life experience? And how

might psychedelics help us find a better path?

**CHRIS BACHE:** The ecological urgency I now feel was foreshadowed in sessions from 1991–1995. I was

shown we’re entering an evolutionary pivot: a profound unraveling followed by the birth of the future

human. For years I was shown radiant visions without mechanisms. In December 1995, while immersed in

Diamond Luminosity work, I was dissolved into the species mind and lived the death and rebirth of the

human family.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I experienced a global systems crisis—felt like cascading ecological shocks—driving

humanity to the bare challenge of survival. It looked almost like extinction. At the nadir, something

gave way; we moved through, and a fundamental change in the human heart dawned. It felt like a shift in

the plate tectonics of the collective psyche: new values, new institutions, compassion at scale.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I was “taught” mechanisms for rapid collective change when a unified field—our

collective psyche—is shoved far from equilibrium. As in physical systems, novel structures can emerge

quickly and small inputs can have outsized effects. The crisis accelerates transformation.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Later I encountered the archetypal future human—a magnificently heart-open being whose

mind and senses are refined far beyond ours. As consciousness consolidates in the body, perception

clarifies; in one session my vision was orders of magnitude sharper. This is the pivot I call the

birth of the Diamond Soul.

**STEVE THEER:** Do any religious frameworks map onto this—say, the Kali Yuga cycle into a new golden

age?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Many prophecies point to a dark age giving way to renewal. I see today’s “darkness” as

a forced surfacing of karmic conditioning—hatreds, splits of race, gender, nation, wealth—so the psyche

can be cleared and infused with grace. The image of Kali as fierce liberator fits: destruction and

awakening as one movement.

**STEVE THEER:** Integration can be hard. In therapy we see crisis as a refiner’s fire. How did you

handle the aftershocks of those collective visions?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Integration is everything. It took me a year to recover from that 1995 session. If you

go deep, you must be well-grounded—physically, emotionally, psychologically, socially. My sense is we

choose our lives before birth; many of us chose to incarnate now to participate in this demanding

transition—for our sake, our descendants’ sake, and, in a real sense, for the sake of the divine.

**STEVE THEER:** How do you reconcile that with horrific suffering—infants born into disease or war?

Why would any soul choose that?

**CHRIS BACHE:** On the surface, life can be brutal. From within time-space and an individual vantage,

the question is unanswerable. From a wider view, nothing is wasted; all suffering is conserved and

used. The divine experiences all of it with us. I can’t explain it fully, but direct encounters with

the love and wisdom behind existence taught me to trust beyond what I can understand. The love of the

universe is fierce. The path is demanding—and attended.

**REED ROBINSON:** Who have been your teachers? How should people proceed wisely?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I taught comparative mysticism and world religions, so the great masters were my

touchstones. I had no psychedelic mentor; the universe was my teacher—tender and ruthless by turns.

For most people, don’t do this alone. Work in responsible settings, with experienced guides and

communities that can help you prepare, enter, and integrate.

**REED ROBINSON:** Could you share more about the “birth of the Diamond Soul” and what a path forward

looks like?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Midway through my journey—in my 38th session after intense purification—I felt all my

former lives pour into me, winding like string onto a kite spool. At a critical mass they fused—an

explosion of diamond light from my chest—and I was catapulted into a mode of individuality beyond any I

had known. Teachings followed for months to anchor it.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Classic “up-and-out” models say we improve lifetime by lifetime until we awaken and

depart. I was shown that’s only half the story. If we keep incarnating long enough, the soul destined

to awaken eventually wakes up *inside* embodied life. That is the Diamond Soul.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Imagine the whole species undergoing this labor. We’ve gestated the future human for

hundreds of thousands of years; gestation is long, labor is short and intense. We cannot run this

planet from egoic consciousness. We must grow up or go extinct. My experiences show we make it

through—barely perhaps—but on the other side we will say it was worth it.

**STEVE THEER:** I’m deeply grateful for your work and your willingness to share it.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you. It’s an honor to be in conversation and to share these teachings.

**STEVE THEER:** Where can people find you?

**CHRIS BACHE:** My website is chrisbache.com. Many papers are also on academia.edu under my name. I’m

not teaching formally at present. I’m giving talks, and retreats may be emerging.

**STEVE THEER:** Thanks again, Chris.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you, and thank you both for the healing work you bring into the world.

**Abstract (145 words)**

Philosopher of religion **Chris Bache** joins Conscious TV host **Ian McNay** to discuss the disciplined

psychedelic research that underpins *Diamonds from Heaven*—his chronicle of 73

high-dose LSD sessions conducted over twenty years. Bache explains how

Stanislav Grof’s therapeutic protocol, rigorous note-keeping, and months-long

integration cycles allowed him to explore successive layers of reality: ego

death, collective suffering, archetypal domains, and the diamond luminosity of

dharmakaya. He contrasts this methodical inquiry with recreational “tripping,”

describes the energetic toll such work takes on the body, and reflects on the

deep sadness that followed his final sessions—a “loss of communion” eventually

healed through family life, nature, and writing. The conversation also covers

Bache’s concept of “quantum pedagogy,” where private mystical practice

mysteriously activates his university students, illustrating consciousness as a

shared field rather than an isolated phenomenon.

**IAN MCNAY:**

Hello and welcome again to Conscious TV. I’m Ian McNay, and my guest today is

Chris Bache. Hi, Chris.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Hi, Ian.

**IAN MCNAY:**

We discovered you after a London lecture and thought your story fascinating.

You’ve written *Life Cycles*, *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, *The Living Classroom*,

and an upcoming book, *Diamonds from Heaven*, about a twenty-year journey into

the mind of the universe.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Yes. I was trained as a philosopher of religion—concerned with life’s meaning,

the universe’s structure, and the limits of consciousness. In 1978 I read

Stanislav Grof’s *Realms of the Human Unconscious*, was stunned by its rigor,

and decided to explore those realms myself.

**IAN MCNAY:**

Your driving questions were about consciousness—its potentials and

boundaries—rather than the usual *Who am I?* themes.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Exactly. Meeting Ian Stevenson’s reincarnation work and Grof’s psychedelic

research the same year blew my agnostic framework apart. I split my life:

publicly a university professor; privately, from 1979-1999, 73 high-dose LSD

sessions using Grof’s eyeshade-music protocol—500-600 µg each time.

**IAN MCNAY:**

All carefully documented.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Within twenty-four hours I wrote full phenomenological notes—dates, music,

dose, body temperature—everything. Over years I saw a sequential curriculum: ego

death, immersion in humanity’s ocean of suffering, archetypal realities, and

finally the diamond light of dharmakaya.

**IAN MCNAY:**

That takes courage. You surrender without knowing where it leads.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Grof taught me to trust the process. Each shattering is held by a greater

intelligence. You die, awaken as another being, and continue the dialogue.

**IAN MCNAY:**

What dies, exactly?

**CHRIS BACHE:**

First the personal ego—the conditioned story of “Chris Bache.” Later even the

sense of being human dissolves, opening to archetypal and causal domains:

realities of immense energy that require repeated visits to stabilize awareness.

**IAN MCNAY:**

You never used LSD recreationally.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Never. No concerts, no late-night chats. This was disciplined cosmological

research.

**IAN MCNAY:**

Mid-journey you wrote *The Living Classroom*, noting how private sessions

mysteriously activated your students.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Yes. Synchronicities exploded. My spontaneous lecture examples mirrored their

weekends. I realized classrooms have morphic fields; teaching became quantum

pedagogy—opening and closing those fields responsibly.

**IAN MCNAY:**

After your final sessions you felt profound sadness.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

I’d tasted the diamond light so deeply that ordinary life seemed a grey exile.

Integration guidance said twenty years; I’m still absorbing. Family, students,

nature, and finally writing the book have re-rooted me in the imminent divine.

**IAN MCNAY:**

Do psychedelics and contemplative practice reach the same truths?

**CHRIS BACHE:**

My maps match the great mystical traditions. Psychedelics are simply a

different, accelerated method—though experience alone doesn’t make a mystic;

lifelong practice does.

**IAN MCNAY:**

Chris, thank you for sharing this extraordinary journey.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Thank you, Ian. It’s been a joy.

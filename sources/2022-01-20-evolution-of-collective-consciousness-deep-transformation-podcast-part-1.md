**Abstract**

Roger Walsh and co-host John Dupuis welcome philosopher of religion and psychedelic pioneer **Chris Bache** for a

wide-ranging discussion on collective awakening. Walsh sketches the West’s transition from a “monophasic” culture

rooted in ordinary waking consciousness to a “polyphasic” civilization that values multiple altered states. Bache

recounts his 20-year program of 73 high-dose LSD sessions—an inquiry that shifted from personal transformation to

species-level healing and a vision of humanity’s imminent evolutionary leap. The trio explore the purifying power of

death-rebirth cycles, the pitfalls of ego inflation, and the promise of a future “diamond soul” humanity forged through

crisis. Throughout, Bache emphasizes trust in the process, humility before the “Mother,” and the necessity of grounding

mystical insight in compassionate action. The conversation closes with a call for courage and service as humanity

navigates its collective dark night toward a luminous future.

**ROGER WALSH**: *\[Music fades\]* Welcome to Deep Transformation—self, society, spirit. I’m Roger Walsh.

**JOHN DUPUIS**: And I’m John Dupuis. Today’s guest is the remarkable Chris Bache—philosopher, award-winning teacher,

and explorer of psychedelic consciousness.

**ROGER WALSH**: Before diving in, I’d like to set context. Western culture has long been “monophasic,” privileging the

waking state. Over 90 percent of the world’s cultures are “polyphasic,” institutionalizing altered states for

knowledge. That is changing here through psychedelics and contemplative practices. Research now shows these substances

offer profound therapeutic and spiritual value. Chris has devoted decades to systematically exploring them.

**JOHN DUPUIS**: Chris, your book *Dark Night, Early Dawn* changed my life—it stabilized my sense of non-duality. This

new book, *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, feels even bigger. Either you’re completely sane or utterly insane—and my

experience says it’s deeply true.

**CHRIS BACHE**: Thank you, John. All my life I’ve wanted to understand reality. Seminary, theology at Notre Dame,

philosophy at Cambridge and Brown—yet I left an agnostic. Then I read Stan Grof’s *Realms of the Human Unconscious*. He

showed LSD could safely probe consciousness. I realized future contributions to philosophy of religion would be

experiential, not merely intellectual. So, in 1979, I began a 20-year journey: 73 sessions at 500–600 µg, eyeshades,

music, and a clinical-psychologist sitter—my then-wife, Carol. My intent was personal purification, but high doses blew

me beyond the individual into collective realms. I came to see the work aimed at healing humanity itself.

**ROGER WALSH**: You faced hell realms—collective suffering—again and again. What kept you going?

**CHRIS BACHE**: Trust in the process. Surrender leads through death to ecstatic teaching. The universe meets you,

educates you, then breaks you down further. Initially I thought I was clearing personal karma. Later I realized I was

processing unhealed wounds of the species. High doses activate wider fields; you become a bit-player in a vaster drama.

**JOHN DUPUIS**: Did you feel guided?

**CHRIS BACHE**: Absolutely. An intelligence titrated experiences so I could acclimate. Each ceiling demanded another

death—first ego, then a “shamanic persona,” then deeper structures. Eventually dying became purification.

**ROGER WALSH**: You describe the “diamond luminosity” as beyond the bardo—contact with clear light.

**CHRIS BACHE**: Yes. I touched it four times. Each immersion compressed that light into my cells, opening “diamond

vision.” I saw as the future human will see—senses amplified, heart cracked open. The message: humanity is gestating a

collective birth. We will face a crushing ordeal, think ourselves extinct, yet emerge transformed.

**JOHN DUPUIS**: That adds nobility—moving from personal quest to service.

**CHRIS BACHE**: Service is inevitable when you know all beings are yourself.

**ROGER WALSH**: After stopping sessions, you entered a “deep sadness,” waiting to die.

**CHRIS BACHE**: I had overdosed on transcendence. Integration required grounding—family, teaching, Vajrayāna

practice—so the light could incarnate. Too much of a good thing can unbalance you.

**ROGER WALSH**: What map of reality emerges?

**CHRIS BACHE**: A universe of unspeakable genius and love, endlessly birthing individuality for ever-deepening

communion. Death is liberation, not loss. Existence is self-healing, self-transcending.

**JOHN DUPUIS**: Any closing words?

**CHRIS BACHE**: Lose the fear of death. Live courageously. The Mother is bringing us home.

**Abstract (140 words)**

Host **Jessica DiRuzza** welcomes philosopher and LSD researcher **Chris Bache** to Trust Psyche’s free monthly livestream. Bache presents key ideas from *LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven*, recounting 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years. He outlines his “psychedelic exploration” methodology—eye shades, curated music, and doses of 500–600 µg—and traces a five-stage journey: ego death, immersion in the “ocean of suffering,” encounters with deep time and archetypal realms, visionary teachings on humanity’s evolutionary crisis, and repeated entries into the “diamond luminosity” (dharmakaya). Bache details the therapeutic, cosmological, and collective dimensions of these experiences, emphasizing the volunteer nature of engaging collective trauma and the need for rigorous integration. The session concludes with an extended Q&A covering dose, set-and-setting, grounding practices, astrological correlations, and the lingering presence of historical trauma in the collective psyche.

Chris’s 73 high-dose LSD sessions over 20 years radically expanded our cosmology.

There couldn’t be a more important time to hear his insights as humanity faces a collective psychospiritual death-and-rebirth.

Please give a warm welcome to Chris.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Thank you, Jessica and Travis. It’s an honor to share my work with Trust Psyche.

Compressing 20 years of experience into one talk is challenging, so I’ll keep the overview brief and leave at least half an hour for questions.

*Methodology*

Raised Catholic in Mississippi, I trained as a philosopher of religion and entered academia an agnostic.

The 1960s passed me by; I was naive about psychedelics until Stan Grof’s *Realms of the Human Unconscious* changed everything.

Between 1979 and 1999 I conducted 73 sessions, typically 500–600 µg of LSD, using Grof’s high-dose protocol: eye shades, headphones, curated music, and a skilled sitter (my wife, a clinical psychologist).

I approached the work as a philosopher, seeking cosmological understanding rather than personal therapy, yet healing inevitably occurred.

I documented each session within 24 hours—about 400 pages of journals—and tracked astrological transits to study potential correlations.

*Five concentric death-rebirth cycles*

1\. **Death of self:** Ego dissolution revealed a vast collective mind.

2\. **Ocean of suffering:** Two years confronting collective trauma spanning centuries. Engaging it felt like cleansing the species’ psyche.

3\. **Deep time & soul review:** Re-experiencing my life as a completed whole, then successive lifetimes fusing into a “diamond soul.”

4\. **Archetypal reality:** Eleven sessions exploring Jungian and Platonic realms, guided by immense intelligences shaping evolution.

5\. **Diamond luminosity:** Four major entries into the clear light (dharmakaya), a state of incomparable clarity and love, followed by demanding purification phases.

*Visions of the future human*

From session 22 onward I received visions of a planetary crisis leading to a species-wide awakening.

A “great death” precedes a “great birth,” propelling humanity into a higher collective consciousness—the diamond soul.

I was shown the transformation from within the collective psyche rather than as external prophecy.

*Integration and the “deep sadness”*

Ending the work brought unexpected grief: a loss of daily communion with the divine.

Over a decade I relearned embodiment through family life, teaching, meditation, and yoga, regaining balance between transcendence and immanence.

**AUDIENCE MEMBER (Israel):**

What do you mean by “high dose,” and what was your set and setting?

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Doses were 500–600 µg. Sessions occurred indoors, lying down, eye shades on, carefully sequenced music, and a trusted sitter always present.

Grounding came from marriage, fatherhood, teaching, meditation, and yoga—rhythms that anchored me after each descent.

**KARI:**

How did astrological transits influence your sessions, and did collective healing show up in everyday life?

**CHRIS BACHE:**

Early correlations were clear, but at deeper levels the astrological mapping grew complex.

Collective effects manifested in my classrooms: students spontaneously processed material resonant with my inner work, leading me to write *The Living Classroom*.

**PAULINE (Poland):**

Did you encounter traumas like the Holocaust?

**CHRIS BACHE:**

The suffering felt planetary—millions across millennia—rather than specific events, yet such traumas were implicitly present in the collective field I engaged.

**PATRICK (Breathwork facilitator):**

Your “ocean of suffering” framework helps facilitators distinguish personal from collective material. Thank you.

**CHRIS BACHE:**

We’re volunteers in this work. Deep giving eventually brings profound gifts and supports the birth of the future human.

**JESSICA DIRUZZA:**

Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone worldwide for joining us.

May your own explorations bring healing to yourselves and the collective.

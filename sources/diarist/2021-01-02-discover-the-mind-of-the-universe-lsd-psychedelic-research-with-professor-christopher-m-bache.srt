00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,660
Luisa: Passion harvest. Hello,
passionate listeners and

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,140
watchers, welcome to passion
harvest. I am Luis, your host,

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,320
international passion
ambassador. I am really, really,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,440
really excited about my guest
today, his I've just read his

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,440
amazing book, and if you don't
know who he is, Christopher M

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,540
Bache, Professor Christopher M
Bache set out to explore his

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,960
mind and the mind of the
universe on what will become a

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,600
life changing journey with the
help of the psychedelic drug,

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,180
LSD, Chris's 73 high dose LSD
sessions over the course of 20

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,420
years drew him into a deeper
communion with cosmic

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,400
consciousness, pushing the
boundaries of theory and

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,060
practice. Chris's psychedelic
experiences took him beyond self

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,600
transformation into collective
transformation beyond the

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,660
present into the future,
revealing spirit and matter in

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,460
perfect balance. Christopher M
Bache, PhD is a professor in the

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,100
Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at young town

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,440
State University, where he
taught for 33 years. He is also

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,860
the adjunct faculty at the
California Institute of integral

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,280
studies, Emeritus, I hope I said
that properly, fellow at the

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,940
Institute of Noetic Sciences,
sciences and the Advisory

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,500
Council of Grof legacy training.
Chris's passion has been the

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,760
study of philosophical
implications of Non-ordinary

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,840
states of consciousness,
especially psychedelic states.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,980
An award winning teacher and
international speaker, Chris has

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,900
written four books, life cycles,
a study of reincarnation in

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,140
light of contemporary
consciousness, research dark

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,760
night, early dawn, a pioneering
work in psychedelic philosophy

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,300
and collective consciousness,
the living classroom and

29
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,260
exploration of collective fields
of consciousness in teaching and

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,820
LSD and the mind of the
universe, the story of his of

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,500
his 20 year journey with LSD.
This is his story, and this is

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,520
his passion. Professor,
Christopher embassy, welcome to

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,180
passion harvest. Thank you so
much for being here. My

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,180
pleasure. Louisa, it's nice to
be with you. It's so nice to be

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,660
with you. I've just read your
book. It's fabulous. I'd like to

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,500
dive right in for those that
haven't read it, and the link,

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,840
all the links will be in the
show notes, what is the Book

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,520
about? And what story are you
telling? That's two questions.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,180
I'm sorry, but

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,320
Unknown: Well, I was trained as
a philosopher of religion, and

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,320
right as I was beginning my
career at young sound State

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,740
University, I met the work of
Stanislav Grof, the foremost

43
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,740
authority of integrating
psychedelics into psychotherapy.

44
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,860
I read his book, realms of the
human unconscious, which had

45
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,140
just been published. This is
Long time ago, in 1978 and I saw

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,480
that this work was
extraordinarily important. I

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,820
mean, we're undergoing a
renaissance of psychedelic

48
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,480
research now, but Stan's work
comes from the early generation.

49
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,860
He was in the earliest tier of
this research. So I read his

50
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,480
work, I saw what, how important
this was, not just to

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,640
psychology, but to philosophy.
And so I just had to find out

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,020
for myself what using
psychedelics was using LSD in a

53
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,260
very careful and specific way,
in a very controlled

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,860
circumstances, using a
therapeutic protocol, you know,

55
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,740
pioneered by the early
researchers Stan, particularly

56
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,200
what it could teach me about
myself, about my mind, and

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,640
ultimately, the mind of the
universe. So I began a 20 year

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,920
what became a 20 year journey. I
chose, perhaps foolishly, to

59
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,640
choose a regimen working with
very high doses of LSD. In these

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,100
control circumstances, I did 73
high dose sessions

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,860
systematically over 20 years,
recording the results and after

62
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,140
I had finished. In 79 I did this
work when I was 30 to 50. After

63
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,740
I finished the work, I took
another 20 years to think about

64
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,960
and digest and process these
experiences. Eventually, 20

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,220
years later, in 1999 publishing
LSD in the mind of the universe,

66
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,120
which is this the complete story
from beginning to end of where

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,540
this journey took me into the
universe.

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
Luisa: I said before the
interview, I'm almost jealous,

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,320
in a way, what you experienced,
but you did experience such

70
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,580
deep, emotional and physical
suffering, but such deep,

71
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,360
profound insight of universal
truths. Do you mind just

72
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,880
explaining to the audience, and
you do detail this in your book,

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,500
what a session looks like.

74
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,580
Unknown: A session. My Sessions
always began in the early

75
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,540
morning. You're all I was always
isolated. I was either in my

76
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,000
home or in my wife's office. I
was always had a sitter who

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,980
carefully took care of me and
monitored me. My wife, my sitter

78
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,720
was my first wife, Carl, who is
a clinical psychologist. I'm

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,960
always lying down on a mattress
on the floor surrounded by

80
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,800
pillows. I'm listening. I have
my eyes covered with eye shades.

81
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,540
I'm. Listening with earphones to
very carefully selected music to

82
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,260
pace the unfolding of the
session, totally protected from

83
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,540
outside, outside interferences,
internally focused, focused

84
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,520
deeply within and they last all
day. They last basically from

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,560
early morning about eight hours
into the late afternoon or early

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,160
evening.

87
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,399
Luisa: And I asked you, before
the physical toll on the body,

88
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:33,559
what was that like, aside from
the emotional aspects and the

89
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,939
spiritual, the physical?

90
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,780
Unknown: Well, physically, I
mean, I'm fine. It's actually a

91
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,300
very beneficial process, because
in this work, when the body

92
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,020
begins, I mean, basically LSD is
an amplifier of consciousness.

93
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,620
It hyper stimulates, hyper
amplifies consciousness. Our

94
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,280
conventional, commonplace
understanding of psychedelics is

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,560
quite wrong. We're coming into a
new era of psychedelic research,

96
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,740
the public is being educated to
a deeper understanding of what

97
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,400
these substances do, but they
basically hyper amplify

98
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,200
consciousness. And if you use
this amplified state carefully

99
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,760
and conscientiously, your body
begins a detoxification process.

100
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,900
It begins to pull out of your
system all the things you'd

101
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,080
rather not face, all the things
you're scared of, all the things

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,260
you're afraid of, all the things
that basically your shadow.

103
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,700
Classically, you begin these
things begin to come up at you.

104
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,980
And if you confront them clearly
and conscientiously, you

105
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,100
basically can begin to lift
these things out of your system

106
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,820
you go through, eventually, a
death and rebirth process, your

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,560
total identity that you had
developed over your lifetime on

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,420
Earth, ultimately is shattered
and you are spun into deeper

109
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,440
Transpersonal or spiritual
states of consciousness. If you

110
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,680
continue this work, this cycle
of purification continues, and

111
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,180
the difficult material that you
have to process comes from

112
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,720
beyond the personal psyche. It
comes from deeper levels of

113
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,660
consciousness, the collective
levels of consciousness, the

114
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,860
species mind, archetypal levels
of consciousness. And I know

115
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,360
this is a radical story. I mean,
I really do. I understand how

116
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,900
far beyond most people's
experience this is, and I

117
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,540
understand how off the wall it
is just, I

118
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,040
Luisa: think, I think it's
incredible,

119
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,820
Unknown: but, but basically, you
go through deep, deep, deep

120
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,600
purification processes, which
are well known in the spiritual,

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,400
mystical traditions. You're
clearing a lot of material, not

122
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,580
only from your own body, mind
history, but also from the

123
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,540
history of your species and so
on and so forth. And it involves

124
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,380
a lot of physical detoxification
as well, a lot of purification

125
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,880
of your body. The net result,
even though you go through some

126
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,340
very difficult purification,
suffering, multiple deaths and

127
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,600
rebirths, the cumulative effect
is very clarifying on your body

128
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,500
and on your emotions. It's very
uplifting, because when you go

129
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,980
through these intense
purifications, you are spun into

130
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,980
very, very deep, positive,
ecstatic states of

131
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,620
consciousness, which deepen as
the process progresses. So my

132
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,520
body is in good shape. I think
my emotions are in good shape.

133
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,060
It was been an adventuresome and
avengersome journey. I just

134
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,620
wouldn't have missed it for the
world.

135
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,659
Luisa: It's incredible. And
what's interesting, you talk

136
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,439
about the death and the rebirth,
you also talk about the death

137
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:43,419
and the rebirth of the ego, or
the removal of the ego. And even

138
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,959
more interesting, during this
process, you had to surrender.

139
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:54,819
But in this process of growth
and evolution, you also affected

140
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:59,199
the collective consciousness,
which is a very interesting way

141
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,999
of thinking about it.

142
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,920
Unknown: And surprising to me. I
wasn't expecting this at all. I

143
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,800
was thinking when I got into
this work that this was about

144
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,760
personal healing or personal
transformation, personal

145
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,960
enlightenment. But what I found
after going through two years of

146
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,680
this work and going into the
second two years of the work, I

147
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,800
started processing enormous,
vast tracts of pain, I started

148
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,520
being drawn into fields of
suffering that really were like

149
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,680
Dante's Inferno. Just 1000s and
1000s of beings and 1000s of

150
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,820
years of human suffering were
just passing through me, flowing

151
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,500
through me. And at first, I
thought this was a deeper form

152
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,600
of ego death. But this kept on
for so many years, and it was so

153
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,440
collective that I eventually was
forced to consider an

154
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,920
alternative understanding, which
has become my normative

155
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,000
understanding, and that is that
in these very, very intense

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,520
states of consciousness.
Something in the universe uses

157
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,160
these states of consciousness to
heal the scars, certain scars

158
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,360
that are collected in the human
collective unconscious, which

159
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,680
history is deposited into the
human collective unconscious, so

160
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,200
that instead of healing my
personal psyche or even former

161
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,600
life trauma. I spent years
healing various trauma that had

162
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,020
gotten lodged into the
collective unconscious. And this

163
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,860
is what I mean, that personal
transformation opens into

164
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,140
collective transformation. Now I
think that all of us are always

165
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,760
hard wired into the collective
psyche, and that all of us, when

166
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,000
we are undergoing various
spiritual, you know, our own

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,780
personal issues, we are
simultaneously processing

168
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,500
collective issues that our
healing has an impact on the

169
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,200
collective psyche. It's just
that when you work with

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,260
psychedelics, this kind of
becomes intensified. It becomes

171
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,180
paramount. So yeah, I spent two
years doing this collective

172
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,600
healing, and then I was spun
into yet another level of

173
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,380
consciousness where the rules of
the game changed, changed again.

174
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,380
Luisa: I can't wait to hear
about that in a minute, but it's

175
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,900
so interesting, because we
always well, we think of

176
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,100
ourselves with our personal
transformation and growth, and I

177
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,220
want to reach this level. But
little do we necessarily realize

178
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,940
that it's we're working on a
collective level. So that would

179
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,440
also mean that the collective
consciousness is affecting us,

180
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,020
what the collective
consciousness is experiencing. I

181
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,740
mean, obviously we're living in
a crazy time in the world right

182
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,240
now, but it must. We can't
distance ourselves from the

183
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,300
impacts of that as much as we
would like to try.

184
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Unknown: Yeah, well, you know,
we're organically embedded, I

185
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,720
think, in the collective psyche.
Just like we're physically

186
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,260
embedded in the Eco ecology of
the earth, you can't separate us

187
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,120
from the ecology that surrounds
us psychologically. We are

188
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,540
embedded in the collective
psyche. My experience,

189
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,560
basically, has spent a lot of
time exploring the intimacy with

190
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,700
which we are embedded in the
psyche and the ways in which

191
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,860
each of our individual lives are
fractal cells within the larger

192
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,220
life of the species, which is
part of a fractal cell within

193
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,420
the larger life of the universe
itself and the solar system and

194
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,160
the galaxy. So we are
implemented, deeply implemented,

195
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,820
in our collective process.
Eventually, I found that there's

196
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,320
no separation between our
personal transformation and our

197
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,040
collective transformation, that
all of us are players on an

198
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,060
historical stage, all of our
individual issue. I mean,

199
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,720
picture any issue that anybody
is dealing with, no matter what

200
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,740
it is, and it has to be related
to something which is going on

201
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,300
in the collective we don't have
a private issue, but isn't

202
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,460
reflected in some type of
dynamic in society which is

203
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,800
dealing with the same issue and
the way we're kind of like hard

204
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,860
wired together. And I know that
that's not the usual way of

205
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,160
thinking about it. I know that
our conventional psychology says

206
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,060
we're all completely standalone
computers. We're all, you know,

207
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,440
simply working on our personal
issues. But that's simply not my

208
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,280
experience. That's not what
shows in these deep states of

209
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,580
consciousness. In these deep
states of consciousness, it's

210
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,840
like we're networked. We are we
have separate private functions,

211
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,040
but we're also networked into
vast collective processes so

212
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,960
that we're engaging that all the
time.

213
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,380
Luisa: Yes, it's a careful
balance between being autonomous

214
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,580
and all one is it your belief
that we are, in fact, all one,

215
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,580
someone's described it as the
creator having multiple

216
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,360
personalities, which is the
humans. I'm just wondering,

217
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,680
what's your point of view?

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,620
Unknown: I think that core
insight that emerges in some of

219
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,460
the religious traditions, the
spiritual traditions that Atman

220
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,360
is Brahman, the essence of the
individual is the essence of the

221
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,920
totality. In my experience,
that's fundamentally true. It's

222
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,600
really true. You know, at the
core of our person is an energy,

223
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,680
a consciousness, an awareness,
an awakeness, and the nature of

224
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,940
that energy is the nature of the
Divine itself, that we are

225
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,340
sparks of the divine fire, and
that all of us, that you know,

226
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,060
oneness is one of the deepest,
most consistent and widespread

227
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,040
spiritual experiences that
emerges in mystical traditions

228
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,120
to experience oneness is a
totally transforming experience,

229
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,260
because out of oneness grows
compassion. Out of oneness grows

230
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,760
a concern for fairness and
justice, and also out of oneness

231
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,660
grows the technology, the
techniques for deepening our

232
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,100
immersion, our community.
Opinion with oneness. So that we

233
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
talk about someone being
mystically realized or

234
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,180
spiritually realized, it means
that they have gone through a

235
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:14,400
process where they become
transparent to the fundamental

236
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,380
oneness of life, and that they
live consciously now, both as an

237
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,660
individual and they are
individuals, and simultaneously,

238
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,180
they have, to varying degrees, a
feeling for our receptivity to

239
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,760
the fundamental oneness of
existence itself, the pulse of

240
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,560
existence as a totality.

241
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,320
Luisa: Yeah, it's really
interesting. We so often get

242
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,800
caught up in our own personal
stories. Yeah, very much. So are

243
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,060
our thoughts our own.

244
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,880
Unknown: They both are and
they're not. I mean, I think

245
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,600
it's a very interesting system.
Logically, we would think it

246
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,120
would have to be an either or,
but in fact, I think it's a much

247
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,420
more complex process. The
thoughts that I'm using right

248
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,840
now to speak to you are my own
thoughts. I'm kind of reaching

249
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,220
into my memories to bring them
to you. But if I if we step

250
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,420
back, if we were to step back
into deeper, more relaxed states

251
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,040
of consciousness, if we would
step into meditative states of

252
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,540
consciousness and deeply quieted
states of consciousness and seek

253
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,860
to watch where our thoughts come
from, we find that there are

254
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,740
actually a number of different
things that influence what

255
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,340
arises from the depth of our
awareness, and many of those

256
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:43,300
things that influence what
arises are really causes that

257
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,500
are outside my personal lineage,
causes which are collective,

258
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,700
causes which are spiritual,
causes which are historical,

259
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,560
causes which are cosmic, so that
what arises into focus in my

260
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,400
individual awareness, moment to
moment has a pedigree. And this

261
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,300
pedigree, I think, extends
beyond the individual. And if

262
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,640
you I mean artists experience
this. You know, many artists are

263
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,940
creative people. When they write
a poem or when they create a

264
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,500
picture, their experience is, I
didn't do it. It flowed through

265
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,260
me. It came through me. So some
artists won't even sign their

266
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,100
works of art, because that would
suggest that they created it

267
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,120
personally, but their experience
is that something larger created

268
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,800
through them, that blending of a
deeper creativity and the

269
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,140
personal agency, I think,
characterizes all of our lives

270
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,580
in all circumstances, and it
certainly becomes transparent in

271
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,620
psychedelic states of
consciousness.

272
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,259
Luisa: Gosh, I was just well, is
the thought my own? But I was

273
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:55,659
just thinking, if we have time,
I'd love you to share some of

274
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:59,439
you know, the pivotal moments
that you share in the book. But

275
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:02,219
what's fascinating is how you
talk about you transcend time

276
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:07,919
and space, future, past,
present. It's all potentially

277
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,819
there happening. Now. Do you
mind exploring or explaining

278
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:14,219
that a little bit more? Because
I think it's absolutely

279
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:14,939
fascinating.

280
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,060
Unknown: Yeah, that was another
one of the surprises that I

281
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:25,400
encountered here. Now we know
that physicists talk to us about

282
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,760
linear time is not really the
only way that time moves. That

283
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,000
there are some particles that
move backwards in time, and when

284
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,020
you enter into the massive
compression of black holes time,

285
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,380
you know the physics of time
changes. And in Super string

286
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,460
theory, there are dimensions of
the Universe that are not linear

287
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,740
time, like space. Time is, turns
out that when you go into deep,

288
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,260
deep, Non-ordinary states of
consciousness, you at least, I

289
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,680
Aldous, speak for myself, and I
think this is echoed in other

290
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,420
people's experiences. You
experienced that fact has that

291
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,960
time has different modalities to
it. There are different ways of

292
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,480
experiencing time. So early on
in my sessions, I went through a

293
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,840
series of experiences that
lasted about a year, seven

294
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,580
sessions where when I came
through this profound

295
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,480
purification process, every time
I did, I was brought into an

296
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,700
experience of what I call deep
time, not eternity, which is non

297
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,260
time, but deep time, where I
experienced my entire life from

298
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,360
start to finish as a
simultaneous now. It was like

299
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,700
all the moments of my life were
a giant tree. And my most recent

300
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,940
experiences before death were
the leaves at the outside of the

301
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,920
tree. And this the experiences
which had been repeated more and

302
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,220
more frequently were the big,
giant limbs in the center of the

303
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,240
tree. But all I experienced
myself both with the life. Yet

304
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,140
to come, and also
simultaneously, with my life

305
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,520
already having been lived and I
knew myself at that deep level

306
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,900
in later sessions in the years
following, I entered into deep

307
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:19,620
time repeatedly, but the texture
kept broadening. I entered into

308
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,900
deep time beyond my personal
life into the life of the

309
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,820
species, I began to have
experiences of the evolutionary

310
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,200
trajectory of humanity. And
again, I know this sounds egoic,

311
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,300
I know it sounds just absolutely

312
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,520
Luisa: crazy to say, but no, it
doesn't. It doesn't.

313
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,860
Unknown: I experience the
trajectory of human evolution,

314
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,500
not as in the future, not as
something which is not yet and

315
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,720
it's in the future time, but I
experienced it simultaneously as

316
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,440
something coming to us, but also
as something that had already

317
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,380
been completed. So there was a
wholeness and a breadth and a

318
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,840
depth of texture when you move
into very, very deep states of

319
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,580
consciousness, for example, when
you move into what classically

320
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,200
we would call archetypal states
of consciousness, deep into the

321
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,160
constitutive principles which
are responsible for kind of

322
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,620
generating space time as we know
it, those beings or those

323
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,900
forces, they live outside of
linear time as we know it, you

324
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:35,120
know so linear time is how
things behave inside space time,

325
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,800
but as you move to the edges of
space Time, time behaves

326
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,640
differently than we experience
it inside space and time. If you

327
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,860
go into extreme conditions, you
may transcend time altogether,

328
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,980
so that you move into you move
beyond time entirely. You can

329
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,740
move into what some people would
call eternity. Are the eternal

330
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,260
Now, are just completely outside
space, time, reality altogether.

331
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,220
Deep time is different than
that. Deep time is a certain

332
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,360
span of time, whether it's 100
years or 100,000 years,

333
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,860
experienced kind of as a
simultaneous now or experienced,

334
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,680
sometimes accelerated. I've been
in experiences where centuries

335
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,520
were passing by in minutes. You
know, just an accelerated

336
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,340
experience of the evolution
taking place on the planet. I

337
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,220
tried to, this is what I try to
unpack this in the book. Try to

338
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,960
lay it out as carefully as I
can. Yeah, I

339
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,920
Luisa: think it's fascinating.
Is everything happening now?

340
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,680
Unknown: I think perhaps from
some perspectives, from a

341
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,920
perspective, you could say that
everything is happening from

342
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,880
now, but personally, that's not
a very useful perspective. I

343
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,520
find I've tried to think in
those terms, and I find that I

344
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,480
literally cannot make my mind
think coherently within that

345
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,300
frame, because my mind needs the
structure of cause and effect,

346
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,320
even if those, if that varies in
certain places, but it needs a

347
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,660
certain some type of variation
or permutation of cause and

348
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,580
effect for me to understand life
as I know it, on this planet,

349
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,060
when I've gone into deep,
Non-ordinary states, time has

350
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,040
been variable, but has time
completely dissolved altogether.

351
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:48,040
It's been radically eclipsed at
different moments, but it hasn't

352
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,000
led me to be convinced that
everything is happening,

353
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,200
happening simultaneously now,
forever and ever. I think it's a

354
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,620
more complex pattern than that,
but I don't know. In the end, I

355
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,400
really don't know.

356
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,980
Luisa: Well, that was a very
honest answer. Thank you so

357
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,860
much. You talk about as well
that you saw the whole

358
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:13,440
trajectory of your life. My
question then is, it's been a

359
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,080
question asked since the
beginning of time, but Well,

360
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,380
what's time? Is everything pre
planned?

361
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,860
Unknown: No, know. I don't think
it's pre planned. I think it is

362
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,600
their probabilities. I think
when we incarnate, for example,

363
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,880
I mean, you know, I believe in
reincarnation, you know, I've

364
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:36,919
Luisa: written a book on
reincarnation. I assumed you

365
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:37,339
did. Yes.

366
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,560
Unknown: I think it's an
empirical fact that we that we

367
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,900
incarnate, that we reincarnate,
and eventually you get far

368
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,200
enough along in that process
that you don't reincarnate

369
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,400
haphazardly or randomly. You
reincarnate by choice. You

370
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
choose your incarnation
carefully, and that means

371
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,200
choosing the place and
circumstances. And timing of

372
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,760
your incarnation, and you do
that from a perspective in which

373
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,380
you can see a certain trajectory
of what's waiting for you if you

374
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,700
choose this life versus if you
choose another life. And in that

375
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,360
respect, I think there's a
certain probability, there's a

376
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,160
certain a certain inevitability
of certain things coming

377
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,020
together that constitute the
challenges and opportunities of

378
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,800
your life. But that doesn't mean
it's deterministic. It doesn't

379
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,620
mean it's a predetermined
outcome, because if it were a

380
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,760
predetermined outcome, then why
bother you know, there would be

381
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,020
nothing to learn. There has to
be a certain open endedness, if

382
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,740
we're truly going to be
challenged by that possibility

383
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,560
of variable outcomes in order to
learn. And so I think that that

384
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,220
while there are probabilities,
and the closer you get to

385
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,180
certain events, those
probabilities increase, the

386
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,740
farther you are away from those
events, those probabilities

387
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,400
decrease. I think there is time.
I think there is chance

388
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,940
operating in the universe. But I
also think that there is deep

389
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,900
the, you know, the Eastern
traditions call it karma. Karma,

390
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,520
the Paka, cause and effect,
cause and effect. But cause and

391
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,740
effect does not extinguish
choice. It conditions choice, it

392
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,540
qualifies choice, but it doesn't
eliminate the possibility of of

393
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:32,240
choice. But you have to work for
choices to be free. If you don't

394
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,660
work, if you don't pay
attention, or let's put it this

395
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,120
way, the less you pay attention,
the more likely your choices are

396
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,020
going to be highly conditioned,
but the more you pay attention,

397
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,700
the more you can increase the
freedom in your choosing. But to

398
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,040
do that, you have to pay a lot
of attention. Great

399
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,120
Luisa: answer, and I'm going to
re listen to that. Has your life

400
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,300
played out how you saw it during
your LSD experiences

401
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,960
Unknown: it has now I want to be
careful. It's not that I

402
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,440
experienced that I saw all the
details of my life. It's funny

403
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,660
how I experienced my life as the
sum totality of everything that

404
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:25,700
I was, everything I had become
everything that I then was, but

405
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,820
there were specific things in my
life that I wish I had had a

406
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,180
little heads up on frankly, you
know, that I didn't see, I

407
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,140
didn't remember all the details,
but it's a deeper reading than

408
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:44,920
that. It was like a coming to
know myself, in a way which gave

409
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,640
me a deep understanding of what
I'm about, what my the Truth of

410
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,780
My Life is about, and somewhat
about why I'm here and what my

411
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,760
purpose is. Now I think every
one of us carries that knowledge

412
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,560
inside themselves, and it guides
us at a very deep level, at an

413
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,620
intuitive level, when we come to
choice points, if we're careful,

414
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,340
we tune into that, and it does
guide us. This is in that

415
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,280
respect. This is nothing
unusual. It's just a an

416
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,720
unusually intense confrontation
with that knowing that we all

417
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:23,660
carry within us, in general,
yeah, I it My life has unfolded

418
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,220
along the lines as I saw it at
that time, as I experienced it.

419
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,420
I'm not as I am, I would say the
person that I met, which is now

420
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,220
about almost 40 years ago, 35
years ago, the person that I met

421
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,720
then is no stranger to the
person that I am now,

422
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,500
Luisa: okay, interesting, but
you're a very different person

423
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,360
than when you were 40 years ago.

424
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,100
Unknown: Well, I am, yeah, yeah.
I've paid my dues, gone to work

425
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,600
every day, raised three
children, dealt with all the

426
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,320
uncertainties of life that we
all have to deal with in that

427
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,740
process. I hope I've kept my
wits about me. I hope I've been

428
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,240
learning as I've been going I

429
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,080
Luisa: have to ask you the
question you spoke about the

430
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,800
evolution of the species and you
saw elements of that in your

431
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,620
experiences. Do you mind sharing
that with the audience?

432
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,000
Unknown: This is, that's a big
topic. Oh, okay, yeah, but I'm

433
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,260
happy to touch on it. But okay,
it's was, again, one of the big,

434
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,100
deep surprises of my journey,
because I'd never, ever imagine

435
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,920
that something like this would
become part of this journey.

436
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,280
Again, I was kind of thinking in
terms of the conventional

437
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,420
descriptions of enlightenment
that you find in the spiritual,

438
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,920
mystical traditions, or that
kind of thing. But what happened

439
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:53,920
was pretty systematically, over
years of work, I began to be

440
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,820
given a series of visionary
experiences. And when I say

441
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,160
visionary, you know, it's. It's
not like they were just visual.

442
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,360
The in these states of
consciousness, you learn by

443
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:13,200
becoming what it is you're
experiencing. So you become what

444
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,500
it is you're experiencing it.
You know it from the inside. So

445
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,200
when I when I say I had a
systematic initiation into

446
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:28,400
various visual visions of what's
happening with humanity. I it's

447
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,100
like I dilated, I entered into
absorption with the species mind

448
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,320
in a state of deep time and just
consistently, there was a

449
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,480
consistent message that was
poured into me about where we

450
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,380
were and completely surprised
me, because I, you know, I

451
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,140
didn't give a lot of time
thinking about humanity in this

452
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,220
global sense, but the message
was that humanity is coming into

453
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,880
a turning point. We're coming to
a decisive time in our history.

454
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,380
We're coming to a bifurcation
point in our evolutionary

455
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,640
development, the time when the
past will convert and diverge.

456
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,500
We're coming into a true before
and after advance, a change

457
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,220
which a time in history that
will change us at the very

458
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,660
fundamental core of our
existence, and not simply a

459
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,460
change in our economy or a
change in our politics or our

460
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,900
cultural values, but a change in
the architecture of the

461
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,520
collective psyche, so that all
human beings born after this

462
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,120
period of history will be
working within a different

463
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,200
archetypal structure of
collective psyche, and that this

464
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,420
was a time of profound spiritual
awakening, a time of extra

465
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,220
ordinary change on the face of
the planet that would be marking

466
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,340
history would always be marked
around this before and after

467
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,680
event. This was over and over.
It was laid out very

468
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,300
consistently, deepening it over
time. And there were times when

469
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,920
I was given, I was taken deep
into the future and given short

470
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,540
experiences of what I came to
call the future human, the human

471
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:18,780
being that we were becoming in
history. But they didn't explain

472
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,220
to me how this was going to
happen, or what form these

473
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,200
things would take, until several
years later, when I had a

474
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,960
particularly deep experience,
which took place in 1995 again,

475
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,560
I did all this work between 79
and 99 but in 1995 I had an

476
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,720
experience that I call the Great
Awakening, very, very difficult

477
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,100
experience. But after extensive
purification, I was propelled

478
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,360
deep into deep time, and I was I
dissolved into the human

479
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,520
species, and I experienced the
death of humanity and the

480
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,000
rebirth of humanity, not as an
individual, but as the species,

481
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:10,620
I experienced that humanity came
into a global systems crisis, a

482
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,740
period of profound loss and
disruption and turmoil, a loss

483
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,820
of control, a time of profound
destructuring, a time that was

484
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,500
so disruptive and so
intimidating that for a time, it

485
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,240
felt like we would all be dead.
It was an extinction event. But

486
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,520
just when it was at its worst,
the pressure lifted. The storm

487
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,960
passed, and we survived.
Humanity survived, significantly

488
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,460
pared down, but we survived, and
when we survived, and when we

489
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,560
began to pick ourselves up and
put our lives back together, we

490
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,820
had been changed. We had been
changed deep in our core, that

491
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,460
in the depths of this global
crisis, we had found certain

492
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,080
principles, certain values,
certain truths, and lived in

493
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,820
them and these This experience
changed us in a never to be

494
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,500
reversed fashion. Many ways to
describe this process, but at

495
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:24,020
its core, I think it's basically
a true encounter with the truth

496
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,840
of our oneness, an outbreaking
of oneness in human species and

497
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,140
in human culture, that
experience that in which that

498
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,380
mystics have talked about, you
know, for 1000s of years, the

499
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,540
experience that we are
fundamentally at core, one with

500
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,900
each other and one with life,
and when you have that

501
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,820
experience, then you just can't
hurt people. You don't allow

502
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,760
yourself, you would never allow
yourself your actions to hurt

503
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,560
people. And we began to build a
culture, to build a civilization

504
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,080
out of this experience of
oneness and true. An experience

505
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,660
of humanity, of a world
civilization that did not leave

506
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,220
anybody out. It was completely
inclusive, a world civilization

507
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,600
that worked for all that. This
was a pivot point in our

508
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,740
spiritual development. And from
this and period on, and I don't

509
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,500
know, I was never shown exactly
how or exactly when, except that

510
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,160
it seemed to be a global systems
crisis that was triggered by a

511
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,420
global ecological crisis. Now I
got to say this was taking place

512
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,420
in the 90s, and I was not
reading the global literature.

513
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,540
There was I wasn't reading the
global ecological literature.

514
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,060
You know, now we're beginning to
sort of see you know exactly

515
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,780
what you're talking about coming
in. But this was 20 years ago,

516
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:54,280
25 years ago, in my last
sessions, in my in the last

517
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,440
couple of sessions, I was given
one more deep, deep, the deepest

518
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,360
encounter with deep time, taken
deep into humanity's

519
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,820
evolutionary future, and was
given the experience of the

520
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,300
deepest experience I had had of
the humanity that we are

521
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,260
becoming. I think we are
entering a time in history of

522
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,920
deep, deep turmoil. But we are
not being punished for our sins.

523
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,240
We are not being destroyed,
though it will feel like it in

524
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,460
certain ways, but we are giving
birth. And certainly All women

525
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,600
know birth is excruciatingly
hard work. Gestation is long,

526
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,920
birth is short and intense. We
are giving birth, and we are

527
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,560
giving birth to the next form of
humanity, to the next iteration

528
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:50,740
of human life. I think we are
giving birth to a species that

529
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,060
is truly an enlightened species.
And I mean that in a technical

530
00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:00,960
sense, a species, a humanity of
Christ, a humanity of Buddhas,

531
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,980
the humanities of the prophet, a
deeply awakened, spiritually

532
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,880
awakened humanity. And that's a
before and after turning point.

533
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,960
And in this last session, when I
was taken deep into the future

534
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,780
and allowed to experience this
future human.

535
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,980
It is so beautiful. It is such a
magnificent creature that we are

536
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,900
creating in history. I mean,
just an extraordinarily open

537
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,940
heart of pure compassion and an
open mind in deep communion with

538
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:43,360
the intelligence of the
universe. Just, I think it's

539
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,600
really important for us to have
a deep vision of what what we

540
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,500
are doing in the long term.
Otherwise we would be we might

541
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:56,560
drown in the sorrow that's
coming. Labor is hard, but this

542
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,680
is we must look beyond labor to
understand that what we are

543
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,080
doing is creating. We're
bringing into existence a future

544
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,640
being a future human.

545
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,180
Luisa: Wow. Well, we
unfortunately, myself included,

546
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,340
or as a collective. We always
grow from suffering.

547
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,580
Unfortunately we have the
greatest growth you also

548
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:23,480
mentioned the paired down human
is that there'll be less souls

549
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,000
incarnated in a physical form
that you saw.

550
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,240
Unknown: Well, I draw that not
primarily from my experiences,

551
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,120
though it's resonates with my
experience, because I draw that

552
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,660
really from looking at the
ecological literature today,

553
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,820
people who are just plotting the
hard numbers, the demographics,

554
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,660
what is the carrying capacity of
the planet? They talk about the

555
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,840
old earth and new earth. You
know, the old Earth is pre

556
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,200
damage of industrial
civilization, New Earth is post

557
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,900
damage of industrial
civilization, where they

558
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,960
estimate that the carrying
capacity could be 2 billion

559
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,800
people. And we're coming into,
you know, 789, billion people,

560
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,180
the push is going to come to
shove. And you know, many, many

561
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,260
people who are not, have never
taken any psychedelics, you

562
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,040
know, are really looking at a
time of deep, deep planetary

563
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,440
disruption, where we won't be
able to feed our population,

564
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,620
given the depth of ecological
turbulence and the droughts and

565
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:32,900
the deforestation, so on and so
forth. So I mean, just

566
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,740
intellectually, I think we have
ample evidence that we are, we

567
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,980
are coming into a time of great
challenges, and some of those

568
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:51,640
challenges will take lives. The
key essential question is, How

569
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,720
soon will we wake up? How soon
will we begin to make important

570
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,020
choices to living in harmony
with the planet, living in

571
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,640
harmony with. Each other. The
sooner we start making those

572
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,700
choices, the more, the more we
can reduce the damage that will

573
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,980
be done. We have already locked
into place a depth of disruption

574
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,560
in this on this planet that's
just deeply shaking. We've

575
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,740
already locked it in place, but
we can still pull ourselves out

576
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,120
of this dive, or we can just
blunder deeper into this dive. I

577
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,240
know

578
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,760
Luisa: you didn't necessarily
see time frames, but you talk

579
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,600
about the sorrow. Was there a
trajectory of time for this,

580
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,940
this sorrowful period in our
species history,

581
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,680
Unknown: I think the 21st
Century is, is the beginning of

582
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,280
what I would call the dark night
of our collective soul. Now the

583
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,060
dark night is a technical term
that scholars of mysticism use,

584
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,160
and it refers to a time of a
very, very intense purification

585
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,200
that comes and precedes mystical
awakening, mystical

586
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,640
illumination, the dark night of
our collective time is a time of

587
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,460
intense purification, a letting
go of the past, a purifying of

588
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,840
the past before we can move into
a truly new future. And I think

589
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,940
that the 21st Century is such a
time, I don't think it's going

590
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,180
to be done quickly. I think
it'll take several generations.

591
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,200
We're lucky. Talking about a
huge change here. I don't know

592
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,040
how long it will take, but
clearly things are accelerating.

593
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,500
I mean, there's so many things
are accelerating,

594
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,600
technologically, socially,
intellectually, the internet,

595
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,260
the fact that I'm talking with
you tonight across vast space,

596
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,000
to people, I mean, this
unprecedented, right? Things are

597
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,660
speeding up. How fast it takes,
how long it takes, partly

598
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:57,160
depends upon how we handle the
pressures that are coming, that

599
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,100
are already being placed upon
us. I mean, we just the Trump

600
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,820
presidency was four years of
denial of the reality of climate

601
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,500
change, we lost a lot of time
during those four years. We

602
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,640
could have been doing better
than we are now. How soon we'll

603
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,780
begin to make serious
commitments to living in balance

604
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,820
with the planet? I think we're,
we're coming into it, and we, I

605
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,800
think we have actually already
entered into the early stages of

606
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:36,260
these convulsions. I think covid
19 is kind of like a a what is

607
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,600
the term in a symphony? It's
like the overture of a symphony.

608
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,200
It's not itself, the depth of
the disruption that's coming,

609
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,300
but it's like the overture that
signals some of the themes that

610
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,200
are coming. And we all know how
deeply disrupted our lives have

611
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,940
been with covid. Well, I think
it's going to get much, much

612
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,260
worse than what we've
experienced with covid, but

613
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,000
perhaps from covid, we are
beginning to learn some of the

614
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,680
insights and behaviors that will
help us do better when the next

615
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,420
series of crises come

616
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,580
Luisa: that takes me just
briefly on to fear, because I

617
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,680
just feel this so much in the
collective consciousness,

618
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,100
there's so much fear. What are
your thoughts on fear and how to

619
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,560
move through a fear based state?

620
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,940
Unknown: Well, first, we have
reasons to be afraid. I mean,

621
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,300
you know, we've we've not doing
a very good job with a number of

622
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,860
things, and there is a tally
coming. So from a completely

623
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,720
realistic perspective. We have
causes to fear. I fear for my

624
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:49,660
children, I fear for my
grandchildren, but my deeper,

625
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,340
deeper experiences at the wisdom
that the universe is profoundly

626
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,720
wise, the universe is
extraordinarily intelligent, and

627
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,800
the universe is deeply
compassionate. But to

628
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,200
experience, to really see, to be
able to see the compassion of

629
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,340
the universe, you have to look
very, very deep, because on the

630
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:15,540
surface the universe looks like
a mean son of a bitch, and on

631
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,660
the surface the universe doesn't
look very intelligent or

632
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,940
profoundly wise. You really have
to be willing to look deep.

633
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,820
Ramakrishna said, if you want to
know God, you must be willing to

634
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,380
look evil in the face. You must
understand that evil is not

635
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,620
something outside of the Divine,
but it is actually part of the

636
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,680
way that the divine manifests
itself, not in malice, but that

637
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,600
the concept that that the divine
acts with great power in ways

638
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:52,720
that hurt us at times, and that
it feels like evil, but it

639
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,480
actually it's much deeper than
that. My experience in the

640
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,180
sessions is that I was many,
many times drawn into. Been

641
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:06,000
dissolved into realities so
deep, so large. I didn't have

642
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,120
words to describe it. I mean,
some people would describe it as

643
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,280
the divine I tend to talk about
it as the cosmic mind, or the

644
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,760
mind of the universe. And I
experienced a universe

645
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,860
extraordinarily wise,
extraordinarily intelligent,

646
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,240
just massive orders of
intelligence beyond anything I

647
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,320
had imagined previously. And
that's the intelligence that

648
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,400
lies behind our moment in
history. We are being summoned.

649
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,540
We are being called into a
higher order of existence. We

650
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,700
have to let go of the past. But
the even though the

651
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,820
circumstances of this
transformation are demanding,

652
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,020
they're extraordinarily
important and extremely

653
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:54,100
exciting. I mean, look, when we
die, we don't want to simply

654
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,760
have had a comfortable life. We
want to have had a life that

655
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,320
means something that really has
challenged us and brought

656
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,220
something deep out of us. And I
think our time in history is

657
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,340
that kind of time. It's not
going to be comfortable, but it

658
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,780
can be very, very purposeful and
very meaningful, and it can be

659
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:19,620
an extra ordinary adventure, and
that, I think that engagement of

660
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:24,680
intelligence is much more
powerful to me than fear. Fear

661
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:30,380
does not, does not move me very
deeply, and like one of the

662
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,080
things that fell away from me
over the course of this journey

663
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,240
is fear of death. I have no fear
of death. And I don't say I say

664
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,200
that truly humbly. I mean, it's
just I'm not afraid of it,

665
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,440
because I've experienced where
I'm going when I die. I've

666
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,600
experienced where people go when
they die. And anyone, any shaman

667
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,900
or any deep spiritual
practitioner, has likely had

668
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,940
these kinds of experiences. And
so I know that I am entering

669
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,900
into a greater intelligence. I
know I'm entering into a

670
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,520
profound love, and therefore I
have no fear. And if you have no

671
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,780
fear of death, then it tends to
sort of sap the strength of all

672
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,020
these other lesser fears that
nibble at us around the edges.

673
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,640
They don't frighten me.

674
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,680
Luisa: So many people, I get
asked this question all the

675
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,000
time, what happens when we die,
or I'm so afraid of death, it's

676
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,500
very comforting from your
experiences to say that there is

677
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,580
no fear of death.

678
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,720
Unknown: I think there's we're
at a time when we have learned

679
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,560
so much about what happens when
we die. I mean, I taught a

680
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,280
course called Transpersonal
studies in my undergraduate

681
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,600
courses, and in it, we looked at
reincarnation research, you

682
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,840
know, just a large burgeoning
body of literature that clearly

683
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,080
demonstrates that death is not
the end of existence. Our

684
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,100
consciousness continues near
death. Episode research,

685
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,900
hundreds, 1000s and 1000s of
people who have had glimpses of

686
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,500
what's waiting for them when
they die. And extra ordinary,

687
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,560
consistent experiences we have,
people like Michael Newton's

688
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,520
work, his books, Journey of the
journeys of the soul and the

689
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,660
destiny of souls, where he
regressed people, not only into

690
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:20,100
their previous lives, but into
their life in between their

691
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,840
lives, he actually was able to
regress people into conditions

692
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,580
where they remembered their
afterlife experiences. And after

693
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,300
taking hundreds of people there,
he was able to reconstruct a

694
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,540
picture of what happens to us
when we die. And what do you

695
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,500
know? It's extraordinarily
consistent with the Tibetan Book

696
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,700
of the Dead and some of the
great insights that come out of

697
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,120
our spiritual traditions, so
that we're beginning to piece

698
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,720
together and in psychedelic
experiences. You know, any

699
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,920
shamanic tradition will tell
you, you know you can die before

700
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,480
you die. I mean, the saying is,
those who die before they die do

701
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,540
not die when they die. It's you
can die before you die

702
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:09,180
physically. You can experience
that reality before. I mean, and

703
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,800
because, the reason we survive
the destruction of the body is

704
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,380
not because something had
happens to us at the moment of

705
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,980
death. It's because of something
that we already are right here,

706
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,380
right now, we already have the
spiritual reality alive within

707
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:29,480
us. We already have access to
the spiritual reality. And when

708
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,500
you tune into that reality
deeply, you everybody

709
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,900
experiences the same fundamental
thing. It's impossible to die

710
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:44,140
the form that you are can die,
you know, the outer layers can

711
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,500
die, but the inner essence
doesn't die. And you take all

712
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,160
your memory with you, you take
all of your learning with you.

713
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,600
And we don't have to accept this
on faith anymore. We have many,

714
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,500
many opportunities for this to
be a true, genuine.

715
00:50:00,736 --> 00:50:03,856
Intellectually persuasive study,
field of study,

716
00:50:06,076 --> 00:50:09,136
Luisa: and this is a large
topic, but I have to ask this

717
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:12,976
question. In your experiences,
this constant cycle of life and

718
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:16,876
death and rebirth and coming
back into the physical body,

719
00:50:17,356 --> 00:50:20,116
what is the purpose of it all,
and is there an end point?

720
00:50:22,756 --> 00:50:26,000
Unknown: Well, big questions,
aren't they? I know. I'm so

721
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,220
sorry. It's okay, fair game.
Well, I don't there isn't an end

722
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,220
point that we can recognize any
more than we can say what the

723
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,140
end point of the universe is,
because billions and billions

724
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,260
and billions of years ahead of
us. You know, we're just and

725
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,700
reincarnation is the same thing.
What reincarnation does is lift

726
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,800
from us the burden of too little
time. What it tells us that we

727
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,700
have an open ended amount of
time in which we will be growing

728
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,740
and evolving. The classic
portrait of reincarnation that

729
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:06,240
emerged about 4000 years ago is
that you reincarnate.

730
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,880
Reincarnate, you learn, you
become more spiritually

731
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,300
developed, until you awaken to
your divine nature. Once you

732
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,260
awaken to your divine nature,
then you leave, then you achieve

733
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,620
moksha, you escape, and you
don't have to be here anymore.

734
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,800
But that leaves unanswered the
question, what is the purpose of

735
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,100
physical existence in the first
place? Is it simply to get out

736
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,820
of here? And the more we know
about how big the universe is

737
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,780
and how old it is and how
intelligent it is, the more that

738
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:40,240
model of reality just doesn't
seem to be very persuasive. In

739
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,540
my experience, in the sessions,
a very different understanding

740
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:48,280
of reincarnation emerged. I had
an experience in one particular

741
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,660
session, which was crescendo of
lots of sessions of work where I

742
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,840
began to have an experience
where all of my former lives

743
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,440
started coming in, and now I'm
familiar with some of my former

744
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,660
lives. I did three years of
hypnotherapy work in which I did

745
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,780
some of this work. But in this
case, all of my former lives

746
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,400
started coming in, and it was
like wrapping filaments of light

747
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,020
around a kite spool. And
eventually, when they came

748
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,300
together, they fused, and when
they fused, there was an

749
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,320
explosion of light, of diamond
light out of my chest. It just

750
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,180
exploded, and it catapulted me
into a state of awareness in

751
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:33,680
which I was both an individual,
but I was an individual beyond

752
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,820
any frame of reference I had
ever experienced before. And I

753
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:44,020
think what I was being shown was
what the trajectory of

754
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,660
reincarnation, where the
trajectory of reincarnation is

755
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:51,520
taking us. It's not simply about
the small, incremental

756
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,000
improvements that we make in our
lives, lifetime by lifetime,

757
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,300
though we do. It's not simply
about learning more and learning

758
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:03,480
more level by level though we do
eventually, sooner or later, the

759
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,680
soul, which is the consciousness
that integrates all of our life

760
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,840
experiences, all of our lives,
come together and they fuse. And

761
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:19,380
when they fuse, there is created
a higher order of human being,

762
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,140
what I call the birth of the
diamond soul. I think that when

763
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,640
the birth, when the when the
diamond soul, awakens a human

764
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:34,400
inside, a human being in earth,
the identity shifts. We no

765
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,320
longer take our personal ego,
our personal private life, as

766
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:44,320
our identity. We now know
ourselves to be 100,000 year old

767
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:49,600
beings. We know ourselves to be
a soul. We are a soul incarnate.

768
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:55,000
We wake up at that level with
our memories intact. This is not

769
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,780
the end of creation. It's not
the end of the process, but it's

770
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,880
a significant turning point. Now
imagine if this is happening, if

771
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,720
this is built into the fabric of
existence, and it's happening

772
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,820
not just to us individually, but
to all of us together, so that

773
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:15,660
eventually the entire species
goes through a process where

774
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,840
they wake up the diamond soul
awakens inside of themselves,

775
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:25,580
and they know themselves to be
soul beings incarnate inside

776
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:30,620
time and space. What a change
that would make in the history

777
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,280
of this planet. And I think
something like that is what we

778
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,640
are in the process of doing in
the birth of the future human. I

779
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,860
think the future human is the
diamond soul we are in a process

780
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:46,000
of becoming fully self aware
spiritual beings inside

781
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,060
existence. And when we are that,
that spiritually awake truly, we

782
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:57,220
are living heaven on earth.
Nirvana is Samsara, and we don't

783
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,440
need to go off planet in order
to be in. Spiritual joy. We can

784
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,240
experience spiritual joy right
here, right now. That's what I

785
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,900
think is happening.
Reincarnation is maturing us

786
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:15,240
toward this, through this, but
then it keeps going another

787
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,840
million years, another million
years. It's just going to keep

788
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,280
going. Wow.

789
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,740
Luisa: Very interesting. Our
lives are just like a pin prick,

790
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:28,040
and that seems so long that this
is the one moment in time,

791
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,360
really each life,

792
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,020
Unknown: and yet so significant.
And particularly, I think, at

793
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:37,220
this particular time in history,
many people have incarnated,

794
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,920
caring, in a sense, the karmic
imprint of many lives, it's kind

795
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,380
of like when you're in college
and you get to the end of your

796
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,740
senior year, you start loading
up your courses to finish your

797
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,760
things up quickly. I think a lot
of us are loading up our former

798
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,040
lives in this life, so that we
carry a lot of karma that comes

799
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,600
from deep history, because we
have a lot of work that we want

800
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,520
to do, we want to accomplish. So
this pin prick is actually a

801
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,740
pretty, a pretty rich pin prick
in time, in time in history.

802
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:13,499
Luisa: That's a great way to put
it. And also removing all the

803
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:16,139
karmic, what people call it
dead, or the karma that we've

804
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,779
accumulated. I like the idea of
that

805
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,400
Unknown: we are. I think we're I
think we're expunging karma

806
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:26,480
exponentially. But remember,
we're not simply healing the

807
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,960
past. We're not simply making up
for things that we did wrong.

808
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:34,460
Most people rise to the karmic
challenges of their life. Most

809
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,480
people, it's like most of the
kids in school, they pass. It's

810
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,640
not a perfect system, but they
pass. They learn. Most souls, I

811
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,660
think, pass the karmic
challenges of their life. So in

812
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:50,320
every incarnation, they're not
simply making up for things they

813
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,000
did wrong. They're building on
things that they did right. And

814
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,740
so we are. We are growing by
leaps and bounds on the basis of

815
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,760
things that we have learned and
accumulated positively. Sure we

816
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,480
have some cleaning up to do, you
know a little but most of what

817
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,760
we're doing, I think, is we're
learning how to write

818
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,980
symphonies. We're learning how
to love bigger, deeper, longer.

819
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,920
We're learning how to think
Rich, more richly than we have

820
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,780
before. We really are building
on a very positive legacy in our

821
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,560
past.

822
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,700
Luisa: Wow, such profound,
incredible insights. I have to

823
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,240
ask you the question, Why did
you stop your LSD sessions?

824
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:45,820
Unknown: I stopped for two
reasons, but the most important

825
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:50,440
reason is I stopped because it
became too difficult to come

826
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:56,380
back at this time in the last
five years of my work, I entered

827
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,780
a period of communion with what
I call the diamond Luminosity in

828
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,860
Buddhism, they call it
Dharmakaya, the clear light of

829
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:11,160
absolute reality. I basically
was repeatedly dissolved over

830
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:18,120
four years into a level of
consciousness that was so pure,

831
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:24,560
so sublime, so clear, clear,
clear, dissolved into the

832
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,640
crystalline body of the Divine,
drawn into deeper, ever

833
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:35,540
deepening intimacy with the
divine fabric of existence. As

834
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:39,500
you can imagine, this was
absolutely deeply soul

835
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,780
satisfying encounters. It
changed me forever. But these

836
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,900
are temporary states. You know,
there are some beings, God bless

837
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,660
them, who can enter into those
states and hold them forever,

838
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,720
you know, and the great
spiritual masters all honor to

839
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,740
them. But when you work with
psychedelics, you only get

840
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,720
temporary access to this
intimacy, and then you have to

841
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,520
come back and integrate it and
digest it. But basically, I was

842
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,560
taken over the years so deep
into the divine, so many times

843
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,380
that it just became too much of
a heartache to come back into

844
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:23,000
time, space, existence, and I
knew that I had to stop this

845
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,080
work, and I had to spend the
rest of my life digesting the

846
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,800
blessings that I had already
been given and to draw them more

847
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,400
deeply into my heart and mind. I
couldn't keep going back into

848
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,100
it, and so I made a deal with
the universe, and the deal was

849
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,140
that that she would not draw me
this deeply back into her again

850
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:49,000
until I could stay with her
forever. And that was marked the

851
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,860
end of my journey. So I've spent
the rest of my life continuing

852
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:58,240
to reflect on these things, to
ponder them, to understand them,

853
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,400
because I'm, you know, full Oss.
I want to understand things, and

854
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,120
I want to share them, and I hope
the story can be useful to

855
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,660
people, some people who do who
are themselves, psychedelic

856
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,440
journeyers. And so maybe there
are some lessons that can be

857
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,220
helpful to them, but I hope that
most people who read the book

858
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,720
will not be psychedelic
journeyers, but the journey can

859
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,840
still be helpful to them,
because it will show them

860
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,420
something that will resonate
with their own deepest

861
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,440
intuitions. It'll show them a
cosmology. There's a picture of

862
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:35,960
our universe. And if it's true,
I think it's true, it will

863
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,680
resonate with that understanding
that we carry deep in our hearts

864
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:44,200
and in our souls, and therefore
it will support them as they go

865
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,400
about their own life, following
their own destiny into their own

866
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,840
spiritual fruition. That's my
hope.

867
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:58,000
Luisa: Well, I just have to say,
Chris Professor Bache, I think

868
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,440
you're I love you. I think
you're amazing. What profound I

869
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,660
mean. I've read your book, but
speaking with you, it's just

870
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,840
incredible. On a final note, is
there any question that I've

871
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,880
missed and there's something
you'd like to talk to the

872
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,620
passion harvest audience about?

873
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,420
Unknown: I would advise people
not to do what I did. I chose to

874
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,340
work with very high doses of
LSD. I pushed my system very

875
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:26,120
hard. It was more taxing than I
thought it was going to be in

876
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,300
the beginning, and along the
way, I realized that there's no

877
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,140
reason to push yourself this
hard. So what I would advise

878
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,380
today for those who do want to
work with psychedelics in a

879
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,480
spiritual manner, to work with
lower doses, to work with

880
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,960
gentler psychedelics and to not
push themselves as hard. And I

881
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,320
lay this all out in the book The
reasons for this and whatnot. So

882
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:51,940
my advice would be, maybe learn
from my mistakes as well as from

883
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:56,440
my successes, and don't do what
I did, because if you push as

884
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:02,820
hard as I did, it really does
come to it takes all of your

885
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:07,080
energy and all of your life to
navigate the journey that you've

886
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,200
done. It's like, you know, if
you climb a mountain, it takes

887
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,460
up years and years of your life.
This took years and years of my

888
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:21,620
life, and I wouldn't have traded
it for anything in the world,

889
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,760
but I know that there are
certain costs that come with

890
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,660
that, and I would encourage
people not to choose that

891
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,740
particular route. Other than
that, I guess I would offer, I

892
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:42,220
would just leave with a witness
to the profound wisdom that is

893
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:46,480
in by embedded in our bodies and
in our hearts and our minds, a

894
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:52,180
wisdom that's embedded in the
very deep evolving structure of

895
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:57,580
the universe and the stars that
mesmerizes with the pictures

896
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:01,260
from the Hubble of the galaxies
and The and the supernovas and

897
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:05,220
the in the nebula that the way,
those the feelings, that those

898
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:09,840
pictures stir in us and awaken
in us, those feelings are true,

899
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:15,180
and that our lives do
participate intimately, deeply

900
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,500
in that wisdom, right here,
right Now, every day, we are

901
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:24,620
embedded in that wisdom, that's
my story, and I'm sticking to

902
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:24,920
it.

903
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:29,360
Luisa: Yay. You're amazing,
Professor Bache, thank you so

904
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,420
much for being on passion
harvest. I've just loved talking

905
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,600
to you, and I'm so honored to
speak with you, and what a

906
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,020
wonderful, powerful message
you're sharing with the world.

907

So thank you so

908
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,760

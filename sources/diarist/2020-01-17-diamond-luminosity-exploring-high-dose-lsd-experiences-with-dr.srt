00:00:00,224 --> 00:00:14,324
Joe Moore: You. Good. Hello,
everybody. Welcome back to

2
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:18,104
psychedelics today. Today on the
show, we have Chris Bache,

3
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:22,280
retired professor and Professor
Emeritus at Youngstown State

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,740
University and author of the
recent book LSD and the mind of

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,300
the universe. We're also going
to be doing a giveaway. So stay

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,540
tuned on that, Chris. Thanks for
joining us. Glad to be here,

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:42,160
guys. So I, I had been talking
about you, I think even a couple

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,980
years ago when I found out about
your, your kind of long term

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,520
project, before, probably the
book, was even with a publisher,

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,220
and I was really excited by the
idea, and then I just totally

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,760
forgot, and then all of a
sudden, we got connected, I

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,080
think, through the publisher.
And now I'm very excited to

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,620
record with you, because this is
quite the project you've

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,860
undertaken, and you've got some
very unique insights to share.

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,540
How do you how do you like to
start this story? Like, how did

16
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,780
maybe, maybe we can start with
psychedelics? How did

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,960
psychedelics come on your radar
initially.

18
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,619
Chris Bache: Well, I had just
finished graduate school. I was

19
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,919
publishing a few articles out of
my dissertation. I was looking

20
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:32,059
for where to take my research. I
was a brand spanking new

21
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,579
university professor, and I met
the work of Stan Grof, and

22
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,539
that's what really snapped my
head to attention. I did not

23
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,839
have a psychedelic history. I
was I finished graduate school

24
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:48,699
in religious studies as a pretty
deeply convinced atheistically

25
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:53,499
inclined agnostic, but I read
Stan's work, and light bulb went

26
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:56,199
off inside of me, and I said,
this is important, not just to

27
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,259
psychology, but it's important
to philosophy religion, which

28
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:03,299
was my training, and I wanted to
get involved. I wanted to do it,

29
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,559
but, of course, it had been made
illegal. So I split my life. I

30
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,639
in my ordinary day job, I
continued to function as a

31
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,819
professor of Religious Studies
in the Department, taught

32
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,959
conventional kind of courses, or
semi conventional courses. And I

33
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,939
began a 20 year, what became
eventually a 20 year journey,

34
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:28,039
working with LSD, following Stan
grofs paradigm, and then pushing

35
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:32,719
the limits of that paradigm
pretty far, much farther than I

36
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,759
appreciate it at the time. And I
was trained in philosophy of

37
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,919
religion, and so I kept careful
records, careful notes. Tried to

38
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,359
make the engagement as clean and
as productive as possible, and I

39
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:49,359
knew there would come a time,
sooner or later, when I would

40
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,079
share the experiences or share
the insights from the

41
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,979
experiences with a broader
audience. And after I retired

42
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:59,259
from the university, that time
finally came,

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Joe Moore: perfect and what was
the first Did you have any kind

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,020
of previous, spontaneous,
mystical experiences or anything

45
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,280
before that? That kind of clued
you into how important these

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,760
things might be.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,200
Chris Bache: I've always been
envious of people who have had,

48
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,960
you know, I was 12 years old, I
had my first spontaneous

49
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,200
mystical experience. That's not
the way it's been for me. I've

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,860
always been kind of deeply
locked into my body and my

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:37,820
physical experience. You know, I
I was reasonably well educated

52
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,380
in Western religious thought. I
became educated in Eastern

53
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,920
religious thought, in a broad
spectrum of contemporary

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,700
thought, but no, I had no
background. In many ways, I'm

55
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,900
the last person you would have
expected to write a book on deep

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,180
psychedelic states of
consciousness. It just, I mean,

57
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,300
I grew up in Mississippi. I got
a degree in theology from the

58
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,380
University of Notre Dame before
going on to graduate school. So

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,480
this wasn't part of my
background at all.

60
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,260
Kyle Buller: I'm curious. How
did you stumble across Stan's

61
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,920
work by not having any exposure
to psychedelics beforehand?

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,540
Chris Bache: Well, I was reading
widely in different areas. I was

63
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,960
reading and kind of emerging
Transpersonal psychology. It

64
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,260
interested me two people whose
work I met my first year out.

65
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,860
One was Ian Stevenson, whose
work at the University of

66
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,860
Virginia convinced me that
reincarnation is a simple fact

67
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,340
of life. And that was a jolt,
because it hadn't been part of

68
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,000
my education anywhere. And then
I met Stan's work, and he had

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,020
just published two years before,
realms of the human unconscious,

70
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,680
and that was the book that
really did it for me. And so Ian

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,680
gave me kind of empirical
evidence that there had to be

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,920
another dimension of reality,
other than the physical world,

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,240
because there, if there is any
time interval between the death

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,600
of one personality and the birth
of the second personality, there

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,460
has to be a place for them to.
This during that time, and Stan

76
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,060
gave me the methodology that
allowed me to the prospect of

77
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,440
exploring that reality. So I
just decided to go for it.

78
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,420
Joe Moore: So maybe next, like,
what? What did the protocol look

79
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:22,940
like to you? Like it to me, it
looks like a very clearly looks

80
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,760
like the work being done at
Hopkins and by maps now. But was

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,940
it any different in your
perspective at this point?

82
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,720
Chris Bache: No, I think it's
pretty much conventional in that

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,800
respect, you're always working
in complete isolation. You're

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,420
always working with a sitter,
you're always working with a

85
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,640
very carefully curated playlist
of music. The difference is,

86
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,740
after I did three medium dose
LSD sessions and then shifted to

87
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,700
working with very high levels of
LSD. So I worked at 500 to 600

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,400
micrograms. At first, I did it
simply for efficiency, because

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,600
it was hard to get time in a
dual career marriage for, you

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,240
know, arranging a session day,
and I wanted to make the most

91
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,560
out of every day. I also thought
it would get me to my early goal

92
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,140
of enlightenment faster, if I
could kind of chew through my

93
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,360
karma in bigger bites that
eventually is a project that

94
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,300
just dissolved along the way,
and the whole concept of a

95
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,040
personal spiritual journey, or
strictly personal evolutionary

96
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:35,240
project that fell out along the
way. So the difference, I think,

97
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,100
is the quantity, the part that
first the psychedelic used, very

98
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,020
different than Psilocybin or
mvma, working with very high

99
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,260
doses, which changed the whole
trajectory of the experience.

100
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:54,340
And then I basically began to
curate a much more aggressive

101
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,180
playlist with the music. I used
a lot more indigenous music. I

102
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,740
didn't use classical western
music. I use a much more

103
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,080
aggressive approach in the music
itself, but otherwise, very much

104
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,280
like contemporary therapeutic
approaches to psychedelics.

105
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,940
Kyle Buller: Yeah, huh, that's
interesting. I guess backtrack a

106
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,600
little bit too. So your book
really kind of covers these,

107
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,360
what is it? 73 high dose
session. So the like your book

108
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,960
is covering all these insights
of your experiences and some of

109
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,540
your philosophical work, and
really understanding

110
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,820
consciousness from these
experiences. So I don't know if

111
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,000
I forget if we gave that little
intro there. So that's just to

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,320
get some context of what we're
talking about and what Joe meant

113
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,580
about protocol of how you're
setting that up. And I'm curious

114
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,500
why did the music change over
time?

115
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,460
Chris Bache: I happened upon
some indigenous chanting music,

116
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,160
and I threw it into my session
on the next day or the next

117
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,280
week, and it had such a profound
impact on the intensity of the

118
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,980
session. It basically rattled my
cage much more aggressively than

119
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,260
some of the more even aggressive
classical music. I like the

120
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,940
effect I recognize that it's
sort of more disorienting, more

121
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,120
giving me stronger support for
going deeper into consciousness,

122
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,440
so I just began to cultivate and
collect that type of music.

123
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,800
Kyle Buller: Yeah, that's really
interesting. And from your

124
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,460
perspective, how important is
music when you're doing high

125
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,000
dose psychedelics or just
psychedelic kind of therapy and

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,020
that self discovery format, I

127
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,060
Chris Bache: think it's very
important. Now, I've done

128
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,560
sessions without music
eventually, after long down the

129
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,100
road, and I've done Psilocybin
sessions with and without music,

130
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,480
but in working with a very
strong psychedelic like LSD, and

131
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,360
working at these very high
doses, which, by the way, I

132
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,160
don't recommend, I truly do not
recommend that people do what I

133
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,260
did. I wouldn't do it the same
way if I did it today. But

134
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,280
basically, when you're working
with opening consciousness that

135
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,860
radically Musik is a has a
tremendously powerful effect, I

136
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,740
would maybe estimate it has a
concentrating, amplifying effect

137
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,200
by five or 10 times, doing it
without psychedelic but without

138
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,380
music. So I remember I started
using music only in the fourth

139
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,220
session, and the jump that
happened in that fourth session

140
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,780
was just enormous. So I think
it's very important.

141
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,020
Kyle Buller: Yeah, it's a topic
that keeps coming up, I guess,

142
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,360
within the psychedelic
community, especially when

143
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,260
talking about putting playlists
together for therapy. And I just

144
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,700
recently recorded an episode
with a fellow who composes music

145
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,300
and ended up taking his
experiences and making music out

146
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,964
of it. So yeah, I think the
music. Piece is just really

147
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:03,904
interesting. It's a huge part
of, you know, Breathwork as

148
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,884
well. Yeah, yeah.

149
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:08,524
Chris Bache: And Helen Bonnie,
of course, her early work

150
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:12,244
plotting the various stages of
an LSD journey and the

151
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,484
characteristics of music that
support each of those stages as

152
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:17,704
we go important work.

153
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:23,959
Kyle Buller: Yeah. So where did
this idea come from of wanting

154
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,019
to engage in this, these high
dose sessions? Like, did you

155
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,559
start off saying, I'm going to
do, you know, X amount of

156
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,279
sessions and really dive in? Or
did you go in saying, I'll have

157
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,159
a few and then see where it
goes? Or did you have this idea

158
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,379
kind of mapped out of doing X
amount of sessions, or had a

159
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,459
goal with it at all?

160
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:48,939
Chris Bache: No, I did not have
any trajectory or any goal. I

161
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,359
saw the range of experiences
that Stan described in realms of

162
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:56,379
the human unconscious. I saw,
you know, since I had a pretty

163
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:59,979
good grounding in western
philosophical thought and

164
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,439
theological thought. I had a
good sense of the significance

165
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:08,039
of these states of consciousness
that he was describing. And I

166
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,619
believe that the people who
would be making the most

167
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:14,039
important contributions in my
discipline would be speaking out

168
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,979
of an experiential basis in a
matter of years, not out of a

169
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:20,459
theory, simply a theoretical
basis. This was common in my

170
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,499
time. So I just, I knew that to
do that, you just had to get in

171
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:27,379
and do your work. And I had no
idea how long the work would be.

172
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,099
I was still thinking in the
early years that, you know, you

173
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:34,219
basically go through ego death,
and then you get unrestricted

174
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:39,259
access, you know, to the deep
consciousness of existence. What

175
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:44,739
I found, of course, is that it's
not matter simply of shattering

176
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:48,819
the ego and going through ego
death. The universe has many,

177
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:53,859
many layers. And while it's all
holographically integrated, in a

178
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:57,159
sense, if you engage the
universe systematically with a

179
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,979
carefully defined kind of
methodology, the universe takes

180
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:07,079
you in by degrees. It takes you
in by layers. And as you move

181
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,079
into a new layer of
consciousness, and your

182
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,579
consciousness stabilizes at that
new layer sooner or later, if

183
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,459
you keep pushing it, the method
you're using has sufficient

184
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,019
power to take you to the very
edge of that new layer. You're

185
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:24,319
going to go through yet another
death and rebirth process that's

186
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:28,099
different than ego death that
builds upon that process. And

187
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:33,079
you go through a series of death
and rebirth processes as you

188
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,219
explore progressively deeper
levels of consciousness. And at

189
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:40,599
least that's how it happened for
me. It may be different for

190
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:43,779
other people and different
substances, but how it happened

191
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,859
to me that there was a
systematic progression, entry

192
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:51,159
into communion with the
universe, and that's where I

193
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:54,039
laid out the book. I just
basically took it in, start at

194
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,079
the beginning, try to I tried to
describe, recognize the levels

195
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,179
of consciousness that I went
into consolidated the story to

196
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:07,259
make it as efficiently conveyed
as possible. And then each

197
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:10,679
chapter basically goes into
another level of consciousness,

198
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:13,859
or another level of engagement
with the universe.

199
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,600
Kyle Buller: How would you, I
guess, define that layer of

200
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,740
consciousness, like, like, What
do you mean by that, of getting

201
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,380
to these next layers? You know,
sometimes you hear in like, the

202
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,420
New Age, like, oh, you ascended
to 5d and maybe that's how, you

203
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,540
know, some people are making
sense of that. But how would you

204
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,520
describe that moving through
layers?

205
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:39,319
Chris Bache: Well, I adopted the
working vocabulary that Stan has

206
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,959
developed in his books, between
psychic levels, subtle level and

207
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:48,099
causal level. Consciousness
differentiates low and high,

208
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:52,419
psychic low and high, subtle and
low and high, causal and that's

209
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:56,859
a vocabulary that works for me.
Of course, the universe is so

210
00:13:56,859 --> 00:14:00,599
deep and has so many hundreds of
levels, those are just

211
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:04,979
approximations, and I don't have
any vested interest in a

212
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:09,299
particular model of the universe
or model of how many levels of

213
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,259
consciousness there are when I
was going through and writing a

214
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:16,619
book and looking back
retrospectively at where this

215
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:22,339
journey went and how Many core
death and rebirth cycles. There

216
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,759
were, there many sub cycles of
death and rebirth, but four

217
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,019
fundamental death and rebirth
cycles, and therefore different

218
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:33,619
levels of consciousness. One
moves into, I found I

219
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:38,539
differentiated five levels. The
first, it takes place at the

220
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:41,439
personal mind, the level of
personal mind, and that

221
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:45,699
culminates in ego death, where
you lose your egoic or time

222
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:51,099
space identity, the second takes
place, or took place, for me, at

223
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,279
the collective mind, its
dynamics, fundamentally at the

224
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,039
early, subtle levels of
consciousness. It has to do with

225
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,519
the species mind dimensions of.
Species existence. The third

226
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,999
level is archetypal mind, where
one is moving into the highest

227
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,759
subtle level, moving beyond
simply the collective

228
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,079
consciousness of the species,
moving into different levels of

229
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,499
archetypal reality. The fourth
for me, is causal mind, causal

230
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:26,539
oneness, where you moving into
profound states of non dual

231
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:35,479
reality. Yeah, causal reality.
And then the fifth is, I call

232
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:39,739
diamond Luminosity, a
particularly deep, clear

233
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:45,159
experience of ultra clear,
particularly clear dimension of

234
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,939
light. There are many, many
different degrees of light that

235
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:54,219
one encounters. The closest I
could find in the conventional

236
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,459
spiritual literature to this was
in the Buddhist concept of

237
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:03,299
Dharmakaya, the clear light of
absolute reality, the light that

238
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:10,079
pre exists prior to the Big
Bang, right?

239
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,780
Kyle Buller: Stan even kind of
talks about that with his first

240
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,220
LSD experience, right? Yeah. I
was talking about, you know, the

241
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:26,900
ladder proceeding and way out,
yeah, yeah. Thinking about these

242
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,980
levels of consciousness, and
thinking about this like kind of

243
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,240
new psychedelic Renaissance with
psychedelic therapy. How

244
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,920
important do you think it is for
therapists to kind of understand

245
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,580
these, these levels of
consciousness when working with

246
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,420
clients,

247
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,639
Chris Bache: if you're going to
be a psychedelic therapist, of

248
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,759
course, because there are many
different levels of

249
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,739
consciousness. As a therapist,
one works at different levels of

250
00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:01,859
consciousness. So I don't think
a therapist has to have deep

251
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:06,539
familiarity with all the levels
to work at the early levels. But

252
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,599
I think conventional wisdom,
it's a good wisdom, that if

253
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,979
you're going to be working with
clients going into deep,

254
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,799
Non-ordinary states of
consciousness, you must be

255
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,019
personally familiar with those
states. Otherwise, how can you

256
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:26,359
be the stabilizing factor in the
room when someone is losing

257
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:30,139
their mind and is terrified of
losing everything they know to

258
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:34,339
be real, if you haven't been
there yourself, if you haven't

259
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:38,359
learned to let go, how can you
help someone else let go at

260
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,499
those deep levels? So I think
it's very important, and that

261
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:44,559
poses a challenge, of course, in
training psychedelic therapists,

262
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,279
because we're in this great
period now, but that's going to

263
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,199
be changing. You know, we're
going to be moving into a

264
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:53,499
different legal environment
soon. I hope the work that you

265
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:56,319
guys are doing and other people
are doing is really creating new

266
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,799
possibilities. But I think, you
know, personal experience is

267
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,259
really important in this area.

268
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,200
Kyle Buller: Yeah, thanks for
that. It's been a hot kind of

269
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,380
topic, I guess that people have
been exploring, should

270
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,140
therapists really understand
this, these layers of

271
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,080
consciousness and these
experiences to be a guide?

272
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,260
Joe Moore: Yeah, right, which is
interesting, this whole idea of,

273
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,380
yes, you can get this training,
but you don't necessarily need a

274
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,700
session. But then there's this
whole vast realm of religious

275
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,900
and philosophy, like this
material that discusses all of

276
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,440
these states in kind of
literature form, or we can go

277
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,080
experiential with it too. And I
my problem lately is I really

278
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,120
want a very strong argument for
this, and I haven't really

279
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,040
personally been able to come up
with one,

280
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,700
Chris Bache: a strong argument
for the importance of personal,

281
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,340
Joe Moore: at least personally,
at least personal experience.

282
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,540
But the point I think that you
made, which is unique, is

283
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,960
there's these very complex
spiritual experiences you can

284
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,260
have, Transpersonal experiences
you have, and that's not really

285
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,540
discussed in literature, as far
as I can tell, in terms of the,

286
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,780
at least the recent literature,
like, how do you be about this?

287
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,960
You know, yes, you became Buddha
for a millennia, and now you're

288
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,860
trying to, you know, work at
your day job again. What? What

289
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,640
do you do? Yeah, good. Any
comments on that kind of thing?

290
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,180
Chris Bache: Well, I think it's
important for people to have a

291
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,540
good, solid theoretical
grounding. I mean, I think it's

292
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,080
important to read deeply in
Transpersonal psychology and

293
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,820
works like Stan Grof and the
various people who have been

294
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,300
guiding people or taking people
into these domains and have

295
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,160
compiled a large database,
experiential database. But if

296
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,240
you don't have personal
experience of these realities,

297
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,920
you're always working at a
disadvantage, and you can have.

298
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,440
Have a verbal understanding of
what it means to go through into

299
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,600
certain territories, but if you
haven't some personal exposure

300
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,180
of this territory, you're going
to make mistakes. You're going

301
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,600
to draw inferences where an
experienced journey or would not

302
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,180
draw those inferences. You're
going to find correlations where

303
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,200
there aren't correlations.
You'll miss correlations where

304
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,920
there are correlations. These
are very, very complex

305
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:32,120
experiences. I mean, my journey
lasted from 79 to 99 covering a

306
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,500
20 year spread. I didn't publish
this book for another 20 years,

307
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,100
and partly that was because of
the legal complications I had to

308
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,600
retire from the university
before I did this, but partly it

309
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,860
took me years during the
sessions and years after the

310
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,580
sessions to work out the
complex, overlapping

311
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,320
phenomenology of these states of
consciousness. And you know, if

312
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,240
I were, I mean, I think the word
guide is maybe not the best

313
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,100
word, I mean, that implies a
role of active guidance, of

314
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,960
active direction, which is not
really the case for I think,

315
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:16,560
working with much of this work,
doing much of this work, but to

316
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,280
be a sitter, to be able to hold
the ground, to be able to help

317
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,120
somebody go to the edge of
everything they know to be real

318
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,720
and true about themselves and
about the world, and help them

319
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,720
jump over the edge, to give them
the support that they need to

320
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,620
lose their mind, I mean, to let
go of everything they know to be

321
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,940
real and true. I don't know how
one could really do that without

322
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,620
having first hand experience of
those domains. And so to that

323
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:48,220
extent, the I think the
effectiveness of therapists or

324
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,560
sitters will be limited to their
own depth of experience. They

325
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,980
can be very, very good and
skillful at levels one, two,

326
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,780
perhaps, but maybe not so much
at levels three, four or five,

327
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,720
or whatever you get the sense of
it, right?

328
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,020
Kyle Buller: That's really
that's kind of interesting to

329
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,340
think about, even like practical
stuff, like going to different

330
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,280
people for different like
sessions, maybe, I mean,

331
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,680
obviously, you have no idea what
the hell is going to come up,

332
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,500
right? But somebody focusing
more on personal dynamics,

333
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:21,860
right?

334
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,480
Chris Bache: Yeah, and I think
it's good right now, we're

335
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,260
proceeding very slowly, very
methodically. We're using

336
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,000
gentler psychedelics. There's no
federal protocol that's

337
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,960
suggesting using LSD and the
quantum in the high levels that

338
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,980
I used it. And I think that's
that's good, that's important.

339
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,660
It's important that we proceed
methodologically carefully. We

340
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,620
have a window. You know, we lost
our window 40 years ago. The

341
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,880
window is back, and it's
important that we move very

342
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,680
judiciously as we expand that
window. But sooner or later,

343
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,740
we're going to find what we
found in the early years of

344
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,900
psychedelic work, and that is
healing the personal unconscious

345
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,600
is only the first step of a long
journey into the universe, into

346
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,600
the deeper dimensions of
consciousness, which take us

347
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,080
into the I don't know what do
you call it? I think of it as

348
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,540
the mind of the universe. The
mind of the cosmos. I hesitate

349
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,560
to call it the divine mind, or
the mind of God, because that

350
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,920
language has very strong
cultural overtones that I don't

351
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,460
really want to import. But when
one dissolves, when one

352
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,984
completely dissolves at the time
space level and just dissolves

353
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:47,804
into increasingly comprehensive
fields of experience that open

354
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:52,784
realities to you that you've
never even dreamed possible. And

355
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:58,544
if you go back again and again
in a methodical way, levels of

356
00:23:58,544 --> 00:24:03,360
consciousness that at first
swallow you up whole. And it's

357
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
very, very hard to stay
consciously aware at these new

358
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,940
levels. And that's why, I think
we often call them ineffable.

359
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,200
But if you go back consistently
over and over again, what

360
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,700
happens is you acclimate, you
learn how to stay conscious at

361
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,600
levels of consciousness that
previously were not able to stay

362
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,920
conscious in and that's a
pattern that repeats itself as

363
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,240
you go deeper and deeper.

364
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,780
Joe Moore: Yeah, I find that to
be really true. Are you familiar

365
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:42,340
with this gentleman, Ken Lindy,
ie from Detroit. I'm not. He is

366
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,020
a very strong proponent of these
high level doses, and I, I

367
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,080
struggle with his arguments
around it, but, but yours, the

368
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,200
you know, seems quite sensible.
It's, you know, how do we

369
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,580
approach it? I'm

370
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,840
Chris Bache: not a proponent of
high doses. By. Stuff. I mean, I

371
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:06,120
did this work. I came through
it. See, in the early years, the

372
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,900
early high dose work done at
Spring Grove Hospital with

373
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,220
terminally ill patients. Well,
it's limited to three sessions.

374
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,620
Low dose psychedelic work, open
ended, high dose work was

375
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,460
limited to three sessions. And I
thought, going into it, I

376
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,940
thought, well, if you could do
it safely three times, you could

377
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,920
do it safely more times. But
what I found was that by doing

378
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,840
it as systematically as I did,
and pushing that edge as hard as

379
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,300
I did, it required, issues
arose, challenges arose which

380
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,360
had not been discussed in the
early levels of the work.

381
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,860
Opportunities for insights and
understanding emerge, but also

382
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,660
challenges navigating these
increasingly intense levels and

383
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,920
large levels of consciousness
and what it does to your body

384
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,840
and mind and as you go into
these realities and how it

385
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,660
affects people around you, I
found that my students never

386
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,080
knew about my work. I mean, I
kept my work completely isolated

387
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,760
from anyone on campus, but I
found at a certain point, my

388
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,280
students began to be activated
by my psychedelic work, there

389
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,920
was a natural contagion that was
happening, because consciousness

390
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,520
at these deeper levels is open
ended. It's like a lake. You

391
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,340
threw a rock in the lake, the
ripple spread out. So when one

392
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,360
person goes very, very deep,
people around them are naturally

393
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,880
going to be impacted. And I had
to learn how to take care of the

394
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,700
activations that my my students
were experiencing. That's I

395
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,420
wrote the book living classroom
as to read that came out of

396
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,920
years and years of trying to
understand this dynamic between

397
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,020
my mind and their mind and our
minds together in the context

398
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,340
of, you know, consciousness at
large. So it's not just a matter

399
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,180
of taking care of your own body
and your own emotions and your

400
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,780
intimate relationships. It's
taking care of everyone who's

401
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,440
touched by your work at a larger
collective level. But I wouldn't

402
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,540
push it as hard if I were doing
it again. I would. It's not that

403
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,600
I would avoid working with high
doses, but I would balance it

404
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,920
working with lower doses. And I
would balance working with LSD,

405
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,300
which pushes a high, cosmic,
logical ceiling, with Psilocybin

406
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,680
work and Ayahuasca work is much
more kind of embodied

407
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,840
psychedelic states.

408
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,280
Kyle Buller: Yeah, man, there's
a couple questions I want to

409
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,280
ask. Much direction I want to go
into, but I want to come back to

410
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,280
the this idea, the ripples,
right? Because I've thought

411
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,400
about this a lot, and I'm kind
of curious what your take is on

412
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,460
this, of having some of these
experiences. And I've even had

413
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,620
it in Breathwork sessions, where
it's like tapping into, I guess,

414
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,140
how you describe it, like this,
this lake, you know, you kind of

415
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,540
toss it in, and there's like
ripples and time wave or

416
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,080
something like that, where all
these kind of synchronistic

417
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,840
things might start happening.
And I'm wondering, from your

418
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,180
perspective, you know, you're
talking about your students

419
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,080
changing, do you think that was
more in the sense of your

420
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,100
presence and the way that you
were showing up, or do you think

421
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,580
it was kind of more in that
subtle realm, world where you're

422
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,780
going into these states, and it
is having more of a ripple on

423
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,460
some other sort of level?

424
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,860
Chris Bache: I think it's a
both, and I think it does as my

425
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,840
work changed me, certainly my
presence in the classroom

426
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,620
changed. But the more
interesting aspect, I think, is

427
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:51,160
working at the subtle level. I
mean, I began, for example, I

428
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,460
found that when I was lecturing
and just just looking for a

429
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,220
random example, looking for an
example to illustrate some

430
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,800
concept that I wanted to, you
know, was bringing forward, and

431
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,040
I would pause, I would just
stop, and my mind would go

432
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,780
blank. And this idea would come
to me to give this example, and

433
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,200
I would use that example. And
students began to come up to me

434
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,640
after class and began to say,
very quietly when they were sure

435
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,720
no one was listening. You know,
it's funny you use that example

436
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,480
today, because that's exactly
what happened to me this week.

437
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,840
And this first, I thought this
was just, you know, an

438
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,980
interesting, you know, accident,
but it kept happening and

439
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,700
happened repeatedly. And not
only was it happening frequently

440
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,320
enough that I knew it was it had
to have some significance, but

441
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,160
the deeper I went in my own
work, the more the students were

442
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,080
being touched. It very, very
deep, private, personal areas of

443
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,800
their lives, lives places where
they needed healing, places

444
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,040
where they were blocked, places
where they needed some help

445
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,560
getting through to the next
stage of their own development.

446
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,920
So as I was kind of facing my
blocks and entering into deeper

447
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,420
communion with the intelligence
of life, it was as if the very

448
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,940
fabric, the intelligent fabric
around me, was being activated

449
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:20,180
and triggering these kind of aha
moments with my students and

450
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,080
their own confrontations with
their blocks and the students

451
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,500
knew that something unusual was
happening. I couldn't exactly

452
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,860
explain what it was, but I had
to, you know, we all knew

453
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,920
something was happening. So I
would have students taking my

454
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,340
courses, partly for the
intellectual content, but partly

455
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,620
because they wanted to be in the
energy of the room. But I found

456
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,980
it wasn't just that there was a
resonance spontaneously

457
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,480
occurring between my energy and
their energy. There was a second

458
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,200
phenomenon that I discuss in the
living classroom, and that is

459
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,340
the effect of group fields. That
is that just like Morphic

460
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,600
genetic fields, Rupert Sheldrake
concept of Morphic fields,

461
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,200
except these are smaller. These
are not species wide fields.

462
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,680
These are more specific fields.
I found that there was, there

463
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,640
were psychic fields growing
around my courses that were

464
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,300
getting stronger year by year,
the more students studied with

465
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,540
me in these courses. And it
wasn't a field that was being

466
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,400
generated by their learning. So
hundreds and hundreds of

467
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,180
students learning over many
years creates a field that was

468
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,600
impacting and accelerating and
deepening the learning of

469
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,800
subsequent students and
subsequent semesters. So there

470
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,980
were multiple factors going into
this phenomenon.

471
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,680
Kyle Buller: Yeah, it's super
fascinating, and I don't know

472
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,940
how to make sense of it at
times. So yeah, thanks for

473
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,480
sharing that.

474
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,780
Chris Bache: But you know, it
turns out that once you let go

475
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,340
of an atomistic psychology, once
you and it's not that atomistic

476
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,540
psychology is really true. That
is the psychology which treats

477
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,020
our individual consciousness as
the individual stand alone

478
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,400
phenomenon. We know that that's
true, but underneath that is a

479
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,080
quantum reality. It's a quantum
psychology, and once you let go

480
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,280
of this idea that everything
that happens around us can be

481
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,320
explained in terms of the of the
aggregate of simply individual

482
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,520
awareness and open to this
larger participatory Cosmos

483
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,500
where there is a deeper context.
It's like a deeper tide that's

484
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:36,140
always moving in and out. It's
always flowing. It actually

485
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,320
becomes very coherent. It's very
easy to understand. It says that

486
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,620
you have to shift your
metaphysical basis, right?

487
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,100
Kyle Buller: Yeah, that makes
sense. That makes sense.

488
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,260
Chris Bache: It's like plate
tectonics. You know, in the

489
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,440
early years, it was very, very
hard to see. It just looked

490
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,060
ridiculous. But once we began to
see it, then a whole lot of data

491
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,720
began to make sense, and it was
elegant and simple and

492
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,440
transparent.

493
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,780
Kyle Buller: I'm curious also to
kind of go back to that idea of

494
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,820
kind of incorporating mushrooms
in Ayahuasca. You kind of said

495
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,700
that it seems to be a little bit
more body medicine. Could you

496
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,080
talk about the difference
between your experiences with

497
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,580
LSD and the more plant based
psychedelics? This is a question

498
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,300
that we we've been asked a lot,
and I think we even chatted

499
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,780
about in our course last two
nights ago, of like, you know,

500
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,720
what is the difference between
like, LSD? Is that a little bit

501
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,940
different that like, I've always
like, somebody said, Oh, I

502
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,220
always heard it's like, more
psychological than say, you

503
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,860
know, more kind of like
biographical and doesn't have

504
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,400
this, like spirit, right? Where
you Albert Hoffman said, right?

505
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,760
He said, you know, Psilocybin
seems to be something in there,

506
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,600
right? So, yeah, I wonder what
your take is.

507
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,720
Chris Bache: Well, inevitably,
my take is based on my own

508
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,200
personal experience, and so it's
always dangerous to generalize

509
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,800
on an end of one. So I just
don't want to over generalize

510
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,660
psychedelics, which have been
used historically, have fields

511
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,740
associated with them. So we've
been using mushrooms for 1000s

512
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,300
and 1000s of years. And I think
there's a certain sense in which

513
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,860
around the biochemistry of this
substance, there are fields of

514
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,900
human experience of human beings
engaging the deeper dimensions

515
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,560
of their own consciousness and
consciousness at large using

516
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,340
this substance. And when one
takes this substance, you don't

517
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,000
just introduce a chemical into
your body, which then you have a

518
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,180
private experience of this
substance, but there is a sense

519
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,680
in which how the substance
affects you is mediated, in

520
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,480
part, by the history of your
species with this substance. And

521
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,800
I think that's also true with
io. Ayahuasca with is a multi

522
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,680
1000 year history surrounding
Ayahuasca with LSD, we don't

523
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,580
have those fields. I mean, LSD
is a new substance, and I don't

524
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,700
think the difference is
fundamentally organic versus

525
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,000
synthetic. I don't find that
discussion terribly

526
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,860
illuminating. I mean, our
experience in the 60s and 70s,

527
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,140
that's that's a few decades.
That's not a whole lot of

528
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,500
experience when it comes to
these types of fields that I'm

529
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,560
talking about. So in my
experience, that living quality,

530
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,960
that kind of living intelligence
quality, I'm sure that there are

531
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,680
spiritual agencies on the other
side, which may account for part

532
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,160
of that and but part of it, I
think, has to do with humanity's

533
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,680
living experience with these
substances and all the

534
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,640
experiences I've had with them.
LSD, strikes me as kind of

535
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,360
cleaner in that respect. It
doesn't have that same kind of

536
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:04,260
programmed quality. Now I don't
know what it would have been

537
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,740
like if I had been working with
low doses of LSD. If I'd been

538
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,560
working with low doses, I'm sure
it would have activated my

539
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,260
experiences would have been much
more personal and psycho

540
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,880
dynamically oriented, but
working with the very high doses

541
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:25,700
that I worked with after the
first 15 sessions or so, when

542
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,480
the sessions were at their peak
hours, I was not working in

543
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,220
relationship to my personal
psyche at all. In fact, pretty

544
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,980
much in the book, I drop out the
personal story as much as

545
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,320
possible, because the personal
story kind of showed up at the

546
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,160
beginning of a session and at
the end of a session. And these

547
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,100
were very meaningful experiences
to me. They were very healing.

548
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,360
They're very, you know, helpful.
They're giving me insights to

549
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,840
relevant things in my life. But
during the peak hours, I was

550
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:05,880
usually operating far beyond the
range of personal psyche. When

551
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,420
I'm working with Psilocybin, I
don't have that experience of

552
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:15,120
being so far removed from my
personal reality. I don't have I

553
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,940
only have limited experience
with Ayahuasca. I like the

554
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,840
medicine very much. Is a very
powerful medicine. Has been

555
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,120
giving me some extra ordinary
help and extra ordinary clarity

556
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,420
here and there, but I don't have
enough experience with it

557
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,460
comparable to my 70 some high
dose LSD sessions to do a

558
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:42,040
careful AB my basic sense is
that the Psilocybin tends to be

559
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,120
less evocative, less disruptive,
less opening up to the deep,

560
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:55,540
deep levels. Ayahuasca is more
disruptive opening up to deeper

561
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:01,860
levels still, and at least for
me. LSD working with it, as I

562
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,840
did, opens up to very, very
deep, cosmic, logical levels.

563
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,200
Eventually, I don't know of
people I have not seen, though I

564
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,840
haven't tried to do an
exhaustive search of the

565
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,240
literature, but I have not seen
people having experiences with

566
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,980
Psilocybin, and, for the most
part, even Ayahuasca, that

567
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,440
correlate to the experiences I
was having in the last 10 years

568
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,460
of my work with LSD. But again,
that's just my personal

569
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:41,020
experience. It's, you know, it's
not a scholarly comparison,

570
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,440
Kyle Buller: right? Yeah. And
what were some of your

571
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,700
experiences like towards the
last 10 years? Like, I guess,

572
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,700
yeah. Could you give us some
examples of, like, those big

573
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,860
themes that you're working
through, if it wasn't so

574
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,300
personal or psychodynamic?

575
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,640
Chris Bache: Well, you know,
that's that's a hard question,

576
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,720
because there's so many levels,
and there's so many of some it's

577
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,280
always tricky to kind of jump
into the later stages, because

578
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:19,080
every stage builds upon earlier
stages. But right one of the one

579
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,000
of the barometers I would
mention, for example, would be

580
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:31,580
time when I went into subtle
level reality. I for a year, I

581
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:37,460
had a consistent set of
experiences where I experienced

582
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,300
the totality of my life from
beginning to end as

583
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:47,380
simultaneously present in
immediate now. So I not only had

584
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,460
insights into my old age, and I
didn't experience my age in a

585
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,140
sort of abstract, theoretical
way, I experienced the distilled

586
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,020
essence of my entire life boiled
down to right now. Now and all

587
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,580
of the data of my life was
present at this particular

588
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,520
moment in time. This was such a
mind shattering possibility that

589
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,040
when I first came back out of
this experience, I couldn't

590
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,000
remember it. It took me entering
into it multiple times to be

591
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,100
able to really be able to hold
on to all of those experiences,

592
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,220
which I write about in the
chapter called deep time in the

593
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:30,320
soul. Going beyond that, I began
to enter into archetypal

594
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,840
dimensions of archetype reality.
I began to have experiences of

595
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,520
something like the Platonic
domain of the reality behind

596
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,980
time, space, reality, except it
wasn't archetypes like Plato

597
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,480
conceives of them. Plato
conceives of archetypes as

598
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,400
unchanging ideas in the mind of
a transcendent intelligence. My

599
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,800
experience, these were vast,
huge beings that were so huge I

600
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,940
couldn't wrap my mind around
them. The best my mind could do

601
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,720
in imaging them was to sort of
see them as galaxies, which I

602
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,560
think was simply my mind's
attempt to image something that

603
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,940
would measure in hundreds of
1000s of light years of scope.

604
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,160
But these were beings that were
responsible for creating time

605
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,340
and space and orchestrating the
the unfolding of reality in time

606
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:35,600
and space. I went into into what
I call deep time, which is not

607
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,980
eternity, it isn't timelessness,
but it's different magnitudes of

608
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,020
time experience within a
simultaneous or broader frame of

609
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,220
reference. So I had many
experiences, and became one of

610
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,300
the overarching themes of my
book of life sessions, and

611
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:57,580
therefore the book of humanity's
future, where humanity was

612
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,160
going, what our moment in
history was, what the archetypal

613
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,380
trajectory of humanity was, what
was happening behind the scenes

614
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,820
in this global sustainability
crisis that we're entering into

615
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,740
what I have a chapter in the
book called The Birth of the

616
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:22,580
future human. Lots and lots of
going into deep time, going deep

617
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,980
into humanity's future,
experiencing what is attempting

618
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:33,680
to be born in this period of
history. What how evolution

619
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,800
works on this larger, broader
scale, and then eventually going

620
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,980
deep into various episodes of
causal oneness, Shunyata,

621
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,960
emptiness, the experience of
primal void. You know, the Void

622
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:56,620
is behind physical, manifest
existence, experience of cosmic

623
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,960
love, cause just being
overwhelmed with and I think

624
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,320
love is basically a kind of
characteristic of the inherent

625
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,260
oneness of life, where you
experience the deep, deep

626
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,900
oneness that existence is. Then
you know the emotional

627
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,900
counterpart of that is love.
It's compassion. That's the

628
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,600
emotion of oneness, and then
eventually going beyond oneness,

629
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,160
beyond the void into this
diamond Luminosity, state which

630
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,920
once I touched the diamond
Luminosity, this occupied the

631
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,500
last five years of my work. Once
I touched it. It was a state of

632
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,080
state of being, state of
consciousness, so incredibly

633
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:47,680
clear, so exquisitely clear that
once I touched it, I wasn't

634
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,260
interested in exploring any of
the other dimensions of

635
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,200
consciousness that I had been
exploring for years. Returning

636
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,180
to that condition became my sole
objective. The next in the 26

637
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,940
chapter, 26 sessions covering
four years of work. I only

638
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,040
touched that condition four
times, and in between those four

639
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,680
sessions were tremendous
cleaning, tremendous

640
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,220
purification, tremendous
detoxification, so that I could

641
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,420
return to that condition and
experience it more clearly, more

642
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,440
completely. So there's, there's
a lot of levels, yeah, that's

643
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,660
what makes the story a complex
story to tell.

644
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:28,879
Kyle Buller: Yeah, well, and
people should check out the book

645
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:31,459
and read through all this. So,
yeah, definitely.

646
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,160
Chris Bache: Well, it's nice now
that the book is out, you know,

647
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,240
they don't have to get it from
me speaking. You know, I've done

648
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,860
my best to tell the story as
cleanly and simply, as I can

649
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,360
with without a lot of the
philosophical baggage that may

650
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:52,240
have been in some of my earlier
works. Right? Is there a

651
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,760
Joe Moore: story that you'd like
to tell the most about your

652
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,400
project that maybe you could
share? Are here for any any kind

653
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:10,260
of specific gem you like to
share the most. You know,

654
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,960
Chris Bache: it's a story of a
journey, and every phase of the

655
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,400
journey was an exciting
adventure in its own right at

656
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,200
the time when I was entering
into that territory. And each

657
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,040
one was absolutely fascinating
and captivating to me when I was

658
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,720
going through this material. And
so I don't have a favorite per

659
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,880
se. I mean, I think, of course,
the diamond Luminosity is from

660
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,880
my own personal heart. That is
the deepest dimensions of the

661
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:56,800
story. The deepest aspect, I
think, the story of the birth of

662
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,320
the future human, where
reincarnation is taking

663
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,660
humanity, is an important
component of the story, because

664
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,580
I what happened to me in one
particular session, in the 38th

665
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,400
session, without this cutting
down to the important piece here

666
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,320
is that I began to experience
all my lives coming into me, all

667
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,520
my former lives were kind of
being integrated. And I've I've

668
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,340
done a lot of other work,
hypnotic regression work, to

669
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,660
familiarize myself with some of
my deep life history, but I

670
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,540
experienced all my former lives
coming in very quickly. It was

671
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:37,760
like wrapping string on around a
kite spool. And there came a

672
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,720
moment when all of that energy,
with all those living

673
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,620
experiences, they fused. And
when they fuse, they ignited.

674
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:50,620
And there was a tremendous
explosion of diamond light from

675
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,800
my chest, and it threw me into a
completely different state of

676
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,280
consciousness and and I think
what I was being shown in this

677
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,020
experience, what I was being
given was an understanding of

678
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,800
where reincarnation is taking
us, because, classically,

679
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,700
reincarnation, you know, leads
to a gradual, hopefully a

680
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,900
sustained development of more
compassion, more understanding,

681
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,700
developing our qualities of our
deep essential nature, more and

682
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,040
more richer and richer levels.
We make mistakes, we go back, we

683
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,460
learn, we go forward in this
process. But I don't think the

684
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:30,260
process is really about taking
us incrementally to eventually

685
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,420
producing a better life, which
is incrementally plus one from

686
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,360
where we were previously. I
think eventually, if we die and

687
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,960
we expand in the after death
condition. We're born, and we

688
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,700
contract into a immediate, one
life focus. We die and we

689
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,660
expand. We're born. We go back
and forth. If we keep this up,

690
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,680
just for hundreds and 1000s and
10s of 1000s and hundreds of

691
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,500
1000s of years, if we keep this
up, sooner or later, the

692
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,880
totality of our consciousness,
which most people would

693
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,320
experience only after they die,
the deep soul, sooner or later,

694
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,920
that soul consciousness, I
think, the evolutionary

695
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,940
trajectory is for this
consciousness to wake up inside

696
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,320
our physical incarnation, and
that's What I call the birth of

697
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,060
the diamond soul, when you wake
up and we are not tempted to

698
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:30,800
identify with simply egoic this
body, mind, kind of structure

699
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:36,020
that we know ourselves to be an
internal being. We know

700
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:41,200
ourselves to be in relationship
with other eternal beings. We

701
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,160
have a felt sense of history
with many, many of these beings,

702
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,700
and the compassion that comes
with that history and a sense of

703
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,040
open transparency to the cosmic
intelligence at large. I think

704
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,700
that's basically where we're
going. And I don't know, I think

705
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,160
this is not a private
experience. It's a collective

706
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,960
experience. The universe doesn't
work in in small numbers. The

707
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,440
universe works with whole
species. And what's happening is

708
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,340
really an evolving of our entire
species in the direction. If

709
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,880
there are one thing, I guess, I
keep, I would come back to one

710
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,780
thing which I wish I could kind
of reach into my heart and

711
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:24,260
communicate to people. It would
be to let go of this terribly

712
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,860
constricting fear of death,
because if we're afraid of

713
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,580
dying, we've got it all
backwards. You know, here's

714
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,060
where the hard work is done.
When we die, we have all this

715
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,120
Hollywood bullshit about what
happens to us when we die, and

716
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,120
most of it, most of it's just
trash. When we die, we enter,

717
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:48,340
you know, we go back home, we
enter. The vast majority of us

718
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:53,680
entered pretty, very easily,
straight into the depth of where

719
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,820
we come from. And there are many
layers of that reality. So

720
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,300
there's a lot of work to do. Uh,
but there's absolutely nothing

721
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,360
to fear and death. And one of
the things that's come out of my

722
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,220
work is I just I don't have a
fear of death. I mean, dying is

723
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:16,920
pain the ass, but being dead has
absolutely no fear for me. In

724
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,620
fact, it's something I look
forward to very much.

725
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,100
Joe Moore: Kyle, how do you
respond

726
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:25,879
Kyle Buller: to that? That
resonates a lot with me. Of what

727
00:50:25,879 --> 00:50:29,359
you're saying, like kind of gave
me a little bit of chills. So I

728
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:34,399
don't know if you know my my
story. Listeners probably know

729
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,279
this, if you've been following
us for a while, but when I was

730
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:41,619
16, I had a Near-Death
Experience, and so rupture my

731
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:48,699
spleen. When I was in the MRI or
the CAT scan machine, I was

732
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:52,839
overwhelmed with this, this
blissful feeling of love and

733
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,259
beauty that I was going back
home. And there is a sense

734
00:50:56,259 --> 00:50:58,359
something came over me and said,
You're going back home, you're

735
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:00,599
going to you're going back to
the stars, where we all come

736
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,959
from, and this, you know,
physical life is going to cease

737
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:08,039
to exist, but you're going to
continue on. And that was really

738
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:13,439
beautiful. And it wasn't scary
when I when I first heard I was

739
00:51:13,499 --> 00:51:16,199
dying, and like they said, you
know, you have internal

740
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:21,259
injuries, you're losing massive
blood, I thought, you know, I

741
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:24,499
was pretty terrified, but in
that moment, as I was drifting

742
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:30,019
away total acceptance, and so I
actually had a really hard time

743
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:33,739
coming back here right because,
and I could probably resonate

744
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:36,679
with that idea, the diamond,
loose Luminosity of wanting to

745
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:39,559
return there. Because I
definitely resonate with that

746
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:42,639
feeling of wanting to return to
that oneness that I felt on that

747
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,819
night, and that's what got me
into like exploring

748
00:51:45,819 --> 00:51:48,639
psychedelics, is having very
similar experiences with

749
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,979
psychedelics and correlating
that to my Near-Death

750
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:56,499
Experience, and wanting to get
back there and over time. And

751
00:51:56,499 --> 00:52:00,899
maybe you'll resonate with this
is like the period in between of

752
00:52:00,899 --> 00:52:04,739
stopping and actually focusing
on the integration. And I keep

753
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:07,679
coming back to this idea that
the work is here. This is where

754
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,799
all the magic happens, and how
do we really embody that and

755
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:11,459
show up?

756
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,480
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah, to
complain about the restrictions

757
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,180
of time and space is kind of
like a weightlifter complaining

758
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:26,000
about the weights. This is where
the work is done. Time space is

759
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,760
an extremely demanding
environment, but progress made

760
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,720
here has exponential import for
what we're what's available to

761
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,540
us when we die. Of all the
various populations of people I

762
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:39,140
feel the closest affinity from
my own psychedelic work are the

763
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,460
near death episode people I've
taught near death episode

764
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,700
research for years at my
university in one of my courses.

765
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,660
And so I've really read deeply
in the near death literature,

766
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,800
and that's the closest
correlation I find with the

767
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,920
deepest of the psychedelic
experiences, very strong

768
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,440
correlations. And Ken ring was
one of the near to so, you know,

769
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,260
one of the founders of that
movement and I have, we've

770
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,720
written together and dialog
together. He's a good friend

771
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,260
around that,

772
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:15,239
Kyle Buller: yeah, yeah, it's,
it's a powerful topic, something

773
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:19,799
I think about often, right? And
what I guess my early

774
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:23,059
experiences got me really on
this path. Was just like, you

775
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:26,839
know, I enter this space where
it just felt so similar with

776
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:30,559
like this. I had an experience
with Psilocybin, where it's just

777
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,879
so on par with dying, and it
just captivated my attention of

778
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:38,599
how could a substance like this?
I mean, I guess in a sense, you

779
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,979
know, if you take it from the
psychotherapeutic like lens.

780
00:53:41,979 --> 00:53:45,099
It's like reliving trauma,
right? I'm kind of, my psyche is

781
00:53:45,099 --> 00:53:48,159
processing that experience, and
I'm going back there to kind of

782
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,399
reprocess it. But I have plenty
of other experiences where, no,

783
00:53:51,399 --> 00:53:54,999
it still felt pretty similar and
on par with that original

784
00:53:55,059 --> 00:53:55,539
Near-Death Experience.

785
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,720
Chris Bache: Yeah, I've died
many times. I mean, I feel like

786
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,380
and that that was the full
impetus in the early work at

787
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,200
Spring Grove, was to give people
a foretaste of where they're

788
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,100
going and they die. And, you
know, I've gone through that in

789
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,480
shamans. This is very familiar
territory, so there's nothing

790
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,180
unique to me there, but I've
gone through that death process

791
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:22,100
so many times. It's It feels
very comfortable and very

792
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:26,900
natural, and coming back is
sometimes challenging. I mean,

793
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:32,540
the hardest chapter for me to
write in this book was the last

794
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,440
chapter coming off the mountain,
because it basically tells a

795
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:42,820
story of what happened after I
stopped my sessions, and I

796
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:47,560
basically entered into a period,
eventually, of deep, deep

797
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,960
existential loneliness. I found
that I had really worked very

798
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,680
hard in integrating my sessions.
I did all of all my very

799
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,320
carefully. I wrote them down, I
studied them, I tried to

800
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,240
incorporate. Or teaching into my
life. I really thought I had it,

801
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,260
you know, locked down pretty
well, and I thought therefore

802
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,620
that I could stop my sessions
and I would just be able to kind

803
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:16,200
of collect and ponder the many
gifts that I had been given

804
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,500
through the years. But what I
learned was that integrating an

805
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,840
entire journey is different than
integrating individual sessions,

806
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,620
and that by repeatedly going
deeper and deeper and deeper

807
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,400
into the universe and experience
the exquisite ecstasy of

808
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:37,280
dissolving into sheer light
repeatedly and entering into

809
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,980
dissolving into the crystalline
body of the Divine, when for

810
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,620
various reasons, I made the
decision that it was time for

811
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:50,020
this work to stop, I found that
I had a I was suffering from a

812
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:55,420
loss of communion, a deep, deep
existential sadness. And

813
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:58,540
eventually, years down the road,
I found that I was really just

814
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:03,900
waiting to die, that I could
return to the light. And I

815
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,580
realized, you know, that wasn't
right. That's not the way this

816
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,520
work is supposed to end. You
know, my entire body was

817
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,180
screaming, failure to integrate.
But because I had been so

818
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:20,160
careful trying to integrate, it
wasn't clear what the where the

819
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,940
imbalance had come in, what I
found eventually is that there

820
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:30,920
was an imbalance that had I had
cultivated inadvertently,

821
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,700
between Transcendence and
imminence. It's all the divine.

822
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,280
The physical universe is the
divine. I knew that it was the

823
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,320
divine. I knew that we're never
absent from the Divine for any

824
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,560
moment, it's only our own
illusions that keep us in that

825
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:50,320
sense. But I had pushed so
deeply into Transcendence that

826
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,500
in this to a certain degree, I
had lost my footing in the

827
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:58,420
imminent divine, and I had to
make a conscious choice and

828
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,640
undertake specific practices to
really kind of ground myself

829
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,140
back in the imminent divine for
the remainder of my years on

830
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:14,580
this earth. It took about 10
years for me to really get

831
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:18,420
solidly, comfortably back inside
my time space suit.

832
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:22,879
Kyle Buller: Wow, I can imagine,
after 20 years of deep

833
00:57:22,879 --> 00:57:27,499
exploration, I mean, that's a,
I'd say that's probably a pretty

834
00:57:27,499 --> 00:57:29,059
long integration process,

835
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,680
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah. And
that's, I think, you know, in

836
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,700
this respect, my story is
sometimes described as a hero's

837
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,480
journey, but it's not the hero's
journey the way it's usually

838
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,900
thought of, it's not simply
going and experiencing something

839
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,600
and bringing back, you know,
something valuable for your

840
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:55,420
culture, for yourself. It's all.
It's tempered by, it's tempered

841
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:01,200
by a kind of lesson that comes
from dealing with, not the

842
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,140
failure of some aspect of the
journey, but actually of the

843
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,760
success of the journey, of being
wounded by the sheer beauty of

844
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,820
what one experiences. You
literally are wounded by the

845
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:16,740
beauty of the universe, by the
experiencing the extraordinary

846
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,860
intelligence of the universe,
extra ordinary love of the

847
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:25,280
universe. And if you're not able
to create a container inside

848
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,500
your historical existence where
you can breathe this

849
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:36,140
intelligence in and breathe the
compassion in, then you know

850
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:43,840
it's like it literally can kind
of become painful. So it my, my

851
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,160
story is in part of it's a
cautionary tale. It cautions

852
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,060
against, and even though I tried
to be as methodical as possible

853
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,820
and do it as carefully as
possible and integrate it as

854
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:01,260
deeply as I could, it cautions
against going too deep, too

855
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:07,920
fast. If you can call 20 years
too fast, going too deep, or

856
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,320
deeper than you can actually
productively use and I think my

857
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:18,180
memories have changed not only
the rest of the years of my

858
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,640
life, but my memories have
changed the trajectory of my

859
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,680
soul's entire evolution. So I
don't think of the results of my

860
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:33,980
journey as necessarily coming to
fruition in just, you know, the

861
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:40,100
next few decades. I think they
come to fruition over lifetimes.

862
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,540
It's changed the entire
trajectory of my deep

863
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,800
evolutionary project. And I
think that's true for anyone who

864
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,160
enters into this. You know, when
you enter into deep intimacy

865
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,420
with life in this way, you
purify, and you're purifying,

866
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,720
you offload. A lot of, you know,
painful trauma, whatever,

867
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,680
whatever, but you. Also open up
to it a different a different

868
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:10,920
relationship with the universe.
So right now, my primary way of

869
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,940
being with the universe in this
intimate way is not working with

870
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,780
psychedelics. That time of my
life is largely over. I'm 70

871
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,260
years old, and this is, you
know, somewhat of a young man's

872
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:26,120
game, young person's game. I do
a lot of contemporary of

873
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,360
classical contemplative
practice. I do a lot of Vadnais

874
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:34,640
practice, which I find to be
very complementary to deep

875
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:40,780
psychedelic work. I don't feel
any cross purposes between the

876
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:49,000
two different work methods of
working. I should mention in

877
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,600
this context, though, I think it
would be a mistake to hold to

878
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:03,000
sort of evaluate the value of
psychedelic, deep psychedelic

879
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:07,800
work by holding it accountable
just to the Enlightenment

880
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:13,080
project, I started this work
with an agenda of an

881
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:19,680
enlightenment Project. What
happened was my personal

882
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:25,580
Awakening was completely
eclipsed eventually by a project

883
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:31,040
of a collective awakening. All
my work began to be focused on a

884
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,400
type of healing of the
collective psyche that went

885
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,300
beyond my personal healing, and
an awakening of the collective

886
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,920
psyche that went beyond my
personal awakening, and then it

887
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:48,880
became just a radical adventure,
a cosmicological adventure going

888
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,720
so deep that it would be
impossible to bring those

889
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,800
experiences back and stabilize
them in some kind of spiritually

890
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:02,400
awakened State. It's just a
different project, you know, the

891
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,880
Enlightenment project and cosmic
logical exploration project.

892
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,840
These are two different projects
that have to be evaluated on

893
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,940
their own terms. My two cents,

894
01:02:17,219 --> 01:02:23,239
Kyle Buller: no, yeah, I would
agree it sounds Yeah, hmm.

895
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:31,399
Joe Moore: Yes, this is quite
the interview. Certainly, like a

896
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:32,179
much, I knew

897
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,160
it was going to be a big topic,
but I'm always impressed by how

898
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:43,660
big some of these things become.
Yeah, you know, I do think some

899
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:48,580
people are doing similar
projects nowadays, though, I

900
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:53,560
want I wonder if LSD still in
vogue in this context. You know,

901
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,720
Chris Bache: I don't know. I
worked with LSD primarily

902
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,740
because that was the work that
Stan had done most of his early

903
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:06,180
work with, and I trusted what I
saw on Stan's research. And I

904
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,060
trusted, you know, the history
there and the methodology he

905
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:13,680
developed. I only began to work
with other psychedelic

906
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:19,140
substances pretty much after my
LSD work was done. And so the

907
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:23,060
mind that I brought to my
Psilocybin experiences and my

908
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:26,780
Ayahuasca experiences and salvia
div and arm so on so forth, the

909
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:33,080
mind was that the mind that had
been transformed by all my

910
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,860
previous psychedelic work, which
is the other thing to you know,

911
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,080
important to take account of
that the mind the experiences

912
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:46,480
that we have reflect the entire
history of our working in

913
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,940
Non-ordinary states of
consciousness. So if we've done

914
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:53,320
this work only a few, a few, two
or three times, well, then we

915
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:58,420
have that kind of depth of
experience to bring to it. But

916
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,200
if we've been doing this work
for years and years and years,

917
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,220
naturally, these substances are
going to have a different kind

918
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,840
of effect, because we've been
transformed. The way I think of

919
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:14,700
this is that, listen, my
experience, the universe is an

920
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,600
infinite ocean of possibilities,
just an infinite ocean that will

921
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,280
never, ever get to the end of
it. I used to think that we'll

922
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,640
get to an end state. That was
the project to get to hold, to

923
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,600
get to the end condition that
was taken away from me along the

924
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:35,540
journey, I began to understand
it's an infinite, infinite

925
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:40,220
progression. I get distracted
from my original point by that

926
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:45,940
particular, that particular
image? Yeah, I'll just stick

927
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:51,340
with that. I lost my train of
thought, but I'll yeah, that

928
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:51,580
works

929
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:57,340
Joe Moore: for us because it's
our orientation is this Grof Ian

930
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:03,240
meets Whitehead and John Cobb.
Kind of. A synthesis, and, you

931
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,480
know, largely this, at least,
the project of the company here.

932
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:13,020
But yeah, yeah, it's, it's good
to hear that, you know, it

933
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:18,420
rhymes, in a sense, with that
Bodhisattva vow of, let's keep

934
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:22,520
going like there's not this end
point Nirvana, until everybody's

935
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,840
there, and it's going to be a
long, long, long, long time, if

936
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,360
time even enters into that
discussion,

937
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:32,420
Chris Bache: it's a long time,
except, of course, it's speeding

938
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:36,980
up. You know, it's kind of like
our collective karma as a

939
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:41,440
species is coming at us hard.
You know, the whole history. You

940
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,200
know, our culture is basically a
culture that's been built by

941
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,340
ego. And for all the many
virtues and values of the ego,

942
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,340
it's basically, it's
fundamentally a fragmented

943
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,220
condition, and therefore it
creates a world which is deeply

944
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:57,280
imbalanced with between
ourselves and between other life

945
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,320
forms. And you know that world
is coming to a radical and

946
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,880
accelerated breakdown. And I
think this is actually part of

947
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:10,560
the evolutionary pivot that we
are coming into a time where we

948
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:14,280
literally will not be able to
continue operating out of the

949
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,300
same, not just an economic or
industrial or technological

950
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:22,580
basis, but we will not be able
to continue functioning out of

951
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:27,140
the same psychological basis of
egoic consciousness. So how fast

952
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:32,060
we might make this transition?
If we use historical projections

953
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,660
from the past, we probably
deeply underestimate how fast

954
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:38,660
this could happen. In fact, in
that chapter on the birth of the

955
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,740
future human, where I talk about
particularly one session,

956
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,700
session 55 that took me deep
into the death and rebirth of

957
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,840
humanity. The message that kept
coming through over and over and

958
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,680
over again was, this is going to
happen much faster than anyone

959
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,820
could have is imagine it's going
to happen much faster, you know.

960
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:00,780
So I think we're the game is
getting very, very intense we're

961
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,840
being driven into non linear
dynamics. Feels that way.

962
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:08,280
Conscious dynamics, the
collective psyche, is being

963
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:13,380
hyper stimulated by the trauma
that we're going into. And when

964
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:16,860
systems, we know from physical
systems, from physical systems,

965
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,860
enter into non linear
conditions, they can do things

966
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,300
that they could not do when they
were in lower energy linear

967
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,500
conditions. And I think that
something similar happens with

968
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:32,120
psychic fields, the integrated
psychic field that holds all of

969
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,720
our individual minds. When that
psychic field is hyper

970
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,860
stimulated by the suffering that
we're going into, but it's hyper

971
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:42,700
stimulated, it moves will
eventually move into a non

972
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,960
linear condition. And the rules
of non linear conditions of

973
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,340
dynamics apply to psychic fields
as well as physical fields,

974
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:58,420
small changes can elicit huge
outcomes, latent connectivity,

975
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:03,120
which was kind of invisible at
the linear level, becomes

976
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:07,200
suddenly active and visible at
the non linear level. Things can

977
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,500
happen much faster at the non
linear level than at the linear

978
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:17,340
level. So, you know, we're going
into a trial by fire, and I

979
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:22,040
think this trial is actually
part of the conscious intention

980
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,800
of the creative intelligence
itself. I don't think it's

981
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,160
accidental, and I don't think
there are any victims here. You

982
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,920
know, personally, my own
personal belief is we all chose

983
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,120
to be here. We chose to be part
of this time in history. It's an

984
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:39,620
extraordinarily important time
to be fully conscious and fully

985
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,560
active. I of

986
01:08:43,659 --> 01:08:45,939
Kyle Buller: it's give me chills
thinking about that. It's

987
01:08:47,799 --> 01:08:50,139
interesting. It does feel like
things are really kind of

988
01:08:50,139 --> 01:08:53,619
speeding up. And, you know,
sometimes I'm like, oh, you

989
01:08:53,619 --> 01:08:56,139
know, you always kind of hear
that as you get older, time

990
01:08:56,139 --> 01:09:00,359
seems to be speeding up. But
even, you know, talk to people

991
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,639
that are older and like, things
just seem to be happening

992
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,419
quicker and quicker. It is
really interesting. Feel like, I

993
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:08,399
can't, like, hold on to
anything, you know? It's like,

994
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,919
once you kind of grasp on to it,
something else has already

995
01:09:10,919 --> 01:09:12,539
changed form. You know, it's,

996
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:16,980
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah. So many
of our, not only our technology

997
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:20,220
is driving this way, but our
social customs, you know, just

998
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,000
They're dissolving right out
from underneath us. The

999
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,840
standards of truth are changing,
and it's a confusing time and

1000
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:30,800
it's a it's a dangerous time and
it's a hard time, but it's an

1001
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,260
extraordinarily exciting time.
It is.

1002
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,180
Kyle Buller: Do you see
psychedelics aiding in this

1003
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:43,359
Chris Bache: in any way? Yeah,
absolutely. I think that the

1004
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,199
ways in which psychedelics have
come back into our culture, both

1005
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:51,699
from the Central American and
South American cultures, which

1006
01:09:51,699 --> 01:09:57,219
have kept this tradition alive,
the the new psychedelics these,

1007
01:09:57,219 --> 01:10:02,159
you know, LSD is often compared
to the i. The atom bomb, since

1008
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,879
they were discovered at the same
time, this exponential this

1009
01:10:05,879 --> 01:10:09,959
opportunity to explore
dimensions of consciousness that

1010
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:13,019
previously, previous
generations, for the most part,

1011
01:10:13,499 --> 01:10:17,519
classically, have had to spend
lifetimes meditating in order

1012
01:10:17,519 --> 01:10:21,979
just to get access to some of
them. And now people of even

1013
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:27,019
modest spiritual capacities can
have temporary experiences of

1014
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:31,819
these realities, which have a
profound they require a profound

1015
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:37,039
redrafting of our existential
assumptions about how life works

1016
01:10:37,339 --> 01:10:40,899
and that we can do this. We can
engage these, these dimensions

1017
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:43,839
of consciousness, not for
recreational purposes and not

1018
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:47,019
even for healing purposes, but
we can engage them

1019
01:10:47,019 --> 01:10:50,979
systematically for educational
and deep transformational

1020
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:54,759
purposes, not only for our own
personal transformation, but we

1021
01:10:54,759 --> 01:10:58,599
can. We can work on behalf of
the collective states of

1022
01:10:58,599 --> 01:11:02,879
consciousness. I mean, I think
psychedelics have just, they

1023
01:11:02,879 --> 01:11:06,239
have that's, that's what I saw
when I first read Stan grofberg.

1024
01:11:06,299 --> 01:11:09,299
I saw, this is going to change
everything. It's going to be a

1025
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:12,659
true before and after
development. We're going to it's

1026
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:17,039
like the invention of the, as he
says, the microscope for biology

1027
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:21,259
and the Telescope for Astronomy.
It just increases the quantity

1028
01:11:21,259 --> 01:11:25,699
of data we have access so too,
so that it changes, it forces a

1029
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:29,299
radical revision of our
theoretical understanding. I

1030
01:11:29,299 --> 01:11:33,019
think psychedelics are part of
it, and just in time, because we

1031
01:11:33,019 --> 01:11:38,419
have very little time, yeah, it
feels that way. Yeah, it's

1032
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:44,679
coming out. It's very fast, very
fast. Cool.

1033
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:49,059
Joe Moore: So I hate to end the
podcast, but we're at over an

1034
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:53,019
hour, and I don't I want to be
respectful of your time, and I

1035
01:11:53,019 --> 01:11:59,199
really appreciate this. This is
very enlightening episode. Can

1036
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,979
you tell us a little bit about
where people can find your book

1037
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:04,739
and perhaps the upcoming audio
book,

1038
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:10,679
Chris Bache: they can find the
book on Amazon. I'm just putting

1039
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:14,639
the final edits on the audio
book. I'm not sure that will be

1040
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:17,219
released through inner
traditions. I'm not quite sure

1041
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:20,299
what the vehicle will be for
that, but it should be out,

1042
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:27,559
hopefully by the beginning,
beginning of the year, I will

1043
01:12:27,559 --> 01:12:30,679
have a website up. Hopefully by
the first of the year. I'm way

1044
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,639
overdue in revising this website
and getting it posted, but

1045
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:38,899
eventually, within a month or
so, people will be able to find

1046
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:44,139
me at Chris bache.com that's
going to be the easiest way

1047
01:12:44,139 --> 01:12:49,899
right now, most of my written
work and some tapes are

1048
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:55,659
collected@academia.edu under my
name, you can find them listed

1049
01:12:55,659 --> 01:13:02,399
there. But right now, I'm not as
good on social media as I should

1050
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:05,939
be. It's hard to keep up with
Yeah.

1051
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,920
Joe Moore: Only do one. It's not
worth being everywhere,

1052
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:15,840
Chris Bache: yeah, but the most
what's really exciting is the

1053
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:21,140
book is finally out, and it's as
clear a presentation of this

1054
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:24,740
material as I've been able to,
took me five years to put it

1055
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:29,060
together and bring it forward,
and it's as it's as good as I

1056
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,200
can tell the story.

1057
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,060
Joe Moore: Well, thank you for
all your work, and really

1058
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,740
appreciate you joining us on the
show today.

1059
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,920
Chris Bache: Thank you guys.
It's been a real honor. I really

1060
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,180
appreciate the work you're
doing. Keep it up. Thank you.

1061
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,760
Keep getting the word out. You
know, you guys are social

1062
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,820
catalyst. Do we need all the
social catalysts and we can get

1063
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:49,840
these days?

1064
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,020
Kyle Buller: Thank you. Yeah,
we'll keep plugging along. You

1065
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,120
you.

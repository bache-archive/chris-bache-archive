1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
Nick Mather: Nick, welcome to
rebel spirit radio, exploring

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,240
the frontiers of spirituality,
consciousness, the esoteric and

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,840
humanity's sacred relationship
with the living Earth. I'm your

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,620
host, Nick Mather, and in this
episode, I speak with Dr Chris

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,380
Bache, author of LSD in the mind
of the universe, which details

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,840
his experience of 73 high dose
LSD sessions taken over the span

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,680
of two decades. In our
conversation, Chris discusses

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,000
reincarnation, its role in human
evolution, the creative

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,800
intelligence of the universe,
our current ecological moment

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,060
and more. So much so please join
me in a fascinating conversation

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,220
with Dr Chris Bache on rebel
spirit reading. Dr Christopher

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,240
Bache is professor emeritus in
the Department of Philosophy and

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,920
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University in Ohio, where

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,240
he taught for 33 years. He's
also an adjunct faculty member

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
at the California Institute of
integral studies, Emeritus

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,140
fellow at the Institute of
Noetic Sciences, and serves on

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,340
the Advisory Council of Grof
legacy training. The heart of

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,340
Chris's work has been the study
of the philosophical

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,660
implications of Non-ordinary
states of consciousness,

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,460
particularly psychedelic states.
Chris has written four books,

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,820
life cycles, a study of
reincarnation in light of

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,900
contemporary consciousness,
research dark night, early dawn,

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,560
an investigation of psychedelic
philosophy and collective

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,540
consciousness the living
classroom, an exploration of

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,360
collective fields of
consciousness and teaching. And

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,980
his latest work, LSD and the
mind of the universe, the story

27
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,660
of his 20 year journey with LSD
by way of 73 high dose LSD

28
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,400
sessions, greeting Chris and
welcome to rebel spirit. Radio,

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,260
I am so very grateful for your
time today, and I can't even

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,780
begin to tell you how much I'm
looking forward to this

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,140
conversation. I'm glad to be
here. Good, wonderful. So first

32
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,820
I wanted to say that I
thoroughly enjoyed your book.

33
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,260
LSD, in the mind of the
universe, I found it to be

34
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,940
deeply personal. It's
beautifully written. It's very

35
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,040
engaging, and I believe
necessary. You know, I've read

36
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,680
all of your books, and in a way,
even though this is your latest,

37
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:44,440
it seems to me to be the first,
as the experiences you describe,

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,760
I think, undergird all of your
other work. That's correct,

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,240
yeah, yeah. It seems to me it's
the source material.

40
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,560
Chris Bache: It really is, yeah.
So

41
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,980
Nick Mather: I wanted to ask,
you know, I'm sure that my

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,140
listeners who are unfamiliar
with you and your work, they

43
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,680
want to know, you know what led
you on this journey? You know

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,200
what led you to this journey and
why?

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,460
Chris Bache: LSD, yeah, quite
unexpectedly. I mean, I was

46
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,280
raised in the Deep South, in
Mississippi. You know, I got a

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,140
degree in theology from Notre
Dame. I mean, I'm the last

48
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,860
person you would expect to have
written a book on LSD research,

49
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,640
and especially a psychedelic
autobiography. So I really

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,100
understand here the background
is I had, I was, had just

51
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,460
finished my graduate work at
Brown University. I was, I

52
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,440
finished my work as a
philosopher of religion. I came

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,640
out of graduate school as an
atheistically inclined agnostic,

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,440
and I had just begun teaching at
young sound state in Northeast

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,820
Ohio, and I was looking around
for where to take my research

56
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,060
after, I mean, I was publishing
articles out of my dissertation,

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,700
and I came across the work of
two people who's changed my

58
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,820
life. One of them is Ian
Stevenson at the University of

59
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,300
Virginia, and his work on
reincarnation, which convinced

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,240
me, in one reading, that
reincarnation was a fact of

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,460
life, and this was totally new
to me in my thinking. And even

62
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,260
more influential was the work of
Stanislav Grof. He had just

63
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,100
published realms of the human
unconscious. This was in 1978

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,500
when I was a young academic, 30
years old. So I read Stan's work

65
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,780
in one reading, he convinced me
that of the importance of

66
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,340
psychedelics for philosophical
inquiry, not just psychological

67
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,760
inquiry. And I became convinced
that the people who would be

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,720
making the most important
contributions in my field would

69
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,380
be people writing out of an
experiential basis, not simply

70
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,780
an intellectual basis. So I had
a choice to make, because

71
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,420
psychedelics were ill. Legal at
this time, and I made the choice

72
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:11,580
to begin a private, hidden
psychedelic inquiry just with

73
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,760
myself, which led to eventually
73 high dose LSD sessions

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,700
following Stan Grof protocols,
as he outlines in LSD

75
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,240
psychotherapy his book LSD
psychotherapy, and I during the

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,320
daytime. I was a conventional
philosopher and philosopher of

77
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,660
religion, teaching my students,
year in, year out, and in my

78
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,000
private life, I began this
systematic exploration of the

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,480
deep structure of my
consciousness, and by studying

80
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,300
my consciousness, studying how
the universe manifested itself

81
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,840
in these deep states of
consciousness. So that's how I

82
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,700
got into it wonderful.

83
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,080
Nick Mather: And you know, I
really appreciate that because,

84
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,100
you know, also coming from the
background in religious studies

85
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,880
and philosophy myself, it drives
me a little bit crazy that it's

86
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,280
all theoretical, that, you know,
there's so little of the

87
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,640
practical aspect the practice,
not practical, but the practice

88
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,740
part of it. And, you know, I
think that sometimes students

89
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,280
have a feel for this. You know,
they can tell someone, not

90
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,360
necessarily, if they have had
psychedelic experiences, but

91
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,220
whether or not they've had
profound religious experience,

92
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,040
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I want to mention right up

93
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,000
front that I do not recommend
that people do what I did. I

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,960
don't recommend that they
setting aside the issue of the

95
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,200
legality or the illegality of
psychedelics. Okay, that's a

96
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,620
changing landscape, right? But I
don't recommend that people

97
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,640
follow the protocol that I
adopted because I know more now

98
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,240
than I did in the beginning. And
I really would recommend, as I

99
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,120
do in the book, I explain, I
would recommend a different

100
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,700
protocol if I were doing it over
again

101
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,620
Nick Mather: today. Yeah, it, it
doesn't, it doesn't read like it

102
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,100
was fun. You describe a lot of
pain and suffering, which is

103
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,060
something I want to get to but,
you know, I think that a lot of

104
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,400
folks who aren't familiar with
psychedelics probably have a

105
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,140
false view of them in many ways.
You know, this isn't a wild

106
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:45,160
weekend in Las Vegas or, you
know, I think there's also a lot

107
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:55,240
of fear involved centered around
psychedelics. I wanted to, since

108
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,880
we're kind of talking about, you
know, you had to keep this

109
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:07,200
secret, and you describe in the
book how this it was that was

110
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,900
also painful for you, that you
couldn't be open about this for

111
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,040
a variety of reasons. You know,
the illegality, of course, is

112
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,640
important. It also, I think
probably there was a question of

113
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,260
credibility with some of the
academic community, who I think

114
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,240
still have a tendency to look
down on these experiences. And

115
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,200
you know, you mentioned that the
landscape seems to be changing

116
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,200
somewhat. Yeah, I know that. I
think Oregon legalized

117
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,120
Psilocybin mushrooms, there is
legislation currently moving

118
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,080
through California to
decriminalize all psychedelics.

119
00:08:51,460 --> 00:09:00,180
And I'm kind of curious, given
this new landscape where

120
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:08,580
psychedelics are more accepted.
Have you ever wondered or

121
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,720
thought about what it would have
been like to teach in this sort

122
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,020
of new environment, or a new
environment where these things

123
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,280
are more accepted?

124
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,160
Chris Bache: Wouldn't that have
been interesting there. I mean,

125
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,760
at first I did have an
opportunity to do some teaching

126
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,520
at the California Institute of
integral studies in the

127
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,180
philosophy cosmology and
consciousness program, but this

128
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,740
came rather late in my series. I
mean, basically, I did my work

129
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,820
between 1979 and 1999 when I was
between 30 years old and 50

130
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,940
years old, you know. And now I'm
in my early 70s. So, so I did

131
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,240
have an opportunity to teach
graduate students this material

132
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,920
after dark net early dawn came
out, but it would be.

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,440
Fascinating to be able to be
doing this work in the classroom

134
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,520
today, instead of in online, you
know, settings and whatnot. But

135
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,580
there's another there's an
upside for having waited as long

136
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,620
as I did. I waited 20 years
until after I'd finished this

137
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:26,180
work to write LSD in the mind of
the universe. And I did so, not

138
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,600
only for the legal
ramifications, but I did so

139
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
because these experiences were
extremely difficult to

140
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,080
understand. When you work with
high doses of LSD, it pushes you

141
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,140
into dimensions of reality that
go considerably, considerably

142
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:50,140
beyond what even appears in much
of the mystical literature. And

143
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,460
it just and the methodology that
you're using to engage these

144
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,220
deep states of consciousness is
very different than the

145
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,720
methodology that's found in
contemplative, you know,

146
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,160
meditative mystical traditions,
and so there were a lot of

147
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,880
riddles to figure out, a lot of
puzzles. And if I had been

148
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,100
teaching while I was doing this
work, I I might not been able to

149
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,600
produce as mature final product.
So by holding on to it for a

150
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,580
long time, really pondering it
and working out a lot of the

151
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,940
details. I think the end result
is a more polished, clear

152
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,800
presentation of the stages of
the journey, because my

153
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,860
experience was, but Well, two
things My experience was, I went

154
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,180
through a series of death and
rebirth experiences going

155
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,380
through layer after layer after
layer in in the universe. But

156
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,440
let me say something about the
methodology itself, because, as

157
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,720
you say, this is an unfamiliar
protocol. And if people are

158
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,780
familiar with psychedelics at
all, they tend to think of

159
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,480
psychedelics either as the
recreational in a recreational

160
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,380
way of tripping, and, you know,
social taking psychedelics and

161
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,100
socializing, or, you know, going
into the woods or something. Or

162
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,480
if they're informed by today's,
you know, experiences, they

163
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,960
would think of psychedelics in
terms of a therapeutic protocol

164
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,080
aimed at, he at personal
healing. The work I did

165
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,820
methodologically was similar to
the current protocols under

166
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,600
adoption. That is, I was working
completely isolated from the

167
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,100
outside world. Every day that I
did a session, I had no contact

168
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,220
with the outside world. I was by
myself in my home, are in my

169
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,420
then wife's office, and my
former wife was my sitter for

170
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,940
all my sessions. So I was
working under the care and

171
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,460
supervision of a clinical
psychologist, isolated lying

172
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,840
down on the floor, eyeshades
earphones, listening to very

173
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,900
carefully selected music that
was specifically designed to

174
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,740
pace the various stages of
opening and closing in a

175
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,020
session, and then my I would
write up my session within 24

176
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,420
hours of the session. So it's a
very different environment than

177
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,760
if you're, you know, taking LSD
and going to a concert or

178
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,880
something like that, yeah, yeah,
for sure.

179
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,700
Nick Mather: Um, I'm curious, in
a sense, because you were doing

180
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,900
this at a you know, the high
dose level, would the same

181
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,260
methodology apply for lower
dosages,

182
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,360
Chris Bache: same methodology
would apply. But the the nature,

183
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,600
the nature of the journey, is
different when you work with

184
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,520
lower doses or with gentler
psychedelics like Psilocybin,

185
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,440
perhaps, or Ayahuasca, you
basically, you're these, but

186
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,540
psychedelics do is they amplify
the unconscious. They amplify

187
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,460
consciousness, and they catalyze
consciousness. So things that

188
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,980
are usually far beyond your
capacity, out of your conscious

189
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,180
ability to experience, begin to
come forward into your

190
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,100
experience. So there is a
churning and a rising of

191
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,760
unconscious content in your
conscious awareness. If you're

192
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,080
working with lower doses of a
psychedelic, you tend to peel

193
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,000
consciousness in layers, so you
may spend lots and lots of time

194
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,180
working through various
psychodynamic levels of

195
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,220
consciousness, then moving stage
by stage, slowly into deeper

196
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,460
levels of consciousness. When
you work with high doses of

197
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,620
psychedelic there's a much more
powerful, cathartic sense of it,

198
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,060
and you you tend to move very
quickly through various

199
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,620
psychodynamic levels and engage
starting with what Stan calls

200
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,220
the pair. Natal level of
consciousness are at the

201
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,820
boundary between physical
reality and and spiritual

202
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,480
reality, and then you keep
pushing deeper and deeper into

203
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,240
various levels of Transpersonal,
our spiritual consciousness.

204
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,440
Nick Mather: Okay, one more
question, kind of about

205
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:28,520
methodology, a understand that
it's helpful to begin a session

206
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,080
by stating an intention. And you
had an intention, I believe that

207
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,500
you wrote it was something like,
you know, may I made this help

208
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,740
me serve the common good, or
something like that. But then

209
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,800
later you write that with the
high doses you were taking, that

210
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,820
the intention didn't seem to
matter that you were taken

211
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,340
where, I guess, by this cosmic
intelligence, which we can talk

212
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,360
about a little bit later. I
wanted to take you. I'm curious,

213
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,820
is the intention still important
in the low dose sessions, or is

214
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,440
there a similarity where you can
set the intention but you're

215
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,760
going to go wherever, whatever
is driving this experience wants

216
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,420
to take you?

217
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,460
Chris Bache: I think it's a
combination of both. If you are

218
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,680
the essence of this type of
practice is surrender. You just

219
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,100
completely once you create safe
conditions, once you are really

220
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,120
contained, you surrender
completely to the experience and

221
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,600
let it take you wherever it
wants to go, whether or not you

222
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,980
understand it at the time, but
when you are working with lower

223
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,100
doses, it disrupts your
psychological structure less,

224
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,560
and so your your reasons for
doing the work can influence

225
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,900
more where you go when you work
with high doses. My experience

226
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,620
was, at least my personal
experience was that it it just

227
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,040
whatever intention I had going
into the work was very quickly

228
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,160
completely shattered, and it
didn't really make much

229
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,300
difference the intention I
brought in. I was on a journey,

230
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,020
and a deeper consciousness, a
larger consciousness, was

231
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,440
guiding my journey. And there
were many, many things that

232
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,780
happened and I didn't really
understand, in certain respects,

233
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,140
I did not understand the deep
structure of what was happening

234
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,780
until years and years of
experiences later. I mean, there

235
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,920
was a journey that I was on, and
you can't understand what's

236
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,580
happening simply from where
you've been in the past without

237
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,300
knowing where you're going in
the future. So it's from the

238
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,140
hindsight perspective that I can
understand some of the structure

239
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,860
of what happened. But what I
found was that I was always

240
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,960
engaging or being guided by an
intelligence, which I think of

241
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,740
as the mind of the universe, a
cosmic intelligence.

242
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,540
Nick Mather: Okay, yeah, I
wanted to talk a little bit more

243
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,900
about this cosmic intelligence.
And, you know, is, is this what

244
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,140
other people might identify as
God? Is it something beyond God?

245
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,720
What else can you say about
this? You know, I'm assuming

246
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,100
that this is the mind of the
universe from the title of the

247
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,580
book.

248
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,860
Chris Bache: Yes, what shall we
call it? You know, shall we call

249
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,040
it God? But then, all of a
sudden, we have to start dealing

250
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,280
with all the historical
conditions and interpretations

251
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,600
of that concept in the different
religions of the world. And I'm

252
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,660
not really comfortable with
that. I'd use. Sometimes refer

253
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,640
to it as the divine, but that's
really just a step sideways a

254
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,320
little bit. I don't know what we
should call it. You might call

255
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,180
it the Dao. I think of it as the
intelligence, the generative

256
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,500
intelligence of the universe,
the intelligence which is

257
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,080
responsible for the Big Bang and
the unfolding of all time and

258
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,420
space since the Big Bang. I
mean, I have this virtual

259
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:18,480
background behind me, because,
just because it tokens the

260
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,760
dimensions of the Universe,
which we have now understand in

261
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,180
this century better than we've
ever understood before, how

262
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,880
incredibly large it is, how
incredibly old it is, and

263
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,020
psychedelic research adds to
this. It's also conscious. So

264
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,400
the size of the universe and the
age of the universe are a

265
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,120
reflection, in a way, of the
intelligence and the

266
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,440
consciousness of the universe.
And it is so large we can't see

267
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,220
the edges of it, and it's so old
we can't see to the beginning of

268
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,840
it. So what shall we call this?
In classical cultures, one would

269
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,760
call it God, but. The but the
interpretations of God over the

270
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,620
last 6000 years have always been
constricted by the cultural

271
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,700
context in which these concepts
have been formed. And I don't

272
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,380
want to buy into that. And yet,
there are certain, clearly

273
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,080
certain qualities about this
consciousness which echo the

274
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,460
qualities of the infinite
divinity which have been talked

275
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,720
about, particularly in the
mystical traditions of the

276
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,580
world. Spiritual traditions,
more than in the neighborhood

277
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,500
church theology, specifically in
the contemplative mystical

278
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,400
traditions.

279
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,100
Nick Mather: When you speak, it
kind of reminds me of the

280
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,460
merkabah mysticism of Ezekiel,
where you can't actually

281
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,620
describe or explain this full
vision of God, but you can talk

282
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,160
about the throne, you can talk
about the hem of, you know, the

283
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,160
robe that God is wearing, but
it's just a very small portion

284
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,800
of this grander vision.

285
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,880
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think so. I
think in the end, I mean, I've,

286
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,600
I've spent more ink than most
people trying to describe these

287
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,080
things, and even so, I still
feel like I'm really just

288
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,940
talking about the hem of the
garment.

289
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,080
Nick Mather: Yeah, yeah,
absolutely. So I want to dig a

290
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:35,060
little bit deeper into this
cosmology that is that was

291
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:42,280
revealed to you, but also you
reveal to your readers and one

292
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,620
of the key elements is
reincarnation. And like you said

293
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:53,020
earlier, you were deeply
informed by the work of Ian

294
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,380
Stevenson at the University of
Virginia. And I agree with you,

295
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,540
I think that he provides
absolute evidence, even though

296
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:06,240
he was very cautious, trying to
be good scientists there, but I

297
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:15,060
think that the evidence is
unequivocal, but yet you have a

298
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:20,720
bit of a different Take on
reincarnation, it seems, than

299
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:27,020
the traditional understanding.
And so I would like you to if

300
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,020
you could speak to that a little
bit more and say something also

301
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,140
about how reincarnation fits
into this cosmology.

302
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,160
Chris Bache: Well, Ian Stevenson
and and a host of researchers

303
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,420
who have followed in his stead,
and a host of therapists who

304
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,380
have been working in pet and
past life therapy in the

305
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,480
hundreds and hundreds of cases
that they've generated. Convince

306
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,740
us, if you are really on
unbiased and you really look at

307
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,240
the data, I think it's
overwhelmingly clear that

308
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,520
reincarnation occurs, that there
is continuity of memory across

309
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,500
multiple lifetimes, that our
consciousness is older than our

310
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,660
body. So the mind that I'm using
to speak to you now has a

311
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:24,500
history that's older than my
physical body, but how it works.

312
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,320
You know, we we still are
beginners in this. We don't

313
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,140
really know the physics of
reincarnation. We don't really

314
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,780
know what the soul is. We don't
know how consciousness encodes

315
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,360
its learning into a new brain
physiology. We don't know how

316
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,820
consciousness leaves when a
person dies, how our experience

317
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,160
leaves intact and stays coherent
after the body falls apart.

318
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,340
There's so much that we don't
know. I'm sure we'll be learning

319
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,600
more as we go on, but there's
much that we don't know, and I

320
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,220
think many of our early
understandings of reincarnation

321
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,200
are just inadequate. I mean, for
example, the idea that you

322
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,560
incarnate as a human being and
then you come back as an animal,

323
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,540
you know, and most sophisticated
thinkers of reincarnation reject

324
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,980
that idea that it's like once
you once you can function at a

325
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,360
certain level, there's nothing
to be gained from coming back

326
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,920
and functioning at a lesser or
lower capacity level. So once a

327
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,260
human, human and up, in a way,
other ideas that that

328
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,500
reincarnation is somehow
something simple, like going

329
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,040
from one life to another life to
another life, much more

330
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,300
complicated, because when you
get into the past life

331
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,520
literature, you find that
actually my present life is

332
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,220
informed not simply by my most
immediate previous life, but my

333
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,640
multiple lives that I have
already lived. So it's like

334
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,980
playing cards, the deck may
have. 52 cards, but you're only

335
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,360
dealt a certain number of cards
for a particular hand, so the a

336
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,200
certain number of my former
lives may be active in

337
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,260
structuring some of the issues
that I'm dealing with in this

338
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,400
life, and for the most part, the
other lives are quiescent and in

339
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,580
the background, so to speak. So
lots and lots of changes and

340
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:28,040
modifications to the idea. But
the basic vision is that when we

341
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,800
die, we expand into a larger
state of consciousness, which I

342
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,220
think of as the soul. And I
define the soul as the

343
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,620
consciousness that holds all of
our experience, all of our

344
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:47,380
incarnation experience. When we
incarnate, we contract down into

345
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:54,640
a very limited physical body,
historical circumstance, social

346
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,680
circumstance, so on so forth. We
it's like going to college. When

347
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,160
you start the college, when you
start the semester, you're in a

348
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,700
specific set of courses,
learning a specific set of

349
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,460
things. Then at the end of the
semester, spring break, you

350
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,780
know, you expand into a larger
state. When you die, you go into

351
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,980
a larger state, reconnect with
the universe and you contract.

352
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,400
So reincarnation, the pulse of
reincarnation is this rhythm of

353
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,880
expansion at death and
contracting at birth, over and

354
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,140
over and over and over again,
whatever the details and in this

355
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,940
process, we learn, we challenge
ourselves, we become more than

356
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,080
we were before, and naturally,
The lessons that we're

357
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,900
investigating exploring in every
lifetime. Mature is just like

358
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,040
students go back and forth to
college semester after semester,

359
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,280
but they're studying different
things as they the longer they

360
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,460
stay in school. They're
maturing. They're developing new

361
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,300
capacities. The primary
difference that I see from

362
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,720
traditional that I hold, from
traditional thinking about

363
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,260
reincarnation is that
classically, in the Eastern

364
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,340
traditions which affirm
reincarnation, the idea is that

365
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,240
we grow, we grow, we grow, and
then we come to a spiritual

366
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,160
plateau where we truly wake up
to what's been going on, and we

367
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,460
Wake up to what we are. We wake
up to that essence of us which

368
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,700
has never died, the essence
which allows us to die and be

369
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,800
reborn, that essence which in
Hinduism, it's called Atman, and

370
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,400
that Atman is Brahman, the
essence of the individual is the

371
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,900
essence of the Divine. In
classical reincarnation thinking

372
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,780
when you are sufficiently mature
that you wake up to this deeper

373
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,260
spiritual identity and
experience some of the deep

374
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:58,540
spiritual truths of oneness, of
the essence of divine being, the

375
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,460
essence of everything which
exists at that point, when you

376
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,740
die, you leave the system, you
leave time space, and there is a

377
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,240
culmination which takes place
off planet, whether it's heaven

378
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,480
or the Islamic garden or the
Buddha pure Land, that existence

379
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,200
culminates off planet in leaving
I understand that theory. I

380
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,800
understand its historical
context, and I think it makes

381
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,080
sense, given what we are capable
of understanding when these

382
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,960
ideas began to percolate about
three to 4000 years ago, but as

383
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,320
we now understand more about the
universe, more about the

384
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,980
evolutionary development of the
universe, more about the time

385
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:53,080
frame of the universe. I think
we are beginning to see a

386
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,520
different outcome. I think the
goal of reincarnation, at least

387
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,840
the I don't think we can see the
ultimate goal any more than we

388
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,920
can see the ultimate goal of the
universe, but the intermediate

389
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,620
goal is to wake up and not to
leave, but to wake up and to

390
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,360
fully embody your soul
consciousness in physical

391
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,980
reality. So the soul wakes up
and you're you no longer are

392
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:27,680
tempted to identify with your
physical body as yourself, the

393
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,340
soul wakes up, and I call this
in the book The birth of the

394
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:39,440
diamond soul, that we wake up
and we have, First of all, we

395
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,400
remember our former lives, more
importantly, we live consciously

396
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,500
the deep life which has been
gestating inside all these

397
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,700
incremental courses that we've
been taking all these centuries.

398
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,920
Nick Mather: That's absolutely
beautiful. And I love that you.

399
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,260
To, you know, it's this not
escaping into a heaven or

400
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,820
Transcendence or nothingness and
Nirvana, but you know, you say

401
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,760
it's this deepening of a sacred
presence on the earth. Yes, and

402
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,640
I'm kind of one of the questions
that came up for me while

403
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,800
listening to you was, you know,
we don't remember necessarily

404
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,540
our past lives, but you know,
some children have, you know

405
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,340
some aspects of it, and you
know, I've always suspected that

406
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,140
there are some things with me
that come from past life

407
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,600
experiences that I just can't
explain. And I've just had this

408
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,280
ongoing suspicion that something
that happened previously, that

409
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:58,780
explains everything. But what
I'm curious about is having

410
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:05,580
this, this, this knowledge that
we are souls on this journey.

411
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,760
Unknown: Does that

412
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,960
Nick Mather: how I'm trying to
figure out how I want to state

413
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:22,760
this question, but I don't want
to say obligation, but can we

414
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,400
start working being cognizant of
this Can we start doing things

415
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:38,060
now in our lives to affect the
long picture of this cycle and

416
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,960
where we are In this cycle? Can
I do things now that will

417
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,900
consciously affect my rebirth? I
guess maybe is the way I'm

418
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,060
Chris Bache: I think so. And I
think, to their credit, the

419
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,480
spiritual traditions, the
classic spiritual traditions,

420
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,040
have always said, even once you
begin to understand what's

421
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,940
happening, once you begin to
understand the truth of

422
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,660
reincarnation and the truth of
karma, and karma simply is the

423
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,320
cycle of cause and effect, which
conditions consciousness and

424
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,400
conditions destiny, once you
begin to understand that then

425
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,520
whether or not you have active
recall of your former lives, you

426
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,240
can still begin to make. You can
improve the quality of your

427
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,880
choices. So, for example, once,
once you understand karma, you

428
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,860
naturally begin to make non
choices of non injury. You make,

429
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,980
begin to make more choices of
generosity. You begin to make

430
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,460
choices which are not simply
tuned to the short term

431
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,080
circumstance, but choices of the
long term. We see this in the

432
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,260
Native American tradition, where
you're looking for seven

433
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,140
generations. Every important
choice is over seven

434
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,080
generations. That basic mindset
that you begin to think long

435
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,940
term, and you think not just how
your choices are affecting you,

436
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,000
but understanding how they
affect other people,

437
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:14,100
understanding that spiritually,
you and other people are like

438
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,540
two leaves on the same branch of
a tree. You're separate at one

439
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:23,240
level, but you're not separate
at another. And once you kind of

440
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,840
even understand that
intellectually, you make choices

441
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,340
that serve the good of the tree,
and in making choices that are

442
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,520
larger and more deep and deeper,
you accelerate your evolutionary

443
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,840
development. You accelerate it,
and you improve the outcome of

444
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,300
this lifetime, and this is this
does not require knowing who you

445
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,660
were in the 17th Century or
anything like that. It simply

446
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,620
requires that you begin to
understand the structure of

447
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:59,320
reality. This is what the Hindus
call Dharma, the teachings of

448
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,080
about the way things are, and
it's simply learning what's real

449
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,340
and then adjusting yourself to
live in harmony with what's

450
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,900
Nick Mather: real wonderful. I
was actually thinking this

451
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:18,960
morning, in thinking about this
conversation, the analogy that

452
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,400
you used of the Native American
belief, you know, the seven

453
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,700
generations out. It kind of
occurred to me that in this

454
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,780
picture that you're presenting,
you know, I think that when we

455
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:40,460
hear this seven generations out,
we often consider them as that

456
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,500
they're not us, yeah. But in
reincarnation, they are us,

457
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,540
yeah. And I was wondering if
more people had that idea, how

458
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,280
would it change? Because, how
would it change how we act in

459
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,920
the world right now? Yeah, you
know.

460
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:03,884
Chris Bache: Um, well, let's
take just the ecological

461
00:35:04,424 --> 00:35:10,844
situation in this in a
fundamental way, reincarnation

462
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:14,624
tells us that the world we come
back to is the world we leave,

463
00:35:14,744 --> 00:35:17,624
not only in terms of its
psychological structure, but

464
00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:21,020
literally in terms of the earth.
Now we've never faced a

465
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,400
situation like we are facing now
in terms of the impact of our

466
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,040
industrial culture on the entire
planet. But if we truly believe

467
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,820
that in 100 years from now,
we're going to be back on this

468
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,300
earth, don't you think we'd be
make taking better care of the

469
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,680
earth? Don't you think we'd be
looking to more care of our

470
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,960
ecological systems if we believe
that we would be coming back

471
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,920
into society and we did not know
and could not control

472
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,400
necessarily, what part of
society we're coming back into,

473
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,260
don't you think we would be
trying to create a society that

474
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,960
worked for all that was just for
all that was fair in its

475
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,060
distribution of resources. So,
yeah, I think those choices,

476
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:15,120
those ideas, do have impact on
how we think about organizing

477
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,840
our culture.

478
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,440
Nick Mather: Yeah, and it seems
to me that it's you know,

479
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,480
because I've thought about this
before, where, you know, I try

480
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,820
to be as environmentally aware
and cognizant as I can be, and

481
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,060
not harm, although I know that I
do, and part of that is just by

482
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,080
the virtue of this system that
we are embedded in. But I, but

483
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,460
I've often thought about this in
terms of karma, and that my

484
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:51,400
actions now are definitely going
to affect, you know, these

485
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,340
future generations. And it seems
kind of fundamentally wrong to

486
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,320
me to think that I would escape,
or any of us would escape the

487
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:10,260
consequences of that. Yeah, and,
and I wonder we'll move on from

488
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,280
reincarnation here in a little
bit. But I'm deeply fascinated

489
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,000
by the question

490
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:29,300
if more people accepted this
idea of reincarnation or were

491
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:35,060
aware of this, do you think and
this larger vision that you're

492
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,420
providing? Because one of the
questions I wanted to ask you

493
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,880
about this is, it seems to me,
and I'm probably jumping way

494
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,660
forward more than I should be.
But it seems to me that we are

495
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:56,320
undergoing this transformation
of spirituality, especially in

496
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,520
the United States, and I think
that more and more people are

497
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,220
hearing sort of the call to
spirituality. I've personally

498
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,820
been going through this for the
past couple of years, and I'm at

499
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,900
this place where I just want
absolutely everything I do to be

500
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:22,400
grounded in spiritual practices.
And I know I have other friends

501
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,100
that are doing similar things,
and so my question is, do you

502
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,180
think this is part of the
evolution of our collective

503
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,860
consciousness? Do you think that
we are moving towards this

504
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:41,260
larger vision that you
experienced.

505
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,300
Chris Bache: I think so. I think
that while there is a growing

506
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,220
appreciation and awareness and
thirst for spiritual truth

507
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,100
spiritual encounter, it's not
necessarily expressing itself as

508
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,320
a an increase of religiosity or
an increase of religious

509
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,080
participation. And personally, I
think what's happening is that

510
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,600
the religions that exist today
have largely done the bulk of

511
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,500
the work that they were kind of
charged with doing. I mean, once

512
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:25,880
you understand the breadth, the
length of human evolution, how

513
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,640
many hundreds of 1000s of years
we are involved in Evol growing

514
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,680
and growing and growing and
growing. Then when you look at

515
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,080
religions, and religions don't
last more than a few 1000 years,

516
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:47,200
you know, for a few 1000 years,
and a religion can't we have a

517
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,020
history of sort of thinking that
a religion, if it's true, it's

518
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,320
eternally true, it'll be true
forever and ever. But that

519
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,500
doesn't really seem to be
realistic. And I think it's more

520
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,500
likely that a religion helps an
evolve. Humanity helps a

521
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,160
reincarnating humanity go from A
to B, and then we come to B, and

522
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,300
there's so much more to go. It
requires a new set of insights,

523
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,540
a new inspiration, a new vision
to take us from B to C, and when

524
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,460
we get to C, it'll require a new
vision to take us from C to D.

525
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,840
And I think we're at that a
phase where the vision, which

526
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:32,840
has taken us to here is is not
sufficient to take us where we

527
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,980
need to go next. And I would
mention that all the religions

528
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,420
of the world, and I know you're
a professor of religion, so

529
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,520
you'll appreciate that there are
fundamentally two core mistakes

530
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,960
that all the religions of the
Axial Age make. Many others,

531
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,820
perhaps, but at least two. One
of them is it gets women wrong.

532
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,980
Systems, you know. And
relatedly, it gets nature wrong.

533
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,320
So are, when you have an up and
out theology where the goal is

534
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,120
to become spiritually awakened,
or to spiritually saved, and

535
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,320
then leave time and space, you
have this gap so that the

536
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,780
physical world is not valued as
deeply as the spiritual world.

537
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:26,480
And you know, you're so on, so
forth. So what happens is we

538
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,720
don't really have an answer to
the question, what is the

539
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,560
purpose of time space? What is
the purpose of the physical

540
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,340
world? It becomes a veil of
tears, or it becomes something

541
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,440
that we basically are trying to
get away from, to get back home

542
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,260
or to get to someplace better
that these religions are wrong

543
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,320
about women and they're wrong
about the Earth, and what we

544
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:57,460
need going forward is a vision
of reality that is larger, that

545
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,200
includes the best of the
insights of the religions of the

546
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,300
past, but then expands them into
a new set of visions which is

547
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,460
truly gender balanced and also
species balanced, because now

548
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,700
you know, the religions have
been, for the most part, and

549
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,780
anthropocentric in that they
value men and human beings more

550
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:26,540
than other species. And a vision
which values physicality, values

551
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:33,020
the experience of being physical
as more than simply a training

552
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,700
ground for going to heaven.
Yeah, very good. Yeah. I think

553
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,560
we're basically we're at a
transition time the collapse of

554
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,760
the old is getting clear and
clear, but it's not yet clear

555
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,840
what the new is going to be yet,
because we're at the cusp. It's

556
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,660
like we're in the middle of a
night, and we are seeing the

557
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,280
early, early layers of dawn, but
we really have not seen what's

558
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,200
gone what's coming forward
fully. It's a very uncomfortable

559
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,820
time to be in because there's so
much uncertainty, things are

560
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,420
falling apart. We haven't really
congealed around a new vision

561
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,620
yet. There's a lot of anxiety, a
lot of back and forth, a lot of

562
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,060
push pull, lot of conflict. We
can see this, this polarization

563
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:24,800
in the political arena, but now
we don't have any time the earth

564
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,720
is forcing us into a new
formation of our values.

565
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,640
Nick Mather: Yeah, absolutely.
And you know, I was thinking

566
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,840
that there's so much I want to
say, but I was thinking about

567
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,380
our current moment, and in
particular with this pandemic.

568
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:52,480
And initially I thought that the
pandemic was a almost like a

569
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,080
final warning shot and a last
opportunity to make a lot of

570
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,780
meaningful changes. You know, I
remember when the lockdowns

571
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,040
first happened, I was out
walking one evening, and, you

572
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,840
know, I'm in Pasadena, which is
in LA County, and the air was

573
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,080
clean, you know, I could
breathe. And I think for a

574
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,360
while, la had some of the
cleanest air in the nation. You

575
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,680
know, there were stories about
dolphins returning to the canals

576
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,180
in Venice and wildlife coming
into the cities. And for me, one

577
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,080
of the great things about this,
even though I was riddled with

578
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,720
anxieties, was it was quiet
again. I could hear nature. And

579
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,960
you would hear stories about
that, like in New York, you

580
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,020
could hear bird song again. And
I thought, well, this is

581
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,100
amazing. This is even though
this is horrible, it's also

582
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,400
potential. And then a couple of
weeks ago, we had thunderstorm

583
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,440
here, and wasn't too bad, but
there was this tremendous crack

584
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,420
of thunder. Here, and you might
appreciate this, but since you

585
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,300
know, I grew up in Ohio, so I
hear this crack of thunder, I

586
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:12,000
immediately have to go out to my
front porch. And it wasn't

587
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
really raining, and it wasn't
horribly overcast. I could

588
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,320
actually see pollution, again,
hovering over a nearby freeway,

589
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,180
and I could hear the sounds from
the freeway. I could hear cars

590
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:28,880
and horns and a siren, and I
thought, then, it's like it it's

591
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,220
too late, you know? You know, we
lost our chance. We have to go

592
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:41,800
through these experiences. And
it seems to me that in your

593
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,400
book, you actually make it seems
like you're suggesting something

594
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,600
similar. We have to go through
this. We are going to have to

595
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:55,720
experience this pain that we
spend so much time avoiding the

596
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:02,040
pain, but it's a necessary part
of this initiation into a new

597
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,880
form of humanity. Am I getting
that right?

598
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,520
Chris Bache: I think we are
being initiated. I mean, we're

599
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,120
kind of jumping, this is a
chapter that I deal with towards

600
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,000
the very end of the book. So
we're kind of jumping over a lot

601
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,080
of intermediate places. But
basically, I think humanity is

602
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:25,340
being initiated into a new level
of consciousness and a new level

603
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:31,400
of maturity, we're basically
inheriting the consequences of

604
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,600
our egoic history, where, in the
ego is a beautiful thing. I

605
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,740
think ego often gets a bad rap
in the religious traditions, but

606
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,140
individual consciousness is a
beautiful thing. I mean, it's

607
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,340
just an extraordinarily
beautiful mechanism, but it's

608
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,000
fundamentally fragmented. It
really cuts us off from each

609
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,240
other. We don't experience
necessarily, the common ground

610
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,780
that we share with each other
and with other life forms and

611
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:03,300
with the physical world itself.
And I think we can no longer

612
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:08,700
afford that kind of
fragmentation, because a world

613
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,660
built by the ego, the
civilization built by the ego,

614
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,500
is an inherently divided and
fragmented world. It's in

615
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,040
divides into have and have nots.
Just the definition of who is

616
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,180
haves and who the have nots are
and changes, but it's a

617
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:29,780
fragmented world, and it's a
world we are basically

618
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,940
inheriting centuries and
centuries of the consequences of

619
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:40,960
a world built by the ego, and we
need to grow up to become less

620
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,700
of an adolescent and more of an
adult, taking adult size

621
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,200
responsibility, adult size
vision and an adult size

622
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,180
commitment. Yeah, and I think
there's, there's going to be

623
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,440
pain, because these the choices
of the past have accumulated,

624
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,760
not only in our social systems,
in our legal systems, economic

625
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,420
systems, but they've also
accumulated within our bodies.

626
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,020
And we have all this history.
And so there's a tremendous

627
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:17,940
detoxification that's taking
place and is about to take place

628
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,300
in a purification process. And I
think that basically we're

629
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,560
coming into, I mean, this is, I
think of this as a birth

630
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:32,180
process. And birth is really,
really hard work, as every woman

631
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,660
will tell you. I mean, gestation
is a long, gradual process, but

632
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,940
birth when the waters break and
it's time to get that baby out.

633
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,040
That's a very short and
cathartic and powerful process.

634
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,700
And I think basically what's
happening is this new human, or

635
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,200
this future human, has been
gestating inside of us for 1000s

636
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,920
and 1000s of incarnations. The
diamond soul has been gestating

637
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,940
and developing and developing,
century by Century, century by

638
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:16,260
Century, and now it's time for
this higher being, this larger

639
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:21,140
being, this deeper being, to be
born. Labor is hard work, and I

640
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:26,120
think we're going into global
labor. Yeah, yeah.

641
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,180
Nick Mather: And it seems, you
know, along those lines, that we

642
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,440
also have, you know, you say
that we've embodied a lot of

643
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,600
this trauma, and also the trauma
from our past lives, and that we

644
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,780
are going through a necessary
healing process, and the pain is

645
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,980
part of that healing, it seems.
Yeah, I'm also kind of curious

646
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:55,660
about, not just in terms of the
past lives, but also in terms

647
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,420
of, I guess, like ancestors, you
know, I think about. About this.

648
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:06,900
Personally, my family has a lot
to account for, but I also

649
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,940
thought of it in terms of just
the culturally, you know, like

650
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,100
we have the founding fathers,
and those are kind of collective

651
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:24,140
ancestors, and there's a lot of
pain and trauma from them that

652
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,520
we still have to account

653
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,080
Chris Bache: for. Well, just as
we are those future seven

654
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:35,900
generations, we are our
ancestors. So our ancestors are

655
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:41,380
not separate and other than us,
but in a reincarnating universe,

656
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,560
where generation after
generation, we are constantly

657
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:51,460
coming being born. That that
means that the ancestors in us

658
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:57,280
are in the how it's easy to over
generalize and to over simplify

659
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,140
what is an incredibly subtle and
complex process. So I forgive me

660
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:06,540
if I do that, but the strains of
our ancestors, the themes and

661
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,560
the learning of our ancestors,
qualities of our ancestors, are

662
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,720
woven into our current
incarnation, and not only the

663
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:22,580
pains left over from our former
lives, but also the strengths

664
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,160
and incredible qualities, I
think that many of us have

665
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,400
learned about reincarnation by
reading the literature on past

666
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,700
life therapy. So our approach to
our understanding of

667
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:40,040
reincarnation tends to be
inflected by a therapeutic

668
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,080
model, and people go into
therapy not because of the

669
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,020
things that makes them feel
good. They go into therapy

670
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,700
because of their pain, but I
think that's really a relatively

671
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,000
small percentage of the
carryover from our previous

672
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,920
lives. Our school system has
many, many problems, but most

673
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,940
kids pass every year. Most kids
learn all right. And I think the

674
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:11,880
most people learn and come out
of every incarnation with more

675
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,560
positive than negative. And we
carry the positive forward as

676
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,440
well as carrying the negative
forward, so that there's a

677
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,380
tremendous accumulation of
capacity of intelligence built

678
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,920
into our into our bodies,
musical intelligence and

679
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,080
mathematical intelligence and
social intelligence that are, in

680
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,700
a sense, the voices of our
ancestors alive in us as we

681
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,940
Continue to this process of
becoming the ancestors of our

682
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,140
future selves,

683
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,560
Nick Mather: wonderful. And that
gets to, I think, one of the

684
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:53,020
final points I wanted to get at
in terms of reincarnation, which

685
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:57,340
is you talk a bit about, and you
have been speaking about the

686
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:02,460
evolution here, and you know the
evolution of the species and

687
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,240
reincarnation. I think at one
point you say that evolution

688
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,720
grows species, where
reincarnation grows individuals,

689
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:16,560
but there seems to be this
connection between human

690
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:21,740
evolution and as a species and
the individual reincarnation.

691
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,320
Yes, I was wondering if you
could maybe say a little bit

692
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,160
more about that.

693
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:28,639
Chris Bache: I think of
reincarnation as the higher

694
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:36,019
octave of evolution. And of
course, well, evolution, our

695
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:39,139
scientists tell us that
evolution is an evolving of

696
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:42,099
whole species. It's a learning
and development of whole

697
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:46,599
species. Somewhere along the
way, nature has figured out, or

698
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:50,919
the intelligence behind nature
has figured out, how to evolve

699
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,999
individuals within certain
highly developed species. So

700
00:53:54,999 --> 00:54:00,159
somewhere along the way, as we
move from group evolution,

701
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:04,439
individual evolution is added on
top of that, where it becomes a

702
00:54:04,439 --> 00:54:08,699
matter of the evolution of our
consciousness. So it has to do

703
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:13,079
with the birth of individuality.
When individuality begins to

704
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:18,059
emerge within species. Where
does that begin? No one knows

705
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:22,099
quite for sure, but somewhere
along the way species begin to

706
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:27,559
birth individuals, then those
individuals make choices, and

707
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:32,119
those choices begin to influence
their learning. And once you

708
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:35,899
have that cycle established, you
have the cause and effect that's

709
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:40,339
influencing not just the
physiology of species, but the

710
00:54:40,759 --> 00:54:46,599
psychophysiology of individuals.
So I think of reincarnation as

711
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:53,139
the higher octave of evolution.
It is when evolution has reached

712
00:54:53,139 --> 00:54:59,019
a point where it is involving
individuals and it is evolving

713
00:54:59,019 --> 00:55:01,439
the consciousness. Of
individuals.

714
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,100
Nick Mather: Okay, wonderful.
And when you were speaking, the

715
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:13,140
thought occurred to me that this
model avoids, in a sense, and

716
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:20,900
maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to
avoid this issue of, like

717
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,260
intelligent design that it's
coming from outside, because it

718
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:30,140
seems like in this model, we are
the ones that are actively

719
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,760
driving human evolution through
this cycle. Would that be

720
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,480
correct?

721
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,980
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think, I
think the idea of design in this

722
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:49,120
way, is a reaction to the sort
of inadequacy of conventional

723
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:54,040
evolutionary theory and its
failure to explain certain

724
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,560
aspects of evolution. So
Intelligent Design is an attempt

725
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,700
to bridge some of those gaps.
But the problem is that it's all

726
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,080
external. You always have an
external deity who's tinkering

727
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,660
from the outside. And I would
think that evolution and

728
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,920
reincarnation is an emergent
principle. It's the intelligence

729
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,380
is already there in matter. The
intelligence is manifesting

730
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,700
itself in ever greater
complexity, partly through the

731
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,580
mechanisms recognized by
science, but partly through

732
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:32,540
other mechanisms, subtler
mechanisms. But it's an emergent

733
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:36,320
quality, which means it's
arising from within So evolution

734
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,400
arises from within organisms,
and evolution arises within

735
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,280
reincarnation. It's, it's so
it's a, it's a self expressive,

736
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,460
self transformative process,

737
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:54,220
Nick Mather: okay, yeah, that
makes a lot of sense. I want to

738
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,540
turn to

739
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:03,480
some of your experiences again,
and this idea of, and we've

740
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,680
already talked about this a
little bit, but the pain and the

741
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,780
experiences, and, you know, you
describe, again, this ocean of

742
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,820
suffering that's both personal
and collective. And you know, it

743
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,980
seems to me that most religions,
I think all religions have

744
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,880
something to say about
suffering, and many of them are

745
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:30,980
centered around ending the
suffering, but you write that we

746
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,660
need to be open to our
suffering.

747
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,740
Chris Bache: Yeah, so let me
back. Let's back up a little

748
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:45,160
bit. Okay, this back into a
context here, when you are

749
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,300
working in a therapeutic
modality with psychedelics, your

750
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:53,140
system becomes hyper conscious.
You are temporarily more

751
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:57,280
conscious than you were before.
And what happens when, when you

752
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,840
do that, is that the system
begins to spontaneously cleanse

753
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,820
itself to clean itself. So it
brings forward, not simply, it

754
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:09,840
brings forward the parts of your
past which you've had difficulty

755
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,200
dealing with. It brings forward
your pain. It brings forward

756
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,220
your fears. It brings forward so
on and so forth. And by

757
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,080
confronting those fears and
confronting those pains

758
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,320
heroically, one can bring to
better resolution things that

759
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,740
had gotten started somewhere in
the past but didn't really work

760
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:37,100
out completely. So deaths that
were ugly, relationships that

761
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:43,900
were ugly, are problematic in
different ways. So you basically

762
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,540
by embracing the suffering which
presents itself to you in your

763
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:56,140
sessions, you engage that you
see it, you let it into your

764
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:02,160
awareness. And by letting it
into your awareness, you bring

765
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,200
it. It brings itself to better
outcome. And when you face the

766
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,880
trauma, say, in a particular
aspect of life, either from this

767
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,200
life or from another life,
something like this, then there

768
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,220
is a tremendous relaxation that
takes place in the system. And

769
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:24,560
the system is then free to move
into deeper and deeper levels of

770
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:30,500
reality. Now, in the early
stages of one's work, one

771
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:36,140
reaches a point where, when
consciousness begins to expand

772
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:41,920
beyond time, space reality, you
begin to be threatened with what

773
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,780
is called ego, death. And ego
here means simply the identity

774
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:52,120
that you have formed in your
time space experience. But when

775
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:57,220
consciousness begins to go
beyond that time space identity,

776
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:02,820
that time space identity of.
Eventually is shattered. It dies

777
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,420
simply because your mind is
bigger than your body, your

778
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,960
body's history. And you go
through an ego death experience,

779
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,440
which is very painful. It's it's
kind of like an inversion of

780
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,340
everything that you've ever
known yourself to be. But you go

781
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:20,780
through that process, and in
that surrender, one's

782
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:26,420
consciousness is liberated into
deeper textures of mind, deeper

783
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,680
textures of consciousness. If
you continue this process, if

784
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,820
you keep exploring these deeper
textures, you will go through

785
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:40,340
more cycles of purification,
more cycles which eventually

786
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:45,580
lead to deeper layers of dying,
deeper layers of surrendering,

787
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,780
and you will go through another
catharsis of death, and then

788
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,740
you'll be exploded into yet
deeper dimensions of reality,

789
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,460
which you will then be able to
explore in future sessions.

790
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:03,600
Again, this is always working
within a very highly focused

791
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,920
regimen of exploration. It's not
like this way, this time, this

792
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,580
way, that time. You're really
always working particular edge

793
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:18,420
now as you go through different
layers of consciousness, of

794
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:25,400
consciousness which transcends
your individual awareness. There

795
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,900
are different patterns that you
engage. And so there some of the

796
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:34,100
early patterns will be these
unfinished businesses from your

797
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,660
personal life and from your
soul's life. But sometimes you

798
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:44,800
engage unfinished trauma that
species wide, that has to do

799
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,020
with your entire human family.
And this is what I write about

800
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,800
in a chapter called the ocean of
suffering, where, after I'd gone

801
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,880
through ego death, and after I
continued to go deeper, I began

802
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:04,260
to get drawn into vast fields of
human suffering, just terrible,

803
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:07,620
terrible anger, terrible
torture, terrible pain and

804
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:12,420
suffering. And it went on for
two years, just huge tracks of

805
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:17,940
human suffering. And eventually,
at first, I saw this essay, a

806
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:22,100
refining of ego death as sort of
another layer of the death of my

807
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,940
own ego. But eventually I came
to the conclusion that this was

808
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:31,700
wrong, that this was not
something aimed at my personal

809
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:36,380
transformation at all. It was
aimed at the transformation of

810
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:40,960
nothing less than my entire
human family, that somehow, in

811
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:46,300
these experiences, in these
sessions, if you're if you're

812
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:52,720
willing to go, go there by
bringing into your consciousness

813
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:58,120
the suffering of humanity in
some way, shape or form, if

814
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,200
you're willing to let the
suffering of humanity come into

815
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,520
your full consciousness and
remember that by saying your

816
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,460
consciousness, I'm not talking
about Chris Bache, his narrow

817
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,240
personality consciousness,
because at this point, your

818
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:17,100
consciousness has expanded to
much, much, much larger

819
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:21,740
dimensions. So it is as if you
are the species, remembering the

820
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:27,320
species pain and reliving the
species pain. And if you do

821
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:33,140
that, you there is a
transformation that takes place,

822
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,340
which registers within your
individual awareness. But it

823
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:41,980
also, I think, registers, and
this is the hypothesis, but it

824
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,280
registers within this, the
awareness of the human species

825
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,480
as a whole, that I think we are
actually working to heal

826
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:55,240
humanity of some of the trauma
that it's carrying. Just as an

827
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:00,040
individual carries the scars of
his or her trauma, the species

828
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,720
carries the scars, all the wars,
of all the terrible things we've

829
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,460
done to each other, all the all
the terrible things we've done

830
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:12,780
to each other, is still carried
in the collective psyche. So for

831
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:18,960
two years, I was processing this
pain, and let me back up in

832
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,880
every session, there's a
purification part and there's an

833
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,840
ecstatic part, right? So it's
not like there was nothing but

834
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,300
pain and suffering from all
these sessions. There were

835
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,480
several hours of pain and
suffering, and then they would

836
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,500
come to a culmination, and I
would go through some type of

837
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,960
dying process, and then I would
be spun out into ecstatic

838
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,220
Transpersonal spaces where I
would be given more instruction,

839
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:49,300
more opportunities to learn and
grow. So it was always a rhythm

840
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:55,060
of purification, personal or
collective, followed by ecstatic

841
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:59,200
instruction, personal or
collective, right? And then

842
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,320
eventually. And after two years
of working in the ocean of

843
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:09,720
suffering, I went through a
profound culmination of that

844
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:15,480
process, hard to describe, but I
do the best I can in the book.

845
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:21,080
And then it stopped. It never
reoccurred. And I was operating

846
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:25,580
from that point on, I was
operating beyond the collective

847
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:28,700
psyche level, beyond the level
of the of the collective

848
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:33,560
unconscious. I was catapulted
first into archetypal reality,

849
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:37,880
and had spent a year and a half
exploring different dimensions

850
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,520
of archetypal reality. And then
there was another death and

851
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:49,120
rebirth process which catapulted
me into what some thinkers would

852
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,920
call causal reality, the reality
of oneness, where you begin to

853
01:05:53,920 --> 01:06:00,100
explore what life is like. In a
sense, you might say what life

854
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,120
is like from the perspective of
the Divine or from the

855
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,720
perspective of the creative
intelligence itself, because the

856
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:12,060
creative intelligence has
manifested itself in the body of

857
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:16,260
the universe, and there is
divisions and diversity in the

858
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:22,160
universe, but within itself,
there is a oneness which has

859
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,420
never been shattered, which is
not divided, and you can

860
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:29,840
dissolve into that oneness. And
when you dissolve into the

861
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:35,420
oneness, you experience all of
reality functioning as an

862
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:40,160
undivided whole, different you
know, different colors,

863
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,820
different textures, different
qualities, different beings, in

864
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:47,020
a way, but underneath those
differences a fundamental

865
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:53,020
wholeness. And then there was
yet another series of deaths and

866
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:57,460
rebirths. And then I was
catapulted into yet another

867
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:04,020
level of reality beyond call. So
level reality. So the last, the

868
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,560
last thing I treat in the first
chapter of the book, where I'm

869
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:12,960
introducing the method, is my
primary concern I have for

870
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,380
readers of this book, and that
is the quantity of suffering

871
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,960
that it tells and

872
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:25,820
and it's not because I'm a
sadomasochist. It's not because

873
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:29,000
I enjoy suffering. I'm like any
ordinary person, I'd like to

874
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,960
avoid my suffering. Thank you
very much. But the suffering is

875
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,460
part of a cycle of purification,
and once you learn that the

876
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:42,880
deepest breakthroughs and the
deepest insights come after the

877
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,560
deepest purifications, and you
learn that rhythm, that there is

878
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,940
purification and then
breakthrough. Then you surrender

879
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:57,340
to the suffering willingly, in
order to be of use to the

880
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:00,960
system, to be of use to the
universe, but then also to

881
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,100
receive the blessings that are
waiting for you when you go

882
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,440
through that process that are on
the other side of that

883
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,160
suffering.

884
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,440
Nick Mather: Okay, yeah, and
yeah, that answers a lot of

885
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,820
questions, because it answers
why. You know, you write that

886
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,500
you know, creation is a choice,
and we all voluntarily

887
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:29,120
participate. We choose to take
this on. But there's always a

888
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,600
blessing. There's always a
blessing. After all of this,

889
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,800
which I think is phenomenal, let
me ask you, the subtitle of the

890
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,500
book, which you refer to as the
inner title, is the diamonds

891
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,120
from heaven? Yeah, are these
diamonds from heaven? Are Is

892
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:52,960
this the blessing? Is this the
gift that we get from going

893
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,280
through this process?

894
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,140
Chris Bache: Well, there are
many blessings that come in this

895
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:03,600
work, the many blessings of
insight, of transformation, of

896
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:09,180
opening and deepening. But the
phrase diamonds from heaven, I

897
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:15,060
use in a more specific way after
I had been doing this work for

898
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:22,160
15 years, and I was had worked
through all the layers of ego

899
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:26,720
death and then collective
species, ego death and archetype

900
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:31,580
of reality and causal level
realities. I was catapulted. I

901
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,280
went through yet another
Death-Rebirth process, and I was

902
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:40,540
catapulted into a dimension of
consciousness, or a dimension of

903
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:46,360
reality which was pure light,
clear, clear, clear, clear,

904
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:51,400
crystalline light. I had
experienced light as many

905
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,360
psychedelic voyagers do at
different levels of one's

906
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,800
journey, but this was when I
call it diamond consciousness,

907
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,880
or. I'm in Luminosity. I'm not
simply using a metaphor to

908
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,780
describe the light. I'm trying
to describe a particular quality

909
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:10,800
of light, ultra, ultra, ultra,
clear, clear, beyond

910
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,440
imagination. And over the last
over the next five years, the

911
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:21,860
last five years of my work in 26
sessions, so about a third of

912
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:26,660
the entire sessions of the of my
journey, I was taken into this

913
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:32,540
diamond Luminosity four times.
And in between those four times,

914
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,720
there's lots and lots of
purification, many lessons and

915
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:39,800
many teachings, but lots of
purification. And it's those

916
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,780
four sessions and the immersion
in the diamond Luminosity on

917
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:48,340
those four days, which I
consider the greatest diamonds

918
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:51,400
from heaven. They are the true
diamonds from heaven. They are

919
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:55,660
the, for me, the most important
takeaway the domain I entered

920
01:10:55,660 --> 01:11:00,600
when I looked at the religious
literature to try to find the

921
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,440
closest thing that would
correspond to this. Of course,

922
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:11,100
the Divine is always imaged as
light, which is relevant. But in

923
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:16,080
Buddhism, they talk about
Dharmakaya, this dimension of

924
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,120
reality, Dharmakaya, and they
call it the clear light of

925
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:24,380
absolute reality. It is the
light out of which the Big Bang

926
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:30,080
emerges, and that, I think, is
what I was experiencing in what

927
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,820
I call the diamond Luminosity.

928
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:39,560
Nick Mather: There were a lot of
the cosmology that you present

929
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:44,620
seems to be very Buddhist, in
many ways, there's, there are

930
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:46,960
clearly some differences, you
know, especially with the

931
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,920
reincarnation to that. You know,
the goal is not to enter party

932
01:11:50,920 --> 01:12:02,040
in Nirvana, but to continue
evolving. I wonder, are there

933
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,880
any other differences? I mean,
do you feel that this, in many

934
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:12,300
ways, confirmed much of
Buddhism? Or, you know, what are

935
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,040
the what would be the
differences?

936
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,280
Chris Bache: Well, I've really
been deeply influenced by all

937
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,340
the religions of the world. I
mean, I taught world religions

938
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,240
for decades, you know. So every
semester I was going around the

939
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:27,380
world, exploring so I've been
deeply influenced by

940
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:32,120
Christianity, and I I began life
as a Christian and as a

941
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:36,260
Catholic. I actually was in the
seminary for four years studying

942
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:42,100
to be a Catholic priest, and the
two and I've learned so much

943
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:45,820
from Hinduism and Buddhism and
Taoism and some of the Native

944
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:50,740
American traditions, the two
which have been the most, the

945
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:54,340
deepest and long, lasting
influences on me, and Judaism, I

946
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,740
should add. I mean, I learned
Hebrew because I was doing

947
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:59,500
Biblical Studies in the early
years. I learned Greek, and

948
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:08,040
Hebrew have been Christianity
and Buddhism. And so I think my

949
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:13,320
my journey, affirms the deepest
truths of Christianity and all

950
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,380
the world's religions. I think
that affirms the deep truths of

951
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:22,340
of the Kabbalah and Judaism and
of Hinduism and Buddhism, and at

952
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:28,520
the same time, not just in in
reincarnation, the theory of

953
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:35,000
reincarnation that emerged in my
work, but in many ways, it

954
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,040
affirms, but it also eclipses,
the religions of the last

955
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,700
several 1000 years because I
think the the universe that I

956
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:50,260
was initiated into, the
opportunities that I was given

957
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:57,940
to explore the deep structure of
reality took me into, let's say

958
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:02,760
It demanded that I develop
levels of understanding that

959
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,200
went beyond anything that I had
learned or been exposed to in

960
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:12,300
these in the religions of the
world. And I began to, I was

961
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,680
forced to, sort of learn how to
become operational within an

962
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:22,520
even deeper metaphysics that
said, I think these experiences

963
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:26,780
do affirm the core truths of the
different religions. It doesn't

964
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:32,240
affirm the kind of the cultural
privilege that each religion

965
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:36,980
places on its own teacher, its
own lineage, its own revelation,

966
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:43,000
its own scripture. Those are
because every religion says its

967
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,720
scriptures are unique in the
Word of God, that tells us that

968
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:50,740
none of them are really unique.
All of them are part of a larger

969
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:57,460
dynamic process, but it affirms
the core insights of the

970
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,620
fundamental part the way we are.
Participating in each other's

971
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:06,360
reality that way, that we're all
hardwired together, and that our

972
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:11,460
deepest well being lies in
serving not just our small good

973
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:16,020
but the good of all, the good of
the whole, the value of self

974
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:21,740
sacrifice that you know he who
that it's worthwhile to

975
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:26,240
sacrifice for the good of others
when the opportunity calls for

976
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:31,940
us to do that, taking the long
vision, looking to the deep

977
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:36,500
future, orienting ourselves to
the deep future, opening our

978
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:41,080
consciousness to the inspiration
that comes from deep, deep

979
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,640
within not only our own being,
but that inspiration that arises

980
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:49,120
out of nature itself, at the
very, very deepest levels of

981
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,440
nature, as the Taoist would say,
to become one with the Tao you

982
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:58,660
know, that type of deep
inspiration. So on the one hand,

983
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:03,480
I feel very comfortable with the
religions of the world, and at

984
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:10,920
the same time, I feel where I've
ended up is in a place which is

985
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,640
larger than the than the
religions of the world.

986
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,360
Nick Mather: Yeah, I can see
that. And it's, you know, I've

987
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,440
been kind of asking this
question, and I touched upon

988
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:27,200
this a little bit ago, in terms
of feeling this call to ground

989
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:33,080
everything in spirituality. And
it's I feel like, and I know

990
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:38,300
others feel like this as well.
You know, where do you turn?

991
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:45,580
Because so many of the
traditions that we have don't

992
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:55,360
seem to answer or fulfill that
deep desire right now, yeah, and

993
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,800
you know, we can recognize, yes,
they have value, and led us to

994
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:06,900
this point. And, you know, I see
a kind of, and I hate the

995
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:14,160
clunkiness of the term, but a
kind of eco spirituality. But

996
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:17,640
I've also been thinking a lot
about in terms of like, and I

997
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:24,740
see others doing this, wanting
to reclaim a paganism, and I see

998
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,820
benefits to that. But something
that you wrote, and some things

999
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:34,280
that you were talking about that
I think that a lot of folks who

1000
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:39,080
are considering this sort of Neo
paganism, they're looking at the

1001
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:45,460
ancient gods not as actual gods,
but of archetypes. Yeah, and

1002
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,360
yet, you mentioned at one point,
I think that this whole

1003
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,880
experience, this journey that
we're on, there's going to be

1004
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:58,660
new archetypes. And so I'm
wondering, and this is a huge

1005
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,080
question, I don't know, and I
don't again, I don't know if I

1006
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:08,880
can frame it as well as I would
like, but do you think that

1007
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,080
these do you think that this new
spiritual vision is something

1008
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:19,560
that is unfolding now it's I
don't know. I guess I'm looking

1009
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:24,260
for advice to give people, and
maybe even for myself, in terms

1010
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:33,200
of how to go about grounding
ourselves in in this new

1011
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:39,560
spiritual experience and reality
as it kind of unfolds, and I

1012
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,580
guess We're all probably
participants in the creation of

1013
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:42,820
it.

1014
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:48,700
Chris Bache: Well, you know the
movements that you mentioned, a

1015
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:52,660
NEO paganism and ego
spirituality. I see both of

1016
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:57,160
these movements as attempting to
put back into spiritual

1017
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:02,520
discourse nature, which is what
was one of the two things lost

1018
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,600
in the classic patriarchal
religions. You know, they're

1019
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:12,180
trying to to bring us back to
the innate wisdom of nature,

1020
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,140
which is a wisdom which runs
throughout our consciousness and

1021
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:19,140
throughout our bodies, and
connects our body consciousness

1022
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:23,660
to the body consciousness of
Earth and eco. Spirituality is a

1023
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:27,320
way of being spiritual, way of
experiencing a form of

1024
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:32,480
spirituality which connects us
to the planet and connects us to

1025
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,320
the stars. And I think we can
see this also in the resurgence

1026
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,680
of interest in astrology, not
kind of that a naive,

1027
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:43,900
mechanistic understanding of an
astrology, but the vision that

1028
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:48,520
the universe has a pulse to it.
The galaxies have a pulse, and

1029
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:53,380
our solar system has a pulse to
it. And if you really know how

1030
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:59,260
to read that pulse, you can kind
of feel how your body and your

1031
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:03,360
destiny. Reality unfolds in
rhythm with the pulse of the

1032
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,040
solar system. And that's a form
of eco spirituality, of solar

1033
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:14,220
spirituality, of galactic
spirituality. So I think there,

1034
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,340
there is a lot of
dissatisfaction with traditional

1035
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:22,580
forms of religious spirituality.
I think psychedelics are very

1036
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:25,880
interesting in that respect. I
mean, psychedelics have come

1037
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:32,120
along at precisely this time.
Hold on. Suddenly, got a word

1038
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:37,220
that my computer is about to go.
There we go. Psychedelics have

1039
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,740
come along at a particular time
in history. Of course, they're

1040
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:44,080
very old. They've been in South
America and in the Mesoamerican

1041
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,900
and the Native American
traditions and the shamanic

1042
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:50,200
traditions have been working
with psychedelics for 1000s of

1043
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,400
years. But in our culture, in
our industrialized culture,

1044
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:59,980
they're they're relatively
young, and so just that we're at

1045
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:04,920
this point in history where we
are the most educated, we have

1046
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:08,520
the most sophisticated science,
with the deepest understanding

1047
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,900
of nature, but we've also bought
into the vision that the entire

1048
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,200
physical world is devoid of
consciousness. It has no

1049
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:20,660
consciousness. It's a giant
machine, and it's growing

1050
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:23,780
randomly with just random
mutation. There's no

1051
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:26,900
intelligence to it. There's no
intelligence. There's no purpose

1052
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:31,340
to our lives. There's no purpose
to existence. It's just, it's

1053
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:37,040
just blind matter spewing out
more complex blind matter. At

1054
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:41,320
precisely that point in time,
these mind openers have been

1055
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:45,940
dropped into our laps, and
they're giving highly educated

1056
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:50,620
people, highly scientifically
informed people, the experience

1057
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:55,000
of the the lie that that is a
lie. They're they're being given

1058
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,720
the experience of the truth that
our consciousness and our very

1059
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:05,340
existence is the result of an
intelligent action. That the

1060
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:09,540
universe is intelligent. In
fact, it's so intelligent that

1061
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:15,240
all the previous visions of its
intelligence are inadequate, all

1062
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,020
the visions of prophetic
revelation and how we have

1063
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:24,800
envisioned that intelligence are
totally child's play compared to

1064
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:30,080
the reality itself. So
psychedelics, if we use them

1065
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:35,660
carefully and constructively, it
can give us direct experience of

1066
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:40,660
layers and layers and layers of
this intelligence and that that

1067
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:45,220
that ruptures this vision that
it's all pointless, it's all

1068
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:49,300
purposeless, and that when we
die, our consciousness

1069
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:54,040
disappears. As soon as our
brains go, it opens up the eye,

1070
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:59,080
the experience that the universe
is a living intelligence. And if

1071
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:03,660
the universe is alive, that's an
aliveness that we might want to

1072
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:08,220
merge with, to enter into
conscious communion with. So it

1073
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:12,900
reanimates this interest in
vision, quest of you know,

1074
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:17,040
immersing ourselves in solitude,
in nature, immersing ourselves

1075
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,660
in meditation, where we go
deeper. We sink deeper and

1076
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:24,020
deeper into our consciousness,
until we drop out from

1077
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:27,980
underneath the floor of our
individual consciousness and

1078
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:32,600
enter into communion with the
deeper consciousness, which all

1079
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,860
spiritual traditions have told
us it's there, but now we can

1080
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:41,320
actually accelerate our
immersion into it. So I think

1081
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,920
there are many, many things
going on all at the same time.

1082
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:51,760
All of us are kind of helping us
break out of the husks of where

1083
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:56,320
we have been growing in the
past, and exposing us to all

1084
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,100
sorts of new ideas, which are
giving us tokens of where we are

1085
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,260
going in the future.

1086
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:05,820
Nick Mather: Yeah, wonderful.
And I think that that is

1087
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:08,640
actually, I'm mindful of the
time that's, I think, a

1088
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,020
beautiful place to end.

1089
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:16,560
So let me ask, I know that you
have a website, Chris bache.com

1090
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,260
is that the best place for
people to find out more about

1091
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:22,100
you and your work.

1092
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:26,300
Chris Bache: It is and as of
this moment, that website is not

1093
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:30,500
finished, but it's almost
finished, and that is generally

1094
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,740
the best place for people to
find me or to connect with me.

1095
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:41,860
You can also go to a website
called academia.edu it's where

1096
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:46,360
academics post articles have
published. And if you search for

1097
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:51,640
my name there, Chris M Bache,
you'll come to my page. And so

1098
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,660
my most important publications,
articles and things like that,

1099
01:24:56,260 --> 01:25:02,640
will show up there. But soon. My
website will be done. It'll be

1100
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:08,400
finished, and that'll it'll have
all my publications, and it'll

1101
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,580
be an easy place to keep track
of me and for us to dialog.

1102
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:15,420
Nick Mather: Okay, wonderful.
And I know that your books are

1103
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:20,540
all widely available on Amazon
and bookshop.org if you don't

1104
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:25,640
want to make Jeff Bezos any
richer than he is. And is there

1105
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,040
anything that you have coming up
that you would like the

1106
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,420
listeners to know about?

1107
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:34,760
Chris Bache: You know, after
holding my silence about

1108
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,600
psychedelics for so many
decades, the conversation that

1109
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,740
I'm having now is about
psychedelics now I don't think

1110
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:46,660
my experiences are more
important than other people's

1111
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:49,900
psychedelic experiences, but
they are my experiences, and so

1112
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:53,020
they're the best thing that I
have to offer the psychedelic

1113
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:59,200
conversation at this time. And
so what I am doing is hosting

1114
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:04,440
conversations around LSD in the
mind of the universe, six week

1115
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:08,100
conversations which are just
beginning, and those will be

1116
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,480
announced on my website for
there for people who have read

1117
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:17,700
the book and want to have
conversations around the themes

1118
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:21,380
of the book, not necessarily
Around my experiences, but

1119
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:25,160
around the themes that were
touched in those experiences.

1120
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:29,840
And I want these conversations
to be useful and available to

1121
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,680
not only to psychedelic
initiated people, but also to

1122
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:37,400
people who are not
psychedelically initiated. I get

1123
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,140
lots and lots of emails from
people who have said, I

1124
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:44,980
understand what you're saying. I
completely agree with you. I've

1125
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:48,040
had many of the same
experiences, and I've never done

1126
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,160
psychedelics at all, and that's
the way, that's what you would

1127
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:54,280
expect, because psychedelics
don't give you an experience.

1128
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:58,240
They amplify consciousness, and
it's got consciousness that does

1129
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,920
the work. So of course, there
are other ways of working with

1130
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,180
consciousness to access these
very, very deep states. So

1131
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:11,940
conversations of with LSD in the
mind of the universe. And, you

1132
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:16,080
know, I'm just, I go where I'm
called. You know, if people want

1133
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,320
to work together or invite me to
go to different places, then

1134
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,600
I'll show up. But otherwise I'm
I'm comfortable just being

1135
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,040
relaxed and growing old.

1136
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:29,240
Nick Mather: Very good. Well.
Thank you so much for your time.

1137
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:33,260

01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,620

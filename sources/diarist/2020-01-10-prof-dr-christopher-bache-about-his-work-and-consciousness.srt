1
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:14,612
Chris Bache: I just have an
understanding of the life

2
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:19,412
process from studying the cases
of small children who have

3
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:23,000
spontaneous memories of their
most immediate former life, and

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,380
we have hundreds and hundreds of
these cases documented by Dr Ian

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,100
Stevenson at the University of
Virginia, and by studying the

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,860
various child psychotherapists
who work with children and adult

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,680
psychotherapists who work with
adults in Taking people back to

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,580
the source of their pain and
recovering the early trauma and

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,100
the healing that this produces
in their present life.

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,380
Eventually, we have accumulated
enormous evidence for the fact

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,340
that we reincarnate. We
reincarnate many, many times. So

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,280
then my concern is to say, well,
so what, what does? What are the

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,060
implications for how we live our
life, and how we understand our

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,600
life, and how we understand our
relationships from this

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,080
understanding that we
reincarnation is a fact of life,

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,340
and my understanding is when we
die, we return to spirit and to

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,560
soul into a larger intelligence,
and then we consciously choose

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,460
the circumstances of our next
incarnation, and we get small

19
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,720
and focus in experience, and
then we die, and we expand into

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,640
the larger arena, and we come
back and we learn. It's like in

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
college, when you choose your
courses, you then focus for the

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,440
semester, and at the end of the
semester, you step back and say,

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,680
Ah, that's over. How nice. And
then we choose another round of

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,340
courses. And by going back and
forth, lifetime by lifetime,

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,180
hundreds of years, 1000s of
years, 10s of 1000s of years, we

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,060
are growing. We are becoming
more than we were before. I

27
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,180
think it makes an enormous
difference. It places all the

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,300
questions we have about life,
and all the projects we may

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,300
undertake in our life, and all
the relationships we have in our

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,280
life on a larger perspective, it
basically lifts the constriction

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,260
of time from our understanding
of existence. If we have, in

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,960
fact, 10s of 1000s of years to
accomplish whatever the purpose

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,760
of life is, it gives us a much
larger landscape, a much larger

34
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,960
canvas on which to create, on
which to understand, first of

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,440
all, and then on which to
create. We understand that we

36
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,820
are not simply developing the
life process for years or a few

37
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,260
decades, but we're developing
the life process for 10s of

38
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,520
1000s, hundreds of 1000s of
years that naturally invites us

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,880
to undertake projects which we
will not be able to fully

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,180
accomplish or realize in this
lifetime, but we undertake

41
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,160
projects which we will will see
a fruition in lifetimes to come.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,140
And it also expands our sense of
our connections to other people,

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,640
because the relationships that
we have in this lifetime did

44
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,820
not, probably did not begin in
this lifetime, but they have an

45
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,540
older history, and likewise, the
way we treat people in this

46
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,920
lifetime will have consequences
in a subsequent lifetime. So it

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,320
just enormously expands the
canvas in which we create. I

48
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,060
truly think that we don't really
understand yet how entering into

49
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,700
extreme Non-ordinary states of
consciousness is impacting our

50
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,980
incarnation in this lifetime, if
we are dealing with gentle

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,960
states of Non-ordinary states or
psychedelic states, if we're

52
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,320
dealing with simply staying
close to the shoreline of time

53
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,940
and space and just unearthing
some pain from this life or

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,120
earlier in our life, we have
medical models for how to

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,500
understand that if we go deeper
to experience the continuity of

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,460
life across time and the
inherent presence of the Divine

57
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,420
or cosmic intelligence in life,
then we still have spiritual

58
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,740
models for understanding how
these things might work. But

59
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,480
when we go very, very deep into
the universe, when we go beyond

60
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,320
the limits of space, beyond the
limits of time, when we immerse

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,480
ourselves profoundly into the
crystalline body of the Divine,

62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,580
how these experiences are being
assimilated by us when we come

63
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,020
back that I think we're still
working out. We're still trying

64
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,060
to understand, at least I'm
trying to work that out. It has

65
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,960
changed my understanding of my
life. It's changed my

66
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,560
understanding of history. It's
changed my understanding of the

67
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,280
Divine. And I don't when I say
the divine, I don't mean the

68
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,940
divine within our conventional,
historical, culturally embedded

69
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,660
concepts of the Divine, because
those get shattered along the

70
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:03,180
way. It's made me very calm.
Look forward to dying, because I

71
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,260
have no fear of what's waiting
for me when I die, because I've

72
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,760
already been there multiple
times, and I'm look forward to

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,760
what happens when I die. I think
the the most challenging aspect

74
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,920
of going into these states and
coming back is working to stay

75
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,320
open so you can use these
temporary experiences as seeds

76
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,200
to catalyze a deepening of your
own life. Once you are here,

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,500
once you are back, you can't
stay in those states. You can't

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,600
even recreate those states here,
but by entering into those

79
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,900
states, they give us seeds of
understanding and seeds of

80
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,200
experience, and we can nourish
those seeds here using

81
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,460
traditional spiritual practices,
meditation practices, acts of

82
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,240
compassion and so on. So for me,
how these experiences have

83
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,040
impacted my life are still being
worked out. Also, I found that

84
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,780
as long as I had to keep silent
about these experiences, as long

85
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,140
as I could not teach from these
experiences, I could not share

86
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,560
these experiences, there is a
sense in which my integration of

87
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,600
those experiences was only
partial. Now that I've begun to

88
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,480
speak freely about the
experiences. Now that I've begun

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,620
to write and teach from these
experiences, I find that their

90
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,880
integration into my being has
deepened. But this is just

91
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,720
beginning after 20 years, after
I stopped these experiences,

92
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,620
only now have I begun to write
about them completely and speak

93
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,020
about them completely. We'll see
where that goes. But I have a

94
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,960
sense that it's going someplace.
I do not know where it's going

95
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,340
to go, yet, the messages I take
away are banish fear. The things

96
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,320
that we're afraid of are not
rooted in reality, that there is

97
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,540
a deeper reality in which that
dissolves all those fears. The

98
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,940
message is to cultivate love and
compassion for all beings,

99
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,000
because compassion is inherent
in the nature of oneness and the

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,020
world is ultimately one in its
deepest forms and its deepest

101
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,940
roots, all individualized
expression of life emerges out

102
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,960
of a fundamental oneness. The
more we recognize that and live

103
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,360
in oneness, the more comfortable
we are, the more we embody the

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,740
values of oneness, the more we
are synergistically coupled with

105
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,420
the processes of life. Fear
comes out of a sense of

106
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:46,780
isolation and an atrophied
individuality, a rich, robust

107
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,880
individuality relates to the
world in compassion and looks to

108
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,260
the good of the whole it said in
some spiritual traditions,

109
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,100
everything I do for myself is
the source of my pain.

110
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,660
Everything I do for others is
the source of my freedom and my

111
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,580
joy. I think that's true. What
we do for others is is our

112
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,240
liberation, because we are
enacting the truth of oneness.

113
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,400
And I think one of the other
teachings is to have a long term

114
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,000
time horizon that we are in a
process of maturation which will

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,600
not be concluded in a few
decades or a few centuries. Our

116
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,140
maturational development takes
place over 10s of 1000s,

117
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,280
millions, billions of years. So
our relationship with the

118
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:41,740
universe is a dance which will
continue for long after we this

119
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,840
body falls away. Let me narrow
the scope a little bit to to

120
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,700
where I think the human race is
going, because in the work that

121
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:58,300
I did, I was given many, many
deep, visionary experiences of

122
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,040
human evolution. What's
happening with the human race

123
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,860
right now, and this is a natural
outgrowth when you when your

124
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,380
consciousness, when your
individual consciousness,

125
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,040
shatters, when the shell of your
individual mind shatters, and

126
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,820
you open into the larger context
of mind, you don't simply shoot

127
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,320
straight into oneness and become
one with totality, but one of

128
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,800
the things that happens is that
you open into your species mind.

129
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,280
You open into the mind of the
species. And when you were in

130
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,520
that state, naturally, you get
some insights into the

131
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,140
developmental trajectory of that
species that you are in that

132
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,780
larger sense. And many of my
experiences kept returning to

133
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,200
this theme in a way that
completely surprised me, where

134
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,260
we are going, what's happening
and over and over and over

135
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,920
again, the teaching was humanity
is coming to a time of great

136
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,060
awakening. Humanity is coming,
in time, into an explosive,

137
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,540
exponential increase in its
capacity and.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,840
But for this to take place, for
there to be this tremendous

139
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,880
remaking of the human spirit,
there must be take place a deep

140
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,160
purification process, a
literally kind of a dark night

141
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,840
of our collective soul, which is
a purification, a confrontation

142
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,740
with the shortcomings of
everything that we've been doing

143
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,580
in history, which has been
keeping us small and the

144
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,120
confrontation with our smallness
in order to open to this new and

145
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,040
emerging greatness of our being.
So I think we in this century,

146
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,800
we are entering into a time of
tremendous purification, of time

147
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,240
of destructuring, a time of
losing control, falling apart.

148
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,000
And one of my experiences, I was
taken forward in time in and was

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,380
allowed to experience the death
and rebirth of humanity at some

150
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,620
point in the future, I don't
know when, but an organic, long,

151
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,620
historically embedded process
where I experienced the entire

152
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,900
collapse of humanity and
entering into what you might

153
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,220
call a near death episode
collapse. It seemed like we were

154
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,220
going to the point of
extinction, a complete breakdown

155
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,320
of life in our structures at
fundamental levels. But then

156
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,000
from that, there took place a
tremendous resurgence, a birth

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,700
process. So I think the
historical, the historical

158
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,480
crisis that we are entering, the
global systems crisis which we

159
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,540
are entering, which is being
driven by a global ecological

160
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,420
crisis, this external crisis of
a world which is trying to

161
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,380
become one and overcome its
history of factions and its

162
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,740
history of individualism,
history of nationalism, its

163
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,140
history of classism, its history
of of gender conflict, this

164
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,160
crisis that's taking place In
the global system is actually

165
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,680
synchronistically coordinated
with a developmental crisis,

166
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,220
which is taking place
internally. As we are trying to

167
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,080
become one planet. I think we
are trying to become one soul,

168
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,460
so that we carry the history of
the planet in our being through

169
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,920
our former lives. And so as the
planet is trying to become one.

170
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,760
I think we are individually
trying to become one. And I

171
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,720
think the solution ultimately of
our planet becoming one,

172
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,240
integrated whole in a healthy,
productive way, is actually

173
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,140
dependent upon ultimately each
of us becoming whole

174
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,780
individually. So that I expect
that the solution in the end of

175
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,680
the global systems crisis will
be the birth of what I call the

176
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,240
diamond soul, which is the birth
of soul consciousness inside

177
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,300
time and space. We will wake up,
we will wake up and realize we

178
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,740
are not just this body. We have
a much larger history. And all

179
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,180
the experiences of all of those
lives come together and fuse.

180
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,900
And when they fuse, they just
don't become a longer story, but

181
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,200
they fuse in an explosion of
energy which lifts the entire

182
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,180
experience of being alive to a
higher register. So I basically

183
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,800
think that humanity is coming
into labor. We have been in

184
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,120
gestation for hundreds of 1000s
of years. Gestation is long,

185
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,020
labor is fast. Labor is very
intense and painful, but we are

186
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,980
in the process of giving birth,
not just to a new culture, to a

187
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,700
new economy, but we are in the
process of giving birth to a new

188
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,700
form of human being, an awakened
human being, a being with A much

189
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,120
expanded compassion and a much
open mind. You

190
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,300
Unknown: you.

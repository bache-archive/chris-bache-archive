Emmy Vadnais: Did you connect
with a being, or beings, or

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,100
angels or other divine entities?
And if you could share a little

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,380
bit about what that realm was
like

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,780
Chris Bache: in all the years
when I was doing this work, and

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,900
all the work I did, I never
encountered a being, a divine

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,820
being. Said, I'm God. You know,
this is what I am. It wasn't

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,120
like that. It was like I would
go deeper into a level of

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,260
consciousness, and I would
experience a communion with this

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,680
consciousness, and this
consciousness would teach me. It

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,800
knew me, it would teach me and
show me things, and it would

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,420
crush me, and then bring me
forward into still deeper

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,480
levels, and I would go into
those deeper levels, and I would

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,060
enter into communion with those
levels and and I internalized

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,380
the energy of those levels, and
I was with this consciousness,

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,740
but it never crystallized into a
specific form. I always felt its

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,720
presence. It guided my sessions.
I could enter into dialog with

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,320
it. I could enter into communion
with it. It would, it would

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,200
dissolve me into itself. But it
never crystallized into a what

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,700
you might call a personality of
God, or a person of God, and it

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,760
just kept getting larger and
larger, deeper and deeper, more

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,580
and more vast. And I think that
many of our theologies of God,

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,160
or thinking about God, is really
based upon what I would call the

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,440
early encounters with an
infinite intelligence, that that

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,260
this infinite intelligence is
far larger, far too large to

25
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,300
ever be concretized in the
historical lineages that we

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,460
recognize in the world.
Traditions.

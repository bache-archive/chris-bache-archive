1
00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:04,148
Unknown: I mean, for for
listeners again, who don't know

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:06,968
like it wouldn't appear as
though this conversation is

3
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:12,608
couched in your 20 year journey,
your 40 year journey as a

4
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:18,548
philosophy professor, and a 20
year journey with high dose LSD

5
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:23,240
sessions. And the book that were
we were referring to earlier is

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,960
your book on those journeys, as
well as a number of other books.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,660
And I'm just curious, because
what I'm seeing in the world,

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,740
which is mostly the world that
is mediated by a screen at this

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:46,600
point, is not is not the kind of
place I really want to be both

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,160
in. I don't both in the sense
of, I don't want to be where it

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,340
appears we're going. I don't we
want to be a part of a system

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,860
that does the things that it
does, you know, like the I

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,680
don't, I don't like the fact
that I'm a part of this

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,340
disgusting, distorted thing, and
also what I see from the

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,920
behavior of the people around
me, and there's a lot to be said

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,340
about how social media
algorithms and and isolation and

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,860
mental health crises
acknowledged or not, are

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,840
contributing to this, but I see
a lot of toxic behavior, a lot

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,040
of toxic people, a lot of toxic
discussion, sort of, like,

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,960
draped in this sort of, like,
this sort of self confident,

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,500
self righteous, almost
Machiavellian style, like

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,760
moralism, of like, the good
versus the evil, and the good is

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,380
me, and anyone that disagrees is
Like the violent devil I must

24
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,940
cast out and and whatever else.
And I don't feel good about what

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,900
I'm seeing about the world, and
it makes me want to just like,

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,800
hide away inside now, yeah, that
said couching this in

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,700
psychedelics and looking at it
as as a large psychedelic I'm

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,760
using air quotes for listeners
process that's happening

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,700
collectively on a global scale,
not just with humanity, but

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,760
we're although we don't know
what the feelings and the

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,180
thoughts or perspectives are,
the birds and the salamanders

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,820
and the and the whales and
whatever. You know they're going

33
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,120
through that with us. So it's
like a planet. It's like a

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,160
planetary experience, right?
Yeah, that when I see these

35
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,100
parts of myself in a psychedelic
session, it's no more

36
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,920
comfortable by any means. It's
equally as ugly, yeah, you know?

37
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,060
And I want to hide away from
that too. And yet, yeah, one of

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,760
the things you talk about in
your book is that you we need to

39
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,460
learn as a part of the
psychedelic journey. We need to

40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,540
learn how to not turn away from
our pain, or from that pain. I

41
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,360
mean, like the pain of touching
a hot fire we turn away from,

42
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,740
but this kind of pain that we
learn to turn towards it. And

43
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,220
I'm wondering if you could just
that's not a clear question, but

44
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,900
can you just comment

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
on, yeah, yeah.

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,440
Chris Bache: You know, the
starting point of serious

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,640
psychedelic work is taking
complete responsibility for

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,420
one's own shadow and and you
just go into a room, close the

49
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,740
door, lock the door, you're
inside by yourself. Nothing

50
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,780
there but you and your mind and
you go into the parts of your

51
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,620
being which are at least
initially, the most daunting,

52
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,040
the most intimidating, the most
frightening, the ugliest ones we

53
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,580
like to acknowledge, the least
you know, and but the commitment

54
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:50,080
is there to take that on, to
enter into it, when we see that

55
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,500
ugliness being manifested in the
world around us by people who

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,740
are not have not yet taken
responsibility for themselves

57
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,040
and they they are still in this
exterior mode where the shadow

58
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,620
was really outside of them, the
evil and the darkness and the

59
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,560
really ugly things were outside
of them. That's a very different

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,440
world, isn't it? And I think
this whole process of breaking

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,080
down, this breaking down process
that we're going into is

62
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,760
basically going to be breaking
down that defense that we have

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,560
to thinking that, you know,
we're the good guys or and the

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,040
other people are the bad guys.
And eventually we're going to

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,020
have to come to terms with the
fact that we're we did this. We

66
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,960
created this imbalance. We have
benefited from it. We are

67
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,160
continuing to generate it in the
cars we drive, in the lives we

68
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,420
live, in the lifestyles we
aspire to. We have done this. We

69
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,100
will we have done it. There's
going to come a time eventually

70
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,180
where there's no place else to
look but we have to. Take

71
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,980
individual and collective
responsibility for the pain that

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,240
is that is alive within us and
lives of everyone around us.

73
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,260
That really is a pivot point, I
think, when we just stop blaming

74
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,400
the other, stop blaming previous
generations, stop blaming so on

75
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,540
so forth. We really settle in.
We're not there yet. Some of us

76
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,720
are there yet. I mean, I think
the psychedelic community

77
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,240
understands these things,
because that's how you make

78
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,220
progress in psychedelic work, is
you confront the shadow. Now,

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,960
when you go into the work, you
know that the more you purify,

80
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,320
the more you cleanse, the deeper
the reward, the deeper the

81
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,740
ecstasy, the deeper the
teaching. So the more you

82
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,100
purify, the deeper the
communion. Once you learn that

83
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,660
not only do you become more
comfortable facing the shadow,

84
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,860
but you actually, actively
embrace the shadow. You active,

85
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,940
actively embrace pain and
suffering, not because you like

86
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,040
pain and suffering, but for two
reasons. One is because you

87
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,700
learned that the deeper the
purification, the deeper the

88
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,140
ecstasy. And you don't like to
suffer, but you like what's on

89
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,880
the other side of the suffering.
But the second thing is, you

90
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,600
embrace the pain and suffering,
even knowing that a lot of it is

91
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,100
not yours, because out of the
same compassion that every

92
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,700
father has for His children,
every mother has for her

93
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,440
children, and every teacher has
for all of their children

94
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,760
eventually that everybody has
for other people, and you

95
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,300
embrace the pain, not counting
whether it's yours or somebody

96
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,940
else's, but because by doing so,
you are helping somebody. You

97
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,320
are helping other beings that
you may never meet. And my

98
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,080
experiences has been that if you
do that, if you are willing to

99
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,360
take on more than your fair
share of suffering, you reap

100
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,220
more than your share of benefit.
The universe responds. It can't

101
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,340
help but respond. And I think
that's going to be happening

102
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,160
with us generationally, this
generation, the next generation,

103
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,340
the generation after that, is
going to go through suffering,

104
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,540
more than their share of
suffering, compared to previous

105
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,280
generations. And after they stop
kicking and screaming and begin

106
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,440
to get down to taking it on and
just doing it, I think they will

107
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,380
experience the blessings that
come from that deep generosity,

108
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:51,400
that profound existential choice
to work with the given, even

109
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,540
when the given is terrible, even
when it kind of crushes your

110
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,740
personal life, but you still
dedicate yourself to The good of

111
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,620
the whole, and in that process,
something begins to change.

112
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,720
Something shifts inside your
person, and the more complete

113
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,140
the surrender to the process,
the more complete the commitment

114
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,100
to that process, I think the
deeper and the faster the

115
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,480
transformation is in our
individual lives in our

116
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,100
collective lives, so that as we
move deeper into this and come

117
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,360
through it, I think
generationally, we will learn

118
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,260
what every psychedelic journeyer
learns, that we confront the

119
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,860
shadow there is Riches on the
other side of this ordeal, and

120
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,760
there's no other way to get to
it, and in the end, the irony

121
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,940
is, you kind of end up where you
were in the beginning, except

122
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,600
you're all cleaned out. You're
just all sorts of this gunk is

123
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,760
out of your system. So you are
you, and you are where you were

124
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,940
before, but you literally are
living a different life, because

125
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,000
stuff that you hadn't realized
was compromising you and

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,840
burdening you is no longer
there, and something new has

127
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,440
taken its place. I think that's
where we're going to be going.

128
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,940
It's going to take time. I

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,120
Unknown: You.

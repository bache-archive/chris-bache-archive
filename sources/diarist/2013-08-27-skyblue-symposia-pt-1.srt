00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,300
Unknown: You are listening to
part one of two of Our

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,640
conversation with Chris Bache.
You

3
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,860
Susan: foreign. Welcome to Sky
Blue symposia, a convivial

4
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,580
gathering for stimulating
conversation and a free exchange

5
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,900
of ideas. We're so glad you
could join us, friends. I'm

6
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,440
Susan, your host, and here at
our round table, our bridge

7
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,680
sibell and chipper and today,
Chris Bache is kind enough to

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,880
join us for a new symposium as
we continue consciously

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,080
exploring welcome, Chris, it's
so nice to have you with us.

10
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,540
Chris Bache: Thank you, Susan,
it's a real pleasure to be part

11
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,020
of your conversation today.
Well, we've

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,500
Susan: been anticipating this,
and we're all very interested in

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,220
your field, so I think we're
going to have a cracking time.

14
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:29,120
Good. But I'd like to start off
by talking a bit about Stanislav

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,680
grofs, his extra ordinary
accomplishments as a scholar,

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,620
healer, pioneer of Transpersonal
theory and practice. I wonder if

17
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,440
you'd be happy to tell us a bit
about Stan's work, and most

18
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,940
especially, how it's influenced
your path, your decisions and

19
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,640
your use of psychedelic inquiry.

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,620
Chris Bache: Well, Stan's been a
huge influence on my life. I met

21
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,100
Stan's work, his books, the
beginning of a series of books

22
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,860
when I first came out of
graduate school in 1978 and his

23
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,400
work, and Ian Stevenson, the
scholar on reincarnation, but

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,120
particularly Stan's work,
changed the direction the course

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,280
of my personal and professional
life. Stan is a psychiatrist and

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,540
the foremost authority of the
influence of LSD and

27
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,500
psychedelics in general, on
consciousness and the

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,280
integrating of psychedelics into
the psychotherapeutic process.

29
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,500
He had been working for many
years in Czechoslovakia at a

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,140
psychiatric institute. He came
to the United States and was the

31
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,460
director of research at Spring
Grove Hospital in Baltimore, and

32
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,240
after a number of years there,
he went to eslin, where he was a

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,840
senior research fellow and
worked for many years in that

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,340
peculiar, that very distinctive
hotbed of humanistic and

35
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,820
Transpersonal psychology that we
all know and love. As Esalen, he

36
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,220
has written over a dozen books.
I think he's really one of the

37
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,300
most seminal thinkers in
psychology and consciousness

38
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,200
studies. He's was the president
for many years of the

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,300
International Transpersonal
Association. Co founder of

40
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,080
Transpersonal psychology, with
Maslow and the ITA, the

41
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,960
International Transpersonal
Association, bringing

42
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,060
Transpersonal psychology and
consciousness studies around the

43
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,380
world and the series of
conferences held in multiple

44
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,780
countries. He's just been a
seminal thinker, and what he did

45
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,360
for me was, when I came out of
graduate school, I was a very

46
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,440
well educated atheistically
inclined agnostic. I had

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,860
assimilated the modern and
postmodern critique of religion,

48
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,580
and I was trained as a
philosopher of religion. I had

49
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,260
assimilated that critique,
moving from medieval theology

50
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,340
and the Protestant Reformation
and the emphasis on scripture,

51
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,840
and then the social and
scientific and psychological

52
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,980
critique of religion. And then I
met Stan's work, and Stan

53
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,980
basically put in front of me not
only an extra ordinary model of

54
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,560
consciousness, but he outlined a
methodology for using

55
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,240
psychedelics to explore the deep
recesses of consciousness, both

56
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,620
for therapeutic purposes, but
eventually the therapeutic

57
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,420
trajectory. When one goes deep
within, it's like the bottom of

58
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,500
your there is no bottom to your
mind. You drop right out of the

59
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,880
personal psyche into the vast a.
Expanse of the mind of the

60
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,160
universe itself. So as a
philosopher, I mean, I mean, I'm

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,800
not a therapist, and have not
primarily been concerned with

62
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,500
exploring psychedelics potential
to heal, but I've been a

63
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,720
philosopher, and so my interest
has been to use psychedelics to

64
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,880
explore the deep structure of
consciousness, to explore those

65
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,760
Non-ordinary states of
consciousness through which we

66
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,700
can experience the deeper
structure of reality itself. Now

67
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,460
of course, that involves a lot
of healing, but healing in a

68
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,360
shamanic sense, going beyond you
know, conventional Western

69
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,620
senses of healing, healing of
not only the psyche, but healing

70
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,980
of the soul, but then exploring
healing at a deep existential

71
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,220
level, as one explores the very
structure of of of well, of the

72
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,480
universe. I just couldn't pass
that opportunity down. So my

73
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,480
problem was, it was 1978 we were
past the the Timothy Leary era

74
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,220
and the all the were past the
60s. Things had calmed down

75
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,920
some, and my government had made
psychedelics illegal. And so I

76
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,820
had a hard choice to make, and
the choice I made was to

77
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,860
conscientiously and respectfully
use these substances in a

78
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,600
systematic, 20 year long
inquiry, which I kept separate

79
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,220
and out of my professional life
as much as possible. I'm an

80
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,780
academic, so I'm a university
professor here in Ohio, but in

81
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,980
my background life, I began this
regimen of systematically

82
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,480
exploring the deeper reaches of
consciousness, and that

83
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,320
influence, I brought that into
my academic work in a very

84
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,900
modest way, but it's really been
only now that I've retired that

85
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:16,500
I'm trying to give a systematic
accounting of the full nature of

86
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,660
that journey that I went on

87
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,280
Susan: that is fabulous,
absolutely fabulous. And it's so

88
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,020
needed right now. And I think
the time is actually ripe for

89
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,660
this. And as we were discussing
before we started the symposium,

90
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,220
it seems that Ayahuasca is the
path that is most available to

91
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,600
people, at least in North
America, and but I think people

92
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,820
will find their own way to
whatever they need, whatever

93
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,840
they can, to open up these
avenues. I think we're we're

94
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
starving for it.

95
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,040
Chris Bache: Yes, yes, yeah.

96
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,559
Susan: And so I appreciate very
much what you're saying. And

97
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:07,739
sibell, you had the next
question you were going to ask,

98
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,459
yeah.

99
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,959
Cybele: So, Chris, for a
beginner, what actually happens

100
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,279
in a psychedelic session, and
what's the difference between

101
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,139
using psychedelics
recreationally or using them

102
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,059
therapeutically or spiritually?

103
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,060
Chris Bache: Yeah. Well, there
are many different psychedelics,

104
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,540
of course, and so if we were to
take this conversation down to a

105
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,140
more precise level, would have
to discuss specific psychedelics

106
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,140
and how they interact with
consciousness, but generally the

107
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,420
category of drugs that we call
psychedelics are are

108
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,100
consciousness amplifiers. They
are amplifiers and catalysts of

109
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,820
consciousness, so that what they
do is hypersensitize

110
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,420
consciousness with a particular
perhaps a tilt one way or the

111
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,580
other. But they hypersensitize
consciousness so that what

112
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,700
happens in a session is actually
not simply a function of the

113
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,880
psychedelic but it's a the
function of consciousness

114
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,960
itself. So consciousness becomes
hyper energized,

115
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,780
hypersensitized, in a very short
period of time, and then there

116
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,700
is a confrontation the deeper
contents of the what is

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
previously we would call, you
know, the unconscious. Of the

118
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,300
contents of the unconscious
begin to surface into one's

119
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,260
awareness, and one literally
becomes aware of dimensions of

120
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,620
one's mind that one previously
had not been aware of. If you

121
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,940
take psychedelics
recreationally, you basically,

122
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,640
most people would be trying to
stay in contact with the

123
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,340
physical world and stay in con
in the identity of their ego.

124
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,880
And then they're entertaining
the ego by having some type of

125
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,800
hallucinatory experience where
there is. Blending between the

126
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,060
what's arising from the
unconscious and one's physical

127
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,100
environment. And there is a
tendency to sort of often focus

128
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:19,140
on esthetic aspects, visual
aspects, hallucinatory aspects,

129
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,360
engaging in sensory awareness
through music or sight or sound

130
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,960
and or if there is a kind of
therapeutic aspect, it's

131
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,520
engaging the surface of
consciousness, the psychodynamic

132
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:42,700
level one's personal history, a
second modality of working well

133
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,600
is working therapeutically and
working spiritually, what I

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,760
would call much more serious
work, where you try to harness

135
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,900
all that energy of that
hypersensitivity, so you isolate

136
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,200
yourself from the physical
world. People will work at

137
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,660
night, they'll work you
basically create a psychological

138
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,300
space of the Kivas of the
southwestern Native Americans,

139
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,740
where you isolate yourself from
the world. You're wearing

140
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,720
headphones, you're wearing eye
shades, you're listening to very

141
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,040
carefully scripted music. You
have a sitter where you're

142
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,780
basically create conditions
where you provide maximal

143
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,320
confrontation with the content
of your consciousness that opens

144
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,440
up depths which very seldom
surface in just recreational

145
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,660
tripping, and I have very little
experience with recreational

146
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,660
tripping. All of my work has
been in this therapeutic

147
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,660
modality, in this shamanic
modality of working with

148
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,360
psychedelics, and so when the
content of one's consciousness

149
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:05,580
begins to surface, i Yes, one
literally usually what happens

150
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,800
in the early stages is stresses
and strains that we have kept at

151
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,480
arm's length are existential
questions or doubts and

152
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,660
uncertainties that we usually
try to stay away from.

153
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,520
Paramount, for example, would be
the fear of death and

154
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,680
extinction. These, these begin
to surface and come at you and

155
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,760
how you meet them, if, if you
meet them in an embracing way,

156
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,760
one goes through a certain
encounter, a certain engagement,

157
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,480
where you confront your deepest
fears. You engage the most

158
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,940
profound questions that human
beings ask themselves, and you

159
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,460
let the universe take you where
where it wants to take you. And

160
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,300
there are a series of crises
that emerge of varying depths

161
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,420
and the varying types, and
usually, usually there is a

162
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:12,540
crisis that ferments and
develops into a critical crisis,

163
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:19,140
a critical kind of point of
impasse. And if you surrender to

164
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,420
this impasse, if you surrender
to whatever it is that wherever

165
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,900
your session is taking you,
wherever consciousness is taking

166
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,000
you, you will go through a type
of death and rebirth process.

167
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,140
You'll go through a complete
surrender where some part of

168
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,480
your life, or some part of life
as you have known it will fall

169
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,560
away, will just combust. You'll
die. Some part of you will die,

170
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,040
and then you find yourself
waking up in a completely

171
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,000
different reality, a larger
reality, a new reality, a

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,580
reality that you had never
expected previously, and a

173
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,340
reality where the universe
operates by different laws, and

174
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,140
you're you are a different kind
of being than you were in your

175
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:19,500
previous reality, and that can
be an exciting and A terrifying

176
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,160
process all at the same time,
yeah.

177
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,940
Cybele: So kind of what I'm
hearing, though, is that, like

178
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,820
someone will take an anti
depressant, and there's some

179
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,200
brain chemistry going on with
this, this medication. And even,

180
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,720
you know, with with
psychedelics, there's some brain

181
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,900
chemistry that's going on, but
you're really talking about

182
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,520
consciously taking this and and
moving it forward in a certain

183
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,820
direction rather than just
having brain chemistry, is that,

184
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,000
yes,

185
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,460
Chris Bache: I'm not addressing
the physiology of psychedelics

186
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,040
at all, the brain chemistry of
psychedelics. I'm not really

187
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,420
competent to discuss that. I'm
really addressing. Just the

188
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,520
psychoactive properties of these
substances. My understanding is

189
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,180
basically we don't yet know how
psychedelics work. I mean,

190
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,060
really, we don't, we don't
understand, we understand some

191
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,940
of the biochemistry of it, but
we don't really understand

192
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,020
completely how they work. But
we've been using them for 1000s

193
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,700
of years as a human species, and
we have a great deal of

194
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,120
experience working with them, so
we do understand a lot about how

195
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,400
they work psychologically and
spiritually.

196
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,620
Cybele: Yeah, yeah. Well, thank
you.

197
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,740
Susan: Well, this is Susan,
again, Chris, when psychedelics

198
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,200
are not used to entertain the
ego, sort of a spiritual

199
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,900
materialism, but instead the
intent is this spiritual process

200
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:56,500
that with an intention of a
personal ego, death. What

201
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:04,800
happens is, is it this
existential death is that a

202
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,920
guaranteed before you can, you
can move past that, that you it

203
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,980
is about facing one's deepest
existential fears. And that's

204
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,920
kind of the ring pass, not that
you have to go through.

205
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,640
Chris Bache: I think that's
inevitable. I want to, if I get

206
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,360
lost in this, in my answer,
bring me back to the question of

207
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,080
dose in low dose versus high
dose. But I think it's

208
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,540
inevitable that one comes to
these thresholds of impasse,

209
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:46,360
because we have to reverse
image, reverse imagine

210
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,840
everything we know about
consciousness. We tend to think

211
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,620
of our consciousness as small,
and by doing this, we are

212
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,880
opening our consciousness to
something larger. But actually,

213
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,800
I think it would be better to
start with what emerges in the

214
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,640
work itself is that an
understanding that consciousness

215
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,500
is our consciousness is actually
infinite, absolutely so it

216
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,800
starts and somehow, in taking
birth, In incarnating we have

217
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,880
voluntarily accepted a
contraction of consciousness,

218
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,080
and we stayed within that
contraction so that we begin to

219
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,540
think that that's what our
consciousness is, that our

220
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,980
consciousness is kind of person
sized, but a consciousness is is

221
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,020
really as large as the universe
itself. So if one, if one,

222
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,780
starts to open to the natural
dimensions of your own mind, you

223
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,120
have to free yourself from that
contraction. So the the easier

224
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,740
it is for you to surrender the
identity that you have developed

225
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,160
over all your lifetime, the
easier it is to open to these

226
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,800
deeper currents of mind. If it
the harder it is, the more

227
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,120
challenging it is so but that
there will always be a crisis

228
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,920
that challenges you to let go of
everything you think you are,

229
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,140
everything you have known as
real, your whole vision of

230
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,360
yourself and reality that seems
inevitable If you if you're

231
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,120
going to push the limits deeply
to basically remember what

232
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,800
you've forgotten. Now, you can
do this in two different

233
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,580
modalities. You can do it in low
dose work, where you basically

234
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,680
energize the psyche just a
little bit and you peel back the

235
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,460
layers of these contracted
identities in small increments,

236
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,120
or you can work with high doses,
where you basically consume

237
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,260
those contractions. You break
through those contractions in in

238
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,920
leaps and bounds, in a way where
you force a larger confrontation

239
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,900
and explode through those shells
and run more quickly and more

240
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,560
into the deeper nature of mind.

241
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,080
Susan: Now, you mentioned shells
plural, yeah, lots. That implies

242
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:24,200
that yes, that there's more than
one. Yeah. That suggests cycles

243
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,600
of death and rebirth and
initiation, and does that happen

244
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,060
through the course of this long
period?

245
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,420
Unknown: Well, I can't

246
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,040
Susan: imagine that you would
want to that it even we would be

247
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,120
capable of doing that in a short
period of time.

248
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,279
Chris Bache: Yeah, the universe
is so big. She's so beautiful,

249
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:58,419
and there's so many layers of
depth to her. She's so

250
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:03,039
magnificent. And. That it takes
years, I think, and even

251
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,119
lifetimes, more than one
lifetime, to explore the farther

252
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,479
reaches of her. Let me give just
put myself back in my own

253
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:18,819
history so I don't make false
claims. I mean, I made a choice

254
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:22,999
early on in my work, after a
half dozen or so sessions to

255
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:29,419
work exclusively in a high dose
regimen. So that really has

256
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:33,319
shaped the trajectory of my
work. I've always worked with

257
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:38,779
very high doses of LSD, kind of
causing maximum combustion,

258
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:44,619
maximum explosion and maximum
absorption into the universe

259
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:48,459
itself, it would have been, I
don't recommend that, if looking

260
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:52,539
back on it, what I If I knew
then what I know now, I think I

261
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,919
would have taken a gentler
approach. But at the time, it

262
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:03,059
seemed like you know the most
reasonable way to go into this,

263
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:10,799
this adventure of learning, but
the fool's journey, the fool's

264
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,839
journey, yeah, and I what you're
absolutely right you go through.

265
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:21,799
What I found is that there are
many layers of death and rebirth

266
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,099
that you go through in the
beginning. Death and Rebirth is

267
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,439
often related to your personal
identity, your personal history.

268
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,959
You're confronting the
limitations of that personal

269
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:38,179
history. And then Stan, as Stan
Grof describes it, you go into

270
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:41,979
what he calls the perinatal
level of consciousness, which is

271
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:45,879
the interface between physical
reality and spiritual reality,

272
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:51,579
where the overarching themes
tend to be biological birth and

273
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:56,259
physical death, overlaid with
all sorts of existential

274
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,659
Death-Rebirth, the meaning of
life, Whether life has any

275
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,419
meaning, whether it's
significant, whether we have any

276
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,079
significance in the larger order
of things. And one often

277
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,459
experiences this existential
crisis in the context of

278
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:16,619
actually reliving your
biological birth. And one also

279
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:20,659
can be reliving deaths that you
have experienced from previous

280
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:25,459
lifetimes. It's a very complex
amalgam. And the reason is

281
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:28,579
because death and birth is a
revolving door. It's how we get

282
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:33,199
back and forth between the world
of spirit. So if you are going

283
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:36,019
back through the world of
Spirit, through the door into

284
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:38,719
the world of spirit, it's not
surprising that we would

285
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:44,439
activate memories of how we came
back from the world, the spirit

286
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:49,599
into matter that is through the
womb. So people relive their

287
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:55,839
their births. And birth is a is
a very often painful and

288
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,619
challenging experience. I mean,
put yourself in the fetuses

289
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:06,119
position being forced out into
the world. And then when one

290
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,639
relives one's birth, one is kind
of born back into the states of

291
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:16,559
consciousness, that the state of
consciousness that you were in

292
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,559
before you were born. So you're
in spiritual reality. But it

293
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,099
doesn't stop there, because,
because that spiritual world is

294
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:31,159
so vast, if you want to explore,
it, has layers to it, and often

295
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,059
these layers are they've been
described. Ken Wilber uses the

296
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:39,679
categories of psychic levels,
subtle levels, causal levels.

297
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,879
And non dual are absolute
levels, different levels of

298
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:51,819
Transpersonal reality. If one is
going to allow yourself to be

299
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:55,479
solved, to be dissolved deeper
and deeper into the universe,

300
00:23:56,379 --> 00:24:01,439
one goes through layer after
layer after layer, and there is

301
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:07,439
a there's a tax, so to speak, as
one goes into those layers,

302
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:12,659
there is a deeper yielding, a
deeper letting go, a deeper kind

303
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:17,759
of confrontation that takes
place as One opens to deeper and

304
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:25,219
deeper dimensions of existence.
So death and rebirth in this

305
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:30,499
type of work is a cycle. It
repeats itself many times along

306
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:36,139
the way, and that simply is a
function of the the enormous

307
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,859
depth and breadth of the
universe and of the Divine

308
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,600
Susan: that is so so beautiful
and so rings true to my own

309
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,760
experience. Yeah, really,
really, really appreciate this.

310
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,860
Cybele: Yeah, Chris, I have a
follow up on this. Did you ever

311
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,280
reach a point of complete?
Complete? A. Am giving of

312
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,240
yourself or relaxation, allowing
into the experience of

313
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:12,720
dissolving into universe or into
source. Because on a recent

314
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,580
experience of mine, I
experienced the dissolving into

315
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,240
source and then rebuilding
myself and dissolving into

316
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,360
source. And, I mean, it was a
continual process of cycling

317
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:32,360
through, but there was, I didn't
have any tax or any any losing

318
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,020
of parts of myself, other than
losing myself completely.

319
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,160
Chris Bache: I I think many
people who do spiritual

320
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,840
practice, whether it's with
psychedelics or meditation or

321
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,980
long term retreat, you know
their psychedelics is nothing

322
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,280
that happens in psychedelic
sessions of this sort are unique

323
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,700
in the larger spiritual
landscape of spiritual practice.

324
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,740
There are many methodologies
that open us up to these very

325
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,240
deep dimensions of life. So
people have, and one of the most

326
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,920
common experiences that people
have who use these practices at

327
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:17,280
one at one time or another, is
return to source. You know, it's

328
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,600
just the most natural thing in
the world as it is, a waking up

329
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,080
to who we always have been. We
don't become source. We just

330
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,220
return to source. We waken up,
we dissolve into it, we relax

331
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:35,240
into it. And when, and as you
say, we kind of, you can move

332
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,200
back and forth, kind of, into
the source mode, and then back

333
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,940
into the individualized, the
catalyzed individual, and then

334
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:50,440
back into source mode, back and
forth, and yeah, those those

335
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:59,200
hours spent opening up to that
part of consciousness that you

336
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,060
have always been. You were
before you were born, you are

337
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,320
while you were born, after you
were born, that you always will

338
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,660
be the the Absolute Source and
ground of all existence, that

339
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,040
which is alive in you, and that
which is the aliveness in all

340
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:23,240
other life forms that is
considered one of the one of the

341
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,640
great healing and awakening
experience that humankind can

342
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,240
have to awaken to what you truly
are. So our individual identity,

343
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,540
whatever it is, whoever we have
developed over hundreds, 1000s

344
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,520
of incarnations, that individual
identity and the truth of our

345
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,880
individuality plays itself out
against a backdrop of the other

346
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,660
identity, the identity of
totality, the identity of

347
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:00,220
source, the identity of the
Divine, if we use theological

348
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,480
language, my there is a sense in
much of the literature, the

349
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,160
Vedic literature, and different
spiritual systems, to think that

350
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,640
it's all about return to source,
that the Ultimately, the goal of

351
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,600
spiritual practice is simply to
return to source. And if you

352
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,360
dissolve completely into source,
that is, that is the end of the

353
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,760
line. There is a there is an end
point, and that is the end point

354
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,600
to return to source. And I don't
agree with that entirely for two

355
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:44,320
reasons. One of them is that
it's been my experience that if

356
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,360
you do return to source, and if
you return to source frequently

357
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:58,000
and in a systematic fashion,
that oneness, oneness itself,

358
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,160
has many layers to it, and
oneness cracks open, to revolt,

359
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,780
to reveal many different
modalities and layers of depth,

360
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:12,360
even into oneness. So that
rather than think that oneness

361
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,380
is once, you arrive at oneness,
that is the end of the journey,

362
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,100
I think what the universe shows
us is they're actually infinite

363
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:28,460
depths of the one, infinite ways
in which the oneness lives in

364
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,300
the universe, or it lives as the
universe. So that I personally

365
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,800
have given up the goal of ever
reaching the end of the journey.

366
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:47,860
I think that the Divine is far
too vast and far too extended a

367
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,020
reality to reach an end point of
the inquiry. It just, it just

368
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,940
keeps, has kept opening and
opening to me. But the other

369
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,500
reason I have reservation.
Questions about the goal of the

370
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,180
journey is simply to open up to
source is, is a larger cosmic

371
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,280
logical question. I think we
come from source. We come from

372
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,300
the one, and the one has birthed
the universe, the domain of

373
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:21,140
differentiation, and we exist
here as individual beings. But

374
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,620
if the goal were simply to
return to one that ultimately

375
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,280
leads to the metaphysical
visions that have dominated our

376
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,340
our cultures in the last 5000
years, which are up out

377
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:36,200
cosmiclogies, you achieve
awakening and you leave. You

378
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,780
achieve spiritual consciousness,
or you return to source, you

379
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:48,940
awaken into nirvana or Moksha
and you leave because if you can

380
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:54,580
be in heaven, why would you want
to be on earth? Because the

381
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,420
spiritual world is infinitely
more satisfying than we can be

382
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,180
on Earth. And so all the
cosmology is of Hinduism and

383
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,000
Buddhism and Christianity and
all the world religions have

384
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,360
basically been up and out.
Cosmology. The goal, one way or

385
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,500
another, even for a Bodhisattva,
is to empty the world so that we

386
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,040
can all become enlightened and
return to spirit. But that, I

387
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,100
think, is an incomplete
cosmology, I think a deeper

388
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,060
cosmic, logical vision is
emerging more recently, now that

389
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,560
we truly are absorbing the scale
and scope of evolution, and that

390
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,400
is the goal is not simply to
awaken to source, but to bring

391
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,960
source into and empower the
evolutionary project to actually

392
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,800
embody, to incarnate the divine
ever more fully in history, so

393
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,160
that we'll be doing this for
billions and billions and

394
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,600
billions years more. So
awakening to source is, to me,

395
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,560
midpoint. It is the turning
point, and then this next point

396
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,620
is to continue and deepen
consciously the evolutionary

397
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,280
project,

398
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,700
Cybele: so bringing heaven to
earth, rather than bringing

399
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,180
Heaven

400
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:14,099
Chris Bache: Heaven to Earth,
yeah, bringing heaven to earth

401
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:21,739
and basically Creating a greater
porosity, so that there are

402
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:27,439
fewer membranes between heaven
and earth, so that one can live

403
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,539
more consciously the by
citizenship that we all have. We

404
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:37,159
are physical beings, but we are
spiritual beings. And I think

405
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,439
the evolutionary trajectory is
towards ever greater inner

406
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:45,279
penetration, which is actually
changing and redefining what we

407
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:49,959
think of as our natural
capacities, what we have, the

408
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:53,739
capacities that we think of as
human capacities, and are being

409
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:58,419
dictated and limited by our
biology, by our Physics, of our

410
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:04,259
bodies, I think are actually
simply evolutionary staging

411
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:10,139
areas. They're just evolutionary
midpoints that are our senses

412
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:14,039
are evolving as consciousness
evolves, and just as we are

413
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:18,899
becoming more soulful over
multiple incarnations, literally

414
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:24,259
are the way in which we see and
hear and think and feel the

415
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:28,459
depth of it, the entire project
of being human, I think, is

416
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:32,179
expanding and will continue to
expand, so that literally, in

417
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:36,079
the future, we will see
differently, we will hear

418
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:36,859
differently.

419
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,300
Cybele: Thank you. It's
definitely something to work on

420
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,640
achieving, I think chipper has
the next question,

421
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:48,519
Chipper: Chris, that sounds a
whole lot like what I think of

422
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:55,239
as field work in that that inner
penetration, that conscious

423
00:33:55,239 --> 00:34:04,439
inner penetration, of awareness,
of of shared awareness of this

424
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:10,619
individuality that returns to
source over and over again, each

425
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:20,899
of us brings in the Divine as
we're capable is a is happening

426
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:28,999
quite rapidly. Over the last two
years, I've talked to people

427
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:34,099
that have become way more
sensitive to what they ingest,

428
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:40,899
what they associate with, what
they take care of themselves

429
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:49,479
with, and I have that
sensitivity I've felt personally

430
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,239
as a as an expanding capacity
for for field work, I guess.

431
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:03,000
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah. Uh.
Yeah, you know, scientists are

432
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,760
now telling us that everything
that we had thought of

433
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,280
previously as particles,
particles are really feels, if

434
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,700
you get down into the deep
quantum level of reality, that

435
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,740
particles are really feels we
are. We are, fields are primary,

436
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,980
particles are secondary. And I
think that's true of us as of

437
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,720
human beings too, that we are
all interconnected in these vast

438
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,040
fields. And we are
interconnected to our own

439
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,760
history, our reincarnational
history, through the fields of

440
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,040
consciousness. And we are
connected to each other through

441
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,360
the fields, the Morphic fields
of the human of the human

442
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,280
psyche, and these fields, I
think, are becoming more

443
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,600
energized in history, that it's
almost like nature has turned up

444
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,760
the fire and it's bringing the
human psyche to a boil. I think

445
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,340
that the collective unconscious,
Jung's collective unconscious of

446
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,160
the or the mind of the species,
is actually becoming more and

447
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,380
more energized for a variety of
reasons, so that, and we all

448
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,700
feel it. I mean, we can feel
this kind of urgency, kind of a

449
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,560
crescendo that's coming up
underneath us. And I think

450
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,800
there's a, you know, the first
book I wrote was on

451
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,980
reincarnation. And for me,
reincarnation is just one of the

452
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,340
simple facts of life, I mean.
And I think we're coming to see

453
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,340
that, that the empirical
evidence for reincarnation is

454
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,500
incredibly strong, stronger than
it's ever been historically. And

455
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,260
I think there is a, I think that
the evolutionary sequence, which

456
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,780
is underwritten by
reincarnation, this is

457
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,800
progressive, becoming more
conscious, more aware, more

458
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,960
empowered, learning from our
mistakes, exercising new

459
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,360
capacities. There is something
happening now on the planet,

460
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,280
there's an interrelationship
between the global crisis that

461
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,460
we have entered and a deep
individual soul fermentation

462
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,020
that we have entered. I think
the way I language this is that

463
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,180
I think the planetary crisis is
driving us past our limitations

464
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,780
of the past, driving us to a
global citizenship, driving us

465
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,440
to a consciousness of oneness on
the planet that's forcing us to

466
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,160
outgrow the divisions of our
history, of our of our egoic

467
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,780
consciousness, what they are
anyway, for sure, yeah, seeing

468
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,800
for what they are. I mean,
they're they're real, but they

469
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,000
aren't the they aren't the whole
story. And I think that there's

470
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,600
a parallel process taking place
at the very depths of the

471
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:55,420
psyche, that there is a
psychologically at a soul level,

472
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,100
all of our previous lives are
coming together into critical

473
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:06,120
fusion. So that s above, so
below, s without, so within. So

474
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,200
that as the world enters deeper,
more and more deeply into this

475
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,240
crisis, there is an inner
gestation which is taking place.

476
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,160
So I think that where this is
taking us is that we are

477
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,520
literally giving birth to the
soul in history. And by the

478
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,940
soul, I mean the consciousness
that integrates all of our

479
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,500
previous lives into a singular
consciousness. Usually we only

480
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,400
make contact with the soul when
we're dead, when we enter the

481
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,560
Bardo. We retain, we recover,
our full memory. And we usually

482
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,880
give that memory up when we are
incarnate. We shrink our memory.

483
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,880
But if we keep that process
shrinking and expanding,

484
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,660
shrinking and expanding, sooner
or later, I think inevitably,

485
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,800
the process is not just towards
more sophisticated individual

486
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,680
egos, but to the birth of soul
consciousness on the planet

487
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,460
intact, so that our
consciousness never is tempted

488
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,200
to shrink to the limits of just
this body, just this individual

489
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,660
of physical embodiment, right? I
think we're giving birth to

490
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,960
soul. And so many people are
feeling this. They're feeling

491
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,000
this kind of deep awakening in
their in their body, in their

492
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,440
psyche. And I think there's a
relationship between the crisis

493
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,660
that we're all facing on the
planet, so that the global to in

494
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,160
a nutshell, the global crisis is
actually the womb which is

495
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,460
engendering what I call the
birth of the diamond soul in

496
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,080
history. And the diamond soul is
simply my way of language. And

497
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,540
what many people are intuiting
that consciousness of a higher

498
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,920
order, a more complete order, is
manifesting in time.

499
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,180
Chipper: And by order, I'm, I'm
going to assume that you're,

500
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,680
you're talking structure.

501
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,600
Chris Bache: Structurally
conscious of itself, yes, yeah,

502
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,980
the deep identity, the soul
identity, is emerging underneath

503
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:16,200
the egoic identity, and it is
absorbing and bringing to

504
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:23,060
fruition egoic identity. I
think, I really think, like many

505
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,780
other people, I think we are at
a cusp. We literally cannot

506
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,920
afford to stay at the egoic
level of conscious evolution,

507
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,360
because ego is a divided
consciousness which leads to a

508
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,420
divided world, which leads to a
competitive world, and a world

509
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,320
of rampant consumption and
violence,

510
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:46,599
Chipper: right, in order to
aggrandize that ego. Yeah.

511
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,939
Chris Bache: I mean, a divided
consciousness leads to a divided

512
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:54,579
world and an awake
consciousness, an integrated

513
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:57,399
consciousness, a soul embedded
consciousness, which is

514
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:02,039
conscious of the breath of our
existence, conscious of the

515
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:06,959
breath of of mind, leads to a
compassionate world, leads to a

516
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:14,099
world which is first healed and
then carried forward into, I

517
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,279
think, into in the creation of
new cultural forms. I think we

518
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:20,179
are just, we are really on the
cusp of creating an entirely new

519
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:25,579
cultural form, as many of your
your your participants in

520
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:28,819
previous conversations have
pointed to, right?

521
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,920
Chipper: It does seem to be a
widespread topic of conversation

522
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,520
these days.

523
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,720
Susan: Yeah, Chris, for years,
I've been feeling like we've

524
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:48,700
been approaching a collective
initiation process. Yeah, and we

525
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,860
may have to do it individually
to kind of get the ball rolling,

526
00:41:53,860 --> 00:42:00,100
so to speak. But also that as
individuals do it. It's done for

527
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:07,800
the collective yes and but also,
is the collective doing it to

528
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,320
individuals? Yes?

529
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,480
Chris Bache: I think, yeah, the
relationship of individual

530
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,020
consciousness and collective
consciousness, particularly in

531
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,400
this evolutionary pivot that we
are making is really the

532
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,720
dominant theme of my second
book, dark night, early dawn,

533
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,860
where, here I'm talking about
the dark night of the soul and

534
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,840
the dawn of the rebirth
consciousness. But here the

535
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,680
emphasis is not on the rebirth
of the individual or the dark

536
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,160
night of the individual soul,
but the dark night of our

537
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,840
collective soul. Let me just
back up and just give you my

538
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,240
particular perspective here,
when I I reached a certain point

539
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,400
in the early stages of my own
psychedelic work where I had

540
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,520
already gone through a series of
death and rebirth experiences at

541
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,260
the individual level. Had had my
ego shattered in the different

542
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,160
ways that it shattered in this
type of work. And then what

543
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,260
happened is that I entered into
what I would describe as the

544
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:24,800
ocean of suffering I began to
have just for years sessions

545
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,880
where the suffering that I was
confronting was not personal,

546
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,900
the suffering was collective,
just vast tracks of human

547
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,280
suffering of all sorts of
different orders of magnitude,

548
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,820
just shattering levels and And
first I was I asked myself, What

549
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,840
are all these people doing in my
therapy? You know, what's

550
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,840
humanity doing showing up in
work which I had previously

551
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,860
thought of in terms of
individual transformation? And

552
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,380
what I came what I came to
understand over time is that I

553
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,180
may have thought that I was
doing a process of individual

554
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,420
transformation to maybe
contribute something to the

555
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,080
collective good. But the
universe doesn't think in those

556
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,580
terms. That that the universe,
the game that the universe is

557
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,580
involved with on our planet
right now, is nothing less than

558
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,140
the transformation of humanity
as a whole. That's the game.

559
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,080
That's where we have to go.
That's what's happening. So the

560
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:30,620
collective psyche is boiling and
is bringing its history forward,

561
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,680
outpouring in all sorts of
historical and social movements

562
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,340
as all the sins and toxicities
of our past are coming forward

563
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,680
naturally, we feel this at an
individual as well as collective

564
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:49,000
level. And if you do deep
spiritual work, it's people find

565
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,340
in hypnotherapy and in yoga work
and deep meditation practice, or

566
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:01,440
in psychedelic work, shamanic
work, that they begin to you. To

567
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,020
open up into these vast tracks
of human suffering, which, in my

568
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,800
experience, went on for about
three and a half, four years,

569
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,620
and I began to understand that
the patient in these sessions

570
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,340
was not me. The patient was some
some aspect of the Morphic field

571
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,260
of the human species, so that
it's the collective psyche which

572
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,960
is trying to heal itself and
taking advantage of the

573
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,260
opportunity that I had provided
to heal itself. And I think

574
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,460
that's happening in all of our
lives, that we are all with one

575
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,560
foot in a personal world and one
foot in a collective world, and

576
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,480
so we're all channeling a hen a
healing energy, which is pulling

577
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,500
poisons out of the collective
psyche and putting healing

578
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,900
energy into the collective
psyche.

579
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,340
Susan: Well, this actually
answers a long time question of

580
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:03,360
mine, because I've had two near
death experiences, and I trained

581
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,100
as an existential and
Transpersonal therapist, and

582
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:14,520
then practiced at it as one for
years, but I was in that field

583
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:21,860
of experiencing things that had
nothing to do with me, but, and

584
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:28,340
I was very aware it wasn't mine.
It was not only the ancestors,

585
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,840
not just personal, but the
collective. And, you know, I

586
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:39,440
take it back and back and back,
but when you said the universe

587
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,320
may or source, makes use of
those opportunities that makes

588
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,060
sense to me. So if an
individual, through whatever

589
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:54,220
means, as you mentioned, makes
themselves open or available,

590
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,320
that source is going to use that
opportunity that is really,

591
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,920
really helpful and insightful.

592
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,680
Chris Bache: Wow, that that,
since we're all and I think we

593
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,400
all chose this, we got knew what
we were getting into before we

594
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,100
were born, we chose to enter
into this time in history, even

595
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,920
though we may have forgotten
that choice temporarily while

596
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,680
we're here there. There are no
victims here, and there are no

597
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,280
innocents, in a way we all
knowingly embrace this time in

598
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,260
history in order to be a co
participant in this evolutionary

599
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,160
journey that we are on. And
clearly, the fire is heating up,

600
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,900
and it's bringing out these
collective threads where I think

601
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,400
they probably maybe weren't as
pronounced 1000 years ago, but

602
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:51,640
they're very pronounced now. Now
my students have, they have

603
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,600
people who are not doing, even
doing this sort of deep,

604
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:02,100
introspective work. I've had so
many students recognize that

605
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,540
there is more going on in their
pain and suffering and their

606
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,660
healing of their pain and
suffering than could possibly be

607
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,040
explained in terms of simply
their own personal life. And I

608
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:19,920
was talking years ago to Roger
Wilber, who's you know is passed

609
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,720
on now, one of the great past
lives therapists, and he said he

610
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,460
had come to the same conclusion
that he was working with clients

611
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,080
who were just uncovering so many
lives, lifetime after lifetime

612
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,160
of pain and suffering. He began
to realize that there was that

613
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,660
somehow, in doing past lives
therapy, they had become a

614
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,560
midwife to a healing that was
reaching beyond the soul

615
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,160
history, as you said, reaching
into the ancestors, reaching

616
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,020
into the collective so that
their work may have begun as an

617
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:59,980
individual soul healing, but it
actually had had changed into a

618
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,780
much larger collective healing
exercise,

619
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,240
Susan: absolutely, absolutely
and like you said, it's speeding

620
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,760
up so much now and it's quite
overwhelming at times for some

621
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,100
people. Hopefully there's enough
information going out and like

622
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:26,540
our program here that give
people some sort of structure

623
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:31,700
that they might be able to make
some sense of things, or if they

624
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:37,400
don't know about it, they feel
that somebody else can resonate

625
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,380
with what they're going through.
Because I imagine if people do

626
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,620
experience it and don't know
what they're going through, that

627
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,900
quite dangerous. It would be
awful. Yeah, yeah.

628
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,560
Chris Bache: And there are times
when, when you want you may need

629
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,760
to step back from the intensity
of this work and and there are

630
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,172
other times, would, yeah, you
just. There are other times when

631
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:03,992
your life allows you to step
more deeply into it,

632
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:10,052
Susan: and then sometimes and
just take a break and time to

633
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:15,932
integrate it all and be you with
it and even see how your life,

634
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:19,832
whole life, changes as a result
of it, because it will be

635
00:50:19,832 --> 00:50:25,400
drastically changed. Yes, no
doubt about it. Yeah. Chris,

636
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,560
could you tell us the names of
your books and maybe just a

637
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,420
brief synopsis about them?

638
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,760
Chris Bache: The books are the
first one is called life cycles,

639
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,900
reincarnation in the web of
life. It's basically a book on

640
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,060
reincarnation. It looks at
reincarnation through the issue

641
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,180
of the empirical evidence. It
looks at it as a psychological

642
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,320
and spiritual phenomenon, and
then it once it documents the

643
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,200
empirical evidence for
reincarnation. It then asks the

644
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,300
question, so what? What's the
difference if we see ourselves

645
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,440
as reincarnating beings versus
one time through beings? So it's

646
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,240
just one of the early attempts
to explore this, the universe as

647
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,220
a pulsing, throbbing,
reincarnating universe. The

648
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:21,680
second one is dark, night,
early, Dawn, which is a book in

649
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,340
the philosophical study of
Non-ordinary states of

650
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,940
consciousness, specifically
psychedelic states of

651
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,740
consciousness, but integrating
Psychedelic Studies with near

652
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,360
death episode research and out
of body research, trying asking

653
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,040
the question is, the question is
The universe as it shows itself

654
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,340
in near death episode research,
in out of body research,

655
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,580
particularly Robert Monroe's
work at the Monroe Institute,

656
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:54,280
and psychedelic research. Are
those pictures cohering, or are

657
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,480
they fragmenting? And so
exploring that and exploring the

658
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,720
ways in which our the collective
psyche shows up in the work of

659
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,980
individuals, and the way the
individuals work influences and

660
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,580
contributes to our collective
evolution. That integrated part.

661
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,840
And the third book is called the
living classroom. And all of

662
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,720
these are you can get them on
Amazon or other book sites. The

663
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,540
living classroom tells the story
of it's about fields of

664
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,660
consciousness, collective
consciousness, the subtler

665
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,740
background textures of
consciousness as they surface in

666
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:38,180
the classroom. Because what I
found over time was, while I I

667
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:43,600
kept my personal life, my quote,
personal spiritual practice out

668
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,780
of the classroom, because it's
not appropriate to bring it into

669
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,680
the classroom. That was my
weekend work. What I found was

670
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,920
that the work I was doing in
these very deep states of

671
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,240
consciousness outside of the
classroom began to impact my

672
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,200
students in the classroom, and I
began to understand and had to

673
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,360
think about and theorize about
the collective the nature of

674
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,740
collective consciousness, not at
the species level, but actually

675
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,280
at a very intimate level of the
students that I was working

676
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,080
with, week in, week out, year
after year. So it's about

677
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,740
teaching and collective
consciousness. So those are the

678
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,600
three. And now I'm going back to
the topic of psychedelic work

679
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:35,420
and trying to give some type of
philosophical description or

680
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:41,380
exploration of that 20 year
psychedelic Odyssey that I went

681
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,840
on between 1979 and 1999

682
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,120
Unknown: this completes Part One
of two of Our conversation with

683
00:53:49,120 --> 00:55:40,120
Chris Bache. You you You You
You.

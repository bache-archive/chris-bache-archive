Chris Bache: One the last great
vision that the universe gave me

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,280
in one of my sessions. It took
me deep into deep time. It took

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,800
me deep into the future, and it
gave me my last experience of

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,880
the future human. It was as if
it took me into the future and

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,360
allowed me to try on for size,
the fundamental blueprint of the

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,440
human psyche at that point in
the future, this was the most

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,980
extraordinary being. Just I
can't describe to you quickly,

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,500
what an extra ordinary being
This being is. Just picture the

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,420
highest, finest qualities we've
imagined. Picture the highest

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,800
spiritual capacities we can
imagine a mind completely open

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,980
to the universe, a heart
completely open to each other,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,040
just extraordinarily magnificent
being. That's what's at stake

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,620
here. That's what we're trying
to become.

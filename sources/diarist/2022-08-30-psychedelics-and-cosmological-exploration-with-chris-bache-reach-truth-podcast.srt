1
00:00:00,704 --> 00:00:02,144
Tasshin Fogleman: Hi friend,
thanks for joining me. I

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:06,164
Chris Bache: was glad to be
here. Tassim, thank you for the

3
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:06,884
invitation.

4
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,944
Tasshin Fogleman: Yes, my
pleasure. I've been reading,

5
00:00:10,124 --> 00:00:14,204
I've read three out of four of
your books in the last and last

6
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:16,724
month or so, and just been
devouring them. So it's been a

7
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:19,304
real treat to read them, and
I've been very excited to have

8
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:26,480
this conversation. So just to
begin, yeah, so just to begin,

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,440
I'd love to hear you share your
background and really your life

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,780
story, anything that you'd like
to share about yourself,

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,820
biographically and your story.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,100
Chris Bache: Basically, I made
my living as a university

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,040
professor at a modest University
in Northeast Ohio. I'm a

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,420
professor of religious studies.
My background is I have a degree

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,200
in Notre Dame, in theology from
Notre Dame and New Testament

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,940
criticism in Cambridge, and a
PhD in Philosophy of Religion

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,920
from Brown and so very
classically educated, raised in

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,540
the Deep South, coming from
Mississippi, but when I finished

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,400
my graduate training and came to
Youngstown State University,

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,200
where I taught for 33 years, I
met the work of Stanislav Grof,

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,560
of course, one of the foremost
authorities in the psychedelic

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,960
integrating psychedelics into
psychotherapy, and his work was

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,200
a turning point in my life. So
at that point, I continued to do

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,040
my work, and I've just made my
living week in, week out, year

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,160
in, year out in the classroom,
doing the things that professors

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,040
do. But in my personal life and
my private life, I began a 20

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,840
year journey working with high
doses of LSD in a therapeutic

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,680
protocol pioneered by Stan and
other early researchers

29
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,920
exploring the deep structure,
not only of my own

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,280
consciousness, but of the
consciousness of the universe

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,780
itself. At least that's my
understanding of my best

32
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,220
interpretation of where I went.
So after holding that material

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,360
and sitting on it for 20 years,
I did this work for 20 years

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,200
between 1979 and 1999 and I sat
on it and crunched it and

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,840
digested it for another 20 years
before releasing LSD in the mind

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,040
of the universe, the story of
that journey. So basically, I'm

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,560
a university professor who's
part of the underground

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,880
psychedelic movement in this
country, beautiful.

39
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,100
Tasshin Fogleman: It's been an
incredible journey to learn

40
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,380
about and appreciate you sharing
it. I you know you allude to a

41
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,740
few in a few points to, kind of
who you were before you started

42
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,680
this journey, and your younger
self. And I forget exactly how

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,580
you put it, but, but sort of
like, you know, you might not

44
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,040
have expected me to go down this
journey, and I've, sort of, I

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,160
got the picture of you as, sort
of like, straight laced and sort

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,500
of like analytic. What were you
like at that time before you

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,480
started all this well,

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,280
Chris Bache: I began my life
seeking to be a Catholic priest.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,440
I was in the seminary in high
school from three years of high

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,300
school, and got a degree in
theology from Notre Dame. So I

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,140
began a very conventional and at
the same time, by the time I

52
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,100
finished graduate school,
because of all my education that

53
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,360
I had acquired, I became an
atheistically inclined agnostic.

54
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,780
Basically, the study of
philosophy of religion and

55
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,960
science had basically wiped my
theological slate clean, and I

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,620
became a pretty hard and fast
agnostic, and that's the way I

57
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,880
began this work, and it was the
LSD work that opened me up to a

58
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,180
broader understanding of
existence. Now, I've been a

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,380
meditator all my life, since
college, and I've practiced

60
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,180
within different Buddhist
traditions within the passina

61
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,540
tradition and Zen tradition, and
eventually settling into the

62
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,060
Vajrayana tradition. But that
all came after the psychedelic

63
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,780
work. Well, I started meditating
beforehand, but the evolution to

64
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,240
more specific Buddhist lineages
came after the psychedelic work

65
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,960
had begun. And I've raised, you
know, three kids, been married,

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,500
you know, mortgages, standard
kind of affair, you know. And

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,180
you know me, look at me. I mean,
I look like an accountant, kind

68
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,580
of I was designed to be an
undercover agent

69
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,960
Tasshin Fogleman: for
psychedelics. Wow, I love that

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,080
description. What? What was it
that so captured you about Grof

71
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,280
work when you encountered it?

72
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,520
Chris Bache: Well, I immediately
saw that if what he was saying

73
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,500
was correct, this had enormous
implications. For philosophy,

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,000
which was my interest, not just
for healing in clinical

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,920
psychology, but here was the
method that allowed us to get

76
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,840
deep, first hand access to
dimensions of consciousness. And

77
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,720
through those dimensions of
consciousness, dimensions of

78
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,860
reality that I had seen
described in many spiritual

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,800
bodies of literature, but here
was a protocol that allow people

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,240
to be initiated, if only on a
temporary basis, because this is

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,900
a path, what I call the path of
temporary immersion, and we have

82
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,820
to be really careful not to
confuse a path of temporary

83
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,660
immersion from what I would call
the bad the path of abiding

84
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,100
presence, more contemplative
meditational path, but it gave

85
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,020
us temporary access to states of
consciousness far beyond our

86
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,960
ordinary egoic awareness and far
beyond space Time awareness to

87
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,680
explore the deep structure of
the universe itself. This has

88
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,820
been a philosopher's dream, in a
way, and particularly in our

89
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,480
culture, which was is
materialist metaphysical

90
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,260
convictions, which has come to
believe that there is nothing in

91
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,840
the universe outside what can be
explained by its material

92
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,660
substrate, that matter is the
only thing that's real. Matter

93
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,080
is the only thing that exists.
And here was a method that was

94
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,860
challenging that assumption gave
us experiences that would be

95
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,340
might be very difficult to
explain in terms of that

96
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,440
materialist hypothesis. So
that's that immediately picked

97
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,920
up my philosopher's ears. I'm
not

98
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,240
Tasshin Fogleman: quite sure how
to ask this question, but when

99
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,020
you decided to go on this
journey, and, you know, were

100
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,400
inspired by Grof and wanted to
adapt his protocol for your own

101
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,040
use, what did what did that look
like, practically for you? What?

102
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,900
What, how did you embark on
that?

103
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:04,199
Chris Bache: Oh, I, I follow the
very strict protocol, and it's

104
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,919
one of the things I think that
made my work a little unusual

105
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,939
over the years. It came when you
work in a therapeutic protocol,

106
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,419
you are totally isolated from
the world. You don't take

107
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,959
psychedelics and go for a walk
in the woods, or go to a

108
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,199
Grateful Dead concert, or even
stay up talking with friends,

109
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,859
you're totally isolated from the
world. You're protected by a

110
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:31,639
sitter who manages all the
logistics of your day, handling

111
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,359
the music you're listening to,
carefully curated music with

112
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:39,859
headphones and eye shades you
basically like in a meditation

113
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:45,279
retreat. You turn your attention
totally within. And psychedelics

114
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,119
are an amplifier. They amplify
the condition of your

115
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:54,159
unconscious, and it causes
subtle levels of of your mind

116
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,999
which you might you have to
really reach to be able to have

117
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:01,199
access to them. It allows those
subtle dimensions of your mind

118
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,839
to come forward, and if you meet
them in a very conscientious,

119
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,459
focused manner, then a cleaning
process begins, a healing

120
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,419
process, a confrontational and
therapeutic engagement process

121
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,619
begins, but you're totally
isolated. So basically, it's an

122
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:23,179
entire weekend agenda. If I'm
working on Saturday, which I

123
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:26,119
usually do, I'd start in the
early morning. Would last all

124
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:30,919
day until after supper time.
You're spending days beforehand

125
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,859
that there's protocols that you
do beforehand, a lot of

126
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,419
preparation of your body, a lot
of preparation of your diet and

127
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,799
of your spiritual practice.
There's certain spiritual

128
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,779
practice I would do before a
session and spiritual practices

129
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:52,599
I would do after a session
eventually. So it's one very

130
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,959
intense day followed by several
days before and after

131
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:00,539
preparation. And you know, it's
a several day commitment each

132
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:06,119
session I did, I chose, after
several medium dose sessions, I

133
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:11,039
chose to work at very high
levels using psychedelic

134
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,939
therapy, not low dose
psychelytic therapy. This is a

135
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:18,899
protocol that I don't recommend
today. It's not that I'm against

136
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,619
occasional high doses of LSD,
but this consistent working just

137
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:30,739
exploding consciousness so
violently or so aggressively is

138
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:35,239
a protocol that I really don't
encourage today. But I worked at

139
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:41,739
500 to 600 micrograms for 73
sessions in 20 years, and on

140
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:46,419
average, it came out to about
five sessions a year. I worked

141
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,339
for four years. I took six year
hiatus, and then I worked in a

142
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,479
very aggressive 10 years. So it
worked out to about five

143
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,379
sessions a year.

144
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,479
Tasshin Fogleman: Can you
explain the difference between

145
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:01,199
psychedelic and psychedelic?
Psychic protocols?

146
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,520
Chris Bache: Yeah, a psyche
lytic protocol is a low dose

147
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,100
protocol where which stimulates
the unconscious more gently and

148
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,180
allows it sort of peels the
unconscious layer by layer and

149
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,680
so layers of your trauma or
anything you're holding which is

150
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,800
problematic or uncomfortable for
you surfaces in smaller

151
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,020
increments, layer by layer. If
you work with high doses of LSD

152
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,520
in the early years, these were
limited to three sessions. The

153
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,060
the work it's that Stan did at
Spring Grove Hospital in

154
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,520
Baltimore was working with
terminally ill cancer patients

155
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,640
who were dealing with death
anxiety, and what they were

156
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,080
trying to do was to precipitate
a something approximating a

157
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,860
Near-Death Experience, to give
these people who were dying a

158
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,400
bit of a glimpse, a foretaste of
where they were going when they

159
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:04,380
died. So it's a very powerful, a
much more evocative state.

160
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,680
Instead of processing all the
individual layers of the

161
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,820
personal psyche, it tends to
blow through those and drive

162
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,280
consciousness into a more
radical state of awareness. So

163
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,280
what I did was I thought, well,
if you could do this work safely

164
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,740
three times. You could do it
safely more than three times.

165
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,840
And I was still thinking in the
early years in a personal model.

166
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,800
I was thinking of cleaning my
own consciousness, but cleaning

167
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,780
it in bigger in bigger
exercises. It's kind of like

168
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,920
eating my karma in in fewer and
larger bites. It turns out that

169
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,980
model was completely incorrect,
as I learned by the second or

170
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,760
third year.

171
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,180
Tasshin Fogleman: Did you have a
sense when you're starting out

172
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,720
that this would be a long term
endeavor, that you'd be doing

173
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,700
these journeys many, many times?

174
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,440
Chris Bache: No, I didn't. When
I started it out, I had been

175
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,740
meditating, and I had
encountered the usual blocks

176
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,760
that everybody hits in the early
years of meditation, and I first

177
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,200
thought I would do some this
therapy in order to push through

178
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,420
and clear those blocks in order
to accelerate my personal

179
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,660
awakening. And it turns out that
that was a false model to bring

180
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,520
to it and but once the adventure
started, once I began to break

181
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:42,280
into these experiences of the
cosmos, then I was hooked. I did

182
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,720
not expect it to be taking up
such a large proportion of my

183
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,440
life. And what I found was, if
you go very deeply into this

184
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,260
work, you're you don't integrate
it around the edges of your

185
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,920
life, and continue to live your
life kind of like an ordinary

186
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,340
life, deep spiritual practice,
as you know all when you commit

187
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,360
to very deep spiritual practice,
it becomes your life. You wrap

188
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,900
your life around your spiritual
practice. And that happened for

189
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,180
me too. I mean, it just this
became a central focus of my

190
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,980
life. Of course, I my students
and my teaching were central

191
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,460
focus. My children and family
and marriage were central focus,

192
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,260
but my psychedelic work became
the core of my deeper

193
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,380
philosophical undertaking.

194
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,280
Tasshin Fogleman: And how did
those aspects of your life

195
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,060
relate to each other and
influence each other? Well?

196
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,640
Chris Bache: Basically, I feel
that my marriage and my teaching

197
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,140
were very grounding. First, I
love being a parent, I love

198
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,680
being a dad, and I love being
married, I love teaching. I just

199
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,900
love being in the classroom. And
I found that those commitments

200
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,980
just kept me grounded when I was
off exploring different

201
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,060
dimensions of reality on the
weekend, when I would come back,

202
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,080
you know, there were dishes to
wash and students to teach. It

203
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,440
was a very grounding way. So
they completely complimented

204
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,380
each other well. It just, you
know, because I mean, any deep

205
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,700
explore, I think, has this
experience, you're going in and

206
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,480
out, you're going back and forth
into these periods of deep

207
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,040
absorption, like a retreat. And
that's really why, I mean, I

208
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,200
never say that I've tripped. I
say I do a session, and it's

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,120
kind of like a Zen session, a
period set aside for intense

210
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,600
spiritual practice. A
psychedelic session is really a

211
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,260
psychedelic session. It's a
period set aside for intense

212
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,340
spiritual practice when you go
back and forth over and over

213
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,940
again, in and out of these
states, back into your ordinary

214
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,860
life. It's. Really it's
important to keep them in

215
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,960
balance. And my life was
organized in such a way that it

216
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,040
did keep those two different
sides of my life did stay in

217
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,020
balance with each other and help
each other.

218
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,340
Tasshin Fogleman: And can you
speak to the you make a

219
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,920
distinction between using
psychedelics for therapy and for

220
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,920
spirituality, and for, you know,
the kinds of cosmological

221
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,560
explorations that you ended up
leaning towards. Can you speak

222
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,460
to that distinction?

223
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,020
Chris Bache: Yeah, and that's
something I became more

224
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,300
articulate about as the journey
went on, and particularly as I

225
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,060
came back and began to write up
the entire thing, because I

226
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,600
found that many people who were
beginning to read my work were

227
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,440
trying to understand it within
frameworks that were too small

228
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,520
to understand the project. And
so I differentiate very clearly

229
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,780
now three different projects
that you can do with

230
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,220
psychedelics. You can do others,
of course, but just three one is

231
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,300
therapeutic healing. This is the
primary work of the psychedelic

232
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,420
Renaissance today, working on
healing the wounds of the

233
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,820
personal, unconscious, post
traumatic stress, death anxiety,

234
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,700
depression, alcohol addiction.
This is working at a personal

235
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:29,120
level, at the early stages.
Different than that is spiritual

236
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,920
awakening. This is basically to
try to awaken spiritually to the

237
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:42,040
truth of one's inner being, to
experientially have access to

238
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,000
the center of consciousness,
which turns out to be the same

239
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,440
unified reality as the entire
field of consciousness that

240
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,460
underlies all existence. This is
a different project than simply

241
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,640
therapeutic healing. It's it.
This is spiritual healing,

242
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,500
spiritual awakening, you know,
opening up to the to the rich

243
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:09,540
spiritual underlying fabric of
existence, the exploring of the

244
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,080
universe. Cosmological
exploration is a different

245
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:19,020
project. Still, cosmological
exploration is not simply

246
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,680
becoming aware or coming tuned
to the spiritual truths of life.

247
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,520
It's exploring beyond those
realities into the deep

248
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,620
structure of existence, going
beyond space, beyond time, going

249
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,800
into deep time, going into deep
space, going into archetype of

250
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,080
reality. You do not have to go
into these dimensions to wake up

251
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,160
or become a fully realized human
being. You do not have to go

252
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,580
into archetype or reality. You
do not have to go to the

253
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,240
beginning of the universe before
the Big Bang and watch creation

254
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,500
emerge out of the great void of
primal existence. This is a very

255
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,900
kind of different agenda, and I
think it's important to keep

256
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,980
apples and oranges separate from
each other. Now, they reinforce

257
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,120
each other. They support each
other in my journey, which

258
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,080
became primarily one of
cosmological exploration. Of

259
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,800
course, there was a great deal
of healing that took place at a

260
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,400
personal level, and there were
episodes of rich spiritual

261
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,140
awakening. But if I were aimed
at just spiritual awakening or

262
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,040
just psychological healing, I
would have organized the

263
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,000
sessions quite differently. But
spiritual, you know,

264
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,200
cosmological exploration is
really kind of like any kind of

265
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,160
demanding extreme sport, kind of
like going climbing Mount

266
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,480
Everest or going to the North
Pole. I don't know why anybody

267
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,480
would want to go to the North
Pole, but it's a very demanding

268
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,720
thing that some people like to
do, exploring the deep

269
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,920
structure. The Kant of the
cosmos is something like that.

270
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,580
It's a very demanding, rigorous
it requires tremendous

271
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,700
safeguards, and it is going in
places that very few people have

272
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,760
gone. And it's not the same as
spiritual awakening.

273
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,560
Tasshin Fogleman: Yeah, on the
one hand, I find the distinction

274
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,840
persuasive, because this really
does characterize your work and

275
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,080
the kinds of discoveries that
you found. And then I think if

276
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,300
you were holding that
distinction as like a purely

277
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,660
separate thing that wouldn't be
aligned with my own experiences

278
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,020
of these things. But it sounds
like you're saying, no, they can

279
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,300
all happen, but it's more like
what you're aiming for or what

280
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,080
your intentions

281
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,780
Chris Bache: are, yeah, and the
overlap.

282
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,740
Tasshin Fogleman: In that case,
how did you structure your

283
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,280
sessions so as to aim in the
direction of cosmological

284
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,480
exploration? And how might
someone structure them if

285
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,680
they're aimed at the other
goals?

286
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,180
Chris Bache: Well, hmm. Yeah, I
didn't first. I didn't

287
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,480
understand a lot of this at the
time when I was doing this work,

288
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,500
I understood it only after I'd
gone a long way down this road

289
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,620
and was looking back and
beginning to understand some of

290
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,040
the choices, the how the choices
I've made an impact of the

291
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:23,180
trajectory of the work. But
basically, once you decide

292
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,960
you're dosed, that's a
significant decision in this

293
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,520
process. But working with high
doses, you completely surrender

294
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,940
to the process. It's impossible
to try to direct. You can set

295
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,560
all the good intentions you
want, but the states of

296
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,220
consciousness that arise with
high doses of psychedelics,

297
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,760
amplified by very carefully
selected music and

298
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:54,100
internalization in a Kiva
practice, this sets in motion

299
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,460
processes that are so powerful
you can't control them at all.

300
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,520
You can't direct them, and the
strategy is simply to surrender,

301
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,360
to let to let your consciousness
take you wherever it wants to

302
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,140
take you, to show you whatever
it wants to show you, no matter

303
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,800
how inscrutable at the time, no
matter how painful, no matter

304
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,420
how absurd it may seem at the
time, just let it take you. It's

305
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,220
only after the fact, when you're
putting it all together, that

306
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,000
you may begin to understand some
of the dynamics of the

307
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,380
unfolding. So there's you put it
together after each individual

308
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,400
session, but then over a string
of sessions, I found that there

309
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,900
was a sequential development. So
more or less one session where

310
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,160
one session ended, the next
session would begin, kind of

311
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,620
like keeping a dream journal.
You're just going deeper and

312
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,120
deeper, and you may not
understand what's happening

313
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,560
until multiple sessions down the
road, and then when you look

314
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,020
back, you understand that
there's a continuity of

315
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,300
development that is taking place
across these different sessions.

316
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,340
So it's not a matter of aiming
the intention beyond the dose

317
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,320
and setting. It's really a
matter of complete surrender and

318
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,220
then figuring out after the fact
what has happened.

319
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,960
Tasshin Fogleman: What is the
word Kiva that used

320
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,980
Chris Bache: Kiva, you know, in
in the Native American

321
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,300
Southwestern tradition, when
they would do sacred ceremonies

322
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,740
with Peyote or with sacraments,
there's a Kiva as a hole in the

323
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,780
ground, you know, with a ladder
coming down, and you sit deep in

324
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,520
this hole in The ground around
the fire ladder is pulled up,

325
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,260
you stay in there, isolated all
night long, doing ceremony,

326
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,600
until the next morning, when
it's over and the ladder is

327
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,800
brought down. So it's I use it
as a metaphor of what a good

328
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,700
psychedelic session is like.
You're totally isolated from the

329
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,380
world. You don't get up and move
around, you don't talk a lot,

330
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,040
you don't engage with the
outside world. You're totally

331
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,240
isolated that way. You know that
whatever you're confronting is

332
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,460
coming from within yourself. Are
coming through yourself. It's

333
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,820
not You're not being triggered
by outside stimuli.

334
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,140
Tasshin Fogleman: Thank you for
explaining, helpful. Yeah,

335
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,180
there's a question on my mind
about your work, and in

336
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,900
particular, you know, it's
almost as if you're presenting

337
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,020
cosmological findings, and I
find them very persuasive,

338
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,740
personally, and, you know,
consistent with my own

339
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,120
explorations. And at the same
time, I there's a kind of

340
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,000
question of, like, why would
someone take these findings

341
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,500
seriously as some kind of, you
know, not just like an adventure

342
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,660
that you had or an inner
experience, but as something

343
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,320
that really says something about
the nature of reality? Yeah?

344
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,800
Chris Bache: Yeah. Good
question. And of course, the

345
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,640
critical question, how do we
know this is more than just? Why

346
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,520
isn't it just some kind of
echoes of my personal

347
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,360
unconscious, or echoes off the
collective unconscious, and not

348
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,520
something that really goes
beyond those canyon walls? And

349
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,320
here we have to get down there.
A couple of things. First are,

350
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,240
are the experiences replicable?
Do these experiences show up in

351
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,840
the psychedelic sessions of
other people? If it were just me

352
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,840
saying these things or
describing these levels of

353
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,460
reality, then that, if there's
just a one off, then it may be,

354
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,080
just as you say. It could be,
you know, just a personal kind

355
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,460
of indulgence, but these the
cosmology that emerges in

356
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,000
psychedelic states. First of
all, it's echoed in the work of

357
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,320
other psychedelicists, if they
you, if they're using a method

358
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,340
and a substance that has
sufficient power to break

359
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,800
through the same number of
layers. Basically there is a

360
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,100
convergence of experience that
emerges at these very deep

361
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,880
levels, so that when I'm
describing my experiences, other

362
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,720
psychedelic journeyers recognize
them. They recognize them as

363
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,320
reflecting their own experience
as well. What's important in

364
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,040
this context is to put all of
our experiences on the table

365
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,080
together, not just one person,
but everybody's experiences, and

366
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,220
by comparing all of our
experiences in the context of

367
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,520
the methodology that each of us
use to realize these

368
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,720
experiences, then we get a
better understanding of of what

369
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,280
is idiosyncratic and what is
common ground in that context.

370
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,340
My work, I think, is largely
comfortable within the common

371
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,440
ground that Grof has outlined as
he has integrated Hundreds 1000s

372
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,800
of psychedelic sessions from
hundreds of people through time.

373
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,680
But also, what emerges in a
psychedelic cosmology is not

374
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,480
unique to psychedelics
themselves, but it is the same

375
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,980
cosmology that emerges in deep
mystical traditions. In deep

376
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,580
spiritual traditions, the
contemplative traditions, there

377
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,900
are nuances of interpretation,
of course, and there are as

378
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,960
different mystical traditions
have different interpretive

379
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,660
canvases to articulate their
experiences. But if you do a

380
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,280
phenomenological analysis, if
you look at the lineages of

381
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,440
witnessing that come out of
world, mystical cultures, and

382
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,000
you compare them to what emerges
in psychedelic cosmology, they

383
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,620
fundamentally are the same
cosmology. So that, in that

384
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,980
sense, there's nothing unique in
what I'm saying, the only thing

385
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,860
that's unique is this particular
method of gaining access to

386
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,720
these dimensions of reality.

387
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,740
Tasshin Fogleman: Yeah, I think
the method is certainly unique,

388
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,100
and there, at least for me, some
of the findings that you share

389
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,720
feel novel or things that I
hadn't encountered previously. I

390
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,060
mean, in particular, the
emphasis on reincarnation as a

391
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,860
kind of process akin to
evolution and development in a

392
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,380
certain way. I mean, there are
similar things that I'd heard

393
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,140
elsewhere, but, but connecting
it to evolution in particular

394
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,520
feels feels novel. And then, you
know, other things as well, but

395
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:30,320
then that felt new. So you said
earlier that, you know, about

396
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,140
two or three years into this
process, that you started to

397
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,600
have a new understanding of the
work that you're doing, and it

398
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,900
was less about your own
personal, you know, blocks and

399
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,940
unblocking yourself. What was
that discovery and what did you

400
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,860
learn as that transitioned?

401
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,120
Chris Bache: Well, for the first
two and a half years, I was

402
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,640
plunged into a level of
consciousness that's at the very

403
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,240
bottom of the personal psyche.
It's a dimension that Stan calls

404
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,320
the perinatal level of
consciousness. It's it's at the

405
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,040
interface of the limits of
physical consciousness and the

406
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,340
beginning of spiritual
consciousness. So that,

407
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,500
typically, people relive their
own birth. They relive their

408
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,340
their fear of death. Birth and
death are the revolving door of

409
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,080
life. You know, we get here by
being born. We leave time and

410
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:28,040
space by dying. In order for
consciousness to expand beyond

411
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,200
time space reality, one has to
confront all that conditioning

412
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,120
in our psyche which tells us
that we are a time space self,

413
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,240
that I am my egoic physical
body, mind, awareness. And none

414
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,780
of us, from that perspective,
are really sure what happens to

415
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,140
us when we die. And many of us
believe there's nothing that

416
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,100
happens to us when we die. Death
is a cessation of all existence.

417
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,260
And we have all sorts of fears
surrounding death, and anxiety

418
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,840
surrounding death. And
basically, in the confrontation

419
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,560
with these perinatal dynamics,
one engages all those fears that

420
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,940
the universe is ultimately
meaningless, that the universe

421
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,440
completely destroys all of our
attempts to do something of

422
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,220
value, do something of enduring,
that something in our life will

423
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,420
endure. And one often re
experiences, one birth in the

424
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,560
same time. But eventually, if
you keep at it, this process

425
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,480
culminates in a in a particular
kind of existential crisis,

426
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:44,920
often called ego death. And your
your physical identity is

427
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,880
shattered. It's just absolutely
shattered, and then you

428
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,280
transition into a deeper level
of spiritual reality that lies

429
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,300
beyond the parameters of your
physical consciousness. Now. Is

430
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,360
very common in mystical
traditions. Mystical traditions

431
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,800
talk about the death of self,
Shunyata, emptiness of self.

432
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,080
Anata, no self. It's very common
in spiritual traditions, as well

433
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,040
as psychedelic traditions. It's
what happened next that really

434
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,200
kind of shifted my perspective.
I was expecting after going

435
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,120
through ego death, that I would
then have unfettered access into

436
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:32,480
a spiritual reality. But what
happened was the entire

437
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,220
purification process began again
at a different at a deeper

438
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:44,020
level, I began to get drawn into
exercises of vast collective

439
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,880
suffering, tremendous pain and
suffering, physical ordeals. It

440
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,860
was like being swallowed by
Dante's Inferno. And this went

441
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,300
on session after session for two
years, deeper and deeper into

442
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:04,320
these vast landscapes of
horrific pain and brutality and

443
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,220
suffering far beyond anything I
mean, my life has never touched

444
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,020
anything like that. It's never
known anything like that. And

445
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,040
this was a real puzzle for me,
because for a long time I

446
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,760
thought maybe this represented a
deeper ego death. But in time, I

447
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,940
eventually came to the
conclusion that no, this was not

448
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,880
about healing or cleansing my
personal psyche, that somehow in

449
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,320
my sessions, a shift had taken
place, and the focus had become

450
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,840
the healing of the entire human
species, that somehow I was

451
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:49,840
tapping into festering fields of
pain which were being held

452
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,300
within the collective
unconscious of our entire

453
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,680
species, that just as we
individually hold on to our

454
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,980
memories and experiences and
some of them are problematic,

455
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,160
the entire human species holds
on to the experiences of all of

456
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,120
its children, all of humanity.
And some of those experiences

457
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,200
are very, very traumatic, the
war, the experiences of war, the

458
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,380
experiences of drought, the
experiences of violence against

459
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,800
each other, these aggregate
within the collective psyche,

460
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,840
and they burden the collective
psyche, just as our individual

461
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,100
trauma burdens our personal
psyche. And that somehow at this

462
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,200
point in my sessions, I had been
kind of given the opportunity

463
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,900
and volunteered to cooperate
with this process where the by

464
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,860
making these vast tracks of pain
conscious, there was some way in

465
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,940
which these were being lifted
out of the collective psyche,

466
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:54,220
just as when you encounter
personal trauma in your personal

467
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,940
psyche and you confront it, it's
lifts that trauma out of your

468
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,160
personal system. And it was
after going through this for two

469
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,600
years that eventually there was
a crescendo of this process, a

470
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,080
huge healing process, which then
threw me into a yet still deeper

471
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,200
level of consciousness, and
that's when I began to really

472
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:23,240
understand that there are cycles
of death and rebirth in this

473
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,360
work, and that the cycles deepen
and change as the level of

474
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,860
consciousness that you are
working on deepens. So the first

475
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,880
level of healing and cleansing
was taking place at the

476
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,160
perinatal, our personal level of
consciousness. The second level

477
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,520
of healing was taking place at
the collective level of

478
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,180
consciousness. And then there
were levels of consciousness

479
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,920
that I went to that were even
deeper. But this cycle of death

480
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,720
and rebirth, purification and
transformation, is a cycle that

481
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,320
repeats itself multiple times,
if you keep going deeper into

482
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,700
the great expanse,

483
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,139
Tasshin Fogleman: what words
would you use to describe the

484
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,659
levels that you went to, beyond
personal and collective?

485
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,079
Chris Bache: When I was looking
back over the whole of my

486
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,119
journey, I basically divided it
into five broad overlapping

487
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:31,399
categories, working at the level
of personal mind, working at the

488
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:36,259
level of the collective mind,
then moving into archetypal

489
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:44,319
reality beyond beyond even the
collective psyche, and then the

490
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:48,459
level of causal reality, or the
one mind, where the entire

491
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:53,919
universe moves us one. And then
beyond that, entering, for the

492
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,519
last five years of my work, what
I came to call the diamond

493
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,399
Luminosity, an exceptionally.
Clear, hyper, hyper, clear

494
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:10,139
expression of pure light, which,
when I looked for religious

495
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:14,459
correlations, or spiritual
traditions correlations in

496
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:18,659
Buddhism, I think this is what
they call Dharmakaya, the clear

497
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:23,359
light of absolute reality out of
which existence springs. So

498
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,599
those five levels, personal
mind, collective mind,

499
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:31,039
archetypal mind, the one mind
and diamond Luminosity,

500
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:39,140
Tasshin Fogleman: I'd like to
return to that. Maybe one of the

501
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,720
themes in your work is, I think,
giving a really persuasive case

502
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,100
for reincarnation. And you know,
I was already, I already sort of

503
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,120
believed in reincarnation for my
own explorations, but it's a

504
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,820
really, really solid case that
you make for it, I think. And

505
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,120
you wrote a book, life cycles
about it, and then later on, in

506
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,760
your most recent book, LSD, in
the mind of the universe, you're

507
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,540
like, oh, there were some things
that I think I didn't quite get

508
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,600
to in that book. And I wonder if
you could describe your current

509
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,280
understanding of reincarnation.

510
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,580
Chris Bache: Well, as a
philosopher, I think

511
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,880
reincarnation is a fundamental
and important concept to

512
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,080
examine, because philosophical
traditions diverge. If you

513
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,220
believe that there is no
reincarnation, and if you

514
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,240
believe there is reincarnation,
you end up with two different

515
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,500
understandings of reality. So
one of the early things I did in

516
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,500
my academic career was really
look seriously at the question,

517
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,740
is there empirical evidence?
What's the state of empirical

518
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,120
evidence for reincarnation? Now,
50 years ago, this evidence what

519
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,300
did not exist, but today it
does. I think we have ample

520
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,300
empirical evidence that
reincarnation is a simple fact

521
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,200
of life. And the primary work
here comes from Ian Stevenson's

522
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,280
work studying young children
around the world who have

523
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,840
spontaneous, detailed memories
of their previous lifetime. And

524
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,440
the opportunity we have verified
these memories, and we have

525
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,440
separated out and really re
eliminated the possibility that

526
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,020
they could have acquired these
memories through natural means.

527
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,760
So for that and for evidence
from past life therapy that is a

528
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,100
strong philosophical case can be
made for reincarnation being a

529
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,120
simple fact of life. It doesn't
mean we understand how it takes

530
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,140
place. We don't understand the
physics of it. We may even have

531
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,920
a very incomplete understanding
of the project of it, what the

532
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,600
purpose of it is, and I
personally think that the

533
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,740
classic Eastern interpretation
of reincarnation I've come to

534
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,700
see is incomplete. It's a first
approximation, but it's not the

535
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,600
complete story. But because of
this available evidence, the

536
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,480
first book I wrote was on
reincarnation, which presented

537
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,080
the evidence and then asked,
okay, so, What? What? So, what

538
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,080
if reincarnation is a fact of
life? What does this tell us

539
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,360
about the way the universe
works? The classic story, and

540
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,660
the story that I used in telling
that story, the classic story of

541
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,600
reincarnation, is a story of the
individual soul or individual

542
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,860
consciousness, making choices,
inheriting the consequences of

543
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,860
those choices, which out of
which, they then make new

544
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,420
choices. So there is a learning
cycle between choosing and

545
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,020
inheriting, choosing inheriting,
and this takes place within a

546
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,240
lifetime, and it takes place
across multiple lifetimes, but

547
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,100
it's the story of the individual
soul into becoming individually

548
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:50,080
more spiritually mature, more
capable, more compassionate,

549
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,320
more talented, so on and so
forth. In there. It's an

550
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,360
individual story. What I found
in my psychedelic work when I

551
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,500
began to open up into the
collective psyche, and deep

552
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,040
within the collective fields of
consciousness, is that in

553
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,760
addition to this individual
story, there was a collective

554
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,000
story that the entire human
species, and some fundamental

555
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,320
ways, operates as a single
organism, There is an

556
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,020
intelligence that's operating
within the entire species, and

557
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,360
that all of our individual
incarnations were profoundly and

558
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:34,160
subtly integrated into the
integration of this group,

559
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,060
species of this group, and that
there was a way in which the

560
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,700
intelligence of the species was
manifesting itself in certain

561
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:48,340
patterns of detoxification,
purification, breakthrough that

562
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,300
were happening collectively. So
it wasn't just individual

563
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,780
choices driving it all, but
there were also collective

564
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,200
choices and a collective
intelligence driving the entire

565
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,700
process. Yes, I also was given a
came into a series of

566
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,600
experiences that gave me a
different understanding of where

567
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,620
reincarnation is taking
humanity. Because the classic

568
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,520
Eastern vision is that
reincarnation evolves you to a

569
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,100
certain point until you have a
core breakthrough. The Hindus

570
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,660
called it moksha, escape, where
we escape ego, but we also

571
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:33,020
escape Samsara. We escape
physical existence. So the basic

572
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,880
vision here is, you achieve
moksha, or you achieve nirvana,

573
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,800
and then when you die, you
achieve parin Nirvana, final

574
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,060
nirvana. But the goal is to
achieve some type of spiritual

575
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:51,040
fruition, which then allows you
to graduate from space time and

576
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,780
to rest in some spiritual
paradise off planet, whether

577
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,480
it's the Muslim garden or the
Christian heaven or the Buddha

578
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,300
pure land. It's some off planet
paradise. But that, of course,

579
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,980
leaves unanswered what is the
purpose of time and space? Which

580
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,620
was okay, as long as we were
thinking that time and space had

581
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,860
only been around for a few 1000
years, but now that we

582
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,240
understand that we're talking
billions and billions of years

583
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,220
of evolution of time and space.
It doesn't seem to really be a

584
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,720
very satisfying account that to
say that after all these

585
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,520
millions of years, billions of
years and millions of years of

586
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,540
evolution of Homo sapiens, it's
all the work that has gone into

587
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:44,320
learning how to walk upright and
use and become a tool user. And

588
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,880
about 5000 years ago, we became
conscious of this deep common

589
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,060
ground of the psyche that as
soon as we begin to become

590
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:57,580
conscious of this underlying,
encompassing Buddha nature, our

591
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,740
essential nature, as soon as we
become aware, then we leave. The

592
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,120
goal is just to leave. And what
happened in my sessions was

593
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,500
something quite different, at a
pivotal session, and I'd done

594
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,440
past life therapy before. I
mean, not in the psychedelic

595
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,980
work, but, you know,
hypnotherapy I was familiar with

596
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,140
a dozen or so had worked with
healing and integrating a dozen

597
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,860
or so of my former lives. But in
this session, my former lives

598
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,160
started coming into me. They
were coming into me, and it was

599
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,280
like wrapping filaments of white
light around a kite spool more

600
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,220
and more consciousness, more and
more lives were coming into me.

601
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,100
They had been healed. They were
coming into and they reached a

602
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:47,320
point where they fused all of
these individual lives fused

603
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,240
into one life. And when they
fused, I was there was an

604
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,860
explosion of diamond light from
my chest, and I was catapulted

605
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:01,080
into a state of awareness that
was beyond anything I had known

606
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:06,420
up to that point in time. I was
an individual, but I was an

607
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,140
individual beyond any frame of
reference that I had previously

608
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,160
known. And this I came to
understand as the birth of the

609
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,220
diamond soul. I language it
other people give it different

610
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,360
words, but it's basically the
guy idea here is that

611
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,740
reincarnation doesn't just grow
us individually, layer by layer,

612
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,160
class by class, you know,
challenge by challenge, but

613
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,840
there comes a time when our
entire history is aggregated and

614
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,800
integrates into a single
consciousness, and at that

615
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,040
point, that single consciousness
becomes one's working identity.

616
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,700
So basically, what's happening
is the soul is becoming born

617
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,720
inside history and by soul. I
think there are ways of

618
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,540
understanding the soul that are
completely compatible with the

619
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,800
Buddhist teaching on anata and
no self, because this is not an

620
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,440
egoic soul. It's not a soul of
boundaries, it's not a soul of

621
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,960
of that's inherently self
centered in its appetites. But

622
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,060
once the soul emerges there,
it's a tremendous breath of

623
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:19,980
intellect, Breath of compassion
and a deep communion with the

624
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,220
spiritual forces of the
universe. And so the goal of

625
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,660
reincarnation is not simply to
evolve us to the point where we

626
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,860
become spiritually awake and
leave but the goal is to evolve

627
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:40,600
us to the point where truly we
become a the next iteration of

628
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:47,020
human evolution, we become a
species of incarnate souls, so

629
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:52,600
that we are never tempted to
take our private ego as our true

630
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,880
identity. But we know ourselves
to be of this time traveler. We

631
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,800
know ourselves to be de. Deeper
than that, and we know we have

632
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,360
kinship relations with so many
1000s of people, and we have

633
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,960
kinship relationship with the
earth. We know that the Earth

634
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,840
that we leave will be the earth
will inherit in our next

635
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:19,260
incarnation. Souls live on Earth
differently than egos do, and I

636
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,520
think that's the I think that's
the pivot we're in the process

637
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,840
of making now, and I understand
four or 5000 years ago, in the

638
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,100
Axial Age, when we first began
to make discoveries of this

639
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,240
spiritual reality, the spiritual
reality, which is so much more

640
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,300
satisfying than time, space
reality, it would develop an up

641
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,960
and out cosmology, the theology,
which says the purpose is to go

642
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,680
home. We don't believe belong
here. This is our fallen

643
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,980
condition. We don't want to stay
here. We want to go back to

644
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:55,660
where we came from. I understand
that, but I think it's an

645
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:00,900
incomplete understanding of the
deeper project of creation. The

646
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,780
project of creation is to awake
and bring heaven to earth, to

647
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:12,720
live the Buddha world here
inside our physical existence.

648
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:25,100
Tasshin Fogleman: What do you
feel in so, you know, so in my

649
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,120
own life, I've been really moved
by Buddhism and inspired by

650
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,360
Buddhism and certainly other
traditions as well. And I find

651
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,320
what you're saying compelling
that, you know, there, there was

652
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,660
an incomplete truth to the
teachings offered in the Axial

653
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,960
Age where there's there's wisdom
to them and and benefit, and yet

654
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,580
it's also incomplete. And I
wonder how you would describe

655
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,080
the relationship of the
perspectives that you hold now

656
00:46:53,560 --> 00:47:00,180
in to the teachings that we may
have received from the past, and

657
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,620
perhaps Buddhism in particular.

658
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,000
Chris Bache: Well, once again, I
want to emphasize that the work

659
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,220
I did is a path of temporary
immersion. Temporary immersion

660
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:20,040
does not easily or
conventionally lead to permanent

661
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,660
shifts in awareness, you have to
do a lot of spiritual practice

662
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,620
before any of the things that we
experience in the temporary

663
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,120
condition, the psychedelic,
amplified condition, can become

664
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,040
our ordinary daily
consciousness. And so the great

665
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,480
masters of the spiritual
traditions and the great masters

666
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,280
of the Buddhist tradition have
always been my heroes, and their

667
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,720
teachings have always been my
guiding light in terms of how to

668
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,160
engage the psychedelic states in
a responsible manner, how to

669
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,380
invest in them in a way which
leads can be converted into, or

670
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,600
leads to long term
transformations of one's

671
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,480
baseline consciousness on this
earth. So first, truly,

672
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,860
genuinely, all honor to the
Great Beings of these

673
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:21,320
traditions. And at the same
time, we know that there is

674
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,280
patriarchy, for example, in the
Buddhist traditions and Buddhism

675
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,640
has had to clear itself of its
patriarchy, just as other

676
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,000
religious traditions have. I
think there are other

677
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:39,260
limitations. There is a kind of
anti physical, a disparagement

678
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,780
of the physical body, which is a
subtle disparagement of nature,

679
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,120
which itself is becoming aware
of and is having to transcend. I

680
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:53,140
think there are elements within
Buddhism that have a deep

681
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:58,660
appreciation of the joy of
living the Buddha nature, and

682
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:05,520
sees that the Buddha nature is
intended to be lived within time

683
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,500
and space, that Samsara truly is
Nirvana, when understood

684
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,860
completely, Nirvana does not
require an abandonment of

685
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:20,540
Samsara, but actually is
coherent with Samsara, and yet

686
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,880
they're the mainstream sources
of Buddhism. For the popular

687
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,240
people, still have kind of an up
and out cosmology, working in

688
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,020
Christianity too. You achieve
salvation, and then you escape

689
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:39,860
to go to heaven. So I think, as
an historian, is simply a matter

690
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:44,980
of, you know, understanding the
historical context within which

691
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:50,080
these great masters were
working, and which helped them

692
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,800
and hindered them in some ways,
from the, you know, the full

693
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,860
expression, giving full
expression of their spiritual

694
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,740
realization. And yet, in, in.
And even if you're working

695
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,360
spiritually within an incomplete
cosmology, the levels of

696
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,480
spiritual realization which can
be achieved is just

697
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,780
extraordinary. What great
masters can do, the great

698
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:18,480
mahasiddhis of the lineages can
do, is just extraordinary and

699
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,480
deserving of all respect. So in
criticizing the cosmology within

700
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,360
which some of them operate,
that's not to criticize the

701
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:32,480
level of spiritual realization
that they have achieved, nor I

702
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,460
want to emphasize again, to have
had unusually deep spiritual

703
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:43,120
experiences in a psychedelic
state is not to have stabilized

704
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,240
those experiences any meaningful
way in one's ordinary

705
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,440
consciousness. There is still a
great deal of work to do before

706
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,300
those states of awareness can
become abiding in any serious

707
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:01,800
sense. So I always want to
qualify the insights that emerge

708
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,660
in psychedelic work,

709
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:08,699
Tasshin Fogleman: yes, yes, and
certainly for myself, this is a

710
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,519
question that comes from a place
of deep respect. I mean,

711
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:17,879
Buddhism is, is like, like my
home in a certain way, so, but I

712
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:23,779
appreciate the clarifications
that you add to it. And I

713
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:28,039
wonder, you know, you spoke
earlier about your own spiritual

714
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:30,259
practice and the different
traditions that you've been

715
00:51:30,259 --> 00:51:33,919
exposed to, and it seems like
you found sort of a home in

716
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:35,899
Vajrayana Buddhism is that?

717
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,660
Chris Bache: Is that right? It
is, and it's a kind of a

718
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:46,000
modified Vajrayana, because I
was doing kind of intense

719
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,980
Vajrayana practice for a number
of years, and I've modified it

720
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,440
from my own psychedelic
experiences, because I've come

721
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:04,620
To understand that I have it's
not that I've realized the

722
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,020
states that I encountered in my
deep psychedelic work, but I

723
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,700
have an understanding and
experience of those levels of

724
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,240
reality. They live inside me as
memories. They are active

725
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,840
memories. And so I've developed
forms of Vajrayana practice.

726
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:30,080
I've expanded them by actively
integrating those memories into

727
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,840
the realization protocols. So
for example, you know, in

728
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,540
classic Vajrayana practice, we
distinguish between the Samaya

729
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,040
Safa and the Jnana sattva. The
Samaya Sava is the being of

730
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,880
construct. It's the being we
formulate through our mantras,

731
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,440
through our visualizations and
using of tankas and exercises to

732
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:00,100
create some approximation of
pure goodness, pure insight,

733
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,100
which then attracts the
jananissa for the reality, the

734
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:11,880
cosmic reality. So we we make
our visualization pure in order

735
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,960
to open a channel between the
cosmic reality, which then we

736
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,980
invite to pour His blessings
into us. Well, in a way, I use

737
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:26,720
my psychedelic memories as part
of constructing my Samaya Safa.

738
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:32,960
To me, the living memory of the
diamond Luminosity is a more

739
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,280
effective spiritual vehicle of
practice than the beautiful

740
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,160
tankers that attempt to give
some type of physical expression

741
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:48,640
of the sublime perfection. Okay,
so I modify it in that way. I

742
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:57,520
also have a sense, because I've
died so many times, and because

743
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:03,720
I've gone where I will go when I
die physically, I've gone into

744
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,880
that domain so many times. I
feel a deep comfortableness with

745
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:15,900
it, and I feel a familiarity
with that domain. And I think

746
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,360
this changes one's practice,
because we're told over and over

747
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,920
again, we practice in order to
prepare for the moment of death,

748
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,580
because the moment of death is
the great potential, has great

749
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:33,560
potential for accelerating our
evolution. And I agree with

750
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:39,260
that, and I tried to live that
in my psychedelic practice has

751
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:43,540
been done in a way to prepare me
for the moment of death, and the

752
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,860
net result of it is that I feel
very comfortable with death, and

753
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:53,140
I feel very comfortable with
being able to navigate what

754
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,920
comes after death, because I
feel like I've already

755
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,480
encountered it in many ways.

756
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:04,080
Tasshin Fogleman: Mm. What do
you think it was about Adriana

757
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,920
Buddhism that attracted you and
felt like you could

758
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,820
metaphorically find a find a
home there?

759
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,420
Chris Bache: Well, it was my
first wife, Carol, who was my

760
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,680
sitter in my sessions, a
clinical psychologist herself

761
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,880
who really brought me into
vadrana. I was kind of

762
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,140
esthetics. I was more interested
in the Zen tradition. I really

763
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,260
wasn't interested with all the
bills and candles and incense

764
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,520
and, you know, all the fanfare
that comes with Vajrayana. But

765
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,380
she went there, and I basically
followed her there, and through

766
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:47,380
her, met the teachers that were
gathering and came through Tara

767
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,960
mandala Buddhist retreat center,
Lama sutra malayonis established

768
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,000
the center in Colorado and began
to study with her and go into

769
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,700
retreats with the Teachers of
that lineage. And so I met their

770
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,660
lineage of awakened beings, and
they made a deep impression on

771
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:11,880
me. If my karma had been such as
to introduce me to the great

772
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:16,980
awakened beings of the Zen
lineage, then, you know, I could

773
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,840
have gone there just as easily.
But it was just the opportunity

774
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:25,880
to meet these beings, to receive
teachings from them that made a

775
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,020
large impression on me.

776
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,540
Tasshin Fogleman: And coming
back to your explorations, use

777
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,920
the phrase deep time. Can you
say what you mean by that? Yeah,

778
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:39,980
I

779
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:50,320
Chris Bache: when I first began
to enter the ocean of suffering,

780
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,160
when I made the transition
outside of egoic after ego

781
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,260
death, and I went into these
episodes of collective anguish

782
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:04,080
when I came every session is
divided into sort of two halves.

783
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,760
There's a purification half
followed by an ecstatic half. So

784
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,700
you go through the purification
half, and if you submit to it,

785
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,300
it comes to a crescendo, a
breakthrough, and then you're

786
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:20,900
spun into a Transpersonal of
section of teachings, and

787
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,640
ecstatic in teachings and next
and so on so forth. So when I

788
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,660
was being, when I was thrown,
after this very intense

789
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:34,820
collective purification, I began
to enter into states of

790
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,140
consciousness that were
extremely novel and

791
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:43,420
unprecedented for me, and I
came, I first called it whole

792
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,460
time, and I came to call it deep
time. I began to have

793
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:53,380
experiences of my entire life
start to finish as a completed

794
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:59,860
toll. It was like every time
moment in my life was in a tree.

795
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:05,040
Was a tree, and I experienced
the whole of my life as a single

796
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:11,160
tree. I experienced my old age,
my middle age. I experienced the

797
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,880
themes of my life as
simultaneously present. This was

798
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,740
such a dramatic expansion of my
cognitive frame of reference

799
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,480
that after the session, I
couldn't hold on to it. It

800
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,440
disappeared. I forgot it. I
couldn't hold it. But I found

801
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,640
that with repetition, going back
into that state again and again,

802
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,720
and it was I was always taken
into the same reality for a

803
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:42,520
year, for seven sessions, by
returning to it and working very

804
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,660
diligently to stabilize your
state of consciousness there. I

805
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,840
learned how to hold on to it. I
learned to remember it. I

806
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,100
learned how to become
cognitively competent in deep

807
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,780
time. And what I've came to
believe was that there, there

808
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:03,900
are really many multiple
modalities of time operating

809
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:09,960
within the universe. Later,
after this period when I went

810
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:15,840
still deeper in my work, going
in toward archetypal reality, I

811
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:21,320
experienced larger swaths of
time than just my personal life.

812
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,400
The first was my personal life
about maybe 100 years. But then

813
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,440
I began to experience whole
time, or deep time, in terms of

814
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:35,900
100,000 year increments, and
maybe even larger later. And

815
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:43,300
basically, not only was my sense
of time expanding, but who the

816
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:48,100
being was, who was having those
experiences was expanding. So

817
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,300
it's not simply like you take a
disembodied ego and have an

818
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,360
experience of Transpersonal
reality, which you then bring

819
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:00,240
back, but literally, your ego is
shattered and you dissolve. Into

820
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,320
a deeper level of consciousness.
And it is that deeper level of

821
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:09,240
consciousness that opens up into
these deeper levels of time and

822
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,040
then instill deeper you
literally become a different

823
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:19,620
being than simply a discarnate
egoic presence. You become a

824
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:23,900
different being for hours and
hours at a time. So you're

825
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,880
dissolved into the fabric of
existence and dissolved into the

826
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,960
fabric of existence, you
sometimes have experiences of

827
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:39,920
how existence itself experiences
time. Now, there are some trends

828
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,580
in physics today that are
hypothesizing that just as super

829
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:49,180
String Theory hypothesizes
multiple dimensions of existence

830
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,260
beyond time and space, that some
of these dimensions of existence

831
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:57,640
that physics is conceptualizing
involve different modalities of

832
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,220
time, I don't know what the
relationship is exactly between

833
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:06,900
that and what my experiences is,
but my experience is that as you

834
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,580
go to the edges of space time,
you enter into different

835
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,120
modalities of time, and
different sets of insights

836
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:19,800
emerge in these different
modalities of time. Now I

837
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,980
understand how absurd this
sounds to my academic colleagues

838
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,720
and my scientific colleagues,
who generally tend to think that

839
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,620
the entire universe works within
linear time. There is an arrow

840
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:38,180
of time. Tachyons may move
backwards in time, but basically

841
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:41,080
the universe moves forward in
time, and it's an absolute

842
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:46,480
limit. I think the very best of
the edge of quantum thinking

843
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:50,620
goes beyond that. And certainly
my psychological, my psycho

844
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:56,560
spiritual experiences go beyond
that. Time became very porous in

845
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,680
my work, as did all my
boundaries in the work.

846
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,020
Tasshin Fogleman: I imagine,
it's difficult to put into

847
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,840
words, but is there anything
more that you can say about what

848
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,720
the experience of that is like,
like, either with your own

849
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,140
personal life, seeing the whole
of it at once, or the larger

850
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:13,680
scales?

851
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:21,859
Chris Bache: Well, first, once
you acclimate to it, it's not

852
01:02:21,859 --> 01:02:27,259
confusing at all. It's clear,
very, very clear. It's it's

853
01:02:27,319 --> 01:02:35,719
simply a different way of
relating to time. Insights

854
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:41,859
emerge out of the fabric, out of
an extended fabric of time, for

855
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:46,479
example, at the personal level,
when I experienced my my life as

856
01:02:46,479 --> 01:02:51,519
a completed whole, naturally, I
understood the deep structure of

857
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:55,419
my life better than I had
before. I understood some of the

858
01:02:55,419 --> 01:02:59,199
themes of my life. I understood
how things that I had been

859
01:02:59,259 --> 01:03:03,839
concerned with and the recurring
issues of my philosophical

860
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:08,819
inquiry in my personal life,
that those issues were deeply

861
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:13,319
etched in life and would be
consuming me for the entirety of

862
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:17,879
my life. I could, I could see
and feel my future. You don't. I

863
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:21,319
didn't see all the details. It's
not like seeing all the details

864
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:24,799
of your life, but it is as
though all your time moments

865
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:29,659
congeal, to give you a deep
reading of what the substance of

866
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:34,579
your life is about. Likewise,
when you dissolve into the human

867
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:40,479
species, and you dissolve into a
large swath of time on the order

868
01:03:40,479 --> 01:03:45,879
of hundreds of 1000s of years
you have, there are insights

869
01:03:45,879 --> 01:03:50,499
that arise in that context about
the developmental stages of

870
01:03:50,499 --> 01:03:57,639
human evolution. So I began to
have experiences, not just to my

871
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:01,799
personal future, but of
humanity's future. And I know

872
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:06,179
again, I know this sounds
arrogant and like ego run amok,

873
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:09,539
but it's the most natural thing
in the world that when you

874
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:16,439
dissolve into the condition of
the full species mind, and you

875
01:04:16,439 --> 01:04:20,359
dissolve into deep time
simultaneously, it's just

876
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:24,499
natural that some of the
developmental future, what is

877
01:04:24,499 --> 01:04:28,099
from our present, the future of
this species comes into view.

878
01:04:28,399 --> 01:04:31,399
But when you experience that,
you don't experience it as

879
01:04:31,399 --> 01:04:35,359
something yet to be. You
experience it as something that

880
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:40,519
already has been. And both of
those are held simultaneously.

881
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:44,979
It is yet to be, and it's also
something that has been so it

882
01:04:44,979 --> 01:04:50,739
has a certainty about it, and I
don't know how to to work out or

883
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:54,639
reconcile all of these things
with free will and any number of

884
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:58,419
different questions. But there
is just a there's a breadth of

885
01:04:58,419 --> 01:05:03,479
understanding that opens. So
that not only did I begin to

886
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:07,019
understand better what my
personal life was about, but I

887
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:11,759
began to understand the time in
history that humanity has

888
01:05:11,759 --> 01:05:15,659
entered, that it's coming into a
developmental crisis. It's

889
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:19,979
coming into an evolutionary
pivot point, and some of the

890
01:05:19,979 --> 01:05:23,959
characteristics of that crisis
and the characteristics of a

891
01:05:23,959 --> 01:05:29,179
breakthrough, which I think is
coming, these all emerge, or

892
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:36,199
these all become possible by
shedding just the limitations of

893
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:40,599
linear time as we conventionally
know it, and going into deeper

894
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:41,979
dimension of time. I was

895
01:05:46,179 --> 01:05:48,339
Tasshin Fogleman: definitely
thinking about free will just

896
01:05:48,339 --> 01:05:54,699
now, and I it makes sense that
it would be difficult to address

897
01:05:54,699 --> 01:05:58,119
that on a large scale
philosophically. I mean, it's a

898
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:04,623
long, long debate, but I wonder
what sensibilities these

899
01:06:04,623 --> 01:06:08,103
experiences gave you about your
own life and free will and

900
01:06:08,103 --> 01:06:10,803
choices, and you know, sort of
having a sense of your whole

901
01:06:10,803 --> 01:06:16,983
life, did, did you feel sort of
like you're fated to make

902
01:06:16,983 --> 01:06:22,039
certain choices, or that you had
free Will in it, or how did that

903
01:06:22,339 --> 01:06:23,359
impact you personally?

904
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:30,440
Chris Bache: Yeah, free will is
a tricky topic, isn't it, and

905
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:35,480
much of our popular discussion
of it, I find just not very

906
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:41,860
satisfying to skim the surface.
Advocates of Free Will over tend

907
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,760
to understate the level of
conditioning that qualifies our

908
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:55,660
freedom. And people who believe
that the determinism of our

909
01:06:55,660 --> 01:07:00,180
conditioning is so profound that
we may feel like we're free, but

910
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,700
if you examine it really
carefully, you find out that

911
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,000
your conditions are so highly
conditioned, your choices are so

912
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,540
highly conditioned that there
really isn't free will there. I

913
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:13,140
find a lot of that discussion
just not very satisfying on

914
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,100
either front

915
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:17,519
Unknown: to me, one

916
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:23,331
Chris Bache: of the themes that
has come through repeatedly in

917
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:31,131
my work is that we do, we do
have free will. It's a

918
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:35,511
conditioned free will, but we
have within those conditions the

919
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:39,591
opportunity to make choices. If
we didn't have the opportunity

920
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:43,179
to make choices, we wouldn't be
truly learning. There really

921
01:07:43,179 --> 01:07:46,719
wouldn't be an adventure of
learning. If when we incarnate,

922
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:50,799
we were simply just inheriting a
predetermined fate, then we're

923
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:53,919
just basically going through the
process of mechanical

924
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:58,599
actualization, and it wouldn't
be a genuine learning exercise

925
01:07:58,899 --> 01:08:02,579
if you can't make mistakes, if
you can't truly come to

926
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:06,719
crosswords and roads and say,
Well, I'm going to go either A

927
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:10,859
or B. Which one should I do? And
that's a true choice, a genuine

928
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:15,239
choice, which has learning
ramifications, then we wouldn't

929
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:18,839
be it wouldn't be an adventure
in learning. And I don't think,

930
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:23,299
I think the universe wants us to
learn it. List the messages that

931
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:29,659
I get is that freedom is an
absolutely important quality.

932
01:08:30,259 --> 01:08:35,419
Now it's always relative at
early stages. Is very little

933
01:08:35,419 --> 01:08:39,499
freedom when grass grows, it
doesn't have a lot of freedom in

934
01:08:39,499 --> 01:08:42,339
terms of how to respond to
photosynthesis and so on, so

935
01:08:42,339 --> 01:08:46,179
forth. But the more our
consciousness develops, the more

936
01:08:46,179 --> 01:08:49,119
choice enters into the picture.
The more individuated

937
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:53,199
consciousness becomes, the more
the cycle of learning becomes

938
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:58,419
more important. And still, our
choice is conditioned. But the

939
01:08:58,419 --> 01:09:02,099
conditioning gets lighter and
lighter, the sense of freedom

940
01:09:02,099 --> 01:09:08,219
being able to make clear choices
emerges, but to make free

941
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:13,859
choices, to make clear choices,
require certain self conscious

942
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:19,679
practice of stepping out of the
conditioning of our mind. And of

943
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,819
course, the meditation
traditions are well aware of

944
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:28,399
this. Because when we quiet the
mind, what we become very aware

945
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:33,499
of is all the multiple voices
that are going on inside us and

946
01:09:33,499 --> 01:09:36,619
all the layers of conditioning
that are conditioning our moment

947
01:09:36,619 --> 01:09:40,359
to moment awareness. And we have
to patiently strip those away.

948
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:44,679
We have to let them exhaust
themselves, and as we do, that

949
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:49,719
clarity of unconditioned
consciousness begins to Dawn

950
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:55,239
within our awareness, right? And
that becomes that is such a

951
01:09:55,239 --> 01:10:01,139
novel experience and so distinct
from conditioned. Consciousness,

952
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:06,119
that it becomes the very highly
desirable state to cultivate to

953
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:11,099
enter our true nature, our
unconditioned nature. I think

954
01:10:11,099 --> 01:10:14,519
these insights replicate
themselves in psychedelic work

955
01:10:14,519 --> 01:10:20,279
as well, that what one
encounters that in psychedelic

956
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:24,979
work is conditioning. You're
throwing off layer and layer and

957
01:10:24,979 --> 01:10:28,399
layer and layer of conditioning,
purifying, purifying. It's like

958
01:10:28,459 --> 01:10:35,179
all one long ndrew, all one long
practice of purification to

959
01:10:35,179 --> 01:10:41,439
uncover what is already there,
but something which has been

960
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:45,039
covered over by that
conditioning. Now in

961
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:48,999
cosmological exploration, you
are going beyond what is simply

962
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:52,419
uncovering what is already
there, but that still remains

963
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:55,239
part of the one of the core
dynamics is letting go of the

964
01:10:55,239 --> 01:10:59,739
conditioning to have a deeper
experience of the clarity that's

965
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:04,199
present in the immediate
conditions of one's awakened

966
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:04,619
mind.

967
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:14,580
Tasshin Fogleman: Can you say
more about the sort of visions

968
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,460
that you had for humanity's
future and the time that we're

969
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:17,580
in?

970
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,600
Chris Bache: This was one of the
great surprises for me in there,

971
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:27,740
because I never expected
anything like this to emerge in

972
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:32,120
my work. I thought this was
about personal transformation,

973
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:37,100
or even personal enlightenment,
or something like that. I never

974
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:42,400
imagined that the evolution of
the species would become such a

975
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:48,160
dominant theme in my work. What
happened was going all the way

976
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,820
back to about halfway through
the work, back into the early

977
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:57,100
early 90s. Starting in 1991 I
began to have a series of

978
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:01,140
visions. They were just dropped
into my sessions, a series of

979
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:06,120
visions that humanity was coming
to a turning point. This was a

980
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:12,120
true before and after point in
history. This was we were

981
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,080
entering a time of intense
purification, that we were

982
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,660
basically purifying the human
psyche of the sins of our

983
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:23,900
father, so to speak, purifying
ourselves, lifting the

984
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:29,120
conditioning of the past in
order to make us more receptive

985
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:34,160
to and capable of internalizing,
spiritual infusion, spiritual

986
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:38,000
insights and power that was
coming into us, becoming made

987
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,040
available to us at This time in
history. So there was a

988
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:48,700
tremendous sense of rebirth
coming. And all of this was

989
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:54,100
contextualized within an initial
experience of experiencing

990
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:59,860
creation in terms of love, that
that the act of creation, the

991
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:05,340
Big Bang is not simply a
generative acts of power or an

992
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:10,920
act of intelligence, but it
actually is an act of love, that

993
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:17,280
creation is itself an act of
love, of cosmic love, and

994
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,200
therefore that all the suffering
which is, which takes place, has

995
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,640
taken place since the Big Bang.
All the suffering in the human

996
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,420
story in particular, all that
suffering takes place in the

997
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:33,620
context of love. This is not
something which is being done to

998
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:38,360
us. It's not something which we
are guilty we are in any way

999
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:43,060
guilty about. This is all part
of a creative process that we

1000
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:48,340
entered into voluntarily. We
entered into by choice. And it

1001
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:53,920
is hard. It's very difficult,
but it is a Noble gift that we

1002
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,060
are giving to the creative
process to participate in the

1003
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:03,360
evolution of this species at
such an early and barbaric time

1004
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,240
in its life that we do these
terrible things to each other.

1005
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:11,220
But all of this was coming to a
crescendo, a moment in history

1006
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:16,620
where we would pivot into a
higher order, a higher order of

1007
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:20,780
spiritual awareness, a higher
order of psycho spiritual

1008
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:26,840
realization. So this went on for
years, and eventually I

1009
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,160
cataloged these in the book in a
section that I call the visions

1010
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:35,240
of awakening six core visions,
and that the creative

1011
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,560
intelligence was trying not just
to awaken individuals, but it

1012
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:44,500
was trying to awaken the entire
species, but it gave me no

1013
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:49,300
insight into how it was going to
pull this off. I had no idea how

1014
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:55,300
it could possibly achieve this
type of breakthrough in human

1015
01:14:55,300 --> 01:15:03,540
evolution. And then in 1995 Of
right before Christmas in 1995 I

1016
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:09,360
had a session in which I was
taken deep into deep time. I was

1017
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:13,440
dissolved into the species so
there was no more Chris Bache, I

1018
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,700
just dissolved completely into
the species and taken into deep

1019
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:23,180
time and experienced the death
and rebirth of humanity in a

1020
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:29,420
transtemporal context. So I
experienced a time in history of

1021
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:36,440
increasing destabilization of
two of chaos and tumultuous

1022
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:41,860
unraveling. The systems of life
were being unraveled. There

1023
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:46,660
seemed to be wave after wave of
ecological crises that

1024
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:50,740
eventually triggered a global
systems crisis, a period of

1025
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:55,120
breakdown of structures at
deeper and deeper levels, an

1026
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:00,900
unraveling of life. We were
losing control of life. We were,

1027
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:04,860
it wasn't. We couldn't, kind of
fix our way out of this. This

1028
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:09,300
was a profound shattering of
life as we had known it. At the

1029
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,020
core

1030
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:12,960
Unknown: and in the

1031
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,020
Chris Bache: midst of this, at
the point where it looked like

1032
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:21,020
we were all going to die, it was
as if a storm passed over the

1033
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:26,120
island like a hurricane passing
over a Pacific Island. And the

1034
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,780
winds began to subside. The
metaphorical winds began to

1035
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:35,600
subside. And the worst of the
crisis past, and we began to

1036
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,100
pick ourselves up off our knees.
And as we picked ourselves up

1037
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:44,740
off our knees and began to
rebuild and reconnect and put

1038
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:49,840
together life. On the other side
of this crisis, we were we found

1039
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,560
that we were different beings.
We were not the same as we had

1040
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,280
been when we went into this
crisis. There's something that

1041
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:02,340
happens in this multi
generational crisis, and I don't

1042
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:06,060
have beyond what I've said. I
don't have any details of when,

1043
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:10,320
where or how. It wasn't that
kind of experience. It was the

1044
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:14,880
fact that humanity was coming
into a profound crisis at a

1045
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:21,800
global level, a global systems
crisis, that something about

1046
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:26,060
this transformation would break
through the deep layers of

1047
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:31,040
conditioning of the human heart,
would tear away all the self

1048
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,060
centered behaviors, not only of
individuals, but of our culture,

1049
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:39,740
would just break us down. And
when we moved through this

1050
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:45,640
crisis, we discovered values
inside our being. We discovered

1051
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:49,840
new values, new insights, new
ways of being in the world, new

1052
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,580
ways of being with each other.
This wasn't simply the birth of

1053
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:59,080
an ecologically responsible
civilization. It wasn't simply a

1054
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:03,720
cultural rebirth, but it
literally represented a shift in

1055
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:09,540
the core structure of the human
psyche. This was a shift in the

1056
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:16,620
plate tectonics of the
collective psyche that, anyway,

1057
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:21,740
that was the vision of it. And I
think that the if, in my

1058
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:25,760
experience, does I examine what
the nature of this future human

1059
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:30,920
is? What is this future human
that's so much more than the

1060
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,700
present human is? What is it?
And I think it is the emergence

1061
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:38,180
of the diamond soul and history.
I think that we have been

1062
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,980
growing the diamond soul,
gestating the diamond soul for

1063
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:45,580
incarnation after incarnation
for 10s of 1000s of years,

1064
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:50,800
hundreds of 1000s of years. But
the birth of the diamond soul in

1065
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,240
history is a relatively short,
traumatic, convulsive period.

1066
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:59,980
Gestation is long. Birth is
short. I think we are entering a

1067
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:04,500
time in history where we can no
longer afford the luxury of a

1068
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:09,660
planet run by egos, even well
intentioned egos. We have to

1069
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:14,760
grow up. We have to grow into a
deeper, our deeper spiritual

1070
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,420
identity. And that deeper
spiritual identity is the

1071
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:22,460
diamond stole, or the soul, or
however you want to language

1072
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:26,900
this, we need to grow up. And I
think that we have entered this

1073
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:31,100
crisis, this beginning, the
very, very early stages of an

1074
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:35,720
unraveling of life as we have
known it, and we are going into

1075
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,840
a future. And I think it's
really important to have a

1076
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,640
vision. That's why, at the end
of the book, I really focus on

1077
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,780
the visions that I was given of
the future human. Because if we

1078
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:50,620
don't have an understanding of
what's going on, if we don't

1079
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:55,540
have a vision of what nature is
in the process of producing,

1080
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,480
then the pain will be so intense
we could survive. Come to

1081
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:06,900
despair and some terrible
apocalyptic interpretation that

1082
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:11,580
would be very counter our
survival, and I think we need to

1083
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:15,900
have a deep understanding where
nature is taking us.

1084
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,540
Tasshin Fogleman: How does this
phrase that use diamond soul

1085
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:24,440
relate to the diamond Luminosity
that you began to experience in

1086
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,420
your own sessions. Is it the
same thing or something

1087
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:26,840
different?

1088
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:32,300
Chris Bache: I think it's a
variation of the same thing, the

1089
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:37,280
diamond Luminosity I
experienced, I believe, to be a

1090
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:43,000
level of reality in the cosmos.
I mean, in Buddhist terminology,

1091
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:47,560
I would describe it as an extra
samsaric reality, which means

1092
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,620
it's beyond cyclic existence,
which means it's beyond the

1093
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:53,560
Bardo. There are many, many,
many layers of the Bardo.

1094
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:57,700
There's the low animal hell
realms, there's the high deity

1095
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:01,440
realms, but the diamond
Luminosity is beyond all of

1096
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:07,260
those. And there is a clear
sensation, a phenomenological

1097
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:11,040
difference between experiencing
the high deity realms and then

1098
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,580
moving into the diamond
Luminosity realms, which is

1099
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:17,820
beyond all deities, beyond
archetypes, beyond any of this

1100
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:26,840
dimension. Now, when the soul
congealed in my being and the

1101
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:32,060
diamond Luminosity, the soul
exploded from my chest. It had

1102
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:38,900
that same quality of light as
the diamond Luminosity, but a

1103
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:46,720
slightly lower intensity of that
light. Now let me back up. We

1104
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,540
experience light many times in
the psychedelic journey. It's

1105
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:54,040
very common. When you go through
ego death, you enter light. You

1106
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:57,160
encounter when you enter
collective dimensions, you

1107
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,620
experience dimensions of light.
I had known light many times the

1108
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:06,060
diamond Luminosity is not simply
using a fancy metaphor to

1109
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:10,140
describe this light. I learned
that there are many degrees of

1110
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:13,560
light. There are many dimensions
of light, and the diamond

1111
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,920
Luminosity is an exceptionally
pure, exceptionally clear

1112
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:23,600
dimension of light. I think the
diamond soul, as an assay light

1113
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:31,040
being is a manifestation of this
quality of light inside

1114
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:36,920
individuated existence. So it's,
on the one hand, it's the same,

1115
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:41,500
and on the other hand, it's a
variation on the same. I

1116
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:45,580
wouldn't want to say it's
necessarily identical, but it

1117
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:50,920
seems to be very, very close. I
will say that when I entered the

1118
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:56,140
diamond Luminosity work over
five years, basically, I only

1119
01:22:56,140 --> 01:23:00,660
entered what I call the diamond
Luminosity four times, and I

1120
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:06,300
entered it about once a year for
four years. So I would do it

1121
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,200
very intense purification for
session after session, I would

1122
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:14,100
tap into the diamond Luminosity.
Then I would be brought back for

1123
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,060
another year, very, very intense
purification before being

1124
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:23,000
brought back into the diamond
Luminosity again. So it wasn't

1125
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,100
like accessing it easily and
ever once gained access, I only

1126
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:32,540
touched that reality four times
in its total purity,

1127
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,700
Tasshin Fogleman: from the way
you're describing I'm getting a

1128
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:44,560
sense of almost like, you know,
the scientific name for humanity

1129
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,800
currently is, like Homo sapiens,
and almost like a different kind

1130
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,500
of humanity. Like, I don't know
the Latin term for Diamond, but

1131
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:54,100
like diamond human, or something
like that is, is that consistent

1132
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:54,880
with what you're saying?

1133
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,760
Chris Bache: It is, people give
it different names. Some people

1134
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:03,420
call it Homo noeticus, a knowing
humanity, homo spiritualis. Some

1135
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:08,460
people call it homo luminance, a
light humanity. I think many of

1136
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:12,000
us have this intuition that
humanity is going into a next

1137
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,380
iteration. You know, there was a
time about 100,000 years ago

1138
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:20,780
where the size of our brain
basically increased 50% I mean,

1139
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:23,600
in a very short period of time,
suddenly we were dealing with a

1140
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:29,000
much larger brain. Nature
triggered it decided to give us

1141
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,020
a bigger brain that we came in
with larger equipment, something

1142
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:36,500
like that is happening now. We
are cooperating with an

1143
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:40,660
evolutionary process, but we are
we are not driving the process.

1144
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:44,140
Nature is driving this process.
Nature is bringing us into this

1145
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:48,220
new condition. And we have many
people have this intuition. Many

1146
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:52,600
indigenous cultures have this
intuition of this time of global

1147
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,620
crisis followed by breakthrough,
and there's no absolute

1148
01:24:56,620 --> 01:25:00,780
certainty you know that we will
survive birth. Is the dangerous

1149
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:06,120
time. Not all fetuses survive
the birth process. So it's not

1150
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:10,740
like this is a foregone
conclusion, but so many beings

1151
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:14,760
have had this intuition, and
they they bring different names

1152
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:20,600
for describing this future
human. Hmm,

1153
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,520
Tasshin Fogleman: there's a term
that you borrow from Grof of

1154
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:34,760
COEX systems, and then you
describe meta Coex systems. And

1155
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,300
I think a lot of what you're
talking about seems related to

1156
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,840
that. I wonder if you could
verbally describe what those are

1157
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,820
and and explain those a little
bit.

1158
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:50,020
Chris Bache: What Stan found is
that the psyche organizes its

1159
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:54,460
experiences. It organizes its
memories in terms of clusters,

1160
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:59,980
thematically integrated
clusters, so that it if it takes

1161
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:04,740
all of our experiences of
abandonment, and all of those

1162
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:07,920
experiences that we've had
around abandonment form one

1163
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,600
tight experiential cluster,
which he calls a Coex system, or

1164
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,380
a system of condensed
experience. Carl Jung called it

1165
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:20,900
a complex we could have,
experiences around anger,

1166
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:26,180
experiences around fear,
experiences around unrequited

1167
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:30,380
love that they basically it's
kind of like reading a novel,

1168
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:33,740
taking all the emotions that
take place in the novel,

1169
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:38,180
highlighting with different
colors, cutting up the novel and

1170
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:41,680
taking all the green in one ball
and all The yellow and another

1171
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:46,420
ball and all the red and another
ball. That when we encounter a

1172
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:52,180
problem in the psyche, we don't
simply encounter one form of

1173
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:58,180
that problem. We encounter a
cluster of experiences that date

1174
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:02,160
back, sometimes all the way into
our birth experience, and

1175
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:06,600
sometimes including former
lives. But we when we melt this

1176
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,380
problem, we melt it in layers.
We first we melt the outside

1177
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:13,620
layers, the less problematic
until we eventually get to the

1178
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:17,760
very, very core. What was the
seed problem? Which may date

1179
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,480
from this lifetime, may date
from birth, may date from a

1180
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:26,480
former lifetime, and we dissolve
this cluster, this COIC system.

1181
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:30,860
Now my experience has been that
the same is true for the

1182
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:34,820
collective psyche, that the mind
of the universe and the mind of

1183
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:41,200
our species stores its history
in these massive thematic

1184
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:46,600
clusters. So all the trauma
associated with war, all the

1185
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:53,140
trauma of drought and dying in
the plains, all the trauma of

1186
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:59,620
male female violence, all these
patterns of violence and pain

1187
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:04,080
and suffering, fear of death,
that these don't exist as free

1188
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,860
floating private existences,
private memories within the

1189
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,480
Bardo of our individual souls,
but the collective psyche

1190
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:16,680
aggregates its history into
these massive collective

1191
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:21,860
structures that I call metacoic
systems. So you have co

1192
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:25,700
existence within the personal
psyche and metacoag systems

1193
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:30,200
within the collective psyche. I
think when I was moved into the

1194
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:35,960
ocean of suffering, what was
happening was my system was

1195
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:41,260
engaging metacoic systems within
the collective psyche, and

1196
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:45,700
making some small contribution
to removing those clusters from

1197
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:50,920
the collective psyche, not all
of them, certainly not any of

1198
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:56,020
one all the way down. This is a
work of generations and all

1199
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,380
spiritual traditions, the saints
and sages and contemplatives

1200
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:05,820
have the same experience. They
all tap into levels of suffering

1201
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,780
which are not personal, which go
deeper. And that's why

1202
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,960
bodhichitta, manifesting the
will to save all sentient beings

1203
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:19,740
is the only appropriate
motivation for doing spiritual

1204
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:23,540
practice. Because you quickly
realize that this is a game

1205
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:27,320
that's not a personal game, it's
not a private game. We're in

1206
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:32,120
this together. It's a collective
evolutionary process. So for me,

1207
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:38,300
that engages medical systems.
What?

1208
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,940
Tasshin Fogleman: What is this
species aiming at, as you

1209
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:43,540
understand

1210
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:50,380
Chris Bache: it, oh, I think we
are. We are, I don't know that

1211
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:54,760
we can really identify aiming
at, but we are constantly

1212
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:59,440
growing. We are, if anything, we
are aiming at growing. Because

1213
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,480
if we. Think that if we identify
what we're growing to what we're

1214
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:07,380
really doing is only identifying
the next stage of our

1215
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,960
evolutionary growing, but if we
just look around, it's taken us

1216
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,000
13 point 7 billion years to get
to here. And assuming we survive

1217
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,980
this crisis, we're going to be
at it for millions and billions

1218
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:25,820
of years more so whatever this
crisis is that humanity is

1219
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:30,440
coming into and growing beyond,
to grow beyond ego, to grow

1220
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:35,540
beyond the narrow confines of
our self centered self clinging,

1221
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:41,440
to go into a larger sense of our
being and presence in the

1222
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:45,280
universe and communion with the
universe. This is just the next

1223
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:49,660
phase, and we will have more
thresholds and more challenges

1224
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:53,320
that will take us into yet
another phase. So if I step back

1225
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:56,740
from all of that and I say, what
is happening here? What is the

1226
01:30:56,740 --> 01:31:01,140
project? I think the project is
to grow and become more than we

1227
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:05,880
were before. It's a process
description, it's not a it's not

1228
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,480
a content description, it's a
process description, just to

1229
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:14,220
grow and become more than we
were, to be more capable. Now, I

1230
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:19,560
think another aspect of this,
just on the short term, all the

1231
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,820
spiritual teachings teach us
that the essence of the

1232
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:27,620
individual is the same as the
essence of the totality. Atman

1233
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:31,940
is Brahman. We are made of the
stuff of the Divine if we speak

1234
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:36,560
of it in divine languages. Or
our Buddha nature, our awakened

1235
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,980
nature, is the same as the
Buddha nature of all living

1236
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:49,960
things, of all things. So when
one awakens to one's essential

1237
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:56,680
nature, you're awakening to the
love and the compassion and the

1238
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:01,800
power that created the universe,
that manifests the universe. And

1239
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:05,520
that there are many stages to
this process, but first there is

1240
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,140
the joy of awakening to that,
but then there is the process of

1241
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:17,400
learning how to actualize that,
so that one's life becomes a

1242
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:22,520
conscious manifestation of the
power of our essential nature

1243
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:26,540
manifesting in the physical
world. And I don't, I really

1244
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:30,380
don't want to reduce this to
such simplistic philosophies

1245
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:34,460
like you become like what you
love and and as you think is

1246
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:37,940
what becomes your destiny, but
something basically that

1247
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:44,320
recognizes that the experience,
what the experiences that come

1248
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,280
at us in the outer world are in
some core way of reflection of

1249
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:52,480
what is coming out of us at a
deep psycho spiritual level. And

1250
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,480
that once you understand that
there is this feedback process

1251
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,900
between what we are putting out
and what is coming back to us,

1252
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:03,240
and you take responsibility for
that process, then you begin to

1253
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:09,360
consciously manifest your chosen
destiny, rather than inherit a

1254
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:14,280
destiny which has been created
by your unconscious process. So

1255
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:18,000
that we are becoming at this
stage, I think conscious

1256
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:24,560
creators of our own destiny, we
wake up and we become we're

1257
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:30,140
basically learning how to become
creators, because our nature is

1258
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,800
the creative principle. Our
Nature is the same as the nature

1259
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:37,820
which manifested the entire
physical universe. So what we're

1260
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:43,240
learning how to do is first
discover and then actualize, and

1261
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:50,260
then participate consciously in
creation, inside time and space,

1262
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:58,120
what we do with that, where we
take that as a species? You

1263
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:04,080
know, just imagine what we can
do a species operating out of

1264
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,820
that kind of consciousness.

1265
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:09,960
Tasshin Fogleman: Yeah, I'm
getting the sense, you know,

1266
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:12,900
coming back to the question I
asked earlier about, like, what

1267
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:16,380
is maybe incomplete about
Buddhism or other earlier

1268
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:20,660
teachings. And, you know, there
the sensibility that I at least

1269
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:25,400
received was like, you know,
existence is a cycle of birth

1270
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:29,660
and death that is, in some ways,
sort of like hellish, and you

1271
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:32,900
should just escape. And that's
the goal is to escape and get

1272
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:38,780
out. And from what I'm hearing
from you, it's almost as if both

1273
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:42,700
on individual and collective
levels, the aim isn't to escape,

1274
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:49,360
but to learn and grow and evolve
and have incompre increased

1275
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:53,140
complexity and nuance and
understanding of oneself and the

1276
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:57,280
universe, and really to manifest
that rather than just like

1277
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,740
getting out or eradicating this
or something like that.

1278
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:03,240
Chris Bache: Yeah. Yeah, yes, I
think so. And in the end, once

1279
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,300
we make this transition, we
understand that what we have

1280
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:11,220
escaped is not time and space,
but we've escaped a certain

1281
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:16,740
mental consciousness associated
a constricted consciousness

1282
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:21,320
that's associated with our
living inside time and space,

1283
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:26,300
but when that bubble pops, when
we have truly escaped that small

1284
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:31,280
world, we experience time and
space completely differently. We

1285
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:35,420
experience time and space as the
Buddha world, as the Buddha

1286
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:35,960
nature.

1287
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,620
Tasshin Fogleman: If you don't
mind me asking, what is your

1288
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:46,120
everyday consciousness like now
after all of these experiences

1289
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,980
and explorations?

1290
01:35:48,339 --> 01:35:51,279
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, I wish
I could tell you that I'm a

1291
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:55,059
fully enlightened being, and I
just cruise in the cosmic planes

1292
01:35:55,059 --> 01:36:02,219
all the time, but that's not the
case, integrating in my

1293
01:36:02,699 --> 01:36:08,819
integrating these experiences is
a lifelong undertaking, in fact,

1294
01:36:08,819 --> 01:36:13,019
and the more I'm thinking about
it in the 20 years after I

1295
01:36:13,019 --> 01:36:19,859
stopped this work, the more I
appreciate just how Large the

1296
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:24,379
integration process is even to
the point that I really, I don't

1297
01:36:24,379 --> 01:36:29,059
really think we know how
entering these deep levels of

1298
01:36:29,059 --> 01:36:34,699
reality is is influencing us as
human beings. I think we're just

1299
01:36:34,699 --> 01:36:41,319
scratching the surface if we're
working in therapeutic work, and

1300
01:36:41,319 --> 01:36:44,979
if we're bringing out issues
from the personal unconscious,

1301
01:36:45,339 --> 01:36:49,839
then we have a model for how to
integrate those experiences. If

1302
01:36:49,839 --> 01:36:53,739
we go deeper and have spiritual
experiences of the intelligence

1303
01:36:53,739 --> 01:36:57,759
that runs through all of life,
we have spiritual models for how

1304
01:36:57,759 --> 01:37:01,139
we might integrate those
experiences. But when we go

1305
01:37:01,139 --> 01:37:05,639
really, really deep, when we go
beyond space and time, when we

1306
01:37:05,699 --> 01:37:11,639
enter deep, dissolve into the
luminous body of creation, how

1307
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:15,839
are those experiences being
integrated in us? Then in the

1308
01:37:15,839 --> 01:37:20,479
end, I don't think you can
integrate the infinite into the

1309
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:24,739
finite The only thing you can do
is integrate your finite

1310
01:37:24,739 --> 01:37:29,839
existence into infinity. And
that brings us back to the nuts

1311
01:37:29,839 --> 01:37:34,339
and bolts of spiritual practice.
You must remove from your being

1312
01:37:34,819 --> 01:37:38,779
everything which keeps smaller
than the reality that you are

1313
01:37:38,779 --> 01:37:44,799
seeking to enter into and that's
a that's a lifelong undertaking.

1314
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:50,499
I used to think that maybe by
the end of my lifetime, maybe I

1315
01:37:50,499 --> 01:37:53,379
would have succeeded in
integrating all of these

1316
01:37:53,379 --> 01:37:58,359
experiences. Now I think that
that's too optimistic. I think

1317
01:37:58,419 --> 01:38:03,839
this work changed not only my
present lifetime, but it changed

1318
01:38:03,839 --> 01:38:08,699
the trajectory of my entire
soul's evolution. I also want to

1319
01:38:08,699 --> 01:38:14,939
say that I've kind of come to
the conclusion that I pushed

1320
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:18,419
myself harder and farther on
this work than was really

1321
01:38:18,419 --> 01:38:23,299
probably wise for me. I think
that it is possible to go too

1322
01:38:23,299 --> 01:38:29,179
deep in one lifetime. And it's
not that the suffering is

1323
01:38:29,179 --> 01:38:32,119
problematic. It's not that the
pain that's inherent in

1324
01:38:32,299 --> 01:38:36,439
purifying it there's very, very
deep levels is problematic. It's

1325
01:38:36,499 --> 01:38:42,339
the joy. It's the ecstasy. It's
being dissolved, the ecstasy of

1326
01:38:42,339 --> 01:38:49,779
being dissolved into unspeakable
beauty and intelligence, which

1327
01:38:49,899 --> 01:38:54,999
can make your physical existence
kind of feel dried up like not

1328
01:38:54,999 --> 01:39:00,479
worth living. And I think I have
suffered from that after

1329
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:04,619
stopping my work, I've really
had to make conscious choices

1330
01:39:04,619 --> 01:39:09,179
and lifestyle choices, how to
manage the memories that now

1331
01:39:09,179 --> 01:39:13,679
live within me in a way that I
don't think it's necessarily

1332
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:18,299
it's not something I don't
recommend to people. It's a very

1333
01:39:18,299 --> 01:39:22,999
demanding process, and I don't
think I needed to do it this

1334
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:26,899
way. If I were starting it over
again, I would be gentler. I

1335
01:39:26,899 --> 01:39:32,479
would have gentler ambitions and
a gentler take more care of this

1336
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:33,859
precious body mind.

1337
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:36,860
Tasshin Fogleman: What would
that look like, practically? To

1338
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:37,400
be gentler,

1339
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:42,700
Chris Bache: I think it would
mean fewer high dose sessions.

1340
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:46,900
It would mean, if you're working
with psychedelics, it would mean

1341
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:51,520
integrating, working with a
substance like LSD, which tends

1342
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,540
to push the high cosmological
ceiling with substances like

1343
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:59,260
Psilocybin or Ayahuasca, which
tend to be more body grounded,

1344
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:03,780
kind of staying. Closer to the
emotional, textured body. Of

1345
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:07,740
course, it always means
integrating your intermittent

1346
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:12,900
psychedelic work with daily
spiritual practice. The more

1347
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,960
I've moved in this direction,
the more I've come to understand

1348
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:20,340
that the daily spiritual
practice is absolutely essential

1349
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,200
in order to handle the enormous
swings of energy and insight

1350
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:29,360
that open to you in your
psychedelic work, but I would

1351
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:32,420
just be I would be gentler. I
mean, one of the reasons I

1352
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:37,100
pushed as hard as I did is
because I had adopted what I

1353
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:41,440
learned to be as a false model.
I had adopted a vision that said

1354
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:45,400
the purpose of this work was to
reach a particular state, you

1355
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:52,480
know, to reach the condition of
awakened state, or to reach, to

1356
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:57,640
reach home, to go home, to reach
heaven, to reach to dissolve

1357
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:01,500
into the into the body of God,
to dissolve into the meta,

1358
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:06,660
cosmic void. And what I found
was that there are many degrees

1359
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:11,160
of oneness, and there are many
degrees even of the void. And no

1360
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:14,580
matter how deep I went, I
discovered that there were

1361
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:18,780
dimensions beyond even those
dimensions. And the key came for

1362
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:22,220
me in the 50th session, when I
was in the diamond Luminosity, I

1363
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:25,460
was as deep in the diamond
Luminosity as I would ever go.

1364
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:30,740
And right in the middle of that
existence, my field opened up,

1365
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:35,120
and I saw reality far, far into
the distance that was filled

1366
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:38,300
with a light that was even a
greater form of light than the

1367
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:42,520
diamond Luminosity. And a beam
of flight came and hit me and

1368
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:46,660
absolutely shattered my mind.
And that's when I realized it's

1369
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:50,980
an infinite progression. You
never the idea of getting to the

1370
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:55,060
end of it is just a false idea.
It's underestimates the breadth

1371
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:59,320
of what we're dealing with. So
once I I understood that is not

1372
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:03,300
about getting to a particular
condition or a particular state

1373
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:07,440
that made me more patient, or
makes me more patients with you,

1374
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:11,640
open up, you bring as much of
that reality into your life as

1375
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:16,320
you can, and then you you crunch
it, you sit on it, you you

1376
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:20,600
integrate it into your daily
life. And so I be gentler and

1377
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:25,940
have more modest expectations.
I'm more patient with our human

1378
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:29,360
psycho spiritual evolution than
I was when I was a young man.

1379
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:34,160
Tasshin Fogleman: What would you
recommend to someone embarking

1380
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:36,920
on a similar journey if they
were inspired by your work,

1381
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:41,860
Chris Bache: don't do it,
please. Honestly, I mean, don't

1382
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:45,100
do it the way I did it. I'm and,
you know, I get lots of letters

1383
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,580
from people who have said, I've
never done psychedelics, but I

1384
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:51,400
know what you're speaking about.
I've been doing a meditation for

1385
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:55,840
empty of years, and I've had
these kinds of experiences. And

1386
01:42:55,900 --> 01:43:00,400
so we know that psychedelics are
not unique to these experiences

1387
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:06,240
at all, but my recommendation
is, go slow. Always work within

1388
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:10,380
a therapeutic modality. Pay a
lot of attention to your set and

1389
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:13,620
setting, not only on the day of
your sessions, but when you do

1390
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:18,180
this work, everyone around you
is impacted, your family

1391
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:21,380
members, your friends. I found
that my students were being

1392
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:24,980
drawn into my psychedelic
practice, and that I wrote the

1393
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:30,980
living classroom basically to
describe, quite to my surprise,

1394
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:36,320
how what I had thought of as a
purely private spiritual

1395
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:39,800
practice was actually
registering and impacting the

1396
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:43,000
lives of My students who are
taking my courses in this time,

1397
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:48,880
and that this is a natural a
natural event that consciousness

1398
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,720
is like water in a lake. You
throw in a rock and the ripples

1399
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:56,740
naturally spread out, that this
is true spiritual practice as

1400
01:43:56,740 --> 01:44:00,392
well. It's just natural that
people would be touched by those

1401
01:44:00,392 --> 01:44:11,372
experiences. So I would be
gentler. Again. I don't know why

1402
01:44:11,372 --> 01:44:15,572
somebody would want to go to the
North Pole, but it's not a

1403
01:44:15,572 --> 01:44:19,352
recreational undertaking. It's a
serious, lifelong commitment,

1404
01:44:19,892 --> 01:44:25,040
and I think it's much wiser
simply to explore closer to home

1405
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:32,300
in ways that keeps the journey
more focused on the nuts and

1406
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:36,080
bolts of one's daily life. So I
have more respect for using

1407
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:40,900
psychedelics as therapy and a
spiritual awakening, and it's a

1408
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:46,300
relatively rare individual who
has the circumstances and the

1409
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:52,000
Constitution to go this as deep
as I did into it, and I want to

1410
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:56,320
there are dangers, right? If you
open up under less than ideal

1411
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:00,600
circumstances, if you open up in
circumstances. Which you are

1412
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:04,500
mixing it up with other people,
or at dance raves, you can open

1413
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:08,760
up prematurely, you and you can
failure. You can have failure to

1414
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:13,080
close you can hurt yourself. You
can really hurt yourself in ways

1415
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:16,620
that does long term damage and
may take you years to recover.

1416
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:22,160
So I I want to emphasize that
this is not an end run around

1417
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:26,720
traditional spirituality. It's
not a and it's not an easy path.

1418
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:31,640
It's a tricky path, and it is a
potentially dangerous path, and

1419
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:35,720
you have to be very cautious
when you are working with mind

1420
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:36,920
amplifiers.

1421
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,260
Tasshin Fogleman: I imagine the
kind of person drawn to doing

1422
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:44,920
the work that you did wouldn't
take your advice to not do it.

1423
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:48,040
They might take your advice to
be gentler, but I imagine they

1424
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:50,860
would be sort of bullish about
it and be like, I'm going to do

1425
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:51,340
it anyway.

1426
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:56,380
Chris Bache: Well, you know, one
of the things I hope is that by

1427
01:45:56,380 --> 01:46:00,280
seeing what I learned, by seeing
the description of the universe

1428
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:04,320
that I was able to bring back
and share with other people, I

1429
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:08,460
hope that that would answer or
satisfy a certain existential

1430
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:12,360
longing to know these things so
that they don't have to go

1431
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:16,080
there. You know that they that
they can be more comfortable

1432
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:24,140
living within a more textured,
or more inwardly, closer to

1433
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:26,900
Earth, textured form of
spiritual practice that they

1434
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:31,100
don't, you don't, you know, when
people went to the moon, it

1435
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:35,120
satisfied so many of us who have
had that longing, but who will

1436
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:38,900
never make the trip just to see
their pictures and see what it

1437
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,620
was like. And I think it's
something can be like that with

1438
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:44,200
spiritual practice too. Yeah.

1439
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,480
Tasshin Fogleman: Oh, that's a
good metaphor for it. I think

1440
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,840
that certainly describes my own
experience reading your book.

1441
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:54,040
And I'm grateful for sort of the
oh, I don't remember what they

1442
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:56,680
call it, but the picture of the
earth that they took from the

1443
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:59,440
moon, it's as if you took that
kind of a picture for us, and

1444
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:03,600
it's a really beautiful one,
Earth rise. I think maybe it's

1445
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:10,020
called Earth rise, yeah, I'm
curious, what do you make of,

1446
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:15,240
you know, at this time, there's
sort of a larger contemporary

1447
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:18,000
Renaissance, you might say, in
psychedelics. What do you make

1448
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,780
of that movement, and what's
happening there? More broadly,

1449
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,980
Chris Bache: I think it's very
exciting, and I think it's about

1450
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:29,000
time. I'm very glad that we're
going back in the direction of

1451
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,380
integrating psychedelics into
our culture. Right now, the

1452
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:37,880
psychedelic Renaissance is
focused on therapeutic healing.

1453
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:41,440
It's by demonstrating the
clinical effectiveness of these

1454
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:45,520
amplifying substances, that we
are opening the door to these

1455
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,600
substances in our culture by
demonstrating that they help us

1456
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:53,320
deal with Post Traumatic Stress,
depression or alcohol addiction

1457
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:58,660
or death anxiety, by healing us
of the wounds of life. We are

1458
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:01,920
demonstrating that these
substances have therapeutic

1459
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,880
value and therapeutic efficacy.
And we're also taking pictures

1460
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:08,700
of how the brains behave on
psychedelics, and we're doing

1461
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:12,600
this very carefully control
studies, where we have control

1462
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:16,020
groups versus a testing group,
and so on so forth. This is all

1463
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:20,040
really important. I think it's
it's a very important stage, but

1464
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:28,640
I do see it as only a stage.
What we're going to find is the

1465
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,880
same thing we found in the early
decades of the psychedelic

1466
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:37,940
movement, that these this
amplification of the of the

1467
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:42,520
psyche, which allows us to heal
the wounds of the personal

1468
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:48,760
psyche. That same amplification,
when continued, gets us gives us

1469
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:52,720
access to deeper and deeper
dimensions of consciousness.

1470
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:56,200
Now, there is a resistance to
these deeper dimensions right

1471
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:59,920
now, because of our metaphysical
commitment to materialism, right

1472
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:04,740
our course, you know, pre
quantum commitment is to believe

1473
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:08,400
that only things which are
physical are real. And

1474
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:11,400
therefore, when someone is
having an experience of

1475
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:15,360
something which goes beyond
physical reality, we call the

1476
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:18,840
substances that open up these
experiences hallucinogens,

1477
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,800
because the hallucination is
something which is not real,

1478
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:25,580
right? It feels real, but it's
not real. But I think what

1479
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:30,260
better understood these
substances are mind amplifiers.

1480
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:34,280
They are psychedelics, mind
openers. And this, once we

1481
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:39,740
consolidate and provide
sufficient evidence for the

1482
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:43,420
healing potential of these
substances, we will then begin

1483
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:47,080
to harness the deeper
manifesting potential of these

1484
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:51,160
substances, or their
philosophical potential. I think

1485
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:54,340
psychedelics represent an
enormous philosophical

1486
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:59,500
revolution, because they allow
those of us to or kind of have

1487
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:04,740
modest. Capacities to have
temporary access to whose states

1488
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:07,620
of awareness and states of
reality that lie far beyond

1489
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:14,160
space time, awareness that has
profound metaphysical

1490
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:18,360
implications, profound
philosophical implications we

1491
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:22,400
can have access. I mean, a
mystical experience does not a

1492
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:26,000
mystic make, and that's what
basically paraphrasing Huston

1493
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,560
Smith, and that's true, but a
mystical experience does a

1494
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:36,200
materialist unmake, and I think
it can undo some of the

1495
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,740
metaphysical constrictions of
our era and open us up to a

1496
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:43,360
deeper understanding of what's
actually taking place. Once you

1497
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:47,320
dissolve into the intelligence
of the universe, the

1498
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:50,200
intelligence of the mind of the
universe, and into the

1499
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:54,520
compassionate center of the mind
of the universe, it radically

1500
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:58,840
transforms your understanding of
what life is about, what we are

1501
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:03,300
doing here, what the process is
and that has enormous

1502
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:06,660
ramifications, and I think we
will be moving in that

1503
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:11,040
direction, but first we have to
earn the right in a way. We have

1504
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:14,460
to earn that access through
demonstrating its clinical

1505
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:18,480
effect efficacy. I am not a
clinician. I'm not a

1506
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:24,320
psychologist. I was not
primarily interested in healing.

1507
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:28,760
I was trained as a philosopher
of religion, and I simply could

1508
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:32,600
not wait for us to get to this
point in time. If I had waited

1509
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:36,260
for us to get to this point in
time, I would have missed the

1510
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:42,520
opportunity of a lifetime. So I
did the work I did underground,

1511
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:47,080
undercover, privately, quietly.
I wish I didn't have to. I wish

1512
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:49,840
I could have done it publicly. I
wish I could have been in public

1513
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:55,960
discussion during all this time.
But I did it with the belief, as

1514
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:59,860
the early researchers did, that
there would come a time when we

1515
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:04,140
would reclaim these sacraments,
and that we would begin to

1516
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:07,680
systematically harness their
deeper potential. And I think

1517
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:10,800
that's where we're going. There
is a movement among the

1518
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,740
pharmaceutical industry that
wants to make money off these

1519
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:17,760
substances, to try to strip the
magic out of the mushrooms, you

1520
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:23,240
know, to basically extract
substances which come from the

1521
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:27,080
psychedelic substances, but do
not induce some of the more

1522
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:32,180
exotic or demanding states of
consciousness that these

1523
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:35,600
substances do in their natural
state. So that they can give us

1524
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,480
a pill which you can take every
day, and they can sell us every

1525
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:42,580
day. And because psychedelics,
you can't make money on

1526
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:45,460
psychedelics because you don't
use enough of them. You know,

1527
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:48,460
you only use them
intermittently, and the healing

1528
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:51,760
effect is so powerful that you
don't need to take them every

1529
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:55,660
day, right? The pharmaceutical
industry wants to make money off

1530
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:58,900
of them, and I think that's a
danger, and that's where we have

1531
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:02,940
to really watch that. I also
think the medicalization of

1532
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:06,960
psychedelics is also a danger.
It's understandable that it's

1533
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:10,500
important for the scientists to
maintain research in these early

1534
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:14,820
years, but I think entering into
these states of consciousness is

1535
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:20,600
a human right, and I don't think
it belongs. It doesn't belong

1536
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:25,280
under the governance of the
medical community only. I think

1537
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:28,220
we're going to come into a point
where we recognize that there is

1538
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:31,520
a broader community of
specialists who are skilled in

1539
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:36,020
navigating these landscapes, who
are not necessarily MDS and

1540
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:37,100
PhDs.

1541
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:45,160
Tasshin Fogleman: You know, in
the movement, there's various

1542
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:49,660
organizations that have formed
to be structured around what you

1543
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:52,840
call, sort of the therapeutic
use of psychedelics. And I

1544
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:57,820
wonder if in the future, there
might be institutions structured

1545
01:53:57,820 --> 01:54:01,140
around the more philosophical or
cosmological explorations of the

1546
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:04,260
kind that you did, what you
imagine those might look like.

1547
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:09,480
Chris Bache: I think it's just a
matter of time. I think there

1548
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:13,860
will be, in the near future,
there will be clinics,

1549
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:18,960
institutional settings,
hopefully deep in nature,

1550
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:24,620
settings where people who want
to explore the deeper dimensions

1551
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:28,220
of their consciousness can go
and do so under careful

1552
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:34,280
supervision. They can do so
safely. There is backup, but

1553
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:40,720
they can do it in a non clinical
or non medical set of

1554
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:44,920
expectations. It's kind of like
the transition from taking birth

1555
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:50,380
out of the hospitals into
turning it over to the midwives,

1556
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:55,360
where you have medical care
nearby if you need it. But birth

1557
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:59,500
is not a medical procedure.
Birth is an entirely natural

1558
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:03,300
procedure. Procedure, likewise,
opening up into deep levels of

1559
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:07,020
your online and the mind of the
universe is not a medical

1560
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:10,680
procedure, even if medical
medicine can be very helpful in

1561
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:14,100
the early stages. So I would
anticipate that there will be

1562
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:18,000
organizations. There will be
structures, places where you can

1563
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,980
go to work with sacred
medicines, various psychedelics

1564
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:27,860
in a safe and effective manner,
which go beyond therapeutic

1565
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:30,740
healing is, I think it's just a
matter of time.

1566
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,380
Tasshin Fogleman: What kind of
affordances might those

1567
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:37,760
structures need that might be
different from a more like

1568
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:41,980
clinical or medical treatment?
Therapeutic usage.

1569
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:47,080
Chris Bache: Well, first, we
should recognize that humanity

1570
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:51,220
has already been doing this for
1000s of years, that there are

1571
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:55,240
in among the indigenous people,
among the First Nations peoples,

1572
01:55:55,540 --> 01:56:02,160
among the in America, among the
indigenous peoples in Brazil or

1573
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:07,140
in South America, they've been
working ceremonially with sacred

1574
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:13,020
substances for hundreds, 1000s
of years. So we we have a great

1575
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:16,800
deal of historical precedent for
how to do this, how to open up

1576
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:21,560
not only individuals, but whole
communities into sacred space

1577
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:24,980
and bring the entire community
back and put them through a

1578
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:28,460
series of exercises so that they
come back, grounded, really

1579
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:33,200
well, grounded into their
physical lives. We're not

1580
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:36,440
reinventing the wheel here. We
really have much to learn from

1581
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:39,800
indigenous people and First
Nations people on how to work

1582
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:44,500
with these substances. Now there
are screening criteria. You

1583
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:47,680
really want to screen people who
are going into these states.

1584
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:51,040
There are some people who really
should not be entering into

1585
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:55,420
these states, either because of
physical health problems that

1586
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:58,300
they're carrying or
psychological problems that

1587
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:02,880
they're carrying. It's just not
a wise procedure to adopt if

1588
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,480
you're carrying certain tensions
within your body and mind. So

1589
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:09,840
there is a place for screening.
But the cultures, these

1590
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:13,200
indigenous cultures, they knew
that they screened it, even

1591
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:17,460
though they didn't have MD
screening the process. So it's

1592
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:22,160
simply a matter of building on
what we're doing, incorporating

1593
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:27,020
the collected wisdom from
indigenous cultures and moving

1594
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:29,120
in to create our own unique
forms,

1595
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:36,080
Tasshin Fogleman: coming back to
the sort of vision for humanity

1596
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:40,100
writ large. Do you have any
advice for the coming

1597
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:40,840
generations?

1598
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:50,200
Chris Bache: Well, the first
thing I would say is that I

1599
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:53,440
think we know enough about the
universe through reincarnation.

1600
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:56,320
If you really do your homework
and you really look at the data,

1601
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:59,740
if you look at the data from
near death episode research, if

1602
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:03,060
you look at that of out of body
research, we know enough, just

1603
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:09,000
enough, to know that we choose
our incarnations. Before we were

1604
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,560
born, we made an informed choice
of the life that we were being

1605
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:20,220
born into. So at a time when we
knew more than we remember now,

1606
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:24,320
we made the choice to live the
life that we're living now, not

1607
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:27,620
that we could see every detail,
but we the fundamental core

1608
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:31,820
components we could see before
we were born. And that means

1609
01:58:32,180 --> 01:58:36,200
that whether or not we have
conscious recall of that choice,

1610
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:41,020
I think we have reasons to be
confident that we are where we

1611
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:45,820
belong as we enter this time in
history that all of us, every

1612
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:51,280
one of us, has volunteered to
participate in this very, very

1613
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:54,700
challenging time. So that's the
first level, is to be kind of

1614
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:58,840
centered in your core and
knowing that you don't have to

1615
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:02,100
run around and you don't have to
go someplace else or do

1616
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:06,000
something else that you were
already planting yourself on a

1617
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:11,700
trajectory that allows you to
participate in this process. And

1618
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:15,600
this process is the process of
the transformation of an entire

1619
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:21,140
culture. It's going there is not
one person or one type of

1620
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:25,940
person, or a healer or therapist
or artist that's going to make

1621
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:30,260
this transition work. It's going
to take all of us. It's going to

1622
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:34,280
take all the skills that
humanity has to make this work.

1623
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:41,920
The real question is, I think,
not, how do we how do we do? How

1624
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:45,400
do we engage this process
meaningfully so we can help us

1625
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:51,100
transform the real question is,
do we have the courage to do,

1626
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:56,860
which we know we can do? What is
at hand? Do we have the courage

1627
01:59:56,860 --> 02:00:00,180
to really enter into this
process consciously? Do. And

1628
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:05,700
that means we basically have to
have the courage to become the

1629
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:10,020
future human that we know the
world needs. We need to become

1630
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:14,400
the human that the world needs
in order to survive this crisis.

1631
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,940
We need to become more
compassionate. We need to work

1632
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:22,280
to create a culture which is
more egalitarian, more fair,

1633
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:26,780
more just. We need to show
greater respect to the Earth and

1634
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:31,100
to our the animal cousins who
live on this earth with us. We

1635
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:36,800
need to basically become in our
own personal lives what humanity

1636
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:42,340
is trying to forge in our
collective life, more where, and

1637
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:45,580
that means doing inward
practice. It also means doing

1638
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:49,720
outward practice of social
transformation, clearing our own

1639
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:53,560
hearts of anything which keeps
us small and helping clean out

1640
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:57,160
those things in our culture
which keeps our culture small

1641
02:00:57,160 --> 02:01:01,440
and focused on values which
you're destroying the earth.

1642
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:06,840
Tasshin Fogleman: Thank you for
sharing that, and also for

1643
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:10,620
answering all my questions and
speaking on so many topics. I

1644
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:14,460
wonder if there's anything else
that you'd like to say or talk

1645
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:20,120
about I you.

1646
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:36,140
Chris Bache: We are coming into
a hard time in history. We're

1647
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:39,800
coming into a time when decade
by decade, things are going to

1648
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:43,480
be getting worse and worse,
there will be tremendous social

1649
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:47,620
anxiety and personal anxiety as
we basically inherit the

1650
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:52,480
consequences of our abuse of the
earth for all the hundreds of

1651
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:56,680
years that we've been Creating
this extractive economy,

1652
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:00,360
Unknown: but I hope

1653
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:05,580
Chris Bache: in everybody's own
individual spiritual practices,

1654
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:08,700
one encounters enough of the
universe to experience the

1655
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:14,280
profound wisdom, the great
intelligence that's behind this

1656
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:19,620
moment of transformation and the
great compassion and love that's

1657
02:02:19,620 --> 02:02:25,520
behind this time in our history
that this is not we are not

1658
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:29,600
victims. This is not an
accident. It is a time that

1659
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,480
calls for us to become the
heroes that we have the

1660
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:36,260
possibility of being, that we
really nothing less than deep,

1661
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:41,860
deep heroic sacrifice and
actualization is called for. But

1662
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:45,820
the universe will support us.
Every time we make a change to

1663
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:49,660
live to the larger good, the
universe will support us. It

1664
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:57,040
will. It will help us overcome
our shortcomings. This is, this

1665
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:01,320
is the game of life. This is the
great time of our life. In the

1666
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:06,000
end, we don't want to live a
comfortable life so much as we

1667
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,660
want to live a life that's
meaningful, and this is going to

1668
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:13,200
give us all an opportunity to
live very meaningful lives.

1669
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:18,180
Tasshin Fogleman: I appreciate
you putting that in perspective

1670
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:21,200
and speaking so clearly about
it. So thank you for that, and

1671
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:24,200
thank you as well for your time
today. It's been a real pleasure

1672
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:24,920
to speak with you.

1673
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:28,400
Chris Bache: Tazim, thank you
for this conversation. Thank you

1674
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:31,340
for the conversations you've
been having with many people,

1675
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:37,520
all focused on helping us know
more and become more that we

1676
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:39,920
have the possibility of
becoming. Thank you.

1677
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,100
Tasshin Fogleman: You're so
welcome. It's a it's an honor

1678
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,920
and a privilege. So thank you.
Mm.

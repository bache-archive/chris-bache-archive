00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,160
welcome to what is going on for
new thought from the edge of OM

4
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,020
each week on om time's flagship
radio show, veteran broadcaster,

5
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,100
author and media consultant,
Sandy sedgebear conducts thought

6
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,840
provoking interviews with
inspirational authors, artists,

7
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,460
musicians, scientists, speakers
and filmmakers who are working

8
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,300
at the point where spirituality
and science meet consciousness

9
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,040
at the very edge of OM here is
your host, Sandy sedgebear,

10
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,520
Sandy Sedgbeer: hello throughout
the years that I've been

11
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,820
conducting interviews on
science, consciousness and

12
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,280
spirituality, I've read numerous
mind shifting books and heard

13
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,040
goodness knows how many extra
ordinary stories, but the story

14
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,500
you're going to hear today is so
Far beyond remarkable that I've

15
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,700
struggled to find words to
adequately describe it. All I

16
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,360
can say by way of introduction
is that what you're about to

17
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,120
hear is a story that I didn't
know until I read it, that I and

18
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,680
no doubt countless millions of
seekers have been waiting for

19
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,380
our entire lives. Christopher
embeche is professor emeritus in

20
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,920
the Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at Youngstown

21
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,840
State University, where he
taught for 33 years, a fellow at

22
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,620
the Institute of Noetic
Sciences. He is also adjunct

23
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,080
faculty at the California
Institute of integral studies

24
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,060
and on the advisory board for
Grof Transpersonal training and

25
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,500
the Grof Foundation, an award
winning teacher and

26
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,360
international speaker, Chris
Bache joins me now to discuss

27
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,740
his book LSD and the mind of the
universe. Diamonds from heaven,

28
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,880
which has been held as a
gripping account of an utterly

29
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,400
unique and extra ordinary hero's
journey that opens our minds and

30
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,980
hearts to a new vision of our
universe and ourselves as

31
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,160
inseparable from the ineffable
being that we have called God.

32
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,780
Chris Bache, welcome,

33
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,380
Chris Bache: hi, Sandy. It's a
pleasure to be here with you

34
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,920
today.

35
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,620
Sandy Sedgbeer: This is a long
awaited interview, I have to

36
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,560
say. Chris so little background,
in 1979 you took the first step

37
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,720
on a life changing journey to
explore your mind and the mind

38
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
of the universe as deeply and
systematically as possible, with

39
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,760
the help of LSD, if you had
known then that it would take 20

40
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,900
years of excruciating pain,
suffering, bliss and intense

41
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,100
purification, plus many more
years of digesting, processing,

42
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,660
organizing and writing to
publish this book, would you

43
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,820
still have put yourself through
it?

44
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,440
Chris Bache: That's a good
question. I'm not sure that I

45
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,840
would. I think knowing now what
i If I had known then what I

46
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,620
know now, I would have been
gentler on myself. I would have

47
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,380
used in a gentler protocol,
balancing high versus low doses,

48
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,780
balancing LSD with Psilocybin
and Ayahuasca, I still would

49
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,980
have taken the journey, but it
might not have been as taken as

50
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,380
aggressively as I did.

51
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,320
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, yeah.
Well, knowing the outcome, you

52
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,100
can't really say No, I wouldn't
have done it. So you experienced

53
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,320
73 high dose LSD sessions
following protocols established

54
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,340
by Stanislav Grof with the
intention of engaging hyper

55
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,440
intensive states in a way that
would allow the initial chaos at

56
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,660
each new level to clear and also
allow your own biophysical and

57
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:10,200
psychological systems to adapt.
How did you know the precise

58
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,980
dosage to accomplish that in the
way that you wanted to

59
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,080
Chris Bache: well, Stan was very
clear in his early books and in

60
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,900
LSD psychotherapy. It was
published in 1980 the protocol

61
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,560
differences between psychedelic
and low dose therapy versus

62
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,000
psychedelic high dose therapy,
psyche lytic running doses

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,900
anywhere 50 150 micrograms and
high dose psychedelic therapy in

64
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:46,480
four to 503 50 to 500 and at
that time, high dose psychedelic

65
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,760
therapy was being worked used at
Spring Grove Hospital in

66
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,960
Baltimore, and they were trying
to basically trigger something

67
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,140
approximating a Near-Death
Experience for people who were

68
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,460
dying, they Were terminal
patients and trying to give them

69
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,760
a glimpse of where they were
going. And I thought, well, if

70
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,600
you could do this work three
times safely, then you could do

71
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,520
it more than three times safely.
And I chose to work with high

72
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,600
doses of LSD for a couple of
reasons. One, I I had a false

73
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,940
model of of what the project
was. The model I had was a model

74
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,700
of personal transformation. I
thought this was about my

75
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,220
personal healing, my personal
spiritual awakening. That turned

76
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,780
out to be an incomplete,
profoundly incomplete model. And

77
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,420
I was thinking that, you know
spiritual awakening is about

78
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,040
clearing your karma. Our karma
ultimately is finite, and by

79
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,960
working with high doses, I would
basically being it was. I knew

80
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,020
it would be more difficult work,
but I thought of myself as

81
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,900
basically biting off my karma
and larger bites and clearing it

82
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,800
faster. Turns out that that's a
false model. Personal

83
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,720
Transformation was too small to
describe it, and the doses I

84
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,180
took from the literature, I
basically wanted to push my

85
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,740
system as hard as I could to be
efficient. I mean, I was in a

86
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,840
dual career marriage. Getting
time for these sessions was very

87
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,860
complicated. Had to balance a
lot of schedules, and I wanted

88
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,960
to get as much done in every
session as I could. Again, what

89
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,420
I learned on along the way is,
because consciousness is unified

90
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,560
at its source, that when you
hyper stimulate consciousness,

91
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,700
you're not just hyper
stimulating your personal field

92
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,600
of consciousness, you're hyper
stimulating some portion of the

93
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,460
unified field of consciousness,
and therefore the dynamics that

94
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,660
get activated, the dynamics of
healing and purification and

95
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,380
illumination, are much, much
larger than. Then personal

96
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,280
dynamics.

97
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,820
Sandy Sedgbeer: At what point
did you realize this, this

98
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,700
wasn't going to be a personal
journey at all, that there was

99
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,560
so much more going on.

100
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,760
Chris Bache: Well, for about the
first two and a half years, it

101
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,840
looked it followed very much the
material that Stan Grof had been

102
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,400
tracking. My first two and a
half years of work were very

103
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,800
much perinatal in nature, going
through the Death-Rebirth

104
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,480
process, experiencing, really
experiencing one's birth,

105
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,320
experiencing a profound
confrontation with death and the

106
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,760
meaninglessness of existence.
But then i This culminated in a

107
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,800
crushing ego death experience
and a liberating ego death

108
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,440
experience. And then, according
to Stan's early descriptions,

109
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,360
what I was expecting after going
through ego death, access to

110
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,620
Transpersonal reality would get
easier. But what happened in my

111
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:03,180
sessions is that I began to go
through the periods of vast

112
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,640
suffering that got deeper and
deeper and larger, terrible

113
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,440
suffering and pain, not
personal, collective, opening up

114
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,300
to the suffering of 1000s and
hundreds of 1000s of people and

115
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,180
1000s of years of time. And at
first I thought this represented

116
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,320
a deepening of ego death, but it
went on for so long and it

117
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,820
involves so many people, that
eventually I had no alternative

118
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,860
to but to come to the conclusion
that what was being healed or

119
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,040
transformed in this process was
not my personal psyche, but some

120
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,180
aspect of the collective psyche
of humanity that just as

121
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,080
personal trauma gets
internalized in our personal

122
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,300
psyche and can produce
pathology, likewise, the vast

123
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,040
quantities of trauma that
humanity has absorbed through

124
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,260
history gets collected and
internalized in the collective

125
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,760
psyche and produces a kind of
Social Pathology at the

126
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,900
collective level. And something
was using my sessions to

127
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:19,800
basically address and heal to
some degree, this collective

128
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,300
trauma.

129
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,140
Sandy Sedgbeer: So there didn't
seem to be anything random about

130
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,980
this journey, because sometimes
you didn't have a session for

131
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,880
long periods, even years, but
when you went back, you always

132
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,320
seem to, you know, catch up
where you were the time before.

133
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,980
Chris Bache: Yeah, that was my
sense of it, too, that I was

134
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,200
engaging a long and sustained
conversation, communion,

135
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,760
initiation, with a larger
consciousness. And the size and

136
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,840
scale of this consciousness kept
deepening and changing as my

137
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,040
work continued and it I always
felt myself engaging in

138
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,660
intelligence. When this is most
dramatic, perhaps this

139
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,760
continuity across time. I did
four years of work, I stopped

140
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,120
for six years, and then I
started again for another 10

141
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,460
years of work. When I stopped, I
was working on the ocean of

142
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,240
suffering material in the
purification phase of a session.

143
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,620
I was engaged in this ocean of
suffering. I stopped for six

144
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,180
years, six years later, in a
completely different time of my

145
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,800
life with different expectations
when I went into the work again,

146
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,200
the ocean of suffering started
exactly where it had stopped and

147
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,020
continued, indicating clearly
that the the intelligence that I

148
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,340
was engaging was guiding what
was happening. It was in charge

149
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,140
of my sessions, and all I did
was really open up, isolate

150
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,940
myself from the world, open up
and follow wherever it wanted to

151
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,500
take me. And I found that if I
trusted myself completely and

152
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,380
surrendered to where it would
take me, I would go through

153
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,760
these intense purification
processes or death processes.

154
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,420
Eventually it would culminate in
some type of crisis or

155
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,580
breakthrough, and then I would
be spun into ecstatic,

156
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,240
revelatory experiences for the
remainder of the session, and

157
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,720
the next session would begin the
cycle again. So I just, I

158
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,520
learned to trust that process.

159
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,240
Sandy Sedgbeer: But, but the
suffering, you know, there were,

160
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,020
I was listening to it on Audible
as well as reading the book. And

161
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,440
there were times when I was, you
know, speaking to you and

162
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,220
saying, My goodness, why are you
going back? You know, it is so

163
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,180
painful.

164
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,880
Chris Bache: You go back, not
because the, you know, I don't

165
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,380
like pain. Who likes pain for
nothing like that? You go back

166
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,680
for the joy that's waiting on
the other side of pain. You go

167
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,760
back. Right with the
understanding that this, the

168
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,900
suffering, this pain, is in some
way a purification process,

169
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,320
which I did not understand the
full scope of it at the time,

170
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,140
but I trusted Stan's work, and
it was affirmed in my work that

171
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,080
this is a purification process,
and that when you go through it,

172
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,700
then the doors open, and that's
why you do it, for the

173
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,720
revelations, for the insights,
for the visions, for the for the

174
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,120
opportunity to enter into such
deep and profound communion with

175
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,080
the universe.

176
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,260
Sandy Sedgbeer: So the suffering
is the gateway. It's a gateway.

177
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,160
Chris Bache: It's it's just a
Prana. You know, we have to let

178
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,320
go of being small in order to
enter into being large, and it's

179
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,280
not always easy to let go of
being small, but it's not just

180
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,940
let going letting go of your
personal identity. You know, we

181
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,960
in therapy, we often focus on
ego death, and many of the

182
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,880
mystical traditions focus on ego
death, but what I found was that

183
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,820
ego death was just the first of
many patterns of death and

184
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,980
rebirth, so that what one is
letting go of at deeper levels

185
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,180
of the journey is much larger,
much deeper than just egoic

186
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,160
structures. And it's such a
mystery that at the end of the

187
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,220
book, I actually have an
appendix where I ask the

188
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,780
question, what dies when you're
so far beyond ego death and yet

189
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,640
you are still having sensations
of dying, loss of control? What

190
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,000
is it that's actually dying in
that process?

191
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,900
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, yeah,
exactly. And when we listen to

192
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,560
it, you know, we can't help
asking the same question. So I

193
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,880
don't want to focus too much on
individual sessions, but there

194
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,960
was one that I really did want
to bring up, and it's actually a

195
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,300
whole collection of sessions
where you experience life as

196
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,700
many different women in turn,
what do you think was the

197
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,960
purpose of those experiences and
how did they impact you?

198
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,040
Chris Bache: Well, that was my
that was my ego death

199
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,920
experience, where the universe
after about, this is a 10th

200
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,620
session, ninth, 10th session. It
just broke me like a twig. It

201
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,700
just took my identity and
snapped it. Now I had begun the

202
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,500
day as a white Ivy League
educated philosopher,

203
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,240
passionately concerned with the
meaning of existence and the

204
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,860
universe, forced me to become
the exact opposite of that. I

205
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,260
became women. I became women of
color. I became women who were

206
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,680
not interested in the meaning of
life at all, who were not

207
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,240
educated at all, and it did not
allow me to experience I was

208
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,340
myself, but I was myself in all
these other roles, other modes.

209
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,560
And it terrified me. It just
scared the bajeebus out of me,

210
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,040
and I fought it, but eventually,
when I gave up and I

211
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,640
surrendered, and I allowed
myself to become all these

212
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,060
women, then suddenly things
shifted, and I was taken under

213
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,260
the arm of the Great Mother and
initiated into the lives of

214
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,400
Hundreds of women the more
positive side of female

215
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,380
experience, given many
experiences of women's lives,

216
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:35,480
conceiving, giving birth, loving
husbands, loving children. And I

217
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,660
think that the fundamental
message here was not reclaim

218
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,080
your former lives as women. I
know I have former lives as

219
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,160
women. That has never been a
question for me. I think the

220
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,800
issue was where you were going.
Gender does not exist. Let go.

221
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,960
So I was being taken into a
level of reality where male

222
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,140
female is irrelevant. But to do
that, I had to be broken of my

223
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,660
male identity. I had to allow
myself to go into some larger

224
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,800
identity. And becoming women was
simply just part of that

225
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,240
breaking process.

226
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,800
Sandy Sedgbeer: The whole the
whole 20 years seems to have

227
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,660
been quite a massive break in
process. I mean, you were doing

228
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,320
this. Nobody knew about it
except your wife. You weren't

229
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,900
allowed to talk about it to
anyone, or you didn't allow

230
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,000
yourself to. You were teaching
mature students philosophy. And

231
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,940
often, you know, there were
aspects of things that you were

232
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,280
teaching where your experiences
would have been the perfect

233
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,700
example to offer them, but you
couldn't do that. What was that

234
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,600
like for you?

235
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,940
Chris Bache: It wasn't so bad in
the beginning, but it got

236
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,640
increasingly difficult as I went
on, especially when I could feel

237
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,580
a question coming from students.
That had personal, deep

238
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,800
significance to them, and an
answer would spontaneously rise

239
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,020
from my person which but an
answer that was grounded in my

240
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,840
psychedelic experience, and I
couldn't. Some of them, I could

241
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,620
lay off on the Stan grofs
experiences or other psychedelic

242
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,720
research experiences, but some
of them, I couldn't lay off, and

243
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,560
I could not bring my own
psychedelic experiences forward.

244
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,960
And I began to experience a
catch in my throat. My voice

245
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,800
would actually kind of, I would
lose control for a split second,

246
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,600
and it would sound like a little
bark coming out of my voice. It

247
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,160
was embarrassing. I mean, I was
I was literally strangling on

248
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,200
what I wanted to say and was not
allowed to say, and that became

249
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,020
difficult because the cost of
doing this work I knew would be

250
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,980
my silence, and I paid that
price. But I did not realize in

251
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,420
the beginning that when you
commit to dividing your life in

252
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,580
this way, to have a daytime job
as a straight professor and then

253
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,520
a nighttime job as a Psychonaut,
that it causes fractures in your

254
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,700
psyche which reach deeper than
you may have anticipated in the

255
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,680
beginning and in the end, these
cracks were only able to be

256
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,960
healed when I finally came out
of the psychedelic closet and

257
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,700
began to allow myself to speak
openly about these experiences.

258
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,380
Sandy Sedgbeer: Most people
these days, especially in the

259
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,880
spiritual arena, are familiar
with NDAs, reincarnation,

260
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,620
channeled works that explain who
we are and where we go in the

261
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,400
afterlife, and you've taught
courses on these yourselves, but

262
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,560
your experience took you way
beyond where anyone has gone

263
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,740
before. It gave you a whole new
vision of the Bardo. Tell us a

264
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,640
bit about that.

265
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,600
Chris Bache: Well, the classic
understanding of the Bardo, I

266
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,920
think, was affirmed in my
sessions, that is, there are

267
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,720
many, many, many layers of
spiritual reality, and when we

268
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,780
die, we return to that layer
that reflects our spiritual

269
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,380
development or spiritual
maturity. And it's a, it's a,

270
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,920
it's a social domain. There,
there are other beings. There,

271
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,320
not only other incarnate beings
or discarnate beings, but there

272
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,500
are also guardians and guides
and so forth. And the basic idea

273
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,560
is, after you die, you go
through a debrief process in

274
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,100
which you process your most
recently completed life. You

275
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,880
learn what you kind of what you
did poorly, and what you did

276
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,920
very well. You go through this
process, and then you go through

277
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,200
kind of a returning to the world
of spirit, to returning home,

278
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,220
and eventually you go through
when it's time to incarnate

279
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,260
again, to the choice process of
incarnating again. And because,

280
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,360
because the evolution of the
soul is so vast and covers such

281
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,380
a wide spectrum of development,
it takes many, many, many

282
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,540
lifetimes to actualize the full
potential of a human existence.

283
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,280
And so there are many tiers of
the Bardo domain. And my

284
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:33,320
experience affirms this classic
vision. I had many experiences

285
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,540
of kind of tapping into Bardo
reality. And it's a collective

286
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,120
reality. I think the ocean of
suffering. Kind of is analogous

287
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,680
to the Buddhist concept of the
hell realm. I tapped into

288
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,020
levels, which would be analogous
to the the high deity realm in

289
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,100
the Buddhist cosmology of the
Six Lokas, of the six realms.

290
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,920
And there are also, there is a
reality that's outside the Bardo

291
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,780
when you get basically, in a
sense, graduate from the Earth

292
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,720
system, when you move beyond
that spiritual echo of time,

293
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,720
space experience, and enter into
the reality beyond all Bardo

294
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,060
existence. And that is
correlated with what I would

295
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,120
describe as the diamond
Luminosity, the domain of

296
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,380
diamond Luminosity.

297
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,020
Sandy Sedgbeer: Why do you call
it that?

298
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,160
Chris Bache: Because that's,
that's, that was the experience

299
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:40,160
one encounters light, often in
deep spiritual experiences and

300
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,560
near death experiences in
psychedelic experiences, when

301
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,860
you go through a Death-Rebirth
process, often you have the

302
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,180
sensation of being flooded with
light, encountering light. It's

303
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,660
almost a universal in the
spiritual traditions. And I had

304
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,880
experienced light at. Many forms
and many times in my practice.

305
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,320
But when I came to this advanced
stage of my work, which started

306
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,880
with the 45th session, I
encountered a light that was

307
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,480
unlike anything I had
encountered previously. It was

308
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,800
incredibly bright, incredibly
beautiful and clear. The hardest

309
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,160
thing to describe when I say
light, it's almost like it

310
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,000
becomes so refined and so
intense, it becomes invisible.

311
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,800
It's just Clear. Clear. Your
mind is just so incredibly

312
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,720
clear. And I came to understand
what the Buddhists meant when

313
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,860
they say touching this for one
second undoes 1000s of years of

314
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:51,100
living in the shadows of karma.
It is radically pure, clear, and

315
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,240
once I touched that, I wasn't
interested in exploring any of

316
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,600
the other dimensions of
spiritual reality that I had

317
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,860
encountered before, which
include collective dimensions,

318
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,280
the collective unconscious,
archetypal reality, even

319
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,080
dimensions of causal oneness.
This was something totally,

320
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,940
completely different. And in the
last five years of my work, in

321
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,240
26 sessions, which is 1/3 of my
entire journey, I only touched

322
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,780
this reality four times, okay?
And every time I touched it, it

323
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,100
would trigger more purification,
more detoxification, and a

324
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,460
year's worth of work before I
was able to come back and touch

325
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,260
it again. Wow.

326
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,860
Sandy Sedgbeer: And was that
something having touched it that

327
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,780
kept you going. You know, had
you seeking it again and again?

328
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,900
Chris Bache: Absolutely, yeah,
the last third of my work, that

329
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,820
was my agenda, was to go back,
so do whatever I needed to do to

330
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,620
go back into that reality.

331
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,680
Sandy Sedgbeer: So if I
understand this, right, and you

332
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,520
know, I haven't read a huge
amount about the Bardo, but what

333
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,780
you're saying is that there are
these different layers, if you

334
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:13,020
like, almost stages, and over
probably millennia, we gradually

335
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,460
go through them, but you went
through them, you know, in that

336
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,380
much time. You know, what kind
of effect does that have on

337
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,920
someone?

338
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,360
Chris Bache: Well, I want to be
careful here. I think what

339
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,360
happens in a psychedelic,
therapeutically focused

340
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,060
psychedelic session, or
spiritually focused psychedelic

341
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,900
session, is that you speed up
what is happening in life at a

342
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,700
slower pace in a natural
process. So reincarnation, as I

343
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,960
understand it, we are growing,
we are evolving. We die, we

344
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,400
return to soul consciousness.
We're born. We contract down

345
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,000
into egoic consciousness. We
die, we go back into soul

346
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,100
consciousness, and that we keep
this up and keep this up over

347
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,260
long periods of time, we choose
lives which challenge us,

348
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,960
stretch us, heal us, allow us to
develop new talents, new

349
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,800
capacities, to deepen the
capacities that we've started.

350
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,780
What happens, I think, in
psychedelic therapy, is that

351
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,080
that whole process is
accelerated. This is, I think

352
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,340
this is true for meditation. In
meditation, when you do long,

353
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,880
sustained retreats of
meditation, you are speeding up

354
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,280
the process that's taking place
at a slower pace in ordinary

355
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:46,300
life. And so I get you do bite
off larger pieces of personal

356
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,520
karma, but then something else
takes over. It's not about your

357
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,760
personal enlightenment. It's not
about your personal development,

358
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:01,200
your ties to the human family,
your ties to the family of life,

359
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,000
your ties to the universe
deepen, and you begin to feel a

360
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,560
sense of dance, or a sense of
engagement of this deep,

361
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:17,160
profound life process. And I
think, I think you can take it

362
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,800
too far, then is comfortable.
You can take it so deeply you

363
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,860
can, you can be dissolved so
completely into these vast flows

364
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,460
of consciousness and vast
dimensions of existence that

365
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,760
it's very hard to come back out
of them. And it's it's hard in

366
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,680
the sense that it's hard to
leave the joy. It's hard to

367
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,300
leave the clarity and the
ecstasy and come back into time

368
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,120
and space. Now that doesn't mean
because you've touched them and

369
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,360
because you've known them. It
doesn't mean that you can

370
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,320
stabilize that awareness back
inside time and space. It

371
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,160
doesn't mean. You have
accomplished what some of the

372
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,540
great spiritual teachers have
accomplished, who can abide one

373
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,020
foot in, one foot out in those
realities. I really, really

374
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,640
emphasize, this is a path of
temporary immersion. It's

375
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,540
temporary you have not just
because you've had a temporary

376
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,760
experience of oneness of life or
Transcendence, doesn't mean that

377
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,320
you are as fully developed a
spiritual being as somebody who

378
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,320
can abide in that reality. And I
all honor truly to the great

379
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,760
spiritual masters who have
abiding the capacity to abide in

380
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:47,680
that reality. So I wouldn't say
necessarily that I accomplished

381
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,720
all of those evolutionary
journeys in one lifetime, but I

382
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,140
certainly did do something
pointing in that direction.

383
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,600
Sandy Sedgbeer: But you also you
can't unknow what you know, and

384
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,800
when you come back knowing what
you know, it must be hell to,

385
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,860
you know, have to, you know,
move into a world that is so far

386
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,120
away from that that is just, you
know, falling apart on every

387
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,820
level. I mean, how do you cope
with that? It's such a

388
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,660
dichotomy.

389
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,580
Chris Bache: It is challenging.
There are mitigating processes,

390
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,560
though too, because the deeper
your experience of the

391
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:39,020
intelligence of life and the joy
of the creative intelligence in

392
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,200
manifesting existence, then you
begin to look around you, and

393
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,820
you see the universe for what it
is. The universe is the body of

394
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,100
the Divine. The body of God. The
universe is the manifestation of

395
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,720
the intelligence, of a profound
intelligence, and once you touch

396
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,800
that intelligence, I mean, we
all know what intelligence looks

397
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,000
and feels like. We recognize it
when we meet it in people. And

398
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,020
this is a cosmic intelligence
that just overwhelms you with

399
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,460
its brilliance and its wisdom
and overwhelms you with love.

400
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,080
Unlike beyond anything I had
ever known in this lifetime, and

401
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,160
I've known love in this
lifetime, this is a different

402
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,900
order of love, and once you
experience those things, then it

403
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,040
changes how you see the
universe. It changes how you see

404
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,900
life, and it also gives you a
larger horizon within which to

405
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:42,940
understand the human experience.
I mean it, I read, I adopted

406
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,840
reincarnation on the basis of
the empirical evidence. Early in

407
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,600
my career, I read Ian
Stevenson's work. I read the

408
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,340
early work on a past life
therapist, and I was convinced

409
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,860
intellectually that
reincarnation was a fact of

410
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:02,280
life, but it still takes years
to truly absorb and live into

411
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:08,400
the fabric of a universe that
pulses in a reincarnation cycle,

412
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,320
not just for the individual, but
for the entire human species. So

413
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,060
I had experiences in which I
understood my current life as a

414
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:23,720
continuity of extending from
previous lifetimes. But I also

415
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,460
had at a deeper level,
experiences of the entire human

416
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:35,120
species pulsing generation by
generation, pulsing in as a

417
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,780
reincarnation species, and that
all of our individual challenges

418
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:46,420
and our individual karma was a
fractal manifestation of this

419
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,740
larger species challenge, and
this species karma that we were

420
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:56,140
working and when you have those
experiences, you look at other

421
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,680
human beings differently. You
look at the planet differently.

422
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,540
You look at the Galaxy
differently. There is a sense of

423
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,100
deeper participation in a
mystery, which you may not

424
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,840
understand the details of, but
you can feel the joy because you

425
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,140
know the you've touched the
intelligence that's behind it,

426
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,300
and that makes it eat, that
makes it more joyful to enter

427
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,260
into it. Now, there is a sadness
that you can't sustain those

428
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,180
peak experiences. But in another
month or two, or I was doing

429
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,500
this about four or five times a
year, I would go back into this

430
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,220
reality, and not every time
necessarily, but I would go back

431
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,820
often enough that I would be
able to drink deeply again, the

432
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:49,540
full cost of how deep I went did
not really emerge until I

433
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:55,660
stopped my sessions at the end
of the journey, the universe

434
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,180
basically told me it was time to
stop, and I could feel. Feel

435
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,380
that it was time to stop, and I
stopped, but it was only then,

436
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,940
when I wasn't returning in a few
months to have another deep

437
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:16,260
communion with my beloved, that
I began to realize the true cost

438
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:22,040
of overextending, overextending
myself as deeply as I had into

439
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,560
the transcendental side of
existence.

440
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,420
Sandy Sedgbeer: Before we go to
the break, there's a one

441
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,720
question. You said that the
universe is the body of God.

442
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:33,920
What are we?

443
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,080
Chris Bache: We're part of the
universe. So we are part of the

444
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,700
body of God too. We are part of
the manifestation of the

445
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,860
intention of the universe to
create our mind, just as our

446
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:55,000
body is rooted in the quantum
reality of life and the atomic

447
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,500
reality of life and the whole
evolutionary story is built into

448
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,420
the nerves in the vascular
systems and the organs of our

449
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,540
body. So we become inseparable
from life as it is manifesting

450
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,280
in the galaxy, in the planet on
this continent. Likewise, our

451
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,660
minds are part of the creative
intelligence that's manifesting

452
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,300
existence. That's why, when we
go deep into our minds, we drop

453
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,400
down into the curse depth of our
personal mind, and we find that

454
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,900
there is no floor at the bottom
of our mind. We fall right

455
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,980
through into the mind of the
species, right through into the

456
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:43,840
mind of the universe. And when,
when you go that deep, then,

457
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,380
then the Hindu teaching, Atman
is Brahman, the essence of the

458
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,760
individual is the essence of the
totality that just becomes the

459
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,800
most natural thing in the world,
that becomes core truth, and one

460
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:06,900
of the likewise a core truth is
oneness. To Brahman is one, and

461
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,040
we are part. We are an aspect of
fractal manifestation of that

462
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,440
oneness. Once one has known that
then even when you go back to

463
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,040
paying your bills and doing the
things we do in the physical

464
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,800
world, all you have to do is
step back, and then you can re

465
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,840
appreciate these deeper truths,
which are the deeper pulsing of

466
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,360
life. We're going

467
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,500
Sandy Sedgbeer: to take a short
break now. I'm Sandy sedgebear.

468
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,040
My guest today is eminent
philosopher and theologian,

469
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,620
speaker and author, Christopher
M Bache, whose latest book, LSD

470
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:49,240
in the mind of the universe,
diamonds from heaven, which

471
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:54,700
rigorously chronicles his
intensive, systematic, 73

472
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,400
session, 20 years, psychedelic
series of journeys into a

473
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,560
unified field of consciousness
that underlies all physical

474
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,160
existence. This is completely
mind blowing, so I need a break

475
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,260
just to reset my mind so that I
can ask intelligent questions.

476
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,940
We'll be back in a few moments.
Stay tuned. Welcome back. Chris

477
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,480
Bache, you've made it quite
clear that there is an

478
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,200
evolutionary dimension to all of
this. And as you move into the

479
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,320
later chapters in the book,
where you talk about the birth

480
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:33,500
of the diamond soul, you begin
to see that we are at an

481
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,400
evolutionary cusp, and the
global systems crisis that you

482
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,180
know we're all experiencing
right now is part of that for

483
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,620
what point? What? What is the
ultimate, you know, purpose here

484
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,000
of all of this happening?

485
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,920
Chris Bache: Yeah. Well, let me
break that down into two parts,

486
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,140
the classical vision, first on
reincarnation. A few words, the

487
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,160
classical vision of
reincarnation as it's held in

488
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:10,800
most Eastern traditions, is that
you grow, you get clear, kinder,

489
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:16,920
more generous, you cultivate
deeper and better qualities, and

490
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,680
eventually You come to a
spiritual maturing where your

491
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,400
consciousness opens to the core
of your being, and you awaken to

492
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,820
the fact that the essence of
your nature is, in fact, the

493
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:33,320
essence of all nature, and that
all beings and you are sharing

494
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,540
the same nature. There's an
explosion of compassion and a

495
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,220
deep embrace of the universe and
their interpretation of what

496
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:47,080
happens next is that you are now
free to leave time and space you

497
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:54,460
in the Hindus called it Moksha
escape, to escape Samsara, and

498
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,120
this up and out cosmology. All
the religions of the Axial Age,

499
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,440
in one way or another, are all
part of. A pattern of an up and

500
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,100
out cosmology. We don't want to
be on Earth. We got here by

501
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,160
accident, and it's a veil of
tears. We want to get out of

502
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,760
here, either by salvation, our
enlightenment. We want to get

503
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,800
out of here. But that leaves
fundamentally unexplained. What

504
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,800
is the purpose of the universe?
What is the purpose of this

505
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,680
magnificent creation, and now we
have a deeper understanding of

506
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,640
the size of existence, the
magnitude of the universe. How

507
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,720
many billions of years went into
the evolving and unfolding of

508
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,860
the universe. And it just
becomes profoundly unacceptable

509
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,140
short sighted to think that the
purpose of life is to awaken to

510
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:47,560
your true nature and then escape
into nirvana or escape into some

511
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:53,140
off planet paradise. At a
critical point in my work, I had

512
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,160
the experience of all of my
former lives coming into me.

513
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,660
They were just coming in, one
right after another, and it was

514
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,560
like wrapping string, white
filament of light, white light

515
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:09,660
around a kite spool. And at a
certain point, all those lives

516
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:15,180
fused into one consciousness.
And at that point there was an

517
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,840
explosion of this diamond light
out of my chest, and I was

518
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:25,100
catapulted into a deeper state
of consciousness than I had ever

519
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,900
touched before. And I was an
individual, but an individual

520
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,460
beyond any frame of reference
that I had ever known. And this

521
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,420
is what I came to call the birth
of the diamond soul. And that

522
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,040
is, I think, that as we
incarnate over and over and over

523
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,240
and over again, sooner or later,
the soul, consciousness that we

524
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,820
return to when we die, wakes up
and manifests inside our time

525
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,500
space consciousness. We
literally the soul wakes up

526
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:03,180
inside time and space, fully
conscious 100,000 year old being

527
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,200
not 100 year old being fully
consciousness with an intuitive

528
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,820
awareness of the breath of human
relationships and an ability to

529
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,380
enter into deeper communion with
the cosmic intelligence. And at

530
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,700
that point, we don't leave at
that point, we begin to live

531
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,860
differently on the planet. And I
think the entire human species

532
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,260
is evolving into the in this
direction to this point, the

533
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,200
entire human species is evolving
into fully manifesting soul

534
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,240
consciousness. And you know,
when I say soul consciousness, I

535
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,020
don't mean separate, isolated
from each other, fully

536
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,040
transparent. Shunyata,
emptiness. Anita, no self

537
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,520
concept, all affirmed but a soul
manifesting consciousness. And

538
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,600
if you can imagine a planet of a
species filled with souls, fully

539
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,800
conscious souls, that species
would create a different life on

540
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,980
this planet than we've ever seen
before. At another point in my

541
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,840
work, later in my work, I began,
actually, over a period of about

542
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,420
four years, amidst everything
else that was going on in my

543
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:28,040
sessions, I began to have dumped
into my awareness a series of

544
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,140
visions about human evolution.
And the message was always the

545
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,160
same. We are coming to a turning
point, a point of profound

546
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,460
spiritual awakening, a before
and after in human history, that

547
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,120
it would involve tremendous
collective purification. But

548
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,200
this collective purification was
emptying out the kind of the

549
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:56,440
pains of history to lay a new
foundation for this infusion, a

550
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,400
new infusion of divine energy
that was rising up within us. It

551
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,720
was clear that, and I was given
a taste glimpses of the future

552
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,560
human. This a transformed
humanity that would emerge out

553
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,000
of this. But it never showed me
how nature was going to pull

554
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,500
this off. It never showed me how
this would would work. And then

555
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:25,160
several years later, in 1995
when I was already had already

556
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,760
transitioned to the diamond
Luminosity phase of my work. So

557
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,920
I was working at pretty advanced
places on a particular day at

558
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,060
the end of 95 when I was
expecting to be taken, hopefully

559
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,160
back into the diamond
Luminosity. Instead, it took me,

560
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,180
it dissolved me into the
species. And so Chris Bache just

561
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,740
dissolved into the human family.
And then as the human family, I

562
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:56,140
was taken into the future, into
what I call deep time. And there

563
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:02,520
I began to experience what I.
Came to understand was a death

564
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,000
and rebirth process that was
impacting the entire human

565
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,320
family, just as an individual
goes through an intense

566
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,800
Death-Rebirth process when they
do spiritual practice or

567
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,000
psychedelic practice, history
was putting the entire human

568
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,880
family into a Death-Rebirth
process. I experienced an

569
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,220
unraveling of life, a profound
loss of control. We were losing

570
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,060
control of all the ordinary
assumptions of life. There was

571
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,480
just a cascading series of
crises that were breaking us

572
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:41,260
down level by level. I was not
given any details. I wasn't

573
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:45,820
given any calendar of events,
but this was a global crisis

574
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:51,220
that seemed to be triggered by a
cascading series of ecological

575
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,180
crises. Beyond that, I wasn't
given the details, but the

576
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:01,140
whole, the whole system of life,
was coming crashing down, and

577
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,740
then, just when it was at its
worst, Just when it seemed like

578
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:10,800
we would all be dying, that this
was an extinction event, the

579
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,320
peak of the storm passed, and
things began to get easier, and

580
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,700
we began to pick ourselves up,
and we began to rebuild

581
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,880
civilization. And when we did,
our entire existence was

582
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,620
different. We were suffused with
new ideas, new things, new ways

583
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,760
of thinking, new values, new
capacities within the human

584
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,240
heart, which generated new
social relationships and new

585
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,060
social institutions, somehow
going through this profound

586
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,840
global systems crisis broke us
down, broke us open, and tapped

587
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,320
us into the universe at a deeper
level than we had ever been

588
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,940
tapped into before, so that when
we went through this crisis, we

589
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,000
were changed profoundly as a
species. And what came out of

590
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,440
this crisis was not just a new
civilization or a new economy or

591
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,600
a new industry. What came out of
it was literally a new kind of

592
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:18,180
human being that this is a shift
in the plate tectonics of the

593
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,700
collective psyche, a shift in
the fundamental core of the

594
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,300
collective psyche. Now, humanity
has been through shifts in the

595
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,260
past like this. There was a time
when we shifted and our brain

596
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,000
size increased 50% that's
enormous shift. This is

597
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,540
something like that. It's a deep
shift of the collective psyche,

598
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:44,200
so that every human being born
after this takes place, will be

599
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,700
living their individual
awareness will be alive within a

600
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,260
field of a collective awareness
which is different than the

601
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,960
field that we are in now and
today.

602
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,260
This is what I call the birth of
the future human, and I think

603
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,400
the form that the future human
will take will be the diamond

604
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:11,700
soul. We are giving birth to a
new species on this planet, a

605
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,440
species which is spiritually
awake, a species which is

606
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,040
spiritually mature, and a
species which is a soul

607
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,300
conscious species, a soul aware
species. And by that I mean

608
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,260
something beyond anything that
we've ever talked about soul

609
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,220
before. Because I think our
restrictions, our concept of

610
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,340
soul, have been restricted by
assumptions we've been making.

611
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,720
And that's why I call it the
diamond soul, to signal that

612
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,560
this is something new. This is
something different. And I think

613
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,480
our great spiritual masters, our
great saints and saviors, Jesus,

614
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,220
the Christ, the Buddhas, the
prophets, these have been giving

615
00:48:54,220 --> 00:49:00,120
us foreshadowing insights into
the nature of the being that we

616
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,840
are becoming. They are the
prototypes of the being that we

617
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,040
are all becoming. And then late
in my and even late in my

618
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,540
journey, I was taken deep into
deep time, and was given my

619
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:19,680
deepest experience of the future
human and this being is most

620
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:25,160
magnificent being just an extra,
ordinarily magnificent,

621
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:32,360
beautiful being of a vast heart,
of a mind capable of drinking in

622
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,940
deep from the creative
intelligence and a heart capable

623
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,660
of experiencing the fundamental
oneness of all of life, and a

624
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,960
being that experiences the
fundamental oneness of life

625
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,080
would never hurt another being,
not just another human being,

626
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,500
never heard another being and
such a being would build a

627
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:59,920
different world than the world
we're building now. So.

628
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,540
Sandy Sedgbeer: Should be in has
no need to evolve.

629
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,300
Chris Bache: Oh, I think this is
simply the next step in our

630
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,840
evolutionary saga. I don't know
how long it's going to take for

631
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,560
this transition to be affected.
I truly don't. I mean, I think

632
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,540
it'll be at least generations,
whether it'll be something that

633
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,660
will be accomplished in 100
years or several 100 years, I

634
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,020
don't know, but however long it
takes, let's say it took 1000

635
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,540
years, which I think is
stretching it, because I think

636
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,660
we'll be dead if we don't make
this transition sooner than

637
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,080
that, we are either going to go
extinct, I think, or we're going

638
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,280
to transition into this new
form. Extinction is a tremendous

639
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,600
accelerator of evolution, near
extinction, the threat of

640
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:48,040
extinction, whatever, however
long it takes, whatever we

641
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:53,380
become, evolution isn't going to
stop. We've been at this for

642
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,440
billions of years. We're going
we're going to be at this for

643
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,020
billions and billions of years
more. There's no telling where

644
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:05,280
we might be going next and then
next after that. So I don't see

645
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,820
it as an end point or a stopping
point. I see it as simply the

646
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:14,700
next point. And the next point
is to wake up to who what's been

647
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,020
really going on, to who we
really are, to wake up to the

648
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,280
depth and breadth of our
relationships with life itself

649
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,780
and other people and other
species, and then we continue.

650
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,140
Sandy Sedgbeer: It's been 24
years since you stopped. Do you

651
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,440
feel that you have fully
integrated all of those

652
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,400
experiences?

653
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:43,840
Chris Bache: No, I haven't. When
I finished my sessions and was

654
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:49,720
beginning the digesting process
my meditation, in my meditation,

655
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,940
the universe said to me, 20
years in, 20 years out. And I

656
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:59,380
thought, Oh, it'll take me 20
years to assimilate 20 years of

657
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,840
my journey. And as I was getting
to the end, when I was writing

658
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,640
diamonds from heaven, I thought
that was probably an optimistic

659
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,380
assessment. I think it'll take
me many lifetimes to fully

660
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,500
integrate all the gifts that
I've been given.

661
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,960
Sandy Sedgbeer: What do you
think in the light of what

662
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,200
you've told us, what you've
learned, what you've seen, we

663
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,880
most urgently need to address
now as a species,

664
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,340
Chris Bache: boy, there's so
many layers to that question. I

665
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:42,112
think first we start by taking
full responsibility for our

666
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:47,512
shadow, for engaging our side,
our shadow, and clearing any

667
00:52:47,572 --> 00:52:53,032
obstacles and blocks which are
impeding our compassion, which

668
00:52:53,032 --> 00:53:01,132
are impeding our healthy whole
psycho spiritual functioning. We

669
00:53:01,132 --> 00:53:07,020
need to reconnect and rediscover
our relationship with the

670
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:11,520
universe and our fundamental
core identity with the universe.

671
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,620
We need to overcome all these
several 1000 years now of

672
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:20,960
teaching which places humanity
at the top of the evolutionary

673
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,180
pyramid, and as being unique in
kind, and not just unique in

674
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,960
degree, but unique and kind and
superior to all other life

675
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,200
forms, and all other life forms
serve us and can be used

676
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,000
exploitively by us, all that has
to be transcended, and We have

677
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,660
to enter into a renewed
communion with the universe,

678
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:48,280
with spiritual reality and with
physical reality. I think we

679
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:53,920
need to recognize that our body
is divine, not just our mind and

680
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,000
our heart, but our body is part
of the manifestation of

681
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,120
divinity. Sri Aurobindo thought
that humanity eventually would

682
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:08,220
become so spiritually energized
that the body was sufficiently

683
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,880
psycho plastic, that the body
had the capacity to live

684
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,680
forever. He said his calculation
would was that it would take 300

685
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,020
years of spiritual practice
before we would reach the point

686
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,500
where we could set in motion the
chain reaction that would have

687
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,420
our biological body perpetually
refreshing itself as we live in

688
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,380
communion with divinity. Now I
don't know about that, but I

689
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,400
find it to be an intriguing
vision from a profound teacher

690
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,740
about the potential that we're
activating. What's important is

691
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:46,960
to realize we're we're just
children waking up in the garden

692
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,160
that's been underway, being
developed for billions of years.

693
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,120
We just are beginning to wake up
to what's going on, to who we

694
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:01,320
are, to what's happening. We
really are. Like children in the

695
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,800
in the playpen, but where I
think we're about to get out of

696
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,260
the play pen, to walk, I think
we're about to become mature

697
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,040
adults.

698
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,220
Sandy Sedgbeer: You feel that
there is an urgent need to get

699
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:23,180
psychedelics back on the table
so that their efficacy can be

700
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:29,300
proven and we can start adopting
them as a way of helping people

701
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:36,020
to, you know, heal their wounds
and hopefully evolve even more

702
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,620
quickly.

703
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,480
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think so. I
think they're very valuable

704
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,020
substance, and fortunately, we
are reclaiming them after our 40

705
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,940
year interruption, because these
are amplifiers of consciousness.

706
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:54,220
Everything hinges on how we use
those hours of amplification. If

707
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:57,700
we use those hours of
amplification carefully and

708
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:02,880
wisely, then these these
substances can help us heal the

709
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,680
wounds of life. We can go deeper
than that. These substances can

710
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,880
help us recover the insights of
our true nature, of our

711
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,080
essential nature, of our
fundamental core identity with

712
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:22,760
all other life forms. They open
up spiritual platforms within

713
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,620
us. I think that psychedelics
have a profound philosophical

714
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,260
significance. This is a
different way of doing

715
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:34,400
philosophy where we
systematically temporarily

716
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:39,680
expand our mind and then come
back and then write it down and

717
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,260
then analyze and crunch our
experiences and compare them to

718
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:49,300
other people's experiences. One
person's experiences are never

719
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,920
important by themselves. It's
when we get many, many people's

720
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,760
experiences and put them all on
the table together and begin to

721
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,500
find out where the common ground
is. What are the common themes

722
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,580
that emerge? That's where we
begin to develop a truly

723
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,860
trustable epistemology, a
trustable set of insights into

724
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,640
what's going on. So I think
these are enormously valuable.

725
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:18,600
They have to be used very
carefully. They should be used

726
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,060
with great respect. When one
amplifies one's consciousness,

727
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,600
the dirt comes out of the
system. And if you're not

728
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,480
prepared to meet that dirt, or
you open up under wrong

729
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,080
circumstances, it can be
terrifying. You can do dangerous

730
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:37,340
things, but if you've taken all
the precautions and you open up

731
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:41,500
under the right circumstances,
there is nothing that comes out

732
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:47,140
that can't be beneficial if you
face it with courage and with

733
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:52,000
grounding and with skill. And I
think we are, we are now

734
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,720
training the next generation of
psychedelic therapists. We are

735
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,800
training people to help other
people use these substances

736
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,700
beneficially.

737
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,900
Sandy Sedgbeer: Well, of course,
you know, back in the 60s, there

738
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,580
was a move. A lot of people were
involved in doing experiments

739
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,880
with these to find out how they
could be useful to humanity, and

740
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,800
they got shut down. Are you
hopeful that this time we will

741
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,840
be able to move forward with
this and find the benefits and

742
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,720
allow people to benefit.

743
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:27,200
Chris Bache: I hope so. That
seems to be where we're going.

744
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,740
The psychedelic Renaissance is
really focused on personal

745
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:35,420
healing and by treating the
conditions that are generated by

746
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,840
modern culture, post traumatic
stress disorder, depression,

747
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:46,180
addiction, death anxiety, we're
using scientific methodologies

748
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:50,560
and carefully frame studies in
order to document the beneficial

749
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:54,880
effect of these substances. Now,
once we do that, once we

750
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,680
establish them and bring them
back as legitimate subjects for

751
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,580
discussion in scientific and
just educated society. Then I

752
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:09,540
think we'll be going into the
next second and third levels,

753
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,140
where we'll begin to realize
that these capacities, these

754
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:17,100
substances, not only heal, have
the capacity to heal, but they

755
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,620
have the capacity to reveal, to
open, to illumine now

756
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,680
civilizations have known
Indigenous peoples have known

757
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:31,100
this for millennia. Ayahuasca is
used in South America going back

758
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:36,680
at least 1500 years. Peyote,
Mescaline mushrooms, indigenous

759
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,620
people have been using these
substances to open up spiritual

760
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:47,380
communion. For millennia, we're
catching up, and so therefore

761
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:52,180
the indigenous people really are
our teachers and how to use

762
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,800
these substances wisely.

763
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,560
Sandy Sedgbeer: Do you ever
wonder why you Why did you have

764
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,580
this? Experience and not someone
else.

765
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,600
Chris Bache: Well, first, many
people have used these

766
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,080
substances wisely and have had
these and types of these

767
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,300
experiences. So I'm just a
representative of a whole social

768
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:24,980
movement, and maybe I pushed the
edge harder than most, and maybe

769
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:30,380
I because of my training, maybe
I wrote it down and and analyzed

770
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:34,460
it and kind of worked out the
details more than most. But I

771
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,300
don't see myself as unique in
any way. I see myself as part of

772
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:43,600
a social movement. When I got
out of graduate school and I met

773
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,200
Stan grofs work, as soon as I
met his work, I said I knew this

774
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,260
was my work. This was my
calling. It was just it woke up

775
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:55,960
inside why that was the case.
Eventually, it really came back

776
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:00,360
to decisions that were made when
I was in the Bardo before I

777
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:05,040
incarnated what my soul's work
was going to be, and my soul's

778
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,020
work really was very much around
education and very much around

779
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,460
healing, but not
psychotherapeutic healing one on

780
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,260
one, but really engaging healing
at a very deep collective level.

781
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,360
And I think that there are many,
many people working at this

782
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,960
level. I think there are many
hidden saints working to bring

783
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,080
about the birth of the huge
human I think there are many

784
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,980
Bodhisattvas in the world. Some
of them are recognized and most

785
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:38,000
of them are not recognized. But
who really are they invest their

786
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,760
life in bringing about the
transformation of the lives of

787
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,020
others, of helping others and
helping us make it through this

788
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:51,220
crisis of that we are entering
into, the global systems crisis,

789
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,940
the ecological crisis. Is it
bearing down on us? It's going

790
01:01:54,940 --> 01:02:00,660
to take all of us, I think all
of us chose, to be here at the

791
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,260
time and the form that we
incarnated. I think there are no

792
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:09,060
victims. There are no there is
no compulsion and reincarnation.

793
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:14,100
We all chose to enter this time
in history. We we may not

794
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,420
remember why, but we chose to be
here. We chose to be part of

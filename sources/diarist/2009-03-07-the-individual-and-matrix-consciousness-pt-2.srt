1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,720
Chris Bache: I think that we
have for several 1000 years,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,340
been on a journey which has been
potentiating individuality and

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,280
all the patriarchal religions,
the whole masculine focus has

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,580
been, as it were, a decided
potentiation of the individual,

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,820
even to the point of asserting
the survival of the soul for the

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,700
reward. You know, the soul lives
forever and ever in heaven or

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,520
hell based upon the quality of
choices of the that the

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,880
individual makes. It's an
enormous potentiation of

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,860
individuals, at the great cost,
of course, of tearing the

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,740
individual free of the matrix of
life. Now we seem to be moving

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,760
into a new direction, where
we're recontextualizing the

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,280
stupendous accomplishment of the
fully empowered individual.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,600
We're recontextualizing that
individual within the subtler

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,860
matrix of what Buddhism
sometimes called the Buddha

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,520
womb, or the matrix
consciousness, the Source

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,440
consciousness, so that what was
previously an unconscious

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,400
relationship of embeddedness is
now becoming a conscious

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,160
relationship of embedded the ego
can get frightened, because the

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,540
ego thinking that its
individuality requires

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,520
separation and unchanging Self,
and that's usually the two

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,840
concepts that go along with
self, is that the self has to be

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,740
separate And it's unchanging.
Neither of those are really true

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,140
that you there is an actual
higher form of individuality

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,780
that emerges and is compatible
with the condition of

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,100
interpenetration, not
separability, and the condition

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,480
of perpetual change, not
unchanging. And I think that's

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,300
really what Buddhism wanted to
deny when it went with the

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,400
option of anata no self, what it
was fundamentally denying was

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,460
separability and unchanging
Self. It rejected those in lieu

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,920
of a concept of self which is
dynamic and is interpenetrating,

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,900
and that, I think, is where we
are moving, evolutionary so that

32
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,980
we have an individuality of a
true self, reflective

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,000
consciousness, potentiated over
hundreds and 1000s of

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,020
incarnations, increasingly
potentiated self, directive,

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,120
self, emergent, self, learning,
self creating, but

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,160
contextualized within a matrix
that supports and is nourished

37
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,080
by that process. It truly does
support it. It is, it is the

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,520
mother matrix which births this
individual genius, and it is

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,040
nourished by the learning of the
individual genius. And that's a

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:10,380
long way from the board. Yeah,
absolutely, that's great. And I

41
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,640
think that, you know, that's the
larger issue behind, you know,

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,000
the fundamental challenge of the
21st Century that we're pushing

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,220
towards, I think, is towards a
global consciousness, you know,

44
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,500
global citizenship, which
mediates between all the various

45
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,280
divisions and nationalism and
factions and religionism of the

46
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:40,840
of history into into a much More
complex, not boundaryless, but

47
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,720
to some degree, boundaryless
condition which doesn't

48
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,340
suffocate individuality, but
definitely recontextualizes it

49
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,560
in a different with a different
force.

50
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:56,259
xcite83: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
What do you see as sort of the

51
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,200
ultimate applicability of this
group wisdom or collective

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
wisdom potential that's
emerging. So what do you see

53
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,380
that as

54
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,360
Chris Bache: I have a lot of
energy around that question,

55
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,820
right? Because it has very far
reaching implications from

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:22,100
everything from Think Tank the
phenomena think tanks and

57
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,380
dynamics for augmenting
creativity, for enhancing

58
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,080
creativity, all the way to
understanding of a new context

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,460
for understanding some of the
dynamics of social and cultural

60
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,080
evolution And psycho spiritual
evolution. So I think, for

61
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,140
example, I think of an
individual, a person, as, from a

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,820
reincarnational perspective, as
a living walking group, all

63
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,520
right, and so they the more
lifetimes a person has

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,480
experienced, the more likely it
is that they're going to. Have

65
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,160
kind of more intelligence, more
to show, more empathy, more

66
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,760
understanding, more skills of
various things. But in a sense,

67
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,280
they are a living community of
themselves. When you have a

68
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,720
group of people come together,
if, if you're coming together,

69
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,740
either for spiritual purposes or
for social discussion or for

70
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,600
research purposes or think tank
purposes. What this suggests is,

71
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,080
if you can harmonize yourselves
psychologically, socially and

72
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,140
even physiologically, you can
augment, you can stimulate and

73
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,180
augment your own functioning by
by augmenting a group

74
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,960
consciousness, a group mind,
which can have an uplifting and

75
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,680
animating and creativity
enhancing effect on the

76
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,060
individual minds of those
present. And this, I think, has

77
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,960
significant implications for how
we go about learning at a more

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,800
pedestrian level, and how we go
about creating new knowledge at

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,360
a collective level. It also has
profound ramifications for

80
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,020
understanding some of the social
dynamics involved if we have if

81
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,520
we have a classroom context, and
this would generalize out to the

82
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,560
culture at large, which is
highly divisive, then we don't

83
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,780
have this kind of intelligence,
enhancing empathy, enhancing

84
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,760
effect of a unified field,
drawing us into a higher state

85
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,000
of sensitivity, a higher state
of knowing if we do have a

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,720
congealed group, if we have a
good social process for

87
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,200
congealing a group, then we
actually stimulate, I believe, a

88
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,800
more potent form of knowing, a
more potent kind of discovery,

89
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,680
because the group mind is like a
more powerful transceiver that

90
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,960
connects the individuals to the
divine mind, so to speak, even

91
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
to the point where we are
clearly at a certain

92
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,480
evolutionary impasse. We need to
break through certain barriers

93
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,600
in order to intellectual
barriers, in order to solve

94
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:27,380
certain major technological
questions and that we have come

95
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,220
to in physics, in in the
sciences which are really

96
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,520
important for environmental
purposes, cold fusion, number of

97
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,680
important unified Field Theory,
I think we're looking at here,

98
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,640
at a planet which, if the planet
continues to be fragmented,

99
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:57,820
politically, racially, gender,
even fragmented in terms of in

100
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,760
terms of speciesism, then that
condition of collective

101
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:09,960
fragmentation is preventing a
potentiation of our individual

102
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,920
genius. Where on the
alternative, if we move towards

103
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,940
greater integration, greater
social cohesion, greater

104
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,320
inclusiveness in medical care,
for example, towards political

105
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,900
democracy, so on, so forth, then
that would have the cumulative

106
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,160
effect of potential literally
potentiating the performance of

107
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,960
our individual minds and and
therefore making it easier for

108
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,020
us to Have the breakthroughs
that would have profound

109
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,540
implications in technology, as
well as the humanities and the

110
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,880
arts, but I'm thinking
particularly of the sciences,

111
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,980
where we have a sense that we're
really up against some Real,

112
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:03,360
major barriers for solving some
of the technologies that we need

113
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,080
to solve for to really get a
grip on some of the

114
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,940
environmental issues we're
dealing with. So I think to

115
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,840
understand the non local quality
of mind has profound social

116
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,560
implications once we begin to
understand that how our mind

117
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,320
functions, not only how
comfortable it is with itself,

118
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,040
but how creative it is, how
imaginative it is, is not simply

119
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,740
a function of the individual
health, the health of my

120
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,220
individual mind, but is a
function of the health of our

121
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,380
collective mind, then we have a
vested interest in the health of

122
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,000
our collective mind, and we have
a vested interest in the health

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,900
of a in a healthy society, in a
healthy culture, in a healthy

124
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,780
globe. To serve that end, cannot
but have a rebounding effect, an

125
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,860
uplifting effect on our
individual well. Being directly,

126
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,760
not indirectly, and not by
virtue of not because of virtue,

127
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,960
but directly because of Morphic
resonance, because of the nature

128
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,860
of mind itself. I.

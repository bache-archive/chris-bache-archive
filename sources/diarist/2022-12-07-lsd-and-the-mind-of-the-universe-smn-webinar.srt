1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,300
David Lorimer: A warm welcome,
everybody. I'm tuning in here

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,420
from the Cathar area of South
West France. As many of you will

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,920
know, my name is David Larimer.
I'm the Program Director of the

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,880
scientific and medical network.
So Chris, Chris, I've known

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,680
Chris for a long time, and he's
he taught for 33 years at the

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,340
Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at Youngstown

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,540
State University, and is also
connected with the CIS

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,720
California Institute of integral
studies and Noetic Sciences, and

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,720
he's an advisor to the Grof
legacy training, which I'm also

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,260
involved in. And he said he
writes here that his passion has

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,780
been the study and the
philosophical implications of

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,840
Non-ordinary states of
consciousness, particularly

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,420
psychedelic states. And I'd like
to add a plug, as it were, for

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,680
his book that isn't on this
particular theme, the living

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,100
classroom, an exploration of
collective fields of

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,240
consciousness and teaching. And
this is particularly fascinating

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,740
in terms of the synchronicities
that seem to arise in Chris's

18
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,560
teaching with his students, and
he may refer to that in passing.

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,300
So his two books that I've read
and reviewed, this is the

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,380
initial one here, Dark Knight,
early door, and I think that's

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,380
exactly where we are
collectively at the moment. And

22
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,040
then his book, prize winning
book, LSD, in the mind of the

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,960
universe. And many of you will
have read his article in the

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,700
current issue of paradigm
Explorer. So Chris, I'm really

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,060
looking forward to this
presentation. Very warm welcome

26
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,660
from us, and we can't wait to
hear what you have to say.

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,140
Chris Bache: Thank you, David,
let me shift into screen

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,880
sharing, if I can do this
correctly. Good. Okay. Well,

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,240
thank you David, and thank you
everybody. It's an honor and a

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,320
pleasure to be here with you
tonight, and I really look

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,160
forward to sharing with you the
experiences that I'm reporting

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,380
in this book, LSD and the mind
of the universe. Now David has

33
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,800
framed our conversation this
evening as a question of whether

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,480
we can all participate, all
access the cosmic mind, I'm

35
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,100
assuming, using psychedelics.
Well, I believe that we all can,

36
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,960
but whether we all should is
another matter entirely. In

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,760
contrast to the early idea that
psychedelics represent a

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,740
shortcut to mystical experience.
My concern is that the

39
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,640
psychedelic journey into the
Cosmic Mind is extremely

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,000
demanding and must be approached
with great care and caution. In

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,620
LSD, in the mind of the
universe, I try to describe as

42
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,600
clearly and carefully as I can,
experiences that opened in 73

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,660
high dose LSD sessions conducted
over 20 years when I was a young

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:20,360
man between 30 and 50 years old.
And this was 1979 to 1999 I

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,280
spent another 20 years thinking
about these experiences,

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,760
digesting them, mapping them,
and pondering their

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,320
implications. I hope that the
visions that I brought back from

48
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,580
this journey will be useful, not
only to other Psychonauts, but

49
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,140
also to those who would never
take a psychedelic themselves.

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,420
Because what's important here is
the vision of the cosmos that

51
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,860
they contain, and a vision of
where humanity is in its long

52
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,580
evolutionary journey and the
turning point that we're coming

53
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,740
to now I want to say up front
before we begin that I'm not

54
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,500
sure that what I did was wise. I
pushed myself very hard on this

55
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,880
journey, harder than was
sometimes good for me, and I

56
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,860
sincerely do not recommend this
protocol to others. If I were

57
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,400
starting this journey over
again, I would be gentler with

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,760
myself. I would work with lower
doses and gentler psychedelics,

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,440
but I made it through intact,
and I would not have missed it

60
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,080
for the world. I also want to
say that I know that what I'm

61
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,180
presenting tonight is a radical
story. I know it raises many

62
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,860
questions that we won't get to
speak about tonight, about the

63
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,020
reality of these experiences,
about how this path compares to

64
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:54,340
other spiritual paths. But this
radical nature is inescapable. I

65
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,700
believe that psychedelics
represent a genuine turning

66
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,540
point in philosophy. A true
before and after advance. They

67
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,920
give us more than new insights
into consciousness and more than

68
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,220
a new therapeutic method for
healing the wounds of the

69
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,040
personal psyche. As important as
these things are, the critical

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,220
use of psychedelics gives us a
new philosophical method that

71
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,980
has two parts, first, immersing
ourselves into temporary states

72
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,080
of hyper aroused consciousness,
and second, stepping back and

73
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,240
critically analyzing our
experiences there by moving back

74
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,920
and forth between non ordinary
and ordinary states of

75
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,200
consciousness, we can gather and
distill new insights into the

76
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,240
structure of reality. Now, of
course, this method is not

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,020
really new, is it? It was
present in the Eleusinian

78
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,120
Mysteries of ancient Greece and
in the Ayahuasca ceremonies of

79
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,520
Brazil that date back 1000
years, but they are new to us,

80
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,280
new to our scientific culture,
and that's the point we are

81
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,780
witnessing, I think, the
emergence of a true psychedelic

82
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:24,440
philosophy. So let's begin my
psychedelic lineage is rooted in

83
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,540
the work of Stanislav Grof. I
was a brand new faculty member

84
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,140
in 1978 when I first read his
book, realms of the human

85
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,360
unconscious, and my life pivoted
that was followed quickly by his

86
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,580
book LSD psychotherapy in 1980
in which he laid out the method

87
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,420
for working with these
substances. Now, Stan has

88
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:52,480
demonstrated that LSD is a non
specific amplifier and catalyst

89
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,160
of consciousness. It does not
give us specific experiences.

90
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,100
Rather, it hyper sensitizes
one's consciousness for six to

91
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,840
eight hours at a time.
Everything that follows hinges

92
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,960
on how we use these hours. Now.
Stan's work clearly

93
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,620
differentiates two different
therapeutic modalities,

94
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,280
psycholytic therapy, low dose
therapy and psychedelic therapy,

95
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,240
high dose therapy, in
psycholytic therapy, the mind is

96
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,920
peeled away layer by layer,
uncovering the different layers

97
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,580
of our shadow and taking us back
deeper and deeper into our

98
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,300
unconscious. In psychedelic
therapy, this is a very

99
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,560
different protocol. It was
developed and used at Spring

100
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,420
Grove Hospital. It was limited
to three sessions maximum, and

101
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,220
it was designed to trigger a
near death type experiences

102
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,260
among patients who were
terminally ill. Well, I thought

103
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,600
if you could use this therapy of
hyad Working with high doses

104
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,220
safely three times. You could
use it working safely more than

105
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,080
three times. So during the years
I was doing this work, I simply

106
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,580
saw myself as doing an extended
course of psychedelic therapy.

107
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,620
But when I came to the end of
this journey and was looking

108
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,620
back over its length, I came to
appreciate how radical this

109
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,300
undertaking had actually been.
This went beyond psychedelic

110
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,440
therapy as it was originally
conceived and practiced, and

111
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,960
therefore it called for a new
term to avoid confusion, and so

112
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,140
I've named it psychedelic
exploration. Now I worked at 500

113
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,220
to 600 micrograms. This is a
very high dose level. The method

114
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,140
is the method of psychedelic
therapy, complete isolation and

115
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,040
complete protection from the
outside world, trusting your

116
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,960
care to a sitter, wearing eyes
shades and working with very

117
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,100
carefully chosen music to pace
the opening and closing of your

118
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,140
session. The difference is the
high number of sessions, in my

119
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:19,080
case, 73 times. Now I think that
the stabilization of the

120
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,060
protocol and minimizing the
variables that I followed in my

121
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,500
session contributed to the
stability and clarity of the

122
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,600
psychedelic window that opened
in my sessions. I always

123
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,340
followed the same protocol, the
same set and setting, the same

124
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,460
sitter, who was my former wife,
my wife at the time, Carol, who

125
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,500
is a clinical psychologist, the
same substance, the same dose

126
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,600
level, even the same location
and the same recording process.

127
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,580
I think this provided a very
stable reception platform that

128
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:03,840
allowed my sessions to develop
clean. Clearly over time. Now I

129
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,400
did this work as rigorously as I
could. I kept detailed records,

130
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,240
making an exhaustive,
descriptive account within 24

131
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,460
hours of each session, I tracked
the dates, and that's Rick

132
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,500
Tarnas is a good friend of mine,
and I've learned, as we've all

133
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,940
read his book, psyche and
Cosmos, I track the astrological

134
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,240
variables to see what the
interplay was between my

135
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,760
experiences and the astrological
transits. I want to emphasize

136
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,520
that the story that I'm telling
in LSD, in the mind of the

137
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,520
universe, is not primarily a
personal story. It's primarily a

138
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,460
cosmological story. The personal
is the least important in my

139
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,760
experiences. After the first 10
sessions or so, the portion of

140
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,060
the experiences that were
relevant to my personal life

141
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,200
tended to come up in the
beginning and endings of the

142
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,460
sessions represented by these
small circles that are drawn at

143
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,460
the beginning and endings of the
sine waves, which represent

144
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,140
psychedelic sessions. When I was
coming back, leaving and coming

145
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,180
back into space time, I often
had many insights and many gifts

146
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,600
given me about my personal life.
But when I was in the peak hours

147
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,520
of psychedelic arousal, I was at
the top of these waves and

148
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,540
experiencing. I was having
experiences that far transcended

149
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,580
my personal life as represented
in these larger circles. And

150
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,720
that's the story I'm telling in
LSD, in the mind of the

151
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,720
universe, that's the
philosophically interesting

152
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,860
story that is the universal
story. And it's a story which is

153
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,380
basically telling the
developmental sequence of

154
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,980
experiences over these hilltop
perspectives.

155
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,320
Now there are many ways in which
you can use psychedelics. Let me

156
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,780
identify three uses. First is
using it in a to for therapeutic

157
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,760
healing, to heal the wounds of
our personal psyche. This is the

158
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,940
dominant form in which
psychedelics are being used and

159
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,860
studied today. Second is to use
them for spiritual awakening to

160
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,100
cultivate that radical,
transparent condition of our

161
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,240
being in which we stand
completely conscious, completely

162
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,620
naked and completely receptive
to the ever changing field of

163
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:42,220
experience. The third usage is
cosmological exploration. These

164
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,840
are distinct, if mutually
reinforcing, undertakings, how

165
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,580
you use psychedelics, dose
levels, circumstances, set and

166
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,480
setting are different in each of
these settings, and I think it's

167
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,120
important to make sure that we
don't judge one project by

168
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,980
criteria that are relevant to
another project. Okay. Now, in

169
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,460
these experiences, when one
works with very high doses of

170
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,740
LSD, one goes through a series
of Death-Rebirth experiences. In

171
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,840
this image, the drop at the
center, underneath the line

172
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,440
represents our egoic
consciousness, our private

173
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,300
consciousness. Everything above
the line represents spiritual

174
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,380
reality, Transpersonal
consciousness, the first

175
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,020
Death-Rebirth experience, takes
place at the interface of our

176
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,980
time, space consciousness and
the beginnings of spiritual

177
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,540
consciousness. And it's usually
referred to as ego death. It is

178
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,100
the complete destruction of our
personal time, space identity,

179
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,260
and the beginning of an opening
into spiritual reality. But if

180
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,720
we continue this process, if we
press deeper and deeper into

181
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,120
spiritual reality, we go through
more deaths, more cycles of

182
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,820
death and rebirth at the
psychic, subtle and causal

183
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,500
levels of consciousness. To use
terms that Stan uses. Now I have

184
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,660
no vested interest in a
particular cosmological map that

185
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,380
delineates the various strata,
strata of Transpersonal

186
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,820
consciousness. Here, I'm simply
trying to make a point that as

187
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,540
you go into deeper levels of
consciousness, you come to

188
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,980
certain gateways, and at these
gateways, you must give up

189
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,660
everything, everything you have
known up to this point in time,

190
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,200
in your journey, in order to
enter into the new fields of

191
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,420
consciousness that are beginning
to open to you. Now, one does

192
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,560
not simply enter into spiritual
reality and pluck these

193
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,840
experiences from the universe
like one plucks an apple. A tree

194
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,220
drawing on Jorge Farrah's
insights in his wonderful book,

195
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,800
revisiting Transpersonal theory,
I hold that all psychedelic

196
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,260
experience is participatory.
This means that our being evokes

197
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,900
in complex ways that portion of
the universe that we encounter

198
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,260
our mind acts as a seed crystal
that catalyzes a certain set of

199
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,140
experiences from the cosmic
mind's infinite potential. As we

200
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,180
are gradually purified and
transformed by this process, it

201
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,280
evokes still deeper experiences
from the universe. In my

202
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,960
experience, one session more or
less started where the previous

203
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,880
session stopped, there was a
gradual and consistent unfolding

204
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,100
into deeper and deeper levels of
reality. This may not be true in

205
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,600
other people's experiences. It
simply is true. Let me give you

206
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,780
a different image for this
process. LSD is often likened to

207
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,720
the atomic bomb, which was
invented in the same decade.

208
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,180
Here I'm using the nuclear
explosion as an image of the

209
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,800
type of come bus combustive fire
that is generated in a long

210
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,300
series of sessions, that
generates this cycle of death

211
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,700
and rebirth. And as this cycle
continues, it activates and

212
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,140
brings into our conscious
awareness deeper levels of the

213
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,740
of the universe, just as this
nuclear explosion brings into

214
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,720
visible form different levels of
the atmosphere there were always

215
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,620
there from the beginning, but
were basically hidden and

216
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,260
invisible. And it is the power
of the psychedelic dynamic that

217
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,120
brings these dimensions of
existence into our into our

218
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,940
conscious awareness. Now we're
not talking about nuclear

219
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,220
explosions. We're talking about
an exploration into the mind of

220
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,980
the universe, an exploration
into the cosmic mind. When I was

221
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,120
at the end of my journey, and
looking back over its length,

222
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,100
identified different strata,
different layers that I had

223
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,960
entered systematically over the
course of these 20 years. And I

224
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,180
would count five of them, the
first having to do with my

225
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:44,800
personal mind. The second having
to do with collective mind, the

226
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,320
mind of our species. The third,
having to do with archetypal

227
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:58,840
mind. The fourth, causal
oneness, and the fifth, diamond

228
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,100
Luminosity. So what I'd like to
do now is simply take you into

229
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,180
the book, chapter by chapter,
with just a few highlighted

230
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,080
comments of the content of each
chapter, just to illustrate,

231
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,780
just to invite you into into the
dialog that you will find

232
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:25,100
unfolded in LSD, in the mind of
the universe. So first the

233
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,620
personal mind. There is the
chapter crossing the boundary of

234
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,120
birth and death. This refers to
crossing what Stan calls the

235
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,840
perinatal level of
consciousness. Now there is a

236
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,760
previous chapter, the chapter on
methodology, where I lay out the

237
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,620
method of the work. Then there
is a chapter three in which I

238
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,480
basically take the reader into a
typical session day to show them

239
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,480
what it's like. But content
wise, we begin here. Now, if

240
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,380
you're familiar with Stan Grof
work, and I'm assuming most of

241
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,180
you are this is classic
perinatal material, deep

242
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,680
confrontations with death and
fetal sensations, severe

243
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,320
existential confrontations,
tremendous perinatal seizures,

244
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,160
purifying the body and the
emotional field, culminating an

245
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,020
ego death. And in ego death, our
identity, our time, space,

246
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:30,680
identity, is just turned inside
out. In my case, my ego death, I

247
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,100
was forced to become the exact
opposite of everything I had

248
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,000
ever known myself to be. The
Universe just reached down and

249
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,100
snapped me like a trick a twig
in the beginning of the day, I

250
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,320
had always known myself as being
male, as being an intellectual,

251
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:54,760
being college educated, and
being passionately interested in

252
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,920
the meaning of life. In this
session, I was forced to become.

253
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,160
Complete opposite of all these
things, and it was as if the

254
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,720
universe was telling me where
you are going. Gender does not

255
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,520
exist. I had to let go of
everything I was in order to go

256
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,840
into what was coming next. And
what was coming next really

257
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,200
surprised me in what I later
came to call the exercises of

258
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,820
collective death and rebirth and
first, the ocean of suffering.

259
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,380
Over the course of two years, I
was repeatedly and

260
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,200
systematically immersed in
experiences of collective

261
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,060
anguish that shattered all my
frames of reference and

262
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,680
completely dwarfing the previous
phase I entered a notion of

263
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,820
suffering that eventually
expanded systematically to

264
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,620
encompass what appeared to be
the entire history of the human

265
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,980
species. The dying in these
sessions was almost entirely

266
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,900
collective. The surrender that
was demanded was the ordeal of

267
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:13,140
repeatedly opening to the sheer
enormity and savagery, savagery

268
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,120
of this ocean of pain. Now
first, I thought this

269
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,460
represented a deepening of ego
death, but it went on for so

270
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,080
long and it involved so many
beings that eventually I changed

271
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,580
my mind. I came to the
conclusion that these collective

272
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,200
episodes were not primarily
aimed at the transformation of

273
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,480
my personal consciousness. They
were aimed at healing some

274
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,920
portion of the collective
unconscious of humanity, healing

275
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,560
scars accumulated through
history and still carried in our

276
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,820
collective memory.

277
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:58,419
Now, in my experience, in a
session, there are essentially

278
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:02,939
two phases. There is the first
phase, the cleansing phase,

279
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:06,119
purification phase, and the
second phase, the ecstatic

280
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:11,639
phase, the ocean of suffering, I
said, lasted two years.

281
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:15,779
Actually, it lasted one year,
and then I took a six year

282
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:19,139
break, and then it I started
again, and the ocean of

283
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:23,539
suffering resumed in that first
year, when I went into the

284
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,519
ecstatic phase of the sessions,
I entered what I came to call

285
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:36,379
deep time in the chapter, deep
time in the soul, when I would

286
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:40,539
come out of the ocean of
suffering, I entered a state in

287
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:46,659
which these seven sessions gave
me an experience of my life as a

288
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:51,579
completed whole, as a totality,
from beginning to end, the

289
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:56,739
visions were stable and
systematically developed. Each

290
00:22:56,739 --> 00:23:01,139
session built upon the previous
session. The sessions, their

291
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:05,279
sequences were repeated,
unfolding in greater detail and

292
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,799
with deepening emphasis. Now, I
found that it was an

293
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:14,879
extraordinary challenge to hold
on to these experiences of deep

294
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:20,719
time. The first time I came back
from deep time, the experiences

295
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:23,059
which had been the most
meaningful experiences of my

296
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:30,679
life. At that point in time, I
could not hold on to them. My

297
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:37,339
mind had no hope to place that
with repetition, when I would go

298
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:41,919
back to the same state of
consciousness again and again, I

299
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,759
was able to hold on to more and
more of the experiences. And

300
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,839
this is an important
epistemological point. You have

301
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,039
to train yourself to stay
conscious in these deep states

302
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:57,159
of consciousness, you have to
undergo a rigorous, systematic

303
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,079
commitment to learning how to
stay awake in states of

304
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,599
consciousness that, in the
beginning, completely swallow

305
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,579
you a pole, but if you practice
you can maintain epistemological

306
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:14,279
clarity in these states. So
during this year, I had many

307
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,359
teachings about reincarnation,
about karmic cause and effect,

308
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:23,719
and the deeper intentionality
operating in life. And then I

309
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:27,559
stopped my work for six years
for reasons that I describe in

310
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:32,959
the book. When I resumed six
years later, the ocean of

311
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:37,579
suffering started exactly where
it had stopped before, and

312
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:41,619
continued to build in intensity
over the remaining year, seven

313
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:46,479
more sessions in a different
time of my life with different

314
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:52,539
expectations and under different
astrological transits, the ocean

315
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:56,979
of suffering began exactly where
it had stopped, which I think

316
00:24:56,979 --> 00:25:00,359
reflects the depth and power of
the intelligence. And

317
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:05,939
consciousness that is directing
these episodes, certainly not my

318
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:10,919
intelligence, something larger
than my intelligence. When I

319
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,299
went into the ecstatic portion
of these sessions, I entered a

320
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,439
completely different reality
than deep time in the soul. I

321
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:23,299
entered, in a sense, what I came
to call an initiation into the

322
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,439
universe. It did involve
transcending time in different

323
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:32,359
ways, but I was given a
systematic series of initiations

324
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:37,219
into the universe and into the
creative intelligence behind the

325
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:42,879
physical universe. The sequence
was deliberate and well crafted.

326
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,959
It felt like an infinite
intelligence was educating me,

327
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:52,179
reminding me of things long ago
forgotten, but now in need of

328
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:58,599
being remembered. Now little
note I give my psychedelic

329
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:02,219
sessions names. I take detailed
notes, I break them down into

330
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:05,519
bullet points, and I give them
names, because my intention is

331
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,819
to try to hold all of my
experiences in my mind at the

332
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:13,319
same time. And so when I see the
name of the session, it reminds

333
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,039
me of the content of the
session. So the names of the

334
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:25,939
sessions that I address in this
chapter are this. We don't have

335
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:29,239
time for me to go into these
sessions beyond what I've

336
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:34,519
already said. The name suggests
some of the content. It was just

337
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:40,539
an extraordinary philosophical
adventure being taken by what

338
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,479
appeared to be the creative
intelligence of the universe,

339
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,219
deeper and deeper into the
mysteries of creation and deeper

340
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:57,039
into humanity's destiny. When
the ocean of suffering came to a

341
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,399
culmination in this session 24
healing the collective wound. I

342
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:09,059
was spun into archetypal reality
in the chapter the greater real

343
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:16,499
of archetypal reality. Let me
see if I can there we go. This

344
00:27:16,499 --> 00:27:23,179
lasted one and a half years and
11 sessions. It I was entering a

345
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:29,119
reality that immediately and
consistently was more real felt

346
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,459
more real than physical reality.
It was a domain behind physical

347
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:38,539
reality and the source of the
structures that exist inside

348
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:44,619
space and time. When I first
entered archetypal reality, my

349
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:50,439
identity as a human being began
to fall away from me. I learned

350
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:55,479
that we have a sense of a sense
of species identity that is more

351
00:27:55,479 --> 00:28:00,719
basic than our individual
identity, and surrendering this

352
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:05,759
species identity represented a
deeper form of surrender and a

353
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,639
deeper death than ego. Death to
die out of human consciousness

354
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:15,719
was to begin to exist in a
domain of consciousness

355
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:21,739
completely beyond the human
species field. This transition

356
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:26,239
was marked with extremely high
levels of energy. I was plunged

357
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:31,039
into white hot lava flows,
exploding Sun fare flares,

358
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,199
liquid fire pouring through me,
completely consuming me, very

359
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:40,659
different from the death that I
had gone through in the

360
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:45,759
perinatal level of
consciousness, my experiences in

361
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,479
archetypal reality, basically
could be broken down into two

362
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:55,119
categories, two levels, one at
the highest subtle level and one

363
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,319
at the lower subtle level, at
the higher subtle level, which I

364
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,959
would call the Platonic level, I
encountered living forms

365
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,699
responsible for creating space
time and the core structures

366
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:14,399
within space time, they were too
vast for me to grasp. Even in my

367
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:19,139
expanded psychedelic state, I
could catch only glimpses of

368
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:25,219
them. I saw them as galaxies,
billions of light years across

369
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:29,719
massive structures, but this was
simply the best my mind could do

370
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:33,439
to wrap itself around the
realities that I was

371
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:39,439
experiencing. These were
archetypes, but not Plato's

372
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:45,399
eternal ideas in the mind of an
unchanging God, but vast living

373
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:50,559
dynamic forces embodying higher
orders of intentionality and

374
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,639
power and operating on a
different order of time

375
00:29:54,639 --> 00:30:01,079
entirely, at the lower, subtle
level, at a. More Jung Ian

376
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,359
level, I was immersed in the
living tissue of our species

377
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:11,759
through a long series of
experiences. I was repeatedly

378
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,279
experiencing our species as a
single organism interlaced with

379
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,999
an intelligent network of meta
functions. I experienced all of

380
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:27,079
our individual minds as nodal
points within the collective

381
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:31,399
mind. I experienced all the
issues that we confront in our

382
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:36,319
life, both psychological issues
and biological issues, as all

383
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,899
part of a larger living tapestry
of cause and effect weaving

384
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:46,839
throughout the entire species, I
experienced our collect our

385
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,939
individual bodies as cells
within our larger collective

386
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:52,479
body,

387
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:58,419
and I began to have experiences
of reincarnation as a collective

388
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:02,699
process. Up to this point in
time, I had already experienced

389
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:06,419
reincarnation, or thought about
reincarnation in terms of a

390
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:12,179
personal, soul generated process
and that and it was about our

391
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:15,719
individual evolution and
confronting individual karma.

392
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,359
But I had many experiences
during this time of our entire

393
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:26,059
species, reincarnating with
Common Cause, I began to

394
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:31,519
experience billions of human
beings incarnating over and over

395
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,879
again, and driving the evolution
of our entire species forward. I

396
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:42,459
was given many insights into
into the dynamics of collective

397
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:47,499
purification and collective
transformation. And this is why,

398
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:51,339
in my book, Dark Night early
dawn, the fundamental theme of

399
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:55,599
that book has to do with the
processes, the dynamics of

400
00:31:55,779 --> 00:32:00,299
collective transformation. Dark
Night early dawn is about the

401
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,199
collective dark night and the
early dawn is about our

402
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:10,199
collective transformation and
history. This was simultaneously

403
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,839
a Numinous, Numinous experience
and a devastating experience to

404
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,539
experience billions of lives as
cells within an organism that

405
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:24,319
was evolving itself on the face
of our planet was just a

406
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:30,079
devastating experience and an
ecstatic experience. Now the

407
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,559
titles of the essay, of the
sessions that I address in this

408
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,119
chapter are these.

409
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,220
You can see how much cleansing
is involved, even at this rather

410
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,080
advanced level. And this
reflects an important truth.

411
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,440
Deeper levels of reality are
higher levels of energy, and

412
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,740
when one wants to enter, if you
want to enter and stabilize your

413
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,720
consciousness at these deeper
levels of reality, you must

414
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,560
adapt to and adjust to this
energy. It's like mountain

415
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,020
climbing. When you climb a
mountain, you're adapt. You're

416
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,820
adjusting to less oxygen. When
you're working through deeper

417
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,560
levels of consciousness, you're
adjusting to more energy. You

418
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,420
must literally become a being
who can sustain these high

419
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:30,860
levels of energy for eight hours
at a time. Session 28 was my

420
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,320
first and brief contact with
causal level reality. It was an

421
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,160
exceptionally clear, dramatic
and beautiful session, but just

422
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,120
touching the purity of causal
level reality was so intense

423
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,820
that it triggered hours and
hours of cleansing that lasted

424
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:58,300
over three sessions stretched
over six months. The cleansing

425
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,800
was some type of purification
process that was making it

426
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,380
possible for me to return to
this level of reality, but to

427
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:13,680
maintain coherent cognitive
focus at this deep level, which

428
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:20,480
then led to a rather startling
experience, the flash of God in

429
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:30,860
session 33 after this, I entered
an extraordinary year of

430
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,840
immersion in causal oneness, in
a chapter that I call a

431
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,020
benediction of blessings. It
lasted one year and eight

432
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:46,960
sessions. So after spending 18
months exploring archetypal

433
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,580
reality, which, of course, is
very quickly, I mean, I just was

434
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,140
moving through this material,
just touching base, just moving

435
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:01,620
through very quickly the year.
That followed was one of extra

436
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,980
ordinary blessings. It was a
veritable benediction of

437
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,980
blessings as I entered the great
depth of causal reality. And

438
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,560
these are the names of the
sessions that I address in the

439
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,180
book. These were preceded by
more experiences of death and

440
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:26,180
more experiences of fierce
purification. The forest was an

441
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:32,300
experience of causal oneness, of
Shunyata, emptiness of self, no

442
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:39,140
self in me, no self in any
other. Just as sun and sun and

443
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,060
air moves through in a forest
without paying any attention to

444
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,680
the particular type of tree that
it's moving through. Singing the

445
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,940
universe away was an experience
of the primal void that lies

446
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,980
beneath our universe and gives
birth to it, day by day, second

447
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,520
by second. Jesus's blood was an
experience of cosmic love, the

448
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,060
most intense experience of love
that I had ever known in my

449
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,920
life, and then the birth of the
diamond soul. And let me mention

450
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,460
something about this, just very
briefly, because it it's really

451
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,600
a pivotal was a pivotal session
for me, and it comes up later in

452
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,260
the book. Previously I had
experienced my life as a

453
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:30,680
completed whole. Now, 11 years
later, I experienced all of my

454
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,360
former lives being rewound, one
by one, coming together and

455
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,420
being rewound like winding kite
string on a spool until

456
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,280
eventually, the spool exploded
in a burst of light, fusing all

457
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,720
the strands together and giving
birth to what I came to call the

458
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,720
diamond soul. The diamond soul
was composed of many lifetimes,

459
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,720
but it was more than the sum of
all their years. This experience

460
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,920
showed me. I think where
reincarnation is taking us. It

461
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,700
would take us too long to go
into in great detail, but

462
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,420
basically, I think the visions
of reincarnation that we have

463
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,480
lived with over the last 2000
years are are incomplete. They

464
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,740
haven't they have a vision of
that we're we're growing

465
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,340
incrementally, lifetime by
lifetime, becoming more knowing

466
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,220
more becoming more
compassionate, becoming more

467
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,980
intelligent, incremental
adjustments. But I think that

468
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:39,500
there is more at foot underneath
this process. Eventually we

469
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,820
there comes a time through the
constant expansion and

470
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,660
contraction, through dying and
returning to the soul and being

471
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,200
born and contracting into the
ego and buying in the soul and

472
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,380
coming back into the ego.
Eventually, there comes a time,

473
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,820
I believe, where all of our
former lives come together as

474
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:03,000
one, and when they come together
as one, they catapult us into a

475
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,980
condition of being which is not
simply a refined and purified

476
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,580
future life. It is a being
catapulted into a different

477
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,620
order of life, a different order
of being itself. I think what is

478
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,560
happening over the long story of
reincarnation is that the soul

479
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:30,740
is being born inside time and
space. This is what I call the

480
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:40,840
birth of the diamond soul. Now
from here, I went into the

481
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,020
diamond Luminosity work. Now
notice I've skipped chapter

482
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,960
nine. I wish I had actually
written these in a different

483
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,320
order. I wish I had had 10
before chapter nine. But I'm

484
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,440
going to skip over nine for the
moment, because the work went

485
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,500
into the diamond Luminosity
material. The benediction of

486
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,580
blessings felt like the closing
of a great circle. It gave me a

487
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,840
feeling of deep completion, a
sense of inheriting blessings

488
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,940
for work done in the ocean of
suffering. I had given something

489
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,500
to the universe that was mine to
give, and the universe had given

490
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,860
me back more treasures than I
could hold. I felt complete and

491
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,660
utterly satisfied. I had no idea
where the sessions would go

492
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,840
next, but there was still five
years ahead,

493
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,980
after going through yet one more
intense cycle of death and

494
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:47,980
rebirth, I was spun into a
brilliantly clear radiance that

495
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:53,500
Buddhism calls Dharmakaya. I
came to call it the domain of

496
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,720
diamond Luminosity. Now, I had
known light many times before,

497
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,660
but this. Was an exceptionally
pure light. This domain

498
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,280
captivated me so completely that
it extinguished any interest I

499
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,880
had in exploring the other
levels of existence that had

500
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,920
previously fascinated me. This
was a different order of reality

501
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,660
altogether. Its clarity was so
overwhelming, its energy so pure

502
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,600
that returning to it became my
sole focus in future sessions

503
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:37,580
over the next four years and 26
sessions, the diamond Luminosity

504
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,700
domain opened to me only four
times, and these are the four

505
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,440
sessions that I describe, that I
present in this chapter.

506
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:57,760
My understanding is that the
diamond Luminosity is an extra

507
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,940
Samsara reality that is, it lies
outside the Bardo, outside of

508
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,260
Samsara, outside all the cycles
of physical reality and the

509
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:13,440
Bardo realities of psychic
reality, the pure light. It is

510
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,200
the pure light from which the
universe arises and returns. It

511
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,060
is Dharmakaya, the clear light
of absolute reality. Now, in

512
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,440
between these four Immersions in
Diamond Luminosity, there were

513
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,760
many intense episodes of
cleansing and personal healing

514
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,320
in general, there were two
movements during this four year

515
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,840
period. There was first a
movement of going deeper into

516
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,700
diamond Luminosity, and then a
movement to diamond Luminosity

517
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,100
began to crunch itself more
deeply into my physical body.

518
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:59,800
And the turning point for this
was session 50. I only began to

519
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,620
understand what was happening
after the fact. Always, I had no

520
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,220
control over what was happening
in the sessions I had basically

521
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,640
went along with whatever the
universe was, wherever it was

522
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,840
taking me, and only figured out
after the fact what was taking

523
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:22,400
place. In Session 50, I was as
deep into the universe as I ever

524
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,000
went. In any of my sessions, I
was in the clearest, most

525
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,480
sublime state of diamond
Luminosity that I had ever

526
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:36,440
known. And then in that session,
everything in my visual field

527
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,800
pivoted 90 degrees, and I saw a
reality far into the distance

528
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,640
that looked like luminous
galaxies, and a ray of light

529
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:51,820
from that reality hit me, and it
absolutely shattered me. I call

530
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,800
it the absolute light, just to
give it a name. But what it

531
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,400
showed me is that the universe
that we are exploring in these

532
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,200
deep states of consciousness is
endless. I would never get to

533
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,560
the end of the divine mind. I
would never get to the end of

534
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,760
the cosmic mind, even using this
powerful method of exploration.

535
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,420
This was a turning point in my
thinking, because I had adopted

536
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,700
the belief that I inherited from
other people, that there was an

537
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,760
end point to this journey, that
there was a point that you came

538
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,860
to which represented your
ultimate destination. Some had

539
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,600
described it as oneness with
God, or as the return to the

540
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,660
primal void. But I had
experienced one oneness with God

541
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,840
many times, and what I learned
is that there are many

542
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,820
permutations and degrees of
oneness. And I had entered in

543
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,660
the primal void several times,
and I learned that there, too,

544
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:00,900
there are degrees of void. When
I first entered the diamond

545
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,000
Luminosity. It came. It brought
such a feeling of Homecoming,

546
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,720
such a feeling of absolute peace
and contentment. I thought that

547
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,740
I had finally found what I was
looking for. I had finally found

548
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:19,860
my ultimate destination. And
then practically I did. It

549
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,480
completely satisfied all my
philosophical and spiritual

550
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,860
longing. But just at the peak of
this satisfaction, the universe

551
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:32,960
showed me that it is an Infinite
Journey. It is an infinite being

552
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,860
that we are exploring in our
lives. This both first shattered

553
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,500
me and then relaxed me into
infinite wonder. And this is one

554
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,380
of the reasons why I would be
gentler with myself if I were

555
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,500
doing this today, because one of
the things I've learned on this

556
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,460
journey is that the goal is not
to get somewhere, to get to a

557
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,340
particular state of
consciousness or particular

558
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:01,380
state of being. The goal of
this. Work, I think, is to open

559
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,520
up to the universe and let as
much of it as possible into your

560
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,340
being, to let as much of the
love and as much of the

561
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,820
intelligence and as much of the
power and consciousness into

562
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:17,100
your being and stabilize it and
hold it and live your life,

563
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:25,940
living by its truths. After this
session 50, the next sessions

564
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,120
really seemed to take me into
the diamond light, but the

565
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,560
diamond light was crunching
itself deeper and deeper into my

566
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,360
body, changing even what I think
of as the physiological

567
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:44,800
structure, the cellular
structure of my body. And now to

568
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:52,420
the chapter I skipped over the
birth of the future human. When

569
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:58,480
I began this work in 1979 I
never imagined that humanity's

570
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,880
future would become part of this
story, but now I think this may

571
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,720
be the most important chapter of
the book, because it speaks of

572
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,440
our children and our children's
children, as far as we can see,

573
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,620
it speaks of a crossroads
humanity is coming too, and of

574
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:24,500
powerful forces taking us into a
future that will change us at

575
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:31,280
the deepest levels of our being.
In this chapter, I summarize

576
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:35,960
bits and pieces of experiences
and visions that actually go all

577
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,100
the way back to the initiation
into the universe material and

578
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:47,020
run all the way through up into
session 55 these are the

579
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,540
sessions that I discuss, that I
present in this chapter here. I

580
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:58,780
collect the pieces of visions. I
extract them from sessions 23 to

581
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:03,900
47 and gather them together in
what I call the visions of

582
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:11,580
awakening, there are six visions
of awakening. Are six themes

583
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,600
that kept showing themselves
over and over in these visions

584
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:21,020
concerning humanity's future.
The themes of those six visions

585
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,200
are divine love all humanity
that the universe is trying to

586
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,900
awaken all humanity that is
being enacted by guiding

587
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,640
intelligence that's guiding our
evolutionary process, our

588
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,580
species as a single being, again
seeing the awakening as not

589
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:47,080
simply a number of individuals
awakening, but our entire

590
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:52,300
species going through the
awakening process, the theme of

591
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,020
collective purification, again,
through the dynamics of

592
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,500
reincarnation, that we are
undergoing a collective

593
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,200
purification, and finally, the
experience of the future human

594
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,360
being given the grace of
experiencing the future human

595
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:15,420
that is being born in history.
But nowhere in these visions

596
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,860
over these four years, nowhere
in these visions was it shown me

597
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,420
how this was going to take
place. The vision was that we

598
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,980
were coming into a period of
profound spiritual awakening, a

599
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,640
shift in the fundamental
architecture of the collective

600
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,600
psyche, a shift that will change
the foundation of human

601
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:41,800
existence on this planet. But it
had not shown me how. And then

602
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,660
in session 55 right in the
middle of the diamond Luminosity

603
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:52,120
sessions, I was taken deep into
deep time, and I was given an

604
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:58,840
experience of the death and
rebirth of humanity, well, of

605
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,000
the death and rebirth of
humanity, for there to be a

606
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,140
great awakening in the human
heart, in our collective human

607
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:12,780
heart, there must first take
place a great death. We must be

608
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:19,080
emptied of the old before the
new can fully emerge. I believe

609
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:24,260
that the 21st Century will be
such a time. It will begin the

610
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,180
dark night of our collective
soul, a time of emptying, of

611
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:34,460
intense anguish, of loss of
control and breakdown, a

612
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,760
collective purification unto
death that will last

613
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,000
generations. But through this
hard labor, we will give birth

614
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,700
to something extraordinary, more
than just a new civilization.

615
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,340
What is emerging is nothing less
than a new order of human being

616
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,260
through the global systems
crisis, our planet is giving

617
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:05,220
birth. Us to the future human
and when I first described these

618
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:10,260
themes in dark night, early
dawn, it sounds quite

619
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,500
appropriate for our times that
we are living in now. But I

620
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,400
would just remind you that these
visions were taking place in the

621
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:24,680
early 90s. The Great Awakening
session took place in 1995 25

622
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:29,840
years ago. At that time, it was
completely beyond my purview

623
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,120
that we were going into such an
enormous watershed moment in

624
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,780
history,

625
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:45,340
in my visions concerning the
human where humanity is, it was

626
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:50,140
as though the transformation of
humanity as a whole was the only

627
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,400
thing that creative intelligence
really cared about. Everything

628
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,380
else, my life, our lives,
everything we are struggling

629
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,840
with in history, was part of
this larger project. It was the

630
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,520
context that framed all of our
endeavors. It was the work of

631
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:15,660
the hour. Now my visions did not
give me any details of when and

632
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:20,780
where, so don't ask. It showed
me the fact of this collective

633
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,760
awakening. It took me into the
collective psyches experience of

634
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,660
this death and rebirth, and it
gave me insights into the

635
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:34,940
mechanisms of our collective
transformation. There's probably

636
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,300
not time here to discuss these
mechanisms, though I think

637
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,360
they're really important, and it
has to do two things with the

638
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,920
unified field, that the
collective species mind is

639
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:53,500
underneath all of our individual
experiences, and the perception

640
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,820
that then the enormous suffering
that is being that will be

641
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:03,180
generated by a global ecological
crisis leading to a global

642
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,080
systems crisis. This suffering
will impact not just

643
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,680
individuals, but it will
actually stimulate the

644
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,520
collective psyche so deeply
it'll shift the collective

645
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:19,560
psyche into what we would call
nonlinear conditions. And we

646
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,660
know something about non linear
systems from physical systems

647
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,740
when they are shoved into non
linear states. And there is a

648
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,660
parallel between what can happen
to a psychic system, a field of

649
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,660
psychological energy, and what
happens to physical systems when

650
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,400
they are both shoved into non
linear conditions, heightened

651
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,660
creativity, higher self
organization, the capacity for

652
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,540
rapidly accelerated change and
small inputs leading to enormous

653
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,500
outcomes.

654
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:03,120
The final vision to bring the
journey to a close, just

655
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:09,000
touching it very briefly.
Actually, the seven, the three

656
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,260
sessions that I discussed in
this chapter, the final vision,

657
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,020
this was one of the most intense
sessions that I went through

658
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,900
anywhere on my journey. In it
the universe put me through a

659
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:29,360
strip down that was more violent
and more radical than any strip

660
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,100
down I had ever gone through at
any other time in my journey.

661
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,720
And it did so, I think in order
to catapult me more deeply into

662
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:47,680
deep time than it ever taken me
before. I won't try to reproduce

663
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,340
or tell you much about that. I
will invite you simply to look

664
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:58,540
at it in the book itself. It was
the final vision given me as a

665
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:04,920
capstone to the long story of
where humanity is going. It

666
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,280
showed me things about the
evolutionary process that I have

667
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,540
held dear to my heart ever
since. It showed me things about

668
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,260
our universe, that our universe
is a diamond maker, making

669
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,980
diamond souls, and it cares very
little whether it takes a

670
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,920
million or billion years for us
to interest, for it to produce

671
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,620
the souls that it is creating.
And it gave me my deepest

672
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:37,220
experience of the future human,
an extraordinary being, just,

673
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:48,040
just an extraordinary being. The
last chapter is coming off the

674
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:54,400
mountain. This chapter was the
longest to write, and in it, I

675
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,360
describe two things that I have
struggled with and confronted in

676
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,660
the years after my journey. I
ended

677
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:11,220
the first I called the deep
sadness I had been given so many

678
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,720
blessings on this journey, I
thought that I could simply step

679
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,920
away and spend the rest of my
life digesting these treasures,

680
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,920
but in the years following my
sessions, I began to experience

681
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:30,980
a deep existential sadness I had
been taken so deep into the

682
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:36,200
divine, into the divine expanse,
so many times, that I was

683
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,380
suffering from a loss of
communion with the divine. Once

684
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,700
you have known the joy of
becoming light, once you have

685
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,080
experienced the ecstasy of
dissolving into the crystalline

686
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:57,580
body of God, life on Earth, can
begin to feel dried up. I found

687
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:03,420
that I no longer wanted to be
here, and this is similar to

688
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,900
what some people who have near
death episodes experience when

689
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,620
they return here. They are
plunged deeply into the light,

690
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,820
the divine light filled with
overwhelming love, and then

691
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,820
suddenly they're back on Earth
with all the limitations of

692
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:25,400
earthly experience. It's hard to
make that transition. I knew

693
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,020
that I was every moment immersed
in the body of the Divine. I

694
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:34,520
knew that she was the root and
the flower of my existence. But

695
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,720
this knowledge did not save me
entirely from the pain of being

696
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:44,860
separated from the full
intensity of her presence. It

697
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:50,800
took me about 10 years to become
fully grounded and comfortable

698
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:58,720
living inside space, time again.
But there was a second factor

699
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:02,820
contributing to my disharmony,
and this is what I call the

700
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:08,700
sickness of silence. Because of
our restrictive laws around

701
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,780
psychedelics, I was not allowed
to speak about my experience to

702
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:18,480
others. I am a natural born
teacher. I love to learn new

703
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,060
things and share that knowledge,
but I was not allowed to teach

704
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:28,040
from my psychedelic experiences
in the Department of Philosophy

705
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,760
and Religious Studies, I had to
keep silent about the most

706
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:37,040
philosophically meaningful
experiences of my life. How can

707
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:42,520
you behold under such
restrictive conditions, over

708
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,440
time, this enforced silence made
me sick inside. Living in a

709
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,300
psychedelic closet is just as
damaging to your soul as living

710
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,020
in any other closet where you
are forced to deny your true

711
00:57:56,020 --> 00:58:02,340
nature, writing LSD in the mind
of the universe, and speaking

712
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,300
openly about my psychedelic
experiences, as I'm speaking to

713
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:12,900
you tonight, is, is been, has
been part of my personal path to

714
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:18,540
becoming whole upon this earth
once again, to become in my

715
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:27,440
Public Life what I have been in
my private life, and in closing,

716
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,480
I'd like to leave you with this
thought. I still have many

717
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,560
questions about what it means to
integrate experiences such as

718
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:41,440
those that I've been describing
tonight. I think we are still in

719
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,340
the early stages of
understanding how entering such

720
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:49,180
extreme states of consciousness
is affecting us in the long

721
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:54,580
term. What does it do to a
person to hold the kind of

722
00:58:54,580 --> 00:59:00,720
memories that I am holding? What
does integration even mean in

723
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:06,900
this context, how does a time
bound person, a time bound being

724
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,760
exquisitely tuned to the
conditions of space time, absorb

725
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,000
excursions into deep time? How
does a finite being digest our

726
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,560
forays into the infinite? What
is the residual impact of

727
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:29,600
merging with all of existence
after we have returned to being

728
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:35,720
just one among many? I am asking
more questions than I have

729
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:41,260
answers for my life has become a
living experiment in these

730
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:46,960
matters, with the outcome still
being determined. But I say

731
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,400
again, I would not have missed
this journey for anything in the

732
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,840
world. It has been the
philosophical and spiritual

733
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:01,680
adventure of a lifetime, and I
take great. Joy and sharing it

734
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,260
with you tonight. Thank you.

735
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,400
David Lorimer: Thank you very
much indeed, Chris. If you could

736
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,880
just stop your screen share.
That would be good. There we go.

737
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:22,220
My eyes, I'm on. Well, I don't
know how many of you have read

738
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:27,680
Chris's book or his article and
the earlier book, which I read

739
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,840
20 years ago, dark night or
early dawn, but it's, it's, it's

740
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,760
a pretty shattering experience
to read, let alone go through.

741
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,140
And one of the things that I
felt was that Chris has done

742
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,280
something on our undertaken this
journey on our behalf, so that

743
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,080
we can borrow, in inverted
commas, some of his insights,

744
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:54,040
which I think are hugely
important for our own

745
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,820
understanding of who we are and
where we're going. And so I just

746
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,520
two, I'm just going to make two
or three observations, then

747
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,420
we're going to have a break and
then come back for back for

748
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:09,480
questions session. One of the
main questions you can ask

749
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:14,640
about, what Chris has been
talking about, is, does what he

750
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:19,200
is conveying here give us access
to the deep structure of

751
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,880
reality, or to the deep, deeper
structures of reality. And this

752
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,520
is something that we ask in the
Galileo commission report, in

753
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,480
which Harold argues in the
affirmative, in other words,

754
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:34,460
that they do. And this would
correspond to the third bar of

755
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:41,500
Jeff Kripal, who was with us a
couple of weeks ago. Now, do

756
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,160
these experiences have important
implications for understanding

757
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,060
of consciousness and reality?
Well, my answer would be

758
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:53,200
absolutely. But obviously,
everybody has to make their draw

759
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,520
their own conclusion, and what
you'll find, what I found is

760
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,800
that I have an extensive
background in near death and

761
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,060
mystical experiences in terms of
the literature, which many other

762
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:10,260
people on the call also have,
and it's consistent with all

763
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:14,400
that, but it takes it a bit
further, in fact, a lot, and

764
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,180
it's a kind of Ultimate Gnosis,
or knowing by identification,

765
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:25,040
and then observation is that we
are clearly living in

766
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:35,180
apocalyptic time here at one
level or another, and about the

767
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:40,300
evolutionary prospects and the
birth of the future Human has an

768
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,420
extraordinary resonance, I
think, at this time, and it's

769
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:46,540
something that Ann bearing was,
he's on the call tonight, who

770
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:51,820
was referring to last week. And
so it'll be very interesting to

771
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:55,060
see how people feel about that.
We've got a lot of questions

772
01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:00,540
that have come up already and in
the chat box, but we'll get some

773
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:06,060
live contributions and so Chris,
wonderful. Thank you very, very

774
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:16,500
much indeed for sharing that so
lucidly. Paul from Poland, you

775
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,340
have a question?

776
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:26,060
Unknown: Hello, yes, I'm Hi,
Chris, a very nice presentation.

777
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:33,860
I mean, you know, whenever you
use the word universe, something

778
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:38,480
just sticks in me. As an
astronomer, I know galaxies. I

779
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,540
know stars, clusters of
galaxies, vast physical spaces.

780
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,780
That's what universe means to
me. Now, I have a universe in a

781
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:54,580
very different way, but I doubt.
But again, you know, I question

782
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:59,020
whether it doesn't see when,
again, when you say, God, I

783
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:09,600
don't universe, you know the
universe? It's a place where,

784
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,540
well, anyway, it's a long
subject. I think I've asked my

785
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:16,140
question anyway, if you could
elaborate a little by what you

786
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,900
mean by universe, so that yeah,

787
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,240
Chris Bache: you're absolutely
right, Paul, you've caught me

788
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:27,440
out on this. I struggle with
language. I struggle with how to

789
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,660
describe some of these realities
that I've entered. I don't like

790
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,960
using the word God. I don't use
it much, but I use it once in a

791
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,960
while, and I don't like using it
because it carries so much

792
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,020
baggage from history, and what
most people mean by God is not

793
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:48,400
what I mean by God. And so I'll
use the word divine sometimes,

794
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,860
but that's just a bit of a ruse,
because there it comes back to

795
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:57,580
the same but I'm trying to strip
the concept free of the

796
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:03,240
historical accumulation. So to
me, I collect pictures of of

797
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,540
galaxies. I collect, collect
pictures of nebulas. And when I,

798
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,680
when I move into meditation
practice, I just will play them

799
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:15,720
over and over and over again,
because this is my God. This is

800
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:21,800
my divine and it what I'm
referring to. What my experience

801
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,100
is is not to the outer body of
the Divine, though I was taken

802
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,060
into exploring some of the body
of the universe. But if I were a

803
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:32,360
physicist, and I would love to
have degrees in physics and go

804
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,140
into these states, because they
this consciousness could have

805
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:40,400
shown me so much more if I had
degrees in astrophysics and

806
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,740
degrees in quantum theory, just
my mind was not tuned to that

807
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:50,320
type of knowledge. I'm talking
about the consciousness which is

808
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,100
the the consciousness of the
universe, the consciousness

809
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:57,520
which has given birth to the
universe. And I'm just scraping

810
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,580
the edges of it. I'm just
touching the pieces of it, my

811
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:07,380
experience of it is certainly
limited by what I can understand

812
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:12,240
because, and again, what I would
love to do is have 100 of our

813
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,520
best, brightest, most talented
scientist, artists, social

814
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:22,220
activists, going into these
states in a systematic fashion.

815
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,400
I mean, can you imagine a
protocol if we had 100 of such

816
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:30,080
people working one day a month
for two years, what body of

817
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,900
knowledge they would come back
with and would be able to share?

818
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:36,440
It's never the experience of the
any individual which is

819
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,120
important. It's the experience
of our collective of our

820
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:44,020
collective genius and our
collective talent as we are

821
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:49,600
engaged. So I stretch language.
I stretch language. It's as big

822
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:54,220
as the universe. It's, it's
deeper than time, it's, it's

823
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,580
more intelligent than any
intelligence I can ever been

824
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:03,240
able to touch inside time and
space and the compassion, which

825
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,200
is the emotion of oneness. It's
when the quantum physicists talk

826
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,500
about, you know, the implicate
order, the oneness that

827
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,640
underlies all manifest
existence, that implicate order

828
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,720
has a wholeness, that when I
touch it, it just explodes me

829
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:24,260
with love, because love is the
emotion of oneness. But I don't

830
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:27,260
mean love in an ordinary sense
of love, but it's kind of the

831
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:32,120
closest approximation I have. So
you're right that I am using

832
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:36,620
universe in a borrowed fashion,
and I'm using it in an

833
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,060
extrapolated fashion.

834
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,400
David Lorimer: Thank you very
much. I think it's I mean, what?

835
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,220
For those of you who've read the
book, you'll you'll understand

836
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:51,460
that the or the books that, for
me, the way that you, you

837
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:58,060
articulate these ineffable
experiences into language gives

838
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:04,620
me the sense that I'm I'm as
near vicariously as I can get to

839
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:11,220
that Gnosis, the understanding
from within and in the Galileo

840
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,000
Commission, we talk about
exploring inner space. And so in

841
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,960
that sense, you're a Psychonaut,
obviously, of exploration of

842
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,940
inner space. So thank you very
much for that question. Next

843
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,920
question is from our president,
Professor, Bernard Carr in

844
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,280
London.

845
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:34,520
Unknown: Bernard, Oh, hi there,
Chris, good to see you, and you

846
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,000
too. First of all, thank you for
well, for taking this, this

847
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,260
cosmic journey, and then for
coming to, coming back to tell

848
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:46,300
us all about it. It was
absolutely engrossing. I noticed

849
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,580
at one point you said you rather
wish you had a degree in

850
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:52,540
astrophysics, and then you will
be able to in another way. Well,

851
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,260
I have a degree in astrophysics,
and I rather wish I had a degree

852
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:02,580
in psychedelics. But my question
really is a follow up to Paul

853
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:07,320
kind of it's this question about
the use of the word universe,

854
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:11,520
because there's sort of a
distinction between your

855
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,660
constant references to humanity
as a species, and then your

856
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,980
description in cosmological
terms, Where you know even your

857
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:26,060
images are from cosmology, and
you said that in some sense that

858
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,840
you that was poetic license. But
on the other hand, it does seem

859
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:33,920
to me that if you really are
contacting in that greater

860
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,260
reality, that cosmic
consciousness, you really will

861
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:40,540
be contacting if you like, a
cosmic level of consciousness,

862
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,140
not just the terrestrial level
of consciousness. And if, for

863
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:47,500
example, one studies the
writings of Buddha, when Buddha

864
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:50,860
in the vasuti Marga, when he had
his experiences, he was very

865
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:55,180
explicit in the fact that he was
experiencing realities beyond

866
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:57,820
the normal terrestrial, you
know, the galactic and the

867
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:02,280
cosmic and things like that. So
my question was this, although

868
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:07,740
you're always referring to
humanity, humanity is something

869
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:11,040
which, by definition, is very
much linked with Planet Earth.

870
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:16,500
Did you ever feel that actually
what you were encountering was

871
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,240
something on a scale much larger
than humanity? In other words,

872
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,220
that it really was cosmic.

873
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:28,640
Chris Bache: Yes, absolutely.
And again, I wish I had your

874
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,140
degrees. The universe could have
taught me so much more than but

875
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:37,700
when I entered in dark, into
archetypal reality, and I said,

876
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:42,220
I died as a human being, as of
my species identity. From that

877
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:47,500
point on in the journey my
sessions basically took me

878
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:53,200
outside of the operational range
of our collective psyche,

879
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,740
outside of human experience,
outside of human history, when I

880
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:59,920
began to move beyond the
collective psyche, everything

881
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:05,820
associated and held within the
collective psyche began to fall

882
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:11,040
away. All our understandings of
God, all our projections of God,

883
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:16,920
all the the flotsam and jetsam
of history just fell away, and I

884
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,040
moved into these hyper,
increasingly clear, hyper clear

885
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:24,740
states of consciousness harder
to describe because so

886
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:30,560
contentless. And I don't think
I, I think we can be very

887
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,820
cavalier about language, and I
and I apologize if I've

888
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:39,320
contributed to that, but I think
when we talk about universal

889
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:45,100
mind or cosmic mind. These are
huge, huge concepts, and I would

890
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:50,200
say that the only part of that
mind that I know and learned

891
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:54,340
about was the part that it
taught me about. There was a

892
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,400
consciousness which took me in.
There was a consciousness that

893
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:02,220
taught me, broke me down, count
me, grounded me up into dust,

894
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,020
and took me deeper and deeper
into itself. But even so, I know

895
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:13,260
I was only experiencing pieces,
aspects, fractal manifestations

896
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:18,900
of its totality. So my language
peters out at that deep level.

897
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:24,260
In when I moved into diamond
Luminosity, I had a very clear

898
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:29,900
perception of moving outside of
Samsara, outside the Bardo, into

899
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:34,520
a reality that's truly even
outside archetypal reality.

900
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,000
There was a period when I was
born into archetypal reality,

901
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,080
and then there was a process in
which I was born out of

902
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:47,380
archetypal reality into into a
level of reality which pre

903
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:50,440
exists before archetypal
reality?

904
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,240
Unknown: Yeah, non physical,
yeah.

905
01:12:55,299 --> 01:12:58,119
Chris Bache: Thank you very
absolutely non physical.

906
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,440
David Lorimer: I'm just going to
take an observation from the

907
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:06,300
chat from Sri about in your
journeys, did you get a sense of

908
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,360
why we seem to learn only
through pain and suffering the

909
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,200
divine heritage we come from or
must return to? Why was this

910
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,740
path into matter, back back to
into spirit, necessary? And of

911
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:23,840
course, that's sort of 64,000
and it reminds me of this, which

912
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,240
you will have heard before,
probably, that there are only

913
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,300
two reasons we change,
desperation or inspiration,

914
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,400
where we certainly change, if
we're desperate and we can

915
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,000
preemptively change, perhaps if
we're inspired. I mean, for me,

916
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,100
this is part of the kind of
gnostic myth that we forget, we

917
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:45,460
fall into darkness, we try and
return to the light, and we

918
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:48,280
forget who we are. We then have
to try and remember who we are.

919
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,820
We go to sleep. We have to wake
up. It just seems to be how

920
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:55,000
things are constituted. Is that
your view? Or do you have

921
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:55,480
another

922
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,080
Chris Bache: I agree with you,
and this is my experience. Is

923
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,560
when I would go deeper and
deeper and deeper into these

924
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,400
levels of reality. I always
experienced it as a remembering.

925
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:09,180
I was remembering. I was
remembering, and I didn't. I

926
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,960
don't have any sense that in
forgetting that that was a

927
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,760
tragedy, or that was somehow my
mistake, or some cosmic sin, or

928
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,340
some, you know, original sin, it
seemed to be part of the natural

929
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:26,960
order of things. There is the
greater and there is the lesser.

930
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,220
When we come into the lesser, we
forget, but we have to remember,

931
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,000
everything that we're describing
is constantly changing. It's

932
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:41,740
constantly evolving. So that I
don't think, I think, I think we

933
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:46,180
have had a tendency to sort of
freeze our level of evolutionary

934
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:50,080
maturity and to form judgments
around how we got here, where

935
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,260
we're going and what we're
doing. And we have to let go of

936
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:58,180
all these sort of fixated
fragments, because the human

937
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:02,040
being as Sri Aurobindo. Said, is
a transitional being. We are

938
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,100
moving from what we were to what
we are becoming. We are

939
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,980
changing. Life is changing.
Planets are changing. Our

940
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:13,200
species is changing. We are in
movement. And so why things are

941
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,160
the way they are isn't on isn't
something that we can answer on

942
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,540
an absolute scale. It's
something we can only answer on

943
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:24,920
an evolving try to answer an
evolving scale. But that, of

944
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:29,780
course, requires expanding our
time horizon enormously. When a

945
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:33,020
geologist helps us expand our
time horizon and helps us

946
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:36,500
understand plate tectonics,
that's extraordinarily exciting,

947
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,260
or when a physicist helps us
understand the evolution of

948
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:43,000
galaxies, it's extraordinarily
exciting. This is something

949
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,900
similar. We have to expand
beyond our personal

950
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:51,040
consciousness to to have
something about the

951
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,720
intentionality that's
manifesting itself in this ever

952
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,200
evolving, magnificent universe
that we are part of.

953
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,900
David Lorimer: So we need to
tune into that part of ourselves

954
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:08,580
that we not take any more
questions. By the way, we need

955
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:12,240
to tune into that part of
ourselves which knows, as you

956
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,780
said, that we're here. We're
here for the ride. No, fasten

957
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:22,040
the seat belts, or maybe not
fasten the seat belts. So we, if

958
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:26,120
we, if we're really centered as
we go through this process, and

959
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,120
then we'll get the guidance we
need, both individually and

960
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,140
collectively. But we need to
listen to that, that guidance,

961
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:37,340
and we need to enable the new
shoots. And there's so much

962
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:40,420
creative thinking going on. I
was in a group this afternoon on

963
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:45,280
the spiritual spirituality and
Education Alliance and and so

964
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,860
there's a huge amount of good
going on that we don't hear

965
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:51,700
about, except in positive news.
Humanity rising. Thank you.

966
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:56,680
That's also humanity rising, and
all the ubiquity University. And

967
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:01,020
so we need to keep ourselves
buoyed up, I think, by by by the

968
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:05,040
positive things that are going
on, but also, as you say, face

969
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,600
down the negative with with the
kind of courage that you

970
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:14,580
demonstrated in your journey.
And so I think I thank you on

971
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:18,780
behalf of us all for the journey
you took and for bringing back

972
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:25,820
these treasures, these gems that
we can actually appreciate, and

973
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:29,480
we can appropriate some of these
for our own journey and

974
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:34,220
understanding just because you
have made that journey. And so I

975
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:39,200
really salute you for that, that
Odyssey, I mean, you could

976
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:45,520
translate it into the hero's
journey and just just a point of

977
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,880
information for people. I
mentioned Thomas troward moment

978
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,420
ago. This is a book here which I
would recommend as a good

979
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:56,620
starter for from Thomas troward.
It's called The Wisdom of Thomas

980
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:01,320
troward, and it has four of his
main sets of lectures in it. He

981
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,960
was a judge in India, and you
can really get to grips with

982
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:08,460
this stuff. And so I do
recommend he talked about self

983
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,760
recognition. When the universal
became the particular in us,

984
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,760
then we had to recognize
ourselves back again as the

985
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,020
universal. And so he was
actually talking about these

986
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:25,520
things in his own way, no 100
years ago. So we're all trying

987
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,140
to catch up with a perennial, as
it were, and live through it. So

988
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:34,640
everybody on the call. Thank you
so much for coming and being

989
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,100
part of this evening. I hope
you've been inspired by it. I

990
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:40,040
hope that you've learned
something that you can apply to

991
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,600
your own lives to your own
journey. And and Andrew, thank

992
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,360
you very much for all the
coordination. Jess. Jessica

993
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,140
cornet, thank you for all the
help with the publicity. And

994
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:55,300
Chris, thank you so much for
sharing that deep wisdom, which

995
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:01,560
we really all need to take on
board in the the rapids that we

996
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:07,740
are entering at the moment. So I
look forward to seeing everybody

997
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:11,580
on a future event. And good
night everybody, and God bless

998
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,200
much love and light to you all.
You.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Unknown: A guy I was speaking to
at an integration circle. He

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,640
mentioned he had a mystical
experience where he encountered

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,320
none other than Ganesh, the
elephant god of Hinduism. After

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,200
your journeys, how would you
reflect on sort of the meaning

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,520
of encountering, say, a
particular form of a deity or or

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,060
something like

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,100
Chris Bache: that, when we
experience realities that are

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,520
beyond us, or consciousness,
dimensions of consciousness that

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,880
are beyond our own. And when
we're tapping into those

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,280
qualities that are like infinite
compassion and infinite

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,220
intelligence and infinite
creativity, these are qualities

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,120
that we tend to associate
historically with various

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,860
deities, and it's not surprising
that our mind would put together

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,420
the qualities of the
phenomenology of the experience

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,560
with the qualities of the
deities which we may or may may

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,460
have had experience exposure to
intellectually and sometimes we

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,760
counter deities that we haven't
they're not part of our own

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,640
personal lineage and may not
have been part of our they may

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,880
not have been something even
that we knew about. It comes

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,780
completely out of left field,
and yet it bears the form of a

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,940
culture's form of this deity
like Ganesh or Jesus or Mary, or

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,660
the Prophet Muhammad or
something like that. So my

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,320
understanding of it is that when
you are working or when you are

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,360
engaging entities or forms that
have this quality of an entity

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,720
that is identifiable in our
historical traditions, my sense

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,800
is that we are engaging a
collective thought form or a

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,340
spiritual being that is wearing
the clothes of a collective

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,580
thought form. And by collective
thought form, I mean, if you

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,300
have millions and millions of
devotees that meditate and pray

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,140
and offer devotions to a
particular deity, form which has

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,140
been identified in their
scripture, which is painted in

32
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,920
their culture, statuary is all
of this form. If you have

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,460
millions and millions and
millions and millions of being,

34
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,600
over 1000s of years, in
devotional attachment to these

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,640
forms, or devotional focus on
these forms. I think it creates

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,620
a certain structure in the
collective psyche, a collective

37
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,600
thought form. And I don't
minimize those forms. I think

38
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,140
they're extraordinarily
powerful, including secular

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,920
thought forms like greed, power,
anger, those you know, very

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,580
powerful in our system. So when
we encounter the deity in a or a

41
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,600
deity in a particular form, we
are either encountering a

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,980
spiritual principle which is
beyond form, which is wearing

43
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,320
the form of this collective
garment, or we're experiencing

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,940
the collective garment straight
out in itself. Either way, the

45
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,780
collective psyche is implicated.
The collective psyche is part of

46
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,980
our experience which is all
perfectly normal and perfectly

47
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,940
well and good. I think at the
same time, I would hold out that

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,220
it is possible to go beyond all
collective thought forms and to

49
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,160
go beyond human history in one's
experience. And when one does,

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,900
those forms tend to fade away. I
know there's a lot of discussion

51
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,780
of entities, because
particularly DMT and DMT

52
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,940
derivatives often expose people
to entities. And I'm not

53
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,060
suggesting that those entities
aren't real or the entities

54
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,000
don't exist, but to me,
personally, and again,

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,520
limitations, but personally
those entities reflect different

56
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,620
levels of reality, that as you
go deeper those level that that

57
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,420
kind of granular quality of lots
of individual beings tends to

58
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,200
yield to levels of reality which
are less granular, fewer

59
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,340
individual beings, kind of
constituting the population of

60
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,260
those levels of reality and
opening up into vast tracks of

61
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,700
consciousness which are less
individual, less entity, like at

62
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,540
least it is In my experience,
yeah,

63
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:43,599
Unknown: that definitely seems
to resonate in terms of it being

64
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:48,879
sort of a matter of levels. And
after seeing sort of where you

65
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,459
go in those levels, it makes a
lot more sense that at some

66
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,799
point, even those dissolve and
become something different.

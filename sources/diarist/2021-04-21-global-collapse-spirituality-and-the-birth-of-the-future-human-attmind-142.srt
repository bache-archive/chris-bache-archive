00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:36,260
James Jesso: You foreign. Hello
everyone. Welcome to Adventures

2
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,460
through the mind. I'm your host,
as always, James W Jesso, this

3
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,140
podcast explores topics relevant
and related to psychedelic

4
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,380
culture, medicine and research.
And I'm going to start this one

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,540
off with a question. Have you
ever wondered what 76 high dose

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,800
LSD sessions over the course of
20 years might teach a person

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,800
about how to make sense
spiritually of a global crisis

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,580
and perhaps the collapse of
civilization as we know it.

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,720
Well, if you wondered about
that, you're in luck for this

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,660
episode, because that's exactly
what we're going to talk about.

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,500
We're talking with Christopher
Bache, the author of this book,

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
LSD and the mind of the
universe. Christopher M Bache is

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
a professor emeritus in the
Department of Philosophy and

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,780
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University, where he has

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,560
taught for 33 years, a fellow at
the Institute of Noetic

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,100
Sciences. He is also adjunct
faculty at the California

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,460
Institute of integral studies
and on the advisory board for

18
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,260
Grof Transpersonal training and
the Grof Foundation, an award

19
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,840
winning teacher and
international speaker. He is the

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,220
author of three books, and he's
been on the show previously, oh,

21
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,460
I forgot to get the number of
that episode one second, Episode

22
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,300
89 mapping consciousness with
high dose LSD, where we talked

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:02,100
about, essentially what this was
all about. His, his 70, excuse

24
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,900
me, 73 high dose LSD journeys
over 20 years, and what he

25
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,220
experienced and what he learned
about the nature of reality and

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,800
the nature of the universe
throughout the course of it. Now

27
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,720
this is sort of a follow up from
that, from that interview, and

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,440
it was intended to be, as you'll
hear in the beginning, a

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,680
discussion of various different
themes of the book, but pretty

30
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,460
quickly, it focused on a
particular aspect of the book,

31
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,960
which is that while Chris was
having experiences of deep time,

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,700
which is sort of like you can
imagine experiencing the entire

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,120
course of The human existence as
a singular moment, or the entire

34
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,020
entirety of time and space as a
singular thing, for example,

35
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,160
although he does a better job
explaining it, he had a vision

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,220
at one point of what he called
the birth of the future human,

37
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,380
and it coming out of basically
extreme cataclysm, in some sense

38
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,660
or another, a long phase of
extreme strife and grief and

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,440
suffering and challenges that
pushes humanity into its next

40
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,240
phase of evolution. And Chris
considers where we're at now to

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,780
sort of be the start of that. So
what initially was going to be

42
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,920
me just taking quotes out of
this incredible book, turned out

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,220
to be a discussion with with
Chris about the crazy situation

44
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,940
we seem to be in as a planet
right now, and what, from his

45
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,560
perspective, is a is the sort of
spiritual meaning of it, or how

46
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,840
we might approach it
spiritually. And yeah, so that's

47
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,580
what we talk about now. This
interview was actually recorded

48
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
in September of 2020, I'm not
entirely sure why it took me so

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,160
long. You know what? I'll tell
you why it took me so long to

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,400
get it out is because I was in
the interview. I actually was

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,340
going through a difficult time,
and at some point it became less

52
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,220
of an interview and more of a
young man pleading to an older

53
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,960
man for some sort of wisdom to
make sense of crisis, make sense

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,800
of the challenges personally and
existentially, that I felt like

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,140
I was facing in the moment and
still kind of feel like I'm

56
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,660
facing, and maybe I was a little
embarrassed about that. I don't

57
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,020
know. But either way, now is the
time that it's coming out, and

58
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,160
some of you might seem to see
some similarities in some of the

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,040
topics to some recent
controversies in the five Meo

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,260
DMT world. But none of this is a
response to that. This is was

61
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,120
actually recorded. What is it
now? April, so like more than

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,100
six, more than six months ago.
So yeah, that's for context.

63
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,560
It's happening. This was
recorded September 2020, another

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,720
point of process about it is
that Chris's sound is not always

65
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,640
super great. There's some
banging, some knocking in the

66
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,460
background. Did my best to clean
it up, removed a lot of stuff

67
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,600
that you won't hear, but bear
with it a little bit. In fact,

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,640
there's one point where he's
saying something super

69
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,640
meaningful, and it is like some
loud thing comes in the

70
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,600
background that's so distracting
at this moment. That feels like

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,840
just such a like a pinnacle of,
like the value of what he's

72
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,780
offering. It just like, it's
just an interesting sort of,

73
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,400
like reality dance moment. But
anyway, so that's those. Those

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,360
are the caveats, and that's,
that's the interview we got

75
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,120
today with Christopher Bache
before we get into it. I want to

76
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,160
give a big thanks to my Patrons

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,000

regardless, you know or well, as

93
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,100
best I can. Okay, so that's all.
That's all for this intro. Stay

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,820
tuned to the end. I got a
special announcement, but here

95
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,020
we go. But here we go. This is
my interview, my second

96
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,320
interview with Christopher Bache
here on adventures through the

97
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,700
mind. Enjoy. So Chris, I had
been, I had been going through.

98
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,720
I had been going through, like,
the extensive amount of notes I

99
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,260
have, like, I'd listen to our
first podcast again, and I went

100
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,800
back through the notes I took
when I was in your workshop in

101
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,140
Vancouver, and also was going
through the book. And I just, I

102
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,240
kept wondering to myself, like,
what, what's the course here, I

103
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,560
felt like, in our first in our
first interview, I had the

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,160
ability to to have listened to
your talks and had paid

105
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,820
attention to the way that you
structure your lectures, and

106
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,500
then sort of utilize that as the
LE, as the, as the, sort of like

107
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,360
as the path to walk, having a
sense of how you start, what you

108
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,660
talk about, and where you go,
and then sort of use that as the

109
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,460
way. And I didn't have that this
time, and so, and if you're okay

110
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,740
with it, I thought we might be
interesting, because I have your

111
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,920
book here, and as you can see,
I've had, I've had quite a

112
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,900
Unknown: time book, yeah. Author
loves to see it, yeah? Very

113
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,100
Yeah. I moved, I moved

114
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,440
James Jesso: on to little tabs,
because I was like, Well, you

115
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,340
know what? As much as, as much
as most like authors like, oh

116
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,880
yeah, write in it, fold up the
pages, whatever works. I just

117
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,120
kind of grew out of wanting to
destroy the paper that holds the

118
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,400
book. Yeah? So I thought maybe
it would be fun, if you're open

119
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,940
to it, that I would just go into
some of the things that I've

120
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,540
felt really moved by or relevant
in your book, read the piece,

121
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,020
and then be like, What is this?
And have you sort of like, speak

122
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,820
to that. Would that feel cool
for you?

123
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,100
Chris Bache: Sure that's fine,
great. And I'll tell you too

124
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:25,280
that now that came out, books
out, first round of interviews

125
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,580
and all that stuff covid hit,
stepping back digesting people's

126
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,840
first reactions, I don't think I
sent you a copy of an article

127
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,160
that I just sent to Cy MedNet In
unit in England, basically, I'm

128
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,420
calling it a post script to LSD.
In the mind of the universe,

129
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,360
it's responding to people's
first takes on the book, first

130
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,860
round of experiences. But in
that process, I'm finding that

131
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:04,560
there is a whole nother tier of
the implications of these

132
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,340
potentials, which I just feel
like I'm beginning to want to

133
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:18,120
get into. It's like nothing new.
And at the same time, the sheer

134
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,620
the sheer audacity of the claims
concerning the limits and the

135
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,040
revised limits of human
experience, what we're capable

136
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,780
of, and the import of entering
such deep intimacy with the

137
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,740
consciousness of the universe.
It's all just sinking into me at

138
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,320
a new level. So that's a
constant conversation. I'm

139
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,460
really glad to be doing this
second bite at the apple,

140
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,600
something different, and there's
been a whole lot of first

141
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,820
interviews. And I'm glad to see
I'm glad to spend this time with

142
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,260
you, and happy to see where we

143
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,040
James Jesso: go. I. Cool is
that, is that something that you

144
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,040
feel because I'm I'm ready and
willing to adapt? Is that

145
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,800
something that you feel like
you'd like to get into? Or is it

146
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,220
something where, if I pick a
section of the book, it can work

147
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,580
as a reference point, even for
your sort of like the second

148
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,980
tier of your considerations on
the impact of the book?

149
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,680
Chris Bache: Yeah, let's do I
trust it'll it'll come up where

150
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,020
it's relevant in our discussion.
Yeah, because it floats in the

151
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,340
back and it's not like a
specific set of themes, it's,

152
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,000
it's

153
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,080
portly, partly, it's the
enormity of the vision of

154
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,400
history that's involved, and it
seems like we're getting into

155
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,580
that episode, a period of
history faster than I thought we

156
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,680
were going to be getting into
it. And partly, it's simply the

157
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:06,840
sheer scale of the of the
undertaking, but it'll come up

158
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,080
when, as it comes up, it'll flow
as it comes up in our

159
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,880
discussion. I trust our
discussion.

160
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,580
James Jesso: Well, I mean, I
think it's right here, right

161
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,100
now, because this is something
that definitely came up for me

162
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,220
as I was reading near the end of
the book. Because I read it, I

163
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,660
read it this year. I read it
during the 2020, pandemic

164
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,260
lockdown. You know, it was one
of the things I was I was

165
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,800
immersing myself in while I was
locked away from the world.

166
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,680
Really no different than I would
have been otherwise, except I

167
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,920
didn't have social events to
unfurl into, you know, at the

168
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,020
end of the day and on the
weekends. Oh, not to mention all

169
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,720
the existential, you know, like
gravity of it all. But one of

170
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
the things is, you get to a
point where you, you, you're

171
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,900
talking about this, sort of,
like, this, I'm not using your

172
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,600
terminology here, or maybe I
accidentally am, because I

173
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,840
forget what it was. But
something about, like, basically

174
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,560
being this rock tumbler, and
that this, this future human, is

175
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,220
going to emerge out of, like
deep strife and struggle and

176
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,640
pain and yeah, these sort of
like this, look at what will

177
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,540
become history as being an
event, Not too similar,

178
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,920
something analogous, analogous
to the cleansing process of your

179
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,240
psychedelic explorations, and
strictly So, yeah, and so, as I

180
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,540
was reading it, I was like, Man,
I kind of feel like, I kind of

181
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,140
feel like, on one level, I'd be,
I might be foolish to think

182
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,380
we're already there despite how
bad this is. This is nothing,

183
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,640
you know. This is ultimately
just a virus, right? And just,

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,640
yeah, yeah, but, but how do you
feel about it?

185
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,540
Chris Bache: I think of it as an
overture. It contains some of

186
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,720
the key elements of the symphony
that's coming, but only in

187
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,880
short, abbreviated forms. It's
mobilizing us. I think what's

188
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,940
coming is going to be much, much
worse, but if we learn this is

189
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,060
sort of disoriented us a lot,
and it's given us a lot of

190
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,140
lessons, and hopefully it's
giving us learnings, teachings

191
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,340
that will help us in what comes
next. But you're right, this is

192
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,740
just this is just act one, just
an overture.

193
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,300
James Jesso: Yeah, stress test
is how I heard it described

194
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,840
early on, like this. This is a
stress of course, it's it has

195
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,560
evolved well and beyond just the
pandemic, we have sort of the

196
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,980
total dissolution of what was
once thought of as of objective

197
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,480
reality due to the impact of
multiple what I have heard

198
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,160
described as multi level
narrative warfare and the

199
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,420
destruction of deep, considerate
or coherent thinking and dialog

200
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,040
because of social media and how
the news and then the, you know,

201
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,980
all the populism and
nationalism, and also the big

202
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,420
push back against these types of
things as Well, especially black

203
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,100
lives matter and stuff like
that, yeah. But, and at the same

204
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,840
time, it's like, this really is
not nearly as bad as it could

205
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,880
get, or maybe will get, yeah,

206
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,200
Chris Bache: yeah, I think so. I
think you're right. In fact, let

207
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,320
me grab a book to bring it up
here to bill, because I'm

208
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,220
probably going to want to
mention it somewhere in this

209
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,180
process. And I'd like to have
the cover to show you Sure. This

210
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:33,380
is a book I went to get Dwayne
Elgin's last book, choosing

211
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:39,320
Earth. It's lifetime, literally
a lifetime, of research going

212
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,560
into it. And he gives he has a
he's a social activist, and a

213
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,120
very detailed decade by decade,
what he thinks is coming. And he

214
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,980
really marshals. He's been
tracking the large scientific

215
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:00,180
data global health of the planet
people for a long time in. And

216
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,880
he has a he really lays out a
time of increasingly tight

217
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,280
collapse over the next several
decades. He really thinks by

218
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:17,880
2050 we're going to be more than
halfway into the great collapse.

219
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,180
So I just want to bring it in to
mention it when it comes up.

220
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,280
James Jesso: Yeah, that's, um,
so then what's coming up for me

221
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,640
right now is it, is this
question of, of and I for

222
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,440
listeners, you know, if yes, if
they're hearing and getting your

223
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,960
work for the first is this the
first encounter with you? This

224
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,620
might be all of a sudden, like,
whoa. How are we already on the

225
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,580
deep end here, but this is very
much a continuing conversation

226
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,560
between you and I, and then also
with your work. Yeah, I noticed

227
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,640
what comes up for me is this,
this, this, you know, the

228
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,020
immediate like, what do we do?
What do I do? Kind of like that,

229
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,720
sort of quick to problem solve,
fix, action now forward, rather

230
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,500
than how did we get here? What
does this mean? How did we how

231
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,220
do we come to understand what's
happening prior to even coming

232
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,100
to understand what an action
based solution is? And I'm

233
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,860
curious for you where, where you
see that process of coming to

234
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,400
understand where we are is,
yeah, something akin to, you

235
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,300
know, you're mentioning about,
you know, something about a lot

236
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,260
of lessons here. What do you
think these lessons are? What

237
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,680
are we learning? And, in fact,
perhaps, what does it appear

238
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,620
from where you're sitting that
we're not learning out of all of

239
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,160
this?

240
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,420
Chris Bache: Yeah? Well, I don't
I have to be careful. I'm not on

241
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,960
the front line. I have only
second hand information from the

242
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,000
news accounts. As I watched
people react and respond, we're

243
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,020
learning a number of things. One
of them is we're learning the

244
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,820
fragility of our of our system.
We're learning our

245
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,260
interconnectedness, how systems
that have functioned quietly,

246
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,900
side by side, seemingly
independently, they're not

247
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,840
independent at all. They're
quite interdependent. We're

248
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,280
learning a lot about supply
chains and how our where our

249
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,600
resources come from, and we're
learning that that people who

250
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,460
have very modest jobs, from some
socio economic viewpoint, to

251
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,880
have very important jobs when it
comes to maintaining the health

252
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,900
and well being of our of our
collective so I think we're

253
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,520
learning interdependence. We're
learning our entire life can be

254
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,540
turned upside down much faster
than we thought it could. We

255
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:54,340
don't have as nearly as much
stability as we think we do. I

256
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,720
think we're learning something
about the limits of patriarchal

257
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,180
ego, and I think Trump is the
embodiment, I hope, of the last

258
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,680
gasp of the patriarchal
monarchy. We're learning how

259
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:14,160
ugly ego is, just how really,
really ugly it is, and we're

260
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,420
learning a lot about where to go
and where not to go when we come

261
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,220
into crisis. This polarization
is taking place, the resort to

262
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,320
violence, how quickly we move to
violence? And it's like we take

263
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,840
almost any issue, no matter how
trivial, like mass, and turn it

264
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,140
into an issue which leads to
people killing each other. I

265
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,840
mean, it's just the mirror. What
we're seeing in the mirror is

266
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,940
not very complementary. It's
pretty ugly. The way I sort of

267
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,340
see the larger landscape, of
course, is that,

268
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,140
in so many ways, it's ego that
built our culture. And by that,

269
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,920
I mean simply, it's a human
being at a level of spiritual

270
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,160
development which identifies
with their body, has a certain

271
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,000
level of self awareness, but
that self awareness stops pretty

272
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,140
close to the edge of their
fingers and toes, and they still

273
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,800
are looking out rationally,
looking out for their well being

274
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,920
and the well being of a small
number of people near them and

275
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,860
around them who basically look
like them or related to them in

276
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,640
some fundamental way. Ego is a
magnificent thing, a beautiful

277
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,100
thing, an important thing, but a
world built by a species that's

278
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:43,720
operating out of egoic awareness
is a divided world. It's a world

279
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,940
of haves and have nots, and we
can't get more extreme in the

280
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,080
presentation to ourselves, and
then the haves and have nots in

281
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,640
Dwayne's book, I came across the
statistic that five people own

282
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,280
as much of the world's resources
as. Half of the world, five

283
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,840
people have half of the world's
resources. You just can't have

284
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,280
that big a disparity of haves
and have nots. And it's just

285
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,020
being this illness is just
blasting this into our faces.

286
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,060
Who's suffering the most and
who's suffering the most are the

287
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:27,560
poor in persons of color. So a
lot going on, but this is just

288
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:33,560
warm up. This is just the first
wave. I think, I think maybe the

289
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,080
first wave might have been
actually the credit crisis of

290
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,860
2008 because that taught us some
things, and it also sucked a lot

291
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:45,220
of liquidity out of the system.
We have much less, much fewer

292
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,240
financial resources to fight
with than we did before. And now

293
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,140
this is getting deeper. You
know, national debt increases,

294
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,180
but certainly we are, if not in
the first round, we certainly

295
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,040
are in a significant second
round.

296
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,940
James Jesso: I mean, for for
listeners again, who don't know

297
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,820
like it wouldn't appear as
though this conversation is

298
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,460
couched in your 20 year journey,
your 40 year journey as a

299
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,360
philosophy professor, and a 20
year journey with high dose LSD

300
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,100
sessions, and the book that were
we were referring to earlier is

301
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,820
your book on those journeys, as
well as a number of other books.

302
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,520
And I'm just curious, because
what I'm seeing in the world,

303
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:44,080
which is mostly the world that
is mediated by a screen at this

304
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,300
point is not the kind of place I
really want to be both in. I

305
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,020
don't both in the sense of, I
don't want to be where it

306
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,200
appears we're going. I don't
want to be a part of a system

307
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,960
that does the things that it
does, you know, like the I don't

308
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,520
I don't like the fact that I'm a
part of this disgusting,

309
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,860
distorted thing, and also what I
see from the behavior of the

310
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,400
people around me. And there's a
lot to be said about how social

311
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,800
media algorithms and and
isolation and mental health

312
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,720
crises, acknowledged or not, are
contributing to this, but I see

313
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,580
a lot of toxic behavior, a lot
of toxic people, a lot of toxic

314
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,240
discussion, sort of, like,
draped in this sort of, like,

315
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,140
this sort of self confidence,
self righteous, almost

316
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,760
Machiavellian style, like
moralism, of like, the good

317
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,380
versus the evil, and the good is
me, And anyone that disagrees is

318
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,640
like the violent devil I must
cast out and and whatever else.

319
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,720
And I don't feel good about what
I'm seeing about the world, and

320
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:56,080
it makes me want to just like,
hide away inside now, yeah, that

321
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,080
said couching this in
psychedelics and looking at it

322
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,940
as as a large psychedelic I'm
using air quotes for listeners

323
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,240
process that's happening
collectively on a global scale,

324
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,000
not just with humanity, but
we're although we don't know

325
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,360
what the feelings and the
thoughts or perspectives are the

326
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,020
birds and the salamanders and
the and the whales and whatever.

327
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,180
You know they're going through
that with us. So it's like a

328
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,060
planet. It's like a planetary
experience, right? Yeah, that

329
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:31,940
when I see these parts of myself
in a psychedelic session, it's

330
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,420
no more comfortable by any
means. It's equally as ugly,

331
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,420
yeah, you know? And I want to
hide away from that too. And

332
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,160
yet, yeah, one of the things you
talk about in your book is that

333
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,020
you we need to learn as a part
of the psychedelic journey. We

334
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,100
need to learn how to not turn
away from our pain, or from that

335
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,980
pain, I mean, like the pain of
touching a hot fire we turn away

336
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,600
from, but this kind of pain that
we learn to turn towards it. And

337
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,100
I'm wondering if you could just
that's not a clear question, but

338
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,380
can you just comment on Yeah,
yeah.

339
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,300
Chris Bache: You know, the
starting point of serious

340
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,500
psychedelic work is taking
complete responsibility for

341
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,280
one's own shadow and and you
just go into a room, close the

342
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,600
door, lock the door. You're
inside by yourself, nothing

343
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,580
there but you and your mind. And
you go into the parts of your

344
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,480
being which are at least
initially, the most daunting,

345
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,900
the most intimidating, the most
frightening, the ugliest ones we

346
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,440
like to acknowledge, the least
you know, and but the commitment

347
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:51,880
is there to take that on, to
enter into it, when we see that

348
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,360
ugliness being manifested in the
world around us by people who

349
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,600
are not have not yet taken
responsibility for themselves,

350
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,900
and they are still. In this
exterior mode, where the shadow

351
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,480
was really outside of them, the
evil and the darkness and the

352
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,420
really ugly things were outside
of them. That's a very different

353
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,300
world, isn't it? And I think
this whole process of breaking

354
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,940
down, this breaking down process
that we're going into is

355
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,620
basically going to be breaking
down that defense that we have

356
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,420
to thinking that, you know,
we're the good guys or and the

357
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,900
other people are the bad guys.
And eventually we're going to

358
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,900
have to come to terms with the
fact that weird. We did this. We

359
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,820
created this imbalance. We have
benefited from it. We are

360
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,020
continuing to generate it in the
cars we drive, in the lives we

361
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,280
live and the lifestyles we
aspire to. We have done this. We

362
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,960
will we have done it. There's
going to come a time eventually

363
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,280
where there's no place else to
look but we have to take

364
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,840
individual and collective
responsibility for the pain that

365
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,100
is that is alive within us and
lives of everyone around us.

366
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:18,120
That really is a pivot point, I
think, when we just stop blaming

367
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,260
the other, stop blaming previous
generations. Stop blaming so on

368
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,400
so forth. We really settle in.
We're not there yet. Some of us

369
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,580
are there yet. I mean, I think
the psychedelic community

370
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,100
understands these things,
because that's how you make

371
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,080
progress in psychedelic work, is
you confront the shadow. Now,

372
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:45,820
when you go into the work, you
know that the more you purify,

373
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,180
the more you cleanse, the deeper
the reward, the deeper the

374
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,600
ecstasy, the deeper the
teaching. So the more you

375
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,960
purify, the deeper the
communion. Once you learn that

376
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,400
not only do you become more
comfortable facing the shadow,

377
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,720
but you actually actively
embrace the shadow. You active,

378
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,800
actively embrace pain and
suffering, not because you like

379
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,900
pain and suffering, but for two
reasons. One is because you

380
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,560
learned that the deeper the
purification, the deeper the

381
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,000
ecstasy. And you don't like to
suffer, but you like what's on

382
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,680
the other side of the suffering.
But the second thing is, you

383
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,460
embrace the pain and suffering,
even knowing that a lot of it is

384
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,960
not yours, because out of the
same compassion that every

385
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,560
father has for His children,
every mother has for her

386
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,300
children, and every teacher has
for all of their children

387
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,620
eventually that everybody has
for other people. And you

388
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,160
embrace the pain, not counting
whether it's yours or somebody

389
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,800
else's, but because by doing so,
you are helping somebody. You

390
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,200
are helping other beings that
you may never meet. And my

391
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,940
experiences has been that if you
do that, if you are willing to

392
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,220
take on more than your fair
share of suffering, you reap

393
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,840
more than your share of benefit.
You the universe responds. It

394
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,720
can't help but respond. And I
think that's going to be

395
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,880
happening with us,
generationally, this generation,

396
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,940
the next generation, the
generation after that, is going

397
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,080
to go through suffering, more
than their share of suffering

398
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,280
compared to previous
generations. And after they stop

399
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,240
kicking and screaming and begin
to get down to taking it on and

400
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,780
just doing it, I think they will
experience the blessings that

401
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:49,660
come from that deep generosity,
that that profound existential

402
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,940
choice to work with the given,
even when the given is terrible,

403
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,620
even when it kind of crushes
your personal life, but you

404
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,480
Still dedicate yourself to the
good of the whole. And in that

405
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,040
process, something begins to
change. Something shifts inside

406
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,600
your person, and the more
complete the surrender to the

407
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,040
process, the more complete the
commitment to that process, I

408
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,020
think the deeper and the faster
the transformation is in our

409
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,160
individual lives and our
collective lives, so that as we

410
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,340
move deeper into this and come
through it, I think

411
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,960
generationally, we will learn
what every psychedelic journeyer

412
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,360
learns, that we confront the
shadow there is Riches on the

413
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,940
other side of this ordeal, and
there's no other way to get to

414
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:48,760
it. And in the end, you the
irony is, you kind of end up

415
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,120
where you were in the beginning,
except you're all cleaned out.

416
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,800
You're just all sorts of this
gunk is out of your system. So

417
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,500
you are you, and you are where
you were before. Or but you

418
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,460
literally are living a different
life because stuff that you

419
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,240
hadn't realized was compromising
you and burdening you is no

420
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,980
longer there, and something new
has taken its place. I think

421
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,860
that's where we're going to be
going. It's going to take time.

422
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,380
James Jesso: There's a lot that
has kind of come up there for

423
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:29,180
me, as you were talking around
like the the complexity of the

424
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:35,960
situation and how each different
person and demographic is coming

425
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,960
at this differently, you know.
And then the confusion of what

426
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,420
is good or what is not, you
know, and then the kind of

427
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,560
getting into, you know, like, oh
yes, I'm gonna put myself in the

428
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,860
pain of this, you know, does
that look like being around

429
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,800
people? Like, does that mean
getting involved in places

430
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,880
where, you know, I'm interacting
with toxic people, you know,

431
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,900
there's, there's all these weird
sort of complications. And as

432
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,140
I'm listening, I'm I'm I'm
efforting to hear it from a

433
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,360
larger perspective than what's
happening right now, you know,

434
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,260
because if I think about
generations that suffer, I'd say

435
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,020
that right now, my demographic,
even my local community, you

436
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,820
know, is not suffering nearly as
much as people in the hardest

437
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,420
hit areas of the United States
with covid and not nearly as

438
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:32,060
much as people who are in
poverty or who are, you know,

439
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,700
are oppressed by systemic racism
or sexism or whatever it is. You

440
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,560
know, especially, of course,
systemic racism is a huge and

441
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,520
important issue, and very like
strong right now issues of

442
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,820
police violence and all the
rest. Yeah, but even then, it's

443
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,860
like, is, is that I'm just like,
trying to, trying to break out

444
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,220
of the thinking that wants to
immediately point to small

445
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,740
examples that don't fit into the
larger generational narrative.

446
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,160
And I'm wondering if there's, if
there's something there that you

447
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,300
want to comment on about, about
how the what you just said

448
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,080
applies to the acute as much as
the bigger picture. Yeah, you're

449
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,140
Chris Bache: certainly right. I
mean, in my local community,

450
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,800
we're not suffering, not badly,
and I'm retired and I'm the

451
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,820
hive, and lost my job, I don't I
know where my next meal is

452
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,180
coming from. And a lot of people
that's not true. And then if we

453
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:39,260
just expand the horizon, the the
hundreds of 1000s of people who

454
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,940
are migrants, who are
ecological, migrants who are

455
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,540
fleeing disastrous
circumstances, people whose

456
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,440
whole lives fit inside a bag, a
suitcase that they're carrying

457
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,920
everything they value in the
world. I mean, it's just the

458
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,940
upheaval. We don't have to go
very far to find it, but even if

459
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,400
it is far from our local
community, I live in a strange

460
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,000
world in that way. I mean, we
all watch television. We all try

461
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,680
to keep abreast of the larger
patterns that are out there. But

462
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,280
inwardly, because of the
psychedelic work, because I've

463
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,380
been dissolved so many times
over so many years into the

464
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:28,640
collective breath of humanity,
and because I've been drawn into

465
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
the collective Shadow Work, The
Dark Night of the collective

466
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,180
soul work, and have gone far
beyond The collective psyche

467
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,960
outside, as outside of the
Collective Unconscious into

468
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,900
larger patterns of time, deep
time, evolutionary time, which

469
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:55,480
you might think of as geologic
time. My insides are tuned a

470
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,680
little differently because I
sort of on a smaller scale, when

471
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,440
I see human beings, I don't see
human beings the way other

472
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,640
people tend to see human beings.
I see souls. I relate to human

473
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,520
beings as incarnations of souls.
And so I'm always tuning to the

474
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,320
soul quality of a person. And in
that respect, for example, we

475
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,840
can see young people who are
truly old in their heart and

476
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,380
mind, and we can see old people
who are like children in their

477
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:33,020
hearts and minds and everything
in between. So when I think of

478
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,220
the people and what we're seeing
on the streets and the people

479
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:43,900
riding around and pick up trucks
with carrying weapons, and I'm

480
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:49,300
seeing souls that are in a long
they're in one phase of a long

481
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,680
evolutionary journey at the
souls progression. And I have a

482
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,440
sense of some approximate sense
of the large scale of the self

483
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,640
education. Education, self,
maturational process, and some

484
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,740
of the stage points along that
that scale, and I don't bring

485
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,100
that as a model that allows me
to judge people and rank people

486
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:17,700
and classify people, but I
approach people. I approach

487
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,640
people knowing that their entire
current incarnation is just a

488
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:31,280
short phase of their larger
learning process, and so I

489
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,900
understand the challenges that
they're facing within this

490
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:45,820
larger context, within this
larger matrix. The tricky part

491
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,600
is you can get so absorbed into
large perspectives like that

492
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,800
that you can lose the immediate,
immediate suffering. You can

493
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,460
lose sight of what it actually
feels like to be undergoing the

494
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,500
privations right here, right
now, of many people. So you have

495
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,760
to live in both morals at the
same time. Yeah, at hand and the

496
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,260
large scale, my professional
work and my psychedelic work has

497
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,880
focused me on the large scale.

498
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,700
James Jesso: Chris, I
unexpectedly really have to pee.

499
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,360
I'm just going to take a take a
little me, and I'll be right

500
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:22,980
back.

501
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:29,360
Unknown: Okay, okay, wow, okay,
so free all of a sudden, much

502
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,720
better.

503
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:36,260
James Jesso: Yeah. So there's a
lot of inner conflict that's

504
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,260
coming up for me as a as I'm
listening to you, that part of

505
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,780
me is like, yes, and another
part of me is like,

506
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,980
does this like? It's the smaller
wind. It's the smaller frame of

507
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,140
like. But does saying it this
way? Does that? Does that equate

508
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,220
to passivity? Does that equate
to, you know? Like, you know, if

509
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,340
this is all a part of a larger
process, is me just looking at

510
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,900
myself, you know, like, is that
actually doing anything? I know,

511
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,600
if I look at a large picture,
yes, of course, it's doing

512
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,860
something. You know, I'm
whatever, helping to evolve and

513
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,440
churn my soul. And by doing good
as best I can, I help sort of

514
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,740
bring goodness into reality
more. And then it can be sort of

515
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:33,920
like in engaged in other
people's realities or whatever

516
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,620
else. So on the on the one
level, I'm like, Yes, but on

517
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,620
another level, like, is that
really enough? There's a lot of

518
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,760
sort of psychedelic rhetoric
around, like, if we just gave

519
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,460
more people Psilocybin, then
we'd stop burning down the

520
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,300
rainforest, you know, if we, or
say, Ayahuasca, then we stop

521
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,420
burning down rainforest. We give
people enough Psilocybin, you

522
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:59,380
know, then we'll, we won't vote
in authoritarian leaders, right?

523
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,180
Yeah. But I think that that that
type of thinking, on some level,

524
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,920
feels really, it feels really
foolish, you know, to think that

525
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,000
if I just do the work that's
going to make big changes in the

526
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,820
world, that that's going to
properly address things, and

527
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,980
yet, there's this whole other
layer, which is like, but can I,

528
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,740
Can I really do any good as a
part of a social movement if I'm

529
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,960
showing up with hatred in my
heart and anger and just and

530
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,200
projection and just looking for
someone to blame for my

531
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,460
suffering, you know? And some
people are showing up because of

532
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,780
that, some, not all. Obviously,
I don't think the movements are

533
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,840
inspired by this. I think
they're inspired by a very

534
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,800
appropriate response to
injustice. Yeah? And then a

535
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,440
whole other layer of me is like,
Oh, if I say this wrong, will I

536
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,120
be canceled because of that sort
of like, yeah, Blamey

537
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,060
hatefulness in the heart. So
again, these aren't clear

538
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,720
questions. I almost like, I feel
like I'm just like, baring my

539
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,300
soul to you, Chris, like, Help
me understand.

540
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,440
Chris Bache: I understand. I
really do. Because if your

541
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,160
spirituality, if your genuine
spirituality, leads you away

542
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,420
from social engagement in the
world, then I don't think it's a

543
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,480
very mature spirituality,
because mature spirituality

544
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,260
leads to that place in the heart
where we contact the heart of

545
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,980
all living things. And when we
contact the heart of all living

546
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,900
things, naturally, we want to
help all living things. And so

547
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,140
the natural progression of deep
spiritual work, when it succeeds

548
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,600
is to be socially engaged in
some form or another, whatever

549
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,420
we feel particularly called to
some people are called to

550
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,540
medicine. They're going to do it
in medicine. Some people are

551
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,460
doing it with high tech, online,
international discussions. Some

552
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,920
people they're doing it in all
sorts of different ways. But.

553
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,560
The important thing is that we
find what it is that feels like

554
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:09,000
our niche, our particular
contribution to make, and we do

555
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,080
it. And you're right, if we do
it, when we do it, we'll

556
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,760
probably end up finding that
maybe we aren't as clean as we

557
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,860
thought we were going in. Okay,
so we step back, we clean, we

558
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:29,780
work that part. But yeah, I
understand the tension it I

559
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:35,420
would feel it more if I were a
young man like you. I'm older,

560
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,740
and I'm in my 70s, so in some
ways, I've had I've made my

561
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,860
decisions around those things.
I've made my choices, and mostly

562
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:51,700
I'm past that active time.
Except as a teacher, you know, I

563
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:57,580
write, I teach, I talk, I do
what I can. But other people my

564
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,840
age, they're on there, on the
front lines, they're much more

565
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,400
active on the front lines. They
really are plowing those fields.

566
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,260
They really they are getting the
vote out. They are working very

567
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,860
tangibly and practically to
bring about a better world.

568
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:25,400
No standardized rules for the
engagement, but we can feel when

569
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:32,720
there's a feeling in our center,
when we are aligned with our

570
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,560
place in the world and our place
in the movement. We've got a

571
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,300
balance point between inner and
outer, sheltered and exposed,

572
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,880
and so we're self correcting
that we're self correcting

573
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,260
beings. And what's most
important, I think, is not rules

574
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,220
of inner outer, or how to engage
and how, what, what not, what

575
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:02,580
not, but tuning into that point
in our center, which is our

576
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:07,140
connecting point to the larger
intelligence, which is always

577
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,800
trying to draw us towards deeper
and deeper levels of engagement

578
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,660
with itself, and that means with
the fabric of humanity and or

579
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,800
non human life forms, as you
Say, that are also being

580
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,940
affected a million species going
extinct, you know, as we stand

581
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,300
here, as we sit here, yeah,

582
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,000
James Jesso: I've been, I've
been sitting with the, you know,

583
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,640
we're, we were going to open up
your book, and maybe at some

584
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,580
point we will. I have been
sitting with the first thing I

585
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,580
wanted to open the book to the
first, the first part of the

586
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,720
book that received a red tab,
which was particularly important

587
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,640
for quoting or reference,

588
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:58,060
as I have coordinated the color
coding here and wondering How

589
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,440
much it applies

590
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:07,080
in the sort of like the the
comparing between a deep

591
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,500
psychedelic work or deep
psychedelic journey, and the

592
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,180
journey that we're on right now
as a as an entire planetary

593
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,680
organism facing the the
Increasing layers of collapse

594
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,400
and catastrophe and crisis that
is just funneling more and more

595
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:32,120
out of the year of clear vision.
And the part is about one of the

596
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,800
greatest risks of psychedelic
work, as you have put in the

597
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,700
book, being ego inflation. And
I'm curious looking around at

598
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,240
the world, that both people in
the psychedelic community, so

599
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,540
maybe it's a real micro scale of
like this is happening in psi

600
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,900
culture, you know, and then the
larger scale of like this is

601
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,340
what's this is what I'm seeing
play out in the in the big

602
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,280
characters, like the big
characters, like the

603
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,300
representations in the media and
so on and so forth. Yeah, I'm

604
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,100
just curious about your comments
on that.

605
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,880
Unknown: Well,

606
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,860
Chris Bache: you know, I'm
essentially a hermit, and even

607
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,620
though I am a member of the
psychedelic community, because

608
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:21,860
I'm involved in psychedelics and
thinking about them, and I don't

609
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,040
really have a lot of living
contact with the psychedelic

610
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,240
community. You know, you go to
conferences. You know, used to

611
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,780
go to conferences. You have
workshops here and there. You

612
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,500
teach here and there. But the
actual number of people from

613
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,540
this large community is
relatively small. You get

614
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,280
impressions from the books. But
again, since I'm older, I'm not

615
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,240
keeping track with all the
latest articles. I really will

616
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,360
just pay attention more to the
important books that come out,

617
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,820
not the small stuff. And so I
don't know really what's

618
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,500
happening in the psychedelic
community. E S, so I can't

619
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:08,760
generalize about that. I think
that in some ways, we're moving

620
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,220
into a psychedelic period of
history, and it may be starting

621
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,180
at low dose psychedelic history,
but we're going to be moving

622
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,480
into high dose psychedelic
history when there will in low

623
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,200
dose work, you may engage
voluntarily. You know the ego

624
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,640
dissolution process. In high
dose work, you will be engaged

625
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,120
whether you volunteer or not.
You will be go put through the

626
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,080
meat grinder. And I think we're
coming into a period of history

627
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,240
where right now we may choose
how to engage or how to pick the

628
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,780
pain, particular pain that we're
going to take on. There's going

629
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,660
to come a time. It's going to be
the Charles choices are going to

630
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,940
be made for us. We're going to
be surrounded by catastrophic

631
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,440
consequences of the historical
policies that we set in motion

632
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,640
for decades and hundreds of
years. So it's going to be, it's

633
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,000
truly like a hurricane coming
off shore. I mean, this is like

634
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,300
everybody's going to be
affected. Everybody's going to

635
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,180
be touched. It's not going to be
a pick and choose situation.

636
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,640
Unknown: So

637
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,700
Chris Bache: I think that the
great danger of psychic work is

638
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,260
of psychedelic work is psychic
inflation. That is, we think we

639
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,620
have we've had a deep
experience. We think we've

640
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,240
become a deep person. We've had
a great experience. We think

641
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,500
we've become a we are a great
being. And that, of course, is a

642
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,420
fool's delusion. Whether the
psychedelic community is in that

643
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,320
position, I don't know, because
I think you know, if you do have

644
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,500
that attitude, then your own
psychedelic sessions are going

645
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,140
to knock your feet out from
under you harder. It's going to

646
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,100
take you down. So you learn
pretty quickly that that's a

647
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,860
that's a dead end street to go
and it becomes much, much more

648
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,880
basic than that. And it's not
about having extraordinary

649
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,440
experiences. To me, it's not
about, I mean, it's not about

650
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:18,840
having ecstatic experiences or
having to me, it's about doing

651
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,080
whatever is necessary so that 48
hours after your session is

652
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:30,440
over, you're living a better
life than you did beforehand. So

653
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,000
you're either you spend your
psychedelic session, either

654
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,680
taking a vacation to Italy, or
you spend it carrying out the

655
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,360
garbage. Carrying out the
garbage is what's going to give

656
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,680
you a better life two days after
your session is over, and if you

657
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,280
carry out the garbage, well,
then you're going to see some

658
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,060
extraordinary things on the
other side. So for me, the real

659
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,120
work is carrying out the
garbage, that's I mean. And so

660
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,200
why would you ever want to
become more conscious than we

661
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,780
already are? If the consequence
of being more cost conscious is

662
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,220
to take more responsibility for
the garbage that you are part

663
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,880
of, it's in your system and it's
immediately around you. So when

664
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,020
you become more conscious,
you're going to have to do more

665
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:26,480
cleaning. So for some, I know
that other people don't

666
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,660
necessarily feel that way. For
them, psychedelics are a way to,

667
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,860
you know, access joy. And you
know, you access great joy,

668
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:42,220
great things, but when you come
by those great joyful

669
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,680
experiences of communion or
great cosmic insights that flow

670
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:54,940
into you when you come by them
through hard work, then I don't

671
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,720
think it then tends to lead to
psychic inflation so much

672
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,660
because you know the price
you've paid to receive these

673
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:09,840
blessings. You you understand
the deeper process, and that the

674
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,940
intelligence that gave you the
blessings is teaching you is,

675
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,680
you know, taking you along, step
by step. And so you these

676
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,720
blessings are not given out
lightly, but they're given out

677
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:29,120
intentionally. And if your if
your psychedelic work is is

678
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,060
really disciplined, and it's
really part of a spiritual

679
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:39,020
practice for you, then
everything that you're given is

680
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,600
also laying the foundation for
work that you're going to do and

681
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:49,000
gifts you will be given later,
because your entire relationship

682
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,400
with the universe is one of the
maturational development, and

683
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,840
once you kind of feel the rhythm
of this maturational development

684
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:05,220
over the course of years. Years
in your work, then that just

685
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:10,260
puts aside, it draws to a close,
all this sort of psychic

686
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:15,600
inflation bullshit. Because it
you know that that's just ego

687
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,900
dancing, and ego

688
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,320
Unknown: is the obstacle,

689
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,800
James Jesso: the the question
that's kind of like me, we've

690
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,400
kind of done this interesting,
sort of, like dance and quasi

691
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,460
pivot, you know, from these,
like, big, sort of global

692
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,900
crises, acute issues that we're
in right now and then, sort of

693
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,640
like, sort of like a larger
cosmological perspective of the

694
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,780
transformation of the human soul
over millennia, ultimately, and

695
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,920
that possibly we're in the we're
in the beginning of this great,

696
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,700
painful, suffering churning that
will eventually Polish us up on

697
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,800
the other side to becoming What
in the book you call the future

698
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,280
human, and now we're sort of,
like, back into that, kind of,

699
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,800
like, we've pivoted into, like,
direct psychedelic work. And I

700
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,180
don't know if this question
feels, I don't know if this

701
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,380
question is, is sort of almost,
um, like, trite in a way,

702
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:25,820
because it's, so general or
what, but I'm just holding it,

703
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:31,100
and it feels like I gotta ask
it, which is given where we are,

704
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,980
given what's happening. And
maybe you've already said this,

705
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,220
you've already answered this
somehow, but given where we are

706
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,100
from the perspective of the deep
psychedelic work that you've

707
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,920
done, you know, what does it
mean to be a good person right

708
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,420
now? What is it? What does it
mean to be what does it take,

709
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,700
you know, yeah, man,

710
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,200
Chris Bache: it's a large
question. I

711
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,360
I think of a half dozen ways to
answer that question pop into my

712
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,680
mind, and all of them are wrong,
so I'm kind of sifting through

713
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,820
layers. I

714
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,500
in some of my deepest
experiences, there are moments,

715
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:54,340
there are times when, and even
after a session, but under the

716
00:52:54,340 --> 00:53:01,800
influence of the learning of a
session, when something just

717
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,700
falls away, something opens

718
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:20,160
and I experience the world truly
as living and Breathing as one.

719
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,500
I feel like my feet are rooted
in the earth the way a tree is

720
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,260
rooted in the earth. I look down
at the grass, and I feel

721
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:32,060
complete continuity of being
between everything around me and

722
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:36,080
my own being. I feel us
breathing the same air. I feel

723
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:41,500
us all different species sharing
the same moment in time. I feel

724
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:48,340
the pulse of the universe in its
utter simplicity, not paying

725
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,660
attention to any of our
divisions of species or moods or

726
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:59,800
incarnations or anything like
that, the entire universe just

727
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:09,900
being itself, and I am part of
that in grateful it's not even

728
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,560
communion, because communion
implies a subtle duality, and

729
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:19,800
this is when all of that falls
away and a great transparency of

730
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,740
being opens. From within that
position,

731
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:49,960
I experience an opening of my
mind, kind of a delicious sense

732
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:57,460
of presence. It gives me an
intimacy with grass. And then at

733
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,540
a deeper level, I experience an
opening of my heart. Art in

734
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:07,320
which the idea of harming anyone
is the farthest thing from my

735
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:13,200
mind, and the idea of helping
everyone is the most natural

736
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:22,580
thing in the world. It's not
being good, it just it's it's

737
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:30,200
being alive within this reality
of oneness. So to me, goodness

738
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:36,200
is simply an approximation, or
it's a, it's a it's a compass

739
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:42,400
needle that points in the
direction of this fundamental

740
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,560
truth of oneness. And the truth
of oneness is all these

741
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:53,800
derivatives that flow from it
circumstances. But at essence,

742
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:59,380
it's very, very simple. And I
think compassion, goodness, in

743
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:05,220
that way, fairness, justice, are
all aspects of oneness. Are all

744
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:12,300
kind of fractal manifestations
of oneness. So what does it take

745
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:18,360
to be a good person today? I
think it takes a willingness, a

746
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,160
commitment, to serving a
collective good to serving a

747
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,260
good that's not private, that
opens up to future generations,

748
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,940
that opens up to people who are
unlike me and species who are

749
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:39,800
unlike me, just an honest
confrontation with What is in

750
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,860
order to bring about a better
life for other beings. I know

751
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:54,640
this is very simple, but to me,
goodness is is is simple. It is

752
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,620
that simple. It gets complicated
in the enacting of it, but in

753
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:05,700
the at its core, it. It's an
action that comes out of

754
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,240
oneness, and if it's not coming
out of a deep grounding in

755
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,860
oneness, then maybe there's
something not to trust in it,

756
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:20,420
because deep goodness comes out
of oneness. I think. Now I don't

757
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,080
know if this really addresses
the depth out of which your

758
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,960
question is coming, because I
understand

759
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,540
Unknown: the true,

760
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,300
Chris Bache: the true angst, not
angst, but the true kind of

761
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:41,440
quandary from which that
question comes, but the deepest

762
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,560
answer I have in response to it,
I'm afraid, is just a mystical

763
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,460
experience, a mystical
experience of oneness, in which

764
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,080
that context goodness just
becomes an insignificant

765
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,980
component, a spontaneous
component, just like the way you

766
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,420
react when you see something
beautiful. It's just, it's an

767
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:07,440
arising. It comes up inside of
you. Goodness is simply an

768
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,060
arising that comes up inside of
you when you're in the condition

769
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,140
of oneness.

770
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,260
James Jesso: I have a, have a,
maybe a more sort of serious

771
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,660
response, and I have a more
joking response. And the more

772
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:31,340
serious response is along the
lines of, like, what, what does

773
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:39,920
it what does it look like to
what does the dance look like?

774
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,320
You said, it becomes difficult
in the enactment. You know, what

775
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,360
does the dance look like between
Okay, having that experience?

776
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,520
Because I've had that
experience, and I can tell you

777
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:59,680
fully 100% honestly, that
anywhere from 10% of the time to

778
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,060
99% of the time, I'm not there
at all. There's no sense of it

779
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:07,680
whatsoever in my experience, you
know, and I am and I'm not in

780
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,160
the ground of that as I'm as I'm
as I'm showing up in the world.

781
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,080
And I'm wondering, yeah, you
know, in the same way that also

782
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,320
the playful response was, so we
all should all take 500 mics of

783
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:26,900
LSD, right? No, no, in the what
does it look like to have had

784
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,900
that experience? Because the way
that you speak about it, and I

785
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,960
think naturally, it makes sense,
like when you're there, goodness

786
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,620
just flows from you, right? It
is the most organic and natural

787
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:39,620
expression of being in the world
is when you're coming from that

788
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,620
place. And yet having a deep and
profound experience doesn't make

789
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,820
you a deep and profound person.
Experiencing oneness doesn't

790
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,300
mean that you now walk through
the world inspired and infused

791
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,360
in all your actions. You know
oneness just streams from your

792
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,700
fingertips, and every
interaction is a blessing with

793
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,260
the world from the depth of the
oneness. I have embodied simply

794
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:04,860
by taking enough mushrooms to
touch it once. So what does it

795
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,800
look like then? I mean, maybe
this is a question around

796
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:13,020
integration, yeah, what does it
mean to remember that, and what

797
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,060
is it into to catch ourselves in
forgetting?

798
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,840
Chris Bache: Yeah, that's that
is, you know, we we go up on the

799
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,440
mountain, we see some things, we
may be given some blessings, and

800
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,200
then we come down, and then we
have to go to work on Monday

801
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,700
morning. And that's over and
over again. It means a matter of

802
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:42,040
constantly engaging, being aware
of how you're engaging, checking

803
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:46,900
yourself, recommitting yourself
to doing a better job, over and

804
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:51,880
over and over again. For me,
much of it was in my work as a

805
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:57,460
teacher you know, constantly,
always enjoying it, always

806
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,800
loving to be with the students,
always wanting to do it better,

807
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,320
but constantly catching myself
making assumptions, making false

808
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:11,100
inferences, not doing a good
enough job, being a little

809
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:16,740
tired, letting my students down
on a particular day, coming back

810
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:20,220
and trying to do better, coming
do better the next day, Do

811
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:24,020
better, the next week, better
the next semester, over and over

812
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:28,820
again, trying to live up to the
things that we know to be true.

813
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:34,820
Integration is a is a strange
term. I'm not sure. I'm glad

814
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,340
that the psychedelic community
is paying more attention to

815
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:42,160
integration, because it's
really, really critical. But and

816
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,000
there are dimensions and aspects
of integration, and the word

817
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,280
integrate carries us a certain
distance, doesn't, doesn't carry

818
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,980
us so far, but it's it's hard to
live our visions. It's hard to

819
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,120
live the truth of what we've
seen. It because it commits you

820
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:04,260
to constantly being aware, if
you take the time to remit to

821
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:09,000
pay attention to yourself, how
bad a job we're doing at living

822
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,080
those truths. But that's just,
that's the nature of the beast,

823
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:20,360
though we just it's constantly I
mean, if we are, if we live

824
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:27,020
around people who are really
good, people who really have a

825
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:32,840
deeper natural instinct for
goodness and kindness and

826
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:39,140
generosity than we have, then it
makes it easier just to sort of

827
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,980
face our own shortcomings,
because we have someone that we

828
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:48,520
can look at and say, Ah, that
person doing this better than I

829
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:52,660
do. So this gives me a measuring
stick. I can do better. I'll do

830
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:57,220
it better tomorrow. I'll keep
working on it. And that's why,

831
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,900
you know, in the Buddhist
tradition, spiritual friends,

832
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,680
people who are also have
committed themselves to

833
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:10,080
awakening. That's really one of
the great Sangha community is

834
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:15,720
one of the great pillars of
progress. So, yeah, you're

835
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,660
right. It's wonderful to have
the experience, but we don't

836
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,800
walk around in that state, but
we practice and practice and

837
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,620
practice, and then maybe 10
years later, we were in a little

838
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,580
bit more. 10 years later, maybe
we're in it a little bit more,

839
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,800
but practice and practice and
practice. And if we ever think

840
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,740
that we're really there, then
all we do is ask our young

841
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:40,240
children, and they'll remind us
that we're not really there as

842
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,680
far along as we think we are,
our our kids will set us

843
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,220
straight.

844
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,040
James Jesso: Or perhaps, or
perhaps we could, I think it was

845
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,500
a Baba Ram Dass said, If you
ever think you're spiritually

846
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,680
awake and go spend a week at
your parents or something like

847
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,240
that. So maybe it's the other
way around.

848
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:58,540
Chris Bache: Yes, yes, as

849
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,600
James Jesso: you were speaking,
I it was funny, because a

850
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,200
question started forming, and
then you had said something that

851
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,080
I was like, Oh, great. I can
point to exactly that to ask

852
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,620
this question, which is around,
you know, being around people,

853
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:16,680
spiritual friends, right? The
question is, partly goes back to

854
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,040
what you said around, like, if
your spiritual practice means

855
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,820
running away from, like, not
engaging in the world, then it's

856
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:25,640
probably not a very mature
spiritual practice. And I agree

857
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:30,620
and respect that very much. And
then so there's a balance

858
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:35,120
between, you know, like being in
these spiritual having spiritual

859
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,480
friends and so on and so forth,
but then not isolating oneselves

860
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,440
and only that experience, but
also engaging in being in the

861
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,220
world right, or being right in
the world of the world, Pardon,

862
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:51,040
pardon the reference. Yeah,
yeah. But then, right now, it

863
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,760
feels as though, and I think in
many ways, this is because so

864
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:59,560
much of our social interaction
is mediated by screens and the

865
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,580
info. Of social media
technology, as well as the

866
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:08,220
influence that, in one way or
another, every interaction we

867
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,540
have is also informed by, is
that person a loaded covid gun

868
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:16,380
or whatever it is, it's, it's,
it's inspired by this sort of

869
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:20,540
weird things. We have this
situation where we're not coming

870
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:25,400
together, right? And so there's
a lot of toxic interaction.

871
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:30,140
There's a lot of charged
emotional charge, a lot of

872
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:33,740
embodied emotional energy that's
very tense. You know, there's a

873
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:37,760
lot of being exposed to how shit
the world actually is, right?

874
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,240
Now. There's a lot of beauty in
the world, of course, but that's

875
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,440
not what we're having shoved
down our down our throats, or

876
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:49,360
shoved through our eyes and so.
So the actual interactions with

877
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,300
the world, be they screen,
mediated or not, is now in this

878
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:56,500
landscape of a lot of people,
understandably so, very

879
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,180
contorted by the situation, very
contorted by the context. And

880
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:03,480
it's in that, you know, in that
contortion, that we generally

881
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,460
aren't operating from oneness,
right? So save for isolating

882
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,000
ourselves and only our little
friend group, that everyone's

883
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:15,360
spiritual and with the oneness
and yada yada, which ultimately

884
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,720
is serving those people there,
but only to a certain extent,

885
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,860
and not anybody else, and then
being sort of in the world,

886
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:25,280
trying to be a person of
goodness and oneness, but

887
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,240
encountering a lot of toxicity
and close mindedness and

888
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:36,080
shunning and and cancel and all
the rest. Like, how does a

889
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,960
person walk this? What does that
walk look like?

890
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,440
Chris Bache: It's good question,
isn't it good question? It's

891
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,080
going to look different for you
than it will for me, and it'll

892
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,540
look different for different
people in different

893
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,680
circumstances.

894
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:07,740
I mean, I really years ago,
decades ago, my life was as real

895
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:11,400
as my students. And so wherever
I was on the weekends, however

896
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,220
deep I was on the weekends,
whatever spiritual practice I

897
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:17,640
was doing at six o'clock on
Monday morning, at 10 o'clock, I

898
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:21,200
was with my class, and I was
teaching in an open enrollment

899
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,380
University, people who were
first generation college

900
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:29,780
educated in a burned out steel
town where opportunities were

901
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:34,640
few and far between, and this
was front line education in

902
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:39,500
America. And you, you it was
hard work, and we worked hard

903
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:45,280
together, so I had to be on my
game, engaging the world in my

904
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,960
role as educator, constantly
confronting their assumptions,

905
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:56,260
encountering the engaging the
biases that they would bring to

906
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:59,620
the discussions of the topics
that as A professor of religious

907
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:06,180
studies, I was teaching, and so,
you know, I would laugh at my

908
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:09,840
friends tease my friends who
were teaching graduate courses,

909
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,860
maybe three graduate courses a
year at their institutions where

910
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:18,120
I was teaching nine quarter
courses an academic year and

911
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:22,160
then courses During the summer.
It's really different kind of

912
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:28,820
world. So if I were answering
your question 15 years ago, when

913
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:35,420
that was my life, the hermit
quality of my life would be

914
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,380
balanced by my particular slice
of the pie that I was

915
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:42,880
responsible for, which is
helping these young people come

916
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,880
to deepen an understanding of
the world and of themselves in

917
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,000
the disciplines that I was
teaching. Now I'm in a different

918
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,880
time of my life. Now I am out of
that world. Now I am retired

919
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:01,980
from that world and so and I
buffer myself from a lot of

920
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:07,620
screen time. I really don't
engage. I mean, I really like

921
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:15,120
you say it is so toxic, it is so
confused. I don't think it helps

922
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:21,980
me to immerse myself in that
toxic confusion. It doesn't help

923
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:26,000
me maintain the clarity that
it's my responsibility to

924
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,920
maintain in my life, so that
when I do engage people, I can

925
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,780
be useful to people coming out
of the space that I've that I am

926
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:39,800
most comfortable with or not
most comfortable but I most

927
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,600
appreciate.

928
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,260
Unknown: So

929
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,240
Chris Bache: I don't have to
engage people nearly as much as

930
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:53,740
you do, and not nearly as much
of people who are going to work

931
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:56,680
nine to five, they're front line
on the covid scene, and they're

932
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,140
riding a bus, they're riding a
train, and they're having to

933
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,940
make all these. Decisions about
who and what, and what can I

934
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:07,260
say, and where should I sit, and
how do I breathe, and all those

935
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:18,420
things. But the principle is
always the same. I mean Teresa.

936
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:24,620
Mother, Teresa, she worked with
the poorest of the poor. She

937
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,920
started her work by basically
dragging people off the streets

938
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,880
of Calcutta so that they could
die with dignity in some small

939
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:39,020
place. We engage the world as we
are, as it is, as circumstances

940
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,880
are right now the circumstances
is this pandemic that we are

941
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,120
involved in, and the political
polarization that's being

942
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,560
generated by that pandemic,
people are grabbing that world

943
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,060
from so many different places,
so Many places, that

944
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:05,400
generalities are hard to come
by, except I come back again to

945
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:11,100
that sense of inner integrity
that kind of tells us when we

946
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,940
are on and off course with
ourselves, whether we are

947
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,500
aligned with our with our deep
being, Whether we're out of

948
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:26,720
kilter with our deep being, and
even in my isolation, I have the

949
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,920
feeling of whether I am aligned
with my deep being or whether I

950
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,540
am not aligned with it, in terms
of, Am I living myself my life

951
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:39,800
in a way that will put me in the
position to be of maximum

952
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:44,620
benefit when I give this talk in
two weeks, or something like

953
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:48,520
that, that it's not something
that happens on the day of

954
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,840
presentation. It's a whole. It's
with your life. It's an is in

955
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,900
tuned with your deepest
aspirations and your deepest

956
01:11:55,900 --> 01:12:00,780
truths of what you know and
believe, so that when you are

957
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:06,240
called upon, you truly have
something to give, which is

958
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:13,440
yours to give, and that that
that tuning into that center

959
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,940
place takes place whether you're
in the subway or whether you're

960
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:21,920
at home by yourself. It's just
tartar in the subway.

961
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:30,260
James Jesso: Yeah, I think, I
think one of the things that's

962
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:38,120
coming up for me is something
along the lines of, you,

963
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,000
Unknown: what that looks like
for different people,

964
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:53,620
James Jesso: and what that looks
like for different people looks

965
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:58,540
like to me from where I'm coming
from, based on where they're

966
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:03,780
coming from, because there are
people in this world who feel

967
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:13,320
like they are doing exactly
that, and what they're doing is

968
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:18,960
putting, you know, taking their
guns out for walks and screaming

969
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,360
At people for wearing masks,
right? Or they feel like they're

970
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,140
doing that thing, but what
they're actually doing is

971
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,220
propagating neo Nazi white
supremacy. Or what they're

972
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,920
actually they think that they're
doing that thing, but what

973
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,640
they're actually doing is
something emotionally violent,

974
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:41,860
immature and toxic, which is
canceling and anybody who

975
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:45,460
disagrees with them and feeling
reinforced in the righteousness

976
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:48,820
of their beliefs by other people
on the internet agreeing with

977
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:52,120
them and them all bonding by
bullying this person who has a

978
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:55,900
different opinion from them,
right? And that they feel like

979
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:03,360
they're doing the good thing
too. And so I want to be able to

980
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:09,060
say that I know that me not
doing those things is me doing

981
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:12,600
the good thing, and that my
inclination is to think that

982
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:18,300
what they're doing is not the
good thing. But then am I? Am I

983
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,520
invisibly making myself a fool
to think that I understand what

984
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,820
goodness is, and that my
goodness is more good than their

985
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:31,460
good. You know, is, there is,
is, I mean, there's that

986
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:34,460
question, and then there's a
larger question of like, is it

987
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:39,620
all good? You know, is actually
them doing that good? Because

988
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:42,940
goodness exists larger than the
frame of reference of what

989
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:47,920
might, of what our immediate
sort of like, acute socio

990
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,600
political, even life span, time
frame seems to state is good

991
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:56,800
because we're incapable of
recognizing, let alone the

992
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,260
second and third order
consequences of our of our

993
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:03,780
decisions. But the 50th, 60th,
the the seven generations,

994
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:07,500
consequence of our thinking, you
know, is all of this good, and

995
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,260
if all of this is good, then
what does it matter? What I do?

996
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,580
Chris Bache: Once again, you're
pushing into deep territory, you

997
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,900
know, in the in the highest
level of Buddhist teachings in

998
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:24,980
Tibetan, Buddhist teachings in
Dzogchen, they would basically

999
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:29,600
radically qualify goodness or
the good that you know it's

1000
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,420
like, doesn't make any
difference whether you're doing

1001
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:36,200
good or not doing good. If
you're truly aligned with the

1002
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:40,240
absolute essence of all things,
it puts you in a different kind

1003
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:46,360
of category in relative to good
and not good, but until you are

1004
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:50,380
living into that, in that
absolute condition, best to do

1005
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,040
good, you know, because that's
the closest approximation we

1006
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,040
have to that absolute condition.
And I think one of the things

1007
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:01,560
that so I'm not willing, though
it is from that perspective, one

1008
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,460
could relatively profoundly
relativize good, and I

1009
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:11,220
understand that my own personal
orientations doesn't go in that

1010
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:14,820
direction, to say it's all good.
I mean, I understand that it

1011
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:18,120
could be that we all think we're
doing good, but I'm not willing

1012
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:23,480
to say that all that we are
doing is all good, and one of

1013
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:29,240
the things is injuring other
people, injuring other people,

1014
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:35,840
physically, psychologically.
That, to me, is a marker of not

1015
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,660
good. That's one of the places
where you draw the line, because

1016
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:45,940
oneness is all embracing and and
it, and the first rule that

1017
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:52,060
comes out of that is non injury.
I think the people who are doing

1018
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,540
the things that you describe,
they had been doing it for a

1019
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:58,300
long time, but right now,
they're doing it more publicly

1020
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,320
than they were doing it before.
Before it may have been more

1021
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,380
private and surreptitious and
individual, but now they've been

1022
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,260
given permission in this greater
social reinforcement and

1023
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:10,380
platforms on social media that
reinforce an echo chamber and

1024
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:16,800
whatnot that reinforce those
patterns. But the fact that

1025
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,420
people are self selecting and
reinforcing different patterns

1026
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:25,340
and all of that's taking place,
doesn't mean that there aren't

1027
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:29,660
still choices of good for
goodness to be made, and it

1028
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:34,820
doesn't mean that goodness is
eliminated as a reasonable and

1029
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:40,040
rational and spiritually rich
criterion for which To look at

1030
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:49,000
our behavior and ourselves doing
various things, lynching, even

1031
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,500
though it may be believed as
being good is not good, it's a

1032
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:58,120
it is a not good, and a lot of
people Who did it believed that

1033
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,500
they were doing good.

1034
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:14,580
Unknown: Ah, when

1035
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,880
Chris Bache: we wake up, when we
begin to wake up through which

1036
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:22,340
whatever means when we are
touched by a passage from

1037
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:25,040
scripture, or whether we're
touched in an arc in an

1038
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,340
Ayahuasca session, in whatever
form, when we wake up

1039
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:36,740
constantly, over and over again,
genuine waking up produces

1040
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:41,680
gentler people. It produces
Kinder people, more

1041
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,000
compassionate people. It doesn't
improve. It doesn't produce

1042
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:50,680
homophobic people. It doesn't
produce people who are violence

1043
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:54,580
and inflicting violence on other
people. It always produces

1044
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:59,860
gentler, more respectful people.
Now that doesn't mean that

1045
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:04,020
doesn't mean that we necessarily
don't fight for justice, and we

1046
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:09,600
don't confront injustice as with
what force we need to but the

1047
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:15,720
core balance is towards an
equality of that the that has a

1048
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:22,760
gentle component to it, a
compassionate component. So then

1049
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:28,160
the question becomes, how do you
confront the not good? Knowing

1050
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:31,040
all the things we know about how
people believe that they are

1051
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,760
doing good, how do we confront
the not good in a way which

1052
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:41,440
doesn't perpetuate evil or
doesn't encourage more divisions

1053
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:47,020
in the world? That's obviously
very, very difficult question,

1054
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:50,140
and only can be done piece by
piece, by the person, in

1055
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:53,860
circumstances, in specific
circumstances. If I step back

1056
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:58,300
and try to generalize, then I'm
just, I'm just blowing smoke.

1057
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,620
You know, this can only. Be done
from really people who are

1058
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:05,640
living in the circumstances and
making decision whether to go to

1059
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,480
the protest, whether to counter
protests, how to address

1060
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:13,080
violence when it meets you on
the street, so on and so forth.

1061
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:26,540
Unknown: Do you think that the
but the what feels like the the

1062
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:32,780
James Jesso: almost ubiquitous
rise of what is often called Bad

1063
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:37,160
Faith arguments and the almost
total

1064
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:43,060
Unknown: devolution destruction
of discourse

1065
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,860
James Jesso: as a consequence of
basically all conflict being

1066
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:51,400
received of and responded to as
a form of abuse.

1067
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,140
Unknown: How?

1068
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,460
James Jesso: I'm not sure what
the question is here.

1069
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,680
Unknown: What is the question
here?

1070
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:24,680
What role do you see? What role
do you see conversation, open

1071
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:30,620
discourse between the various
expressions of self perceived

1072
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,160
good

1073
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:38,420
James Jesso: as playing in the
evolutionary process we're in as

1074
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:40,960
as humans and

1075
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,580
Unknown: and how do you balance
that with the the

1076
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,540
James Jesso: understandable
limitation of, well, I'm not

1077
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:56,560
really particularly interested
in giving a voice or a space for

1078
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:06,300
a hateful racist or a hateful,
whatever, and a violent person

1079
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,120
to have a voice. I don't want to
speak to them. I don't think

1080
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,840
that they should have something
to say. What is, what is the

1081
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:20,240
balance there in the course of
doing good and trying to bring

1082
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,500
about goodness in this world?

1083
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:39,920
Chris Bache: That is a large
question, again, a huge

1084
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,680
question, of which I have a very
limited framework from within to

1085
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:53,320
respond to it. Partly here, my
background is I'm an academic.

1086
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,740
And I'm an academic in the
history of religious thought, in

1087
01:22:56,740 --> 01:23:01,740
the history of philosophical
thought, in a discipline that

1088
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:07,860
prizes engagement, it prizes
discussion, it prizes

1089
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:12,960
collaboration and conflict as a
vehicle for determining greater

1090
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:18,000
truth. I've gone through
multiple revolutions in my own

1091
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,500
thinking, the hardest pivot in
when you move from a worldview

1092
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:25,100
with certain sets of assumptions
and a certain way of seeing the

1093
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:30,260
world, the hardest pivot is the
first one, because that's when

1094
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:37,460
you let go of a sense of being
grounded in reality and you have

1095
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:42,040
to step back and when you pivot
in certain fundamental beliefs,

1096
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,540
then you suddenly realize that
what you had taken as reality

1097
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,200
was just a model of reality, and
you're dealing with models and

1098
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:54,280
models when the second and third
and fourth time you make that

1099
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,480
pivot, as you continue to shift
and grow, it does get easier,

1100
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:02,640
because You realize you know,
you discover that you're living

1101
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:08,160
within a matrix of assumptions,
a paradigm of assumptions. So

1102
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:15,480
I've gone through being a
conventional Christian to being

1103
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:19,980
a non Christian, to being deeply
informed by science and the

1104
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:23,660
scientific worldview to
challenging some of the core

1105
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:26,960
axioms of a reductive
materialist interpretation of

1106
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:31,220
science through the psychedelic
work, and I've been in dialog

1107
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:34,700
with people all the years, all
these stages, not only my

1108
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:38,960
students, but all the faculties
and colleagues and People who

1109
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:43,960
I've spent my entire academic
career, disagreeing with and

1110
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:48,580
still managing to be friends
with and working with students

1111
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:53,920
and allowing them to voice
opinions in the room, which I

1112
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:59,140
find abhorrent, and yet it's
essential for them to be able to

1113
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,040
express the. Themselves, if
there's ever going to be a

1114
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:06,960
chance of opening up a
possibility that they can see

1115
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,740
the world from a little
different perspective. But all

1116
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:14,280
of that is within a certain
frame of reference in which

1117
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:19,260
there is a set of rules about
the give and take and the limits

1118
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:24,380
of give and take what's
happening today is a very

1119
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:26,780
different world in this
sheltered world that I've been

1120
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:30,860
functioning in inside a
university. This is, as you say,

1121
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:35,840
it's a dissolution of standards.
It is a radicalization of

1122
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,780
everyone's got the right to
their own position, and every

1123
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:43,720
position is as valuable as any
other. And in the end, it comes

1124
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,400
down to might makes right, or
the vote of the majority,

1125
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,660
however coerced and contrived,
that is, this a very different

1126
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:59,440
world. And when I tried to
fathom that world, I think we

1127
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,940
are living in a time. I mean, we
know it. We're in a time of

1128
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:06,840
paradigm change. We are in a
time when certainties are

1129
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:11,220
becoming uncertainties,
constants are dissolving. So

1130
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:14,940
many reference points that
people have used to orient

1131
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:22,640
themselves are being changed. I
mean, science changed so much,

1132
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:26,540
and now science has changed
itself so much. When it began to

1133
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:31,280
point to 96% of reality is
invisible, dark matter and dark

1134
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,400
energy. How the hell do we live
in a universe like that? How do

1135
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,820
we live in a universe as big as
the universe is we're

1136
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:43,540
describing. All the religions of
the world have all come together

1137
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:46,480
in one valley. It's like rivers
have come together into one

1138
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,020
valley, and just meeting each
other as we have in the last two

1139
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:53,860
centuries, has forced, for
anyone who's paying attention,

1140
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:57,520
has forced a radical
reassessment of all of our truth

1141
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,260
claims, of all of the
certainties that we've had about

1142
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:05,640
what we know to be true, and
what we know God is doing with

1143
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,700
the world and what and when we
look when just in this

1144
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:12,000
complexity of plurality that
we're dealing with, just within

1145
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,160
a mindset of disciplines, it
opens up, it taps into this

1146
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:20,600
deep, deep uncertainty that,
well, maybe we really don't know

1147
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,660
what God wants, and maybe we
really don't know what the truth

1148
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:27,320
is. And maybe we really have to
go look not only in our sacred

1149
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,380
scriptures, but in their sacred
scriptures, and in their sacred

1150
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:34,400
scriptures to even begin to deal
with some type of approximation

1151
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,840
that might become more adequate
than it was before. And so many

1152
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,340
of these things are missing
right now, this sort of self

1153
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:46,180
awareness of the limitations of
one's paradigm, of our cultural

1154
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:51,880
embeddedness that's missing from
much of this discussion so but

1155
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,480
we see it all in acting out.
We're at a time of a falling

1156
01:27:55,480 --> 01:28:01,320
apart of values. We can't even
count on nature to be whole

1157
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,340
patterns that it had held for us
for all these centuries. The

1158
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:08,340
weather patterns are different,
the rain patterns are different,

1159
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:12,000
the heat patterns are different.
Not even nature is allowing us

1160
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,600
to stay in the comfortable
domain. Immigration patterns are

1161
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,320
different. Racial balances in
our country are different. So

1162
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,280
many differences, so many
things. People are scared,

1163
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,340
people are unstable, people are
grabbing they're hiring to hold

1164
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:30,740
on to. And from one perspective,
you can say yes, yes, yes, good

1165
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:36,440
luck with that, because it's
going to keep falling apart.

1166
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:40,180
It's going to keep getting
worse. And if you're not able to

1167
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:44,500
deal with that. You're going to
suffer enormously. If you keep

1168
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:49,720
trying to hold on to old values,
you're going to suffer terribly,

1169
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:52,720
and you're going to cause
suffering, and that suffering is

1170
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:59,980
going to come back on you. To
me, it's not just that the world

1171
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:03,300
is a dirty and uglier place than
the academic university is

1172
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:08,040
because the academic university
can be a pretty, dirty and ugly

1173
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:12,540
place in its own form, in its
own genre, but underneath our

1174
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:17,880
culture, the constants are
falling away. The legs are being

1175
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,380
kicked out from under the table.
This just tremendous

1176
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:29,360
uncertainty, and truth has been
a casualty of that. Truth has

1177
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,480
been a casualty of that process
as well a sense of feeling

1178
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:32,960
truth.

1179
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:35,960
Unknown: But

1180
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,860
Chris Bache: we'll get through
it. We have no other choice,

1181
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:42,400
because this is a truth that we
live in. We live in a

1182
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:46,840
pluralistic society. We live in
a sexually pluralistic society.

1183
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,380
We live in a in a society of
multiple truths. We live in a

1184
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:54,400
culture of multiple truths. We
live in a world of expanding

1185
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:57,880
truths, of just expanding
horizons, over and over and over

1186
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:02,640
again. It's very uncomfortable.
To live in such a fluid world,

1187
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:08,940
but if we're not good at it now,
we better get good at it within

1188
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:11,760
the next generation or two,
because this is not going to

1189
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,060
change. We're not going to go
back into the tried and

1190
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:19,260
comfortable world of the past.
We are only going forward into

1191
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:24,620
new and uncertain territory, and
we're going into it together. We

1192
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,560
have to kind of grow up.

1193
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,920
We have to grow up. We have to
stop acting and arguing like

1194
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:44,200
adolescents. We have to start
acting and arguing like adults,

1195
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:51,820
and adults have a time horizon
and a perspective that you don't

1196
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:58,480
have when you're an adolescent,
and adults can hold their temper

1197
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:08,760
more and they don't cause injury
like adolescents do. And so it's

1198
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:14,400
grow up or die time. We have to
grow up. We have to stand up. We

1199
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,660
have to measure up

1200
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,580
Unknown: to this,

1201
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,740
Chris Bache: to the higher
demands of growing truth. Yeah,

1202
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:29,180
because truth is growing, truth
is expanding, we're trying to

1203
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:35,000
keep up with it hard time.

1204
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:38,780
James Jesso: Yeah, this, this
whole conversation. I just, I

1205
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:41,320
mean, I keep throwing really
hard questions at you, and

1206
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:45,220
incredibly, I'm just, or
increasingly, like, this is all

1207
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,800
so difficult. I mean, you think
these questions are difficult,

1208
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,220
the fact that we even are asking
them means we're in a reality

1209
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:54,280
that is far more difficult than
even just looking and forming

1210
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,180
the questions, right?

1211
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,940
Chris Bache: And you're asking
me questions about things I

1212
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,860
don't really know much about. I
mean,

1213
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:03,240
James Jesso: ask me, What about
that? I wrote a book about I

1214
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,160
know it's so funny. I thought I
was gonna ask you about

1215
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,620
psychedelics. I'm sitting here,
I feel like I'm in satsang or

1216
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:10,200
something, and you're just like,
what does it mean to be a good

1217
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,900
person? Grace. How do I face the
meta crisis?

1218
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:17,220
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, we're
all in this together. We are all

1219
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:20,040
in together. All your listeners
and all the people who are not

1220
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:25,940
listening, we're all in it
together. No What's wonderful

1221
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:29,600
about this conversation, and the
conversations that you encourage

1222
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,500
is that it pushes beach bulls
boundaries in a safe and

1223
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:37,400
respectful way. It invites them
to become more self reflective,

1224
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:41,560
more self aware. It invites them
to read more books and to learn

1225
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,940
more and to become less reactive
and more integrated in their

1226
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:51,820
presence. That is a mode of it's
not just the content that comes

1227
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:55,660
from these kind of discussions,
which can be useful to people,

1228
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:00,600
but the mode of the conversation
itself, the mode of disciplined

1229
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:03,660
inquiry. It's, you know, yes,
you read the books, you've done

1230
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:06,180
your homework. You know what the
issues are that we're going to

1231
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:11,640
talk about. But the quality of
engagement is itself a model for

1232
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:17,160
how we need to do to move
forward where we're going, you

1233
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,680
know. And that's a great value.

1234
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:23,959
James Jesso: Well, thank you. I
kind of feel like I recognize

1235
01:33:23,959 --> 01:33:28,939
that in myself, in the sense of
what I'm attempting to produce

1236
01:33:29,299 --> 01:33:34,099
and also in what I'm consuming.
I'm, you know, like I'm kind of

1237
01:33:34,099 --> 01:33:37,879
just coming out of this place
where my response to all of this

1238
01:33:37,879 --> 01:33:41,319
at first was like, okay, my
nervous systems on overload. I'm

1239
01:33:41,319 --> 01:33:44,859
going to play Playstation, and
I'm going to just like, do the

1240
01:33:44,859 --> 01:33:48,999
absolute bare minimum of just
like I had a bunch of podcast

1241
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:52,539
things recorded, and I was just
like, doing the bare minimum,

1242
01:33:52,539 --> 01:33:56,379
just trying to do the podcast
all recorded out. And then at

1243
01:33:56,379 --> 01:34:00,599
some point, increasingly, I'm
removing myself, because I don't

1244
01:34:00,599 --> 01:34:04,499
have the ability to participate
in the generative social

1245
01:34:04,499 --> 01:34:08,039
discussions I previously was a
part of in my community in the

1246
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:11,699
same way, and I'm looking to
find myself and surround myself

1247
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:16,079
the type of quality of
conversation and topic of

1248
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:21,979
conversation and and angle of
addressing the topic and the

1249
01:34:21,979 --> 01:34:26,539
quality, because otherwise, you
know, I am the five people I

1250
01:34:26,539 --> 01:34:29,359
spend most time with or, I mean,
that's a pretty strong

1251
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:32,659
generalization, but if the five
people I'm spending most time

1252
01:34:32,659 --> 01:34:36,499
with is whatever happens to be
trending on Twitter and and

1253
01:34:36,499 --> 01:34:40,959
Facebook, Which is like, the
algorithms basically push for,

1254
01:34:40,959 --> 01:34:48,279
like, maximum attention, maximum
attention grabbing, and what

1255
01:34:48,279 --> 01:34:51,099
Tristan Harris calls like a race
to the bottom of the brain stem,

1256
01:34:51,459 --> 01:34:54,699
and it's all limbic hijacking
and all the rest and the it's,

1257
01:34:54,699 --> 01:34:59,919
it's just like a it's just a
dynamic of outrage in one way.

1258
01:34:59,999 --> 01:35:02,219
Or another, then that's the
world I'm in, and that's the way

1259
01:35:02,219 --> 01:35:05,519
I'm gonna engage things. And I
see that I want the podcast to

1260
01:35:05,519 --> 01:35:08,939
be something different. You
know, it's psychedelic, I mean,

1261
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:13,139
but it's not, you know, it's
like, it is about psychedelics,

1262
01:35:13,139 --> 01:35:15,839
but it's more about being
someone who uses psychedelics

1263
01:35:15,839 --> 01:35:17,939
and has a psychedelic
perspective, trying to make

1264
01:35:17,939 --> 01:35:21,319
sense of life in real life. And
I'm trying to also surround

1265
01:35:21,319 --> 01:35:23,719
myself with the types of
conversations and discussions

1266
01:35:23,719 --> 01:35:28,099
and topics that are helping me
stay in that so I can keep being

1267
01:35:28,099 --> 01:35:31,579
a part of and contributing to
that kind of world. Because I'm

1268
01:35:31,579 --> 01:35:34,459
looking at this, this balance
somebody I've been really

1269
01:35:34,459 --> 01:35:38,179
listening to a lot recently,
Daniel schmactenberger talked

1270
01:35:38,179 --> 01:35:41,179
about trying to, well, it's kind
of hard to really know if I ever

1271
01:35:41,179 --> 01:35:43,359
understand what he's saying,
because he's saying, because

1272
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:46,959
he's I feel like he's way too
smart for me, or I'm not smart

1273
01:35:46,959 --> 01:35:49,239
enough, or something. You know,
it's real humbling listening to

1274
01:35:49,239 --> 01:35:51,879
talk, listening to him talk
something along the lines of,

1275
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:56,499
like, trying to find that place
between, you know, recognizing

1276
01:35:56,739 --> 01:35:59,799
what's it, what's going wrong
with the world, and all the

1277
01:35:59,799 --> 01:36:04,379
things going wrong, and what am
I actually able to do? Like,

1278
01:36:04,379 --> 01:36:09,239
what am I actually able to do?
Yeah, rather than trying to

1279
01:36:09,239 --> 01:36:12,299
solve what's wrong with the
world, being like, Okay, I got a

1280
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:14,759
sense of it. But what am I
actually able to do? And, and

1281
01:36:14,759 --> 01:36:17,579
right now, it feels like this is
what I'm actually able to do.

1282
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:26,000
Chris Bache: Yeah, I understand
that, and I don't do Twitter

1283
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,780
feeds, I don't do Instagram. I
spend very little time in social

1284
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:33,740
media altogether. So at the
cost, at the risk, of separating

1285
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:40,840
myself from the pulse of where
people are. Where I Live is not

1286
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:47,620
where most people live, and one
of the reasons I live in a

1287
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:52,420
different place is because of
psychedelics. When I when I

1288
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:55,240
experience what's happening,
it's within a different

1289
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:59,560
historical horizon than most
people experience what's

1290
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:04,200
happening, and when I am
concerned for the people who are

1291
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,560
suffering, even that is from a
different perspective, because

1292
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:12,120
of the psychedelic experiences
that have taught me to recognize

1293
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:16,200
the different levels of being
that are present in a human

1294
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:22,880
body, the Different levels of
soul inside a human body, and

1295
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,960
then to recognize even the
different levels of soul

1296
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,940
maturation which are in a
species in an historical period

1297
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:39,200
and that's contextualized within
an intimate experience of the

1298
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:43,780
aliveness of the universe, that
the universe is alive at core,

1299
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:50,200
in every blade of grass and
every every gyration of the

1300
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:55,480
planets, in the movement of the
galaxies, it is alive and its

1301
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:58,540
intelligence. And its
intelligence is constantly

1302
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:02,340
knocking on the back of our
mind, constantly asking for

1303
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:08,820
permission to enter and to
infuse us more with its

1304
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:18,900
understanding, to attend that
deeply to The invitation that

1305
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:24,380
the universe gives us requires
stepping out of Twitter feeds

1306
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:28,280
and Instagram feeds and this
buzz, buzz, buzz, which is

1307
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:36,020
important, but if you want to,
it's like if you want to

1308
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:39,560
understand where we are in our
universe and where we are in the

1309
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:42,580
galaxy and where our galaxy is,
you have to go out at night

1310
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:47,200
under a dark sky with no
surrounding lights and and let

1311
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:50,260
your eyes adjust to the darkness
and stay focused there for a

1312
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:55,480
long time, and then listen very
carefully. And it's the same way

1313
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:59,920
with inner knowing. Inner
knowing requires a stepping back

1314
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:04,980
out of the give and take of
daily discourse, tuning in

1315
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:11,460
deeply. And I've been blessed in
that I've my life has afforded

1316
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:16,020
me an unusual amount of time to
do that without taking on monk's

1317
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:23,780
robes. You know that's so my
whole experience of the

1318
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:27,560
challenges that we're facing,
all of them, are really not

1319
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:31,340
based on earthly wisdom. You
know, there's, I try to frame it

1320
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:35,840
as best I can, earthly wisdom,
but my framing, my deepest

1321
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,200
understanding of what's, what
are really the challenges that

1322
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:42,280
are we're facing, and what's
really driving the social

1323
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:47,260
context that we're in? You know,
they come out of my psychedelic

1324
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:54,100
work. They come out of a very,
very different perspective than

1325
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:57,820
even a time space perspective.
Or I would say that the time

1326
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:06,780
space perspective is. Is at best
50% at best 50% and the other

1327
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:17,460
50% or more really comes out of
an intimacy, I don't want to

1328
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:20,480
say, with the divine, because
that brings us back to the

1329
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:25,340
culture wars. How do we define
God? But in so that's why I talk

1330
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:29,420
about the mind of the universe
and intimacy with the generative

1331
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:33,320
intelligence of the universe, an
intimacy with the creative

1332
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:39,080
intelligence of the universe
that, to some degree, has taken

1333
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:42,880
me under its wing, because I was
willing to pay the dues to

1334
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,240
snuggle up inside there and

1335
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,800
You never look at life again,

1336
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:01,260
Unknown: as you know,

1337
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:06,480
Chris Bache: after you've been
into those intimate places, when

1338
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:10,860
you've been dissolved into the
into the deepest pulse of life

1339
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:14,520
that you've ever known, you
never experience life the same

1340
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:20,180
way again. And if you've, if
you've nurtured a deep and long

1341
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:27,140
connection to this deeper
knowing which Transcendence

1342
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:29,240
history in a profound way.

1343
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,200
You never, you never experience
life the same way as you did

1344
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:44,620
before. You now have a It's not
like you have the answers or you

1345
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:50,860
have the knowledge which solves
things, but there is a there's

1346
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:52,420
an intimacy.

1347
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:09,300
It makes you very sensitive to
how much fear drives things. And

1348
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:12,660
when you, when you've dissolved
all the fear that you've ever

1349
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:15,720
been asked to dissolve, when
you, when you dissolve all of

1350
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:20,720
that. And you enter into those
territories which in which there

1351
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:27,140
is no fear and there is only
truth and only insight and only

1352
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:31,760
understanding and only love and
compassion. Then when you come

1353
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:36,740
back out of that and you look at
life around you, so much of it

1354
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:40,720
is driven by fear and so little
understanding, and so many

1355
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:44,380
people are afraid of dying, and
so many people are afraid of

1356
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:47,680
losing this, that and the other,
because underneath it, they're

1357
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:51,700
fundamentally afraid for their
own existence, for their just

1358
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:56,080
they're afraid of dying. And if
you lose that, if you are no

1359
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,080
longer afraid of dying, and
you're no longer afraid of that

1360
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:04,740
deep destructuring, whether or
not you are challenged by short

1361
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:12,660
term destructuring or not, you
come at it from a very different

1362
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,220
perspective. You just live it
from a different way. So to me,

1363
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:21,680
you know, LSD in the mind of the
universe is a psychedelic

1364
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:27,320
memoir. It's a whole life's work
that is reflected there. It's a

1365
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,260
it's a journey. That's why I
like the title diamonds from

1366
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:34,460
Heaven better, because it it's a
story of a journey of deepening

1367
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:39,740
intimacy. And when you, when you
come out of that, you I remember

1368
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:42,880
when I would do a session, and
at the end of the session,

1369
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:47,560
someone I would pick me up at
the end of the day and take me

1370
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:51,520
to where I would be that night.
And once in a while, we had to

1371
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:55,600
go buy a grocery store. And as
you can imagine, there are few

1372
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:00,240
places stranger to be than an
American grocery store after

1373
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:04,680
you've come down from a serious
psychedelic session, it's like

1374
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:10,200
being in Disneyland. I mean,
it's like in the strange,

1375
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:13,440
strange world, something as
simple as a grocery store can be

1376
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:20,660
that's our work, though, isn't
it? When we go into this space,

1377
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:24,740
we enter into deeper intimacy
with whatever it is that's

1378
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:29,540
driving the universe, and then
we come back and we try to live

1379
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:33,380
our lives as best as we can.
This is what reincarnation does.

1380
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:37,520
Reincarnation plunges into. It
pulls us out, connects us to

1381
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,980
spiritual reality again, plunges
us back in, and then we go out

1382
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:45,460
again and back and forth and
back and forth. A psychedelic

1383
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:48,760
session will do the same thing,
but on a smaller orbit. It

1384
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:52,420
basically kills the earthly
life. It shatters the earthly

1385
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:59,080
life and opens us up to what
it's like to die into this great

1386
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:02,580
surrounding world. Old, and then
after the session, we come back

1387
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:06,180
and we're alive inside time and
space again. And then a few

1388
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:10,560
months later, we'll shatter out
into outside time and space. So

1389
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:16,080
we're reproducing, reenacting
the dynamic of nature in

1390
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:21,020
reincarnation and whatnot. Once
you do that enough times, and

1391
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:27,320
once you incarnate enough times,
then you you cease to to relate

1392
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:34,520
to the world the way you did
before. And in much of this

1393
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,380
aberrant social behavior that we
see around us, what I see is so

1394
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,040
much

1395
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:42,640
Unknown: youth. Is

1396
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,060
Chris Bache: so much
inexperience, is so much

1397
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:55,180
naivete, maybe badness, but more
than badness, I see something

1398
01:45:55,180 --> 01:46:01,620
that makes me feel terribly sad.
I see people not knowing better?

1399
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:07,380
And if you ask, why don't they
know better? At core, I'm

1400
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:11,400
looking at a soul, and I think,
why does this soul not know

1401
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:18,840
better? And at core of that,
it's like Jesus. They're babies,

1402
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:22,820
they're children, they're
adolescents, they just haven't

1403
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:30,500
matured enough to really
understand the deep reciprocity

1404
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:34,520
that exists between human
beings, which leads to a respect

1405
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:38,720
of human beings, no matter what
they are, no matter who they

1406
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,320
are.

1407
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,340
Unknown: That's well,

1408
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:48,400
Chris Bache: that's
childishness, really. And

1409
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,640
psychedelics grow us up. I mean,
if you do them right, if you use

1410
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:56,140
them carefully, they accelerate
our maturation. They don't make

1411
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:58,900
us perfect, and they don't fill
us up with, you know, eternal

1412
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:06,720
truths, but they do force us to
become more mature than we were

1413
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:10,320
in the beginning, if we if we
engage them responsibly,

1414
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,600
James Jesso: well, that might be
a good place to call to a close.

1415
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,480
Feel like that was a really
great way to end.

1416
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,560
Unknown: Chris, I want to thank
you for

1417
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:29,240
James Jesso: sitting down and
addressing a bunch of questions

1418
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:32,900
that a couple, maybe a little
bit for the most part. 80% of

1419
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:36,020
this had nothing to do with your
book. I didn't even open it up

1420
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:39,140
as to what's the plan. And I
really asked you to go to the

1421
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:42,040
edge of your thinking. I feel
like I really asked you to go to

1422
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:45,820
the edge of your thinking today
on some difficult questions. And

1423
01:47:45,820 --> 01:47:49,120
I feel really, I feel really
nourished by what came of it,

1424
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:53,680
and I trust that my listeners
will will feel the same, or at

1425
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:56,740
the very least something,
something will come up worthy of

1426
01:47:56,740 --> 01:48:00,600
talking about. So I really
appreciate your time today,

1427
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:00,900
Chris,

1428
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:04,320
Chris Bache: you bet I trust our
conversations. I trust what

1429
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:08,580
comes out of them. I trust where
they go. I hope they're useful

1430
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:12,240
to the people who tend to tune
into your podcast. It's always a

1431
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,040
joy to talk with you.

1432
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,380
James Jesso: James, thank you,
Chris. I'm going to show your

1433
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:20,480
book here for those who are
watching on the YouTube LSD and

1434
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:24,980
the mind of the universe. It's a
very good book, and

1435
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:27,380
Chris Bache: I'm going to put a
plug in for a book of a friend

1436
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:30,800
of mine, because if, if you are
concerned about the birth of the

1437
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,680
future human, and if you're
concerned with the historical

1438
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:37,100
crisis that we are entered, and
you want deeper understanding,

1439
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:41,080
my book gives a psychedelic
vision of where we are and where

1440
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:44,440
we're going. But this book,
let's see if I had, is it

1441
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:45,280
showing here?

1442
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,680
James Jesso: Yeah, I see it
choosing Earth, humanity's great

1443
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:50,860
transition to a mature planetary
civilization.

1444
01:48:51,219 --> 01:48:53,499
Chris Bache: Yeah, Dwayne Nelda,
and you can see, it's not a big

1445
01:48:53,499 --> 01:48:56,379
book, it's a thin book. It won't
take you a lifetime to read it

1446
01:48:56,619 --> 01:49:01,499
really, really, really fine
book, looking at where we are,

1447
01:49:01,499 --> 01:49:04,859
where we're going, and how to
navigate the times we're

1448
01:49:04,859 --> 01:49:05,339
entering.

1449
01:49:06,179 --> 01:49:08,879
James Jesso: Very kind book.
Cool. Thanks for the suggestion,

1450
01:49:08,879 --> 01:49:13,319
Chris. Last thing, is there
anywhere, given how damning we

1451
01:49:13,319 --> 01:49:15,779
were of social media throughout
the course of this interview,

1452
01:49:15,779 --> 01:49:18,539
are there places on social media
that you'd like to direct people

1453
01:49:18,539 --> 01:49:18,959
towards?

1454
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:20,280
Unknown: Well,

1455
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,960
Chris Bache: in a couple of
months, they can go to Chris

1456
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:30,080
bache.com the website will
eventually appear there. I'm so,

1457
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:33,200
I'm so social media. Out of it,
I don't, haven't fulfilled my

1458
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:36,920
responsibility to have the
website up and done. They can

1459
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:42,580
reach me at my university email
address, which is cm Bache, my

1460
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:50,080
initial cm bache@ysu.edu they
can contact me there for the

1461
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:53,020
time being, but in a couple of
months they'll be able to go to

1462
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,940
Chris bache.com Great.

1463
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,640
James Jesso: Well. Thank you
very much, Chris, and looking

1464
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,240
forward to the next
conversation. Me too, James. Is

1465
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:05,160
always a head cut. Okay, thank
you for tuning in. Check out

1466
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:08,400
Chris's book. LSD, in the mind
of the universe. It's beautiful.

1467
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:13,200
I loved it, as you can see here.
You know, so many tabs, so many

1468
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:18,960
underlines. I loved it. I also
love talking with Chris. So he's

1469
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,440
a great guy. He's seemingly a
great guy, and he's got a lot of

1470
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,440
wisdom, and check out his book.
Additionally, if you like this

1471
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,840
episode, you can share it with a
friend, and if you'd like to

1472
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:29,420
support the show financially,
Patreon is a great option, where

1473
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:33,620
you can pledge a monthly an
amount to be sent forth monthly,

1474
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,440
as little as a cup of coffee
once a month. Everything is

1475
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:40,040
something, and it all adds up to
allow me to earn income while

1476
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,060
dedicating myself full time to
the show and to the larger body

1477
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:46,060
of psychedelic research that I'm
putting into and out into the

1478
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:51,520
world. And I had mentioned there
was a special announcement after

1479
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,800
the interview, so I'll just let
it out now, which is that I'm

1480
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:56,740
going to be taking a two episode
break for the next little while.

1481
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:59,740
So if you're new to the show, is
a great opportunity to go back

1482
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:02,280
through the archives. If you're
not new to the show, I will be

1483
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:06,300
releasing some content patrons.
I just released an update on the

1484
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:10,440
Patreon feed just for you, which
includes some insider

1485
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:14,220
information, but also includes
some exclusive content that's

1486
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:18,000
just going to be for you guys as
well. And yeah, so I'm taking a

1487
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,240
two episode break to sort of
like clean house metaphorically,

1488
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:26,360
not so much literally. My house
is pretty good, but definitely

1489
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:30,980
metaphorically. And yeah, so
that's all, thanks for tuning

1490
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:34,460
in, thanks for listening all the
way to the end, and I will see

1491
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:37,580
you on the next episode of
adventures through the mind. And

1492
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:40,120
until then, take care. You. You.

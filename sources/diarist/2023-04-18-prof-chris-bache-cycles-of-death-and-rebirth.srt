Chris Bache: When one works with
very high doses of LSD, one goes

2
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:12,572
through a series of
Death-Rebirth experiences. In

3
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:16,712
this image, the drop at the
center underneath the line

4
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:20,360
represents our egoic
consciousness, our private

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,160
consciousness. Everything above
the line represents spiritual

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,240
reality. Transpersonal
consciousness, the first

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,860
Death-Rebirth experience takes
place at the interface of our

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,820
time, space consciousness and
the beginnings of spiritual

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,400
consciousness, and it's usually
referred to his ego death, it is

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,960
the complete destruction of our
personal time, space, identity

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,060
and the beginning of an opening
into spiritual reality. But if

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,560
we continue this process, if we
press deeper and deeper into

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,980
spiritual reality, we go through
more deaths, more cycles of

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,680
death and rebirth at the
psychic, subtle and causal

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,060
levels of consciousness. To use
terms that Stan uses. Now, I

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,500
have no vested interest in a
particular cosmological map that

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,220
delineates the various strata,
strata of Transpersonal

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,680
consciousness. Here, I'm simply
trying to make a point that as

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,340
you go into deeper levels of
consciousness, you come to

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,780
certain gateways, and at these
gateways, you must give up

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,500
everything, everything you have
known up to this point in time

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,040
in your journey, in order to
enter into the new fields of

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,460
consciousness that are beginning
to open to you. You.

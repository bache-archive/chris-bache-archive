00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,640
Simeon Mihaylov: Simon, welcome
to the secret to Seeker podcast.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,020
My name is Simeon, and it's my
honor to introduce to you today

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,820
our first ever guest on the
podcast, Dr Christopher M Bache.

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,140
Chris is Professor Emeritus at
the Department of Philosophy and

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,440
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University, where he

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,520
taught for 33 years. His work
explores the philosophical

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,760
implications of Non-ordinary
states of consciousness,

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,700
particularly psychedelic states.
He has authored four books, his

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,200
latest one being LSD and the
mind of the universe, or as

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,340
Chris prefers to call it,
diamonds from heaven. In

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,720
diamonds from heaven, Chris
combines his expert knowledge of

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,980
the world's wisdom traditions
with the insights he personally

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,160
gained from 20 years of intense,
high dose, psychedelic work

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,640
undertaken in secrecy and the
cosmic plan that revealed itself

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,140
to Chris is both astonishing and
beautiful and carries great

16
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,920
implications about the way we
should understand our individual

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,600
and our collective existence.
Chris and I split our

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,740
conversation neatly into two
parts, so in the first half of

19
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,200
the podcast, you can get some
more details on the general

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,180
areas that Chris's work focuses
on, and the general chronology

21
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,100
of his work. But if you're
familiar with Chris's work, feel

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,900
free to skip ahead halfway where
we delve into issues that Chris

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,440
hasn't spoken about in length
before, such as the nature of

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:57,100
suffering and evil and also how
reincarnation and the non self

25
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,460
can both be true at The same
time. One final note, please

26
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,940
bear with me as I get this
podcast up and running. I know

27
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,420
that video quality and audio
quality on my end are pretty

28
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,100
bad, but I promise better
quality in the future, and

29
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,400
fortunately, Chris does most of
the talking here, so it

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,140
shouldn't be too much of a
issue. I hope the beautiful

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,000
conversation Chris and I had
brings you joy and wisdom, same

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,720
as it brought me, and I hope you
enjoy.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,360
Thank you for watching good So
to begin, would you like to kind

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,020
of give a general overview of
your work that kind of you talk

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,260
about in the book, what the book
is about and what your

36
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,820
experiences really were.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,540
Unknown: Yeah, well,

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,100
Chris Bache: it all began right
after I finished graduate school

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,720
in 1978 I had started. I started
my career as a professor of

40
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,060
religious studies at Youngstown
State University in Ohio, and I

41
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,140
read Stan Grof first book,
realms of the human unconscious,

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,760
and I knew immediately that this
was critically important work to

43
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,240
my discipline, which was
philosophy of religion. And Stan

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,640
outlined a methodology that
allowed us to enter

45
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,500
systematically and carefully and
unsafely into these deep states

46
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,840
of consciousness in which we
could not only heal but explore

47
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,980
the deepest levels of our mind,
and entering into those levels,

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,260
dropping into deeper levels of
consciousness that went beyond

49
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,280
individual mind. So that excited
me very much. As a young

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,800
philosopher, I thought this was
great. This is a whole new

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,240
philosophical method. So I began
to do this work, and to do it,

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,480
of course, since it was illegal
at the time, I had to make a

53
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,900
choice. And I don't like doing
things illegal, but I made a

54
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,760
choice to divide myself in half
and in my daytime job for the

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,960
next 33 years, I was a professor
of religious studies at

56
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,380
Youngstown State University,
teaching courses and doing the

57
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,640
things that people do. And then
my nighttime job, I began the

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,480
systematic journey into deep,
Non-ordinary states of

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,580
consciousness using LSD. And I
used LSD because that was the

60
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,740
substance that Stan had worked
with in his early years, that's

61
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,700
what his research was based on,
primarily, and I trusted what I

62
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:33,200
saw in his work, so I used that.
And after my sessions, my work

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,920
was always following the
protocols that he laid out in

64
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,440
his early book, LSD
psychotherapy. They were always

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,760
protected from the world. They
were always private. I worked

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,680
with a sitter. I was always
lying down with carefully

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,140
choreographed music, pacing the
stages of opening and closing in

68
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,260
the sessions. And I made a very
careful and. Sustained effort to

69
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,180
record each session faithfully
and completely after the session

70
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,680
was over. So I began this work.
I did it intensely for four

71
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,460
years, and then for reasons that
I describe in the book, I

72
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,360
stopped the work for six years,
and then I resumed it for

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,500
another 10 years of work I
started in 1979 and I finished

74
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:31,040
it in 1999 I did 73 high dose
sessions. Over this 20 year

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,240
period, I started with three
medium dose sessions and then

76
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,880
went into all the rest of my
sessions were high dose

77
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,900
sessions, which I worked at 500
to 600 micrograms, which is a

78
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,720
protocol that I don't recommend.
I don't recommend such a long,

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,520
sustained hammering of the
boundaries of consciousness

80
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,020
exploding so relentlessly into
these this work. I would work

81
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,640
much differently if I did it
again today, I would work more

82
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,440
slowly. I would alternate high
doses with low doses, and I

83
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,480
would work I would balance LSD
with more body grounded or

84
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,740
psychedelics such as Psilocybin
and Ayahuasca. But what happened

85
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,560
on the journey, basically, is
that I went through not just one

86
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,580
death, not just ego death, but
the universe took me in

87
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,320
gradually through multiple
layers of reality, deeper and

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,040
deeper, through deeper levels of
consciousness. And I found that

89
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,200
entering deeper levels of
consciousness, and therefore and

90
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,700
through them, accessing deeper
levels of reality required going

91
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,920
through a series of deaths,
dying at one level of

92
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,700
consciousness to enter a deeper
level of consciousness, and then

93
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,000
mastering or learning the ins
and outs of that level, and then

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,040
going through yet another death
to enter in a yet A still deeper

95
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,200
level of consciousness. So when
I got to the end of the journey

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,540
and was looking at all of the
years of work, I basically asked

97
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,300
myself, How many fundamental
levels of reality did I

98
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,260
experience, or how many cycles
of death and rebirth? And I came

99
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,640
up with five. There was a level
that took place at the level of

100
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,360
collective mind, excuse me,
personal mind, ego, death. Then

101
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,440
there was a level that took
place at the level of collective

102
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,580
mind, the collective mind of our
species. Then there was a level

103
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,080
that took place at archetypal
mind, and then the level of

104
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,880
causal reality, the level of
oneness. And then, in the five

105
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,800
last years of my work, the level
of diamond Luminosity, what I

106
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,740
call diamond Luminosity, what
Buddhism calls the absolute, the

107
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,400
absolute, the clear light of
absolute reality. So after I

108
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:11,220
finished my sessions, Spirit
said to me in my meditation, 20

109
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,240
years in, 20 years out. And I
took that at the time to mean

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,600
that it would take me 20 years
to fully assimilate and

111
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:26,180
integrate, 20 years of my
sessions, as it turned out, LSD

112
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,240
in the mind of the universe, or
as I prefer to call it, diamonds

113
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,080
from heaven, was published
exactly 20 years after I

114
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,160
finished my sessions. So there
was 20 years of exploration,

115
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,620
followed by 20 years of
digesting, reflecting,

116
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,240
integrating, and finally,
telling the story of this

117
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,560
journey, and I share it in the
hope that it will be useful to

118
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,220
other people, both people who
are journeyers, but also people

119
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,060
who are not journeyers, who are
involved in spiritual practices

120
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,700
other than psychedelics, because
of the I hope the cosmology that

121
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,660
emerges in the story and the
understanding of some of the

122
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,740
cosmological processes that
we're all engaged in will be

123
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,760
useful to people.

124
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,480
Simeon Mihaylov: Yes, yeah, your
work is definitely fascinating.

125
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,380
And one thing I think that is
very important to address

126
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,040
whenever somebody is talking
about psychedelic states and

127
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,480
insights that arise from them, I
think the go to argument of the

128
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,680
skeptic is these are states that
appear while the mind is under

129
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,320
the influence of a substance.
Therefore, why should any

130
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,180
insight gain be legitimate? But
even to take this argument

131
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,700
further, when you are exploring,
when you're having your

132
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,720
experiences under the influence
of these substances, how do you

133
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,900
know what you are studying? How
do you know what you're seeing?

134
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,940
Is this the call. Most Is this
your personal psyche? What is it

135
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,440
that you are experiencing?

136
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,520
Chris Bache: Yeah, really an
important question, isn't it?

137
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,740
Can we trust what emerges in our
awareness, in psychedelic states

138
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,300
of awareness? Well, I took my
starting point from Stan's

139
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,260
observations and many other
psychedelic therapists in the

140
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,860
early years, and that is an
understanding that psychedelics

141
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,120
don't give you an experience.
What they simply do is amplify

142
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,780
your own consciousness. They are
an amplifier and a catalyst of

143
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:38,300
your own mind. And if you use
these hours of amplified

144
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,880
awareness carefully, if you
focus them and internalize them

145
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,320
and keep your vision focused on
the stream of awareness that's

146
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,740
arising within you, you begin a
process of purification and a

147
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,620
process of confrontation with
different blocks and pains and

148
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,000
things we'd rather not look at
in our daily life, your system

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,800
just spontaneously moves to
eliminate those challenges which

150
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,880
are lodged in our history.
Sometimes our history from just

151
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,480
this lifetime, sometimes our
history from former lifetimes.

152
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:24,920
In the early stages, we know
that we can judge the legitimacy

153
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,400
of what's what we are
experiencing, because these are

154
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,760
activating memories from our
lifetime. We can verify those

155
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,940
memories. We can explore them.
They have the texture of memory.

156
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,920
And when we confront the pains
that arise there, there is a

157
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,100
liberating experience, there's a
healing experience which has

158
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,140
demonstrable impacts on our
daily life after a session has

159
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,600
ended. So there's a tremendous
sense of verification of the

160
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,920
truth of what one is
encountering. And that tends to

161
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,020
give confidence that when one
moves beyond the familiar, when

162
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,240
one moves beyond the domain of
one's immediate life, that there

163
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,320
is a truth also in these
experiences, even though they're

164
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,480
coming from a more foreign level
of consciousness, this process

165
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,540
repeats itself so one enters
into a reality which is

166
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,360
completely foreign, unknown,
strange. And at first, maybe

167
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,260
what stands out is its
strangeness, but the more

168
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,100
frequently you go back into that
reality, the more you become

169
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,260
familiar with its landscape. And
my experience is that if you

170
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,300
engage these hours carefully,
and if you record them and work

171
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,380
hard to retain them, listen to
what it's teaching you, the

172
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,780
universe enters into a dialog
with you. It's like now it knows

173
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,260
you're paying attention, and so
it's speaking to you, and it

174
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,820
takes you through an educational
process, it takes you through a

175
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:10,020
series of lessons about how
reality works. Here, what's

176
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,220
going on at this level of
reality and in the early stages,

177
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,120
there are certain qualities that
relate to your personal life.

178
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,680
Maybe you experience your
personal life in a larger in a

179
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,400
larger spiritual trajectory. You
may have insights into former

180
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,240
lives. You may have insights
into your deeper former life

181
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,500
history that clarifies and heals
relationships in your present

182
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,500
life, and because these have
such a dramatic impact on our

183
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:48,580
present life. Once again, their
legitimacy is confirmed in your

184
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,380
own life experience and as one
goes deeper into collective

185
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,040
mind, into archetypal reality,
into deeper into spiritual

186
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,340
reality. In this case, I had I
was fortunate in that I had a

187
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,860
PhD in philosophy of religion. I
had a lot of opportunity to

188
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,260
study some of the great
spiritual traditions of the

189
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,100
world. So I was familiar with
some of the ins and outs of

190
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,040
spiritual practice as those had
been developed in different

191
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,960
countries. I had an
understanding of their maps of

192
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,240
what lies in the spiritual
world. And so I had a reference

193
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,820
point to compare my experiences
in psychedelic states with the

194
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,160
experiences that other spiritual
seekers were having in their

195
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,560
traditions, using meditation
methods, yogic methods, or

196
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,000
psychedelic methods, to explore
reality from across the world.

197
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,840
Now, I've always taken a global
perspective when I teach. I

198
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,380
taught intro to world religions
for years, I taught courses on

199
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,940
comparative mysticism. I've
always found that the deepest

200
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,260
patterns emerge or the first.
Me, the most interesting

201
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,820
patterns are the patterns that
emerge not simply in one

202
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,360
culture, in one spiritual
tradition, but in multiple

203
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,660
traditions looked at
simultaneously. And when you can

204
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,560
hold the world spiritual
traditions in your consciousness

205
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,400
all at the same time, then you
begin to see patterns that

206
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,340
connect the different lineages
into larger holes, and I found

207
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,860
that my psychedelic experiences
fit comfortably within that

208
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,960
larger landscape, and I have to
qualify because it fit

209
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,720
comfortably. And yet, as I went
deeper, it also pushed the

210
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,060
boundaries of those experiences
and took me deeper. But I guess

211
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,320
in addition to this sort of
personal verification and then

212
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,880
collective, global spiritual
correspondence, which is a kind

213
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,080
of verification, there is an
experiential quality to these

214
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:07,080
experiences, you pay a great
price to enter into these

215
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,520
states. You must go through
multiple, multiple cycles of

216
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,840
purification, detoxification,
confrontation with your own

217
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,400
limitations, layer after layer,
in order to enter into clear

218
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,140
states of perception, clear
states of awareness. These

219
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:33,500
states of awareness have a
quality where it's just

220
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,940
transparently clear that you are
experiencing something real,

221
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,500
something genuine. It doesn't
mean necessarily that you're

222
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,580
seeing all that exist or
everything is there or that, not

223
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,460
that there can't be limitations
or distortions in your

224
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,180
experience, but you know you are
confronting something which is

225
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,900
just as real as what you
confront in time, Space,

226
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:03,600
reality. So in this dialog, in
this dance, Mike, conviction

227
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,180
grew that I was on a journey, a
journey that had philosophical

228
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,280
value, a journey that was
producing genuine insights into

229
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,000
how our universe works. The
structure of the universe

230
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,200
doesn't mean that everything I
saw is necessarily perfectly

231
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,400
correct, but there is a
fundamental conviction that

232
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,660
these are real, that these are
valuable, and they're shared by

233
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,200
other persons. If it were only
my experiences, then maybe they

234
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,160
would just be a solipsistic
fantasy. But by comparing your

235
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,780
experiences to the experiences
of other psychedelic explorers,

236
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,000
and in this respect, Stan Grof,
compendium of so many hundreds

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,180
and 1000s of psychedelic
journeyers and their experiences

238
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,500
gave me confidence that what I
was experiencing was not simply

239
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,960
a personal illusion or personal
fantasy, But was flowing in

240
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,240
accord with what other
psychedelic journeyers had

241
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,240
experienced, and then by
comparing them to the

242
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,860
cosmologies of meditation
traditions, it gave me

243
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,960
confidence that psychedelics
were not psychedelics were just

244
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,320
a key that were giving us Access
to states of awareness, which

245
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,760
are universal, and you can get
access to these states using

246
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,020
other methods as well.

247
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,320
Simeon Mihaylov: I see so and
you began your work with the

248
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,060
motivation to explore the
universe. As a philosopher, is

249
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,240
that

250
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,980
Chris Bache: correct? Yeah, that
was my intention. I'm not a

251
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,300
therapist. I wasn't I mean, I've
received much healing in this

252
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,020
work, and always grateful for
it. But that was not my primary

253
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,920
intention. I was trained as a
philosopher of religion. I

254
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,700
wanted to explore the universe
as deeply as I could and

255
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,320
understand not only my nature,
but understand the larger

256
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,720
landscape of the universe,

257
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,860
Simeon Mihaylov: and you're
saying that despite the fact so

258
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,060
the fact that your experiences
fit in kind of the larger body

259
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,500
of religious and philosophical
traditions we have as a species

260
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,600
gave you confidence that what
you're experiencing is genuine.

261
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,620
But at the same time, you also
push the boundary in terms of

262
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,920
seeing things that you had not
encountered before and

263
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,320
elsewhere. So keeping this in
mind, do you believe that

264
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,020
psychedelics offer the promise
of new insights that we can gain

265
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,060
philosophically and spiritually
that we have not uncovered

266
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,320
before. How do you see
psychedelics fitting into the

267
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,380
future developments of
philosophy and spirituality of

268
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,500
our

269
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,060
Chris Bache: species? Yeah,
well, this is an exciting time

270
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,920
and exciting territory. I became
convinced early on that psyche.

271
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,100
Psychedelics represented a true
before and after development in

272
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,700
philosophical reflection,
because in philosophical

273
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,220
reflection, in one way or
another, we are always

274
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,000
reflecting upon the breadth of
human experience, not only our

275
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,680
own experience, but other
people's experiences, and we

276
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,520
here have an opportunity to
temporarily deepen our

277
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,820
consciousness, deepen our
awareness, and push the

278
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,740
boundaries of awareness. And I
think this opens up not only

279
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,440
individual selective insights
into the nature of

280
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,720
consciousness, but it also opens
up the possibility of an entire

281
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,200
new method of exploration, which
was first articulated, I think,

282
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,340
by William James. Well, in
modern times, there are ancient

283
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,440
prototypes of this work in the
elysinian mystery schools and

284
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,500
the Ayahuasca churches of
Brazil, but in Western

285
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,920
philosophy, probably first
articulated by William James,

286
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,680
and that is a systematic rhythm
of expanding consciousness,

287
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,940
experiencing what you can
experience, coming back,

288
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,220
recording it, evaluating it,
comparing it to other bodies of

289
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,840
knowledge, comparing it to other
people's experiences, and then

290
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,600
expanding again, going out
again, coming back, same

291
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,680
process, writing it down, this
rhythm of expansion and then

292
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,060
evaluation. Expansion and
evaluation, I think, opens up

293
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,440
the possibility. It allows us to
explore dimensions of

294
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,320
consciousness that are for the
most part, for most people,

295
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,220
unless they have are lifelong
spiritual practitioners of some

296
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,640
of the meditative arts. For most
people, these dimensions of

297
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,780
consciousness are invisible.
They just lie outside the

298
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,160
purview of their awareness. But
by systematically entering into

299
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,080
these temporary states, we can
explore them, we can taste them,

300
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,480
we can sample them, and we can
gather insights about how the

301
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,820
universe is working, because we
find that all the awareness, all

302
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,240
the intelligence, all the
compassion, which is inside us

303
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,320
is not something which has been
assembled by Mechanical chances,

304
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,840
by mechanical processes which
are driven by random variation

305
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,600
as of the modern mind thinks,
but we find that our mind opens

306
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,040
into an infinite mind, something
which is ultimately an infinite

307
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,280
mind. It opens up into the
species mind, the collective

308
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,320
unconscious of our species, into
deeper and deeper levels beyond

309
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,520
the species and ultimately into
the mind, which is the

310
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,180
generative mind of the universe
itself, at least that's my

311
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,040
experience. Now philosophically,
we've been talking about that

312
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,320
mind for years, even in denying
its existence if you choose the

313
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,340
atheistic alternative, but we've
been wanting to know about we've

314
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,480
been asking questions about our
larger place in the cosmos,

315
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,300
whether there is meaning in our
lives, whether there is

316
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,740
intention in the evolutionary
project, what the hell is going

317
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,480
on? Why does life hurt so much?
Why is there so much suffering?

318
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,440
These are core philosophical
questions that in the modern

319
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,460
mind, many philosophers have
just abandoned and just said

320
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,280
they're unanswerable. We can't
know, so we're going to change

321
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,940
the topic of discussion. But
still, as long as we live, we

322
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,240
want to know the answer to these
questions. Psychedelics, I

323
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,000
think, give us an opportunity to
systematically and rigorously

324
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,020
engage these questions, and
that's a turning point, because

325
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,580
ideally, for example, I think we
would want to take 100 people,

326
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,440
say the best educated people,
most creative people with PhDs

327
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,360
in multiple disciplines, and
then go through the same

328
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,660
systematic regimen of disclosure
encounter, and then compare the

329
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,100
notes of all these people and
see what is the collective

330
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,900
patterns that they're what is
the common ground that they see

331
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,040
and recognize this tokens? I
think this is what's beginning

332
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,120
to happen. This is what we're
doing. This is what we will be

333
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,360
doing for hundreds of years. And
this is a turning point

334
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,320
philosophy. This really marks a
difference between old

335
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,620
philosophy, which was done on
the basis of just sensory

336
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,920
consciousness, and a new
philosophy, which is done on the

337
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,560
basis of this new technology,
this new technology of

338
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,160
encounter,

339
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,460
Simeon Mihaylov: that's that's
really momentous changes that

340
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,540
seem to be coming within
psychedelic Renaissance, which

341
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:58,660
seems to be happening at the
moment. But for for our viewers,

342
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,660
that in your book. Have a really
nice section where you describe

343
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:10,140
a day in the life of you doing
your psychedelic session. For

344
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,320
those of our listeners and
viewers that are not aware of

345
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,340
it, would you go through it and
tell us what your protocols

346
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,840
really were and how a typical
session they would go,

347
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,280
Chris Bache: Well, there's a
chapter in the book basically a

348
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,640
session day, because some of the
readers, early readers of the

349
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,300
manuscript, asked me to do just
this, to kind of take him into a

350
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,700
typical day. So here's a typical
day. All my sessions took place

351
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,840
in my house or in my wife's
therapeutic office. They always

352
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,740
began in the early morning. I
was always I would begin with

353
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,460
meditation or yoga or some type
of centering practice to get

354
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,300
myself centered. And the more I
worked with these states, the

355
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:01,380
more important I paid to more
parts I understood was the

356
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,000
preparation, not only the
preparation of set and setting,

357
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,640
which is well appreciated today,
but a lot of attention to my

358
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,140
emotional state and my physical
state, a lot of practices

359
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,500
purifying my body, making sure
that my literally, my physical

360
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,080
bone structure was aligned.
Because when you enter into

361
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:31,280
these states, if you are not
really balanced, open, porous,

362
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,720
in good condition, you can get
into all into various

363
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,500
complications and energy gets
jammed up in your body. But the

364
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,160
dates, they would start early
morning, I would go through my

365
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:51,400
practice, and then my sitter for
all the 20 years of my work was

366
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,320
my first wife, Carol, who was a
clinical psychologist. And

367
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,680
basically, after these early
preparations, I would take the

368
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,420
psychedelic and then I would
turn over responsibility to my

369
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,180
condition, to her to my
protection. She would take care

370
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,440
of me. She would make sure I was
safe. She would make sure that I

371
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,620
would stay focused inwardly,
that I would not allow myself to

372
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:22,280
get distracted or act out in any
dangerous way. I for the most

373
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,960
part, because I was working with
very high doses of LSD. There

374
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,280
was no verbal interaction. I was
listening to music. She was the

375
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,200
curator of music, responsible
for intuiting when to shift from

376
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,540
one stage to another. There are
certain stages in a psychedelic

377
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:46,780
session, I would basically do
the work as long as it lasted,

378
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,620
which is usually six to eight
hours. She was with me the whole

379
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,980
time, making sure I was safe
until I was back, and

380
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,720
consolidating. And then I would
spend that evening reflecting on

381
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,320
the sessions, thinking about it,
trying to put together the first

382
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,420
map of what had happened in the
sessions. And often, I didn't

383
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:14,580
sleep much the day after a
session, but the next day, it

384
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,720
was always a priority to make a
written account of the session.

385
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,860
And when you're entering really
foreign territory, making an

386
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,160
accurate written record can be
challenging. Now, some people

387
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,720
who have artistic abilities can
draw them or paint them. Alex

388
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,960
Gray's work, such wonderful
work. Other psychedelic artists,

389
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,100
I don't have those skills. So
for me, it was making a written

390
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:48,640
record, and in order to learn
how to capture experiences that

391
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,740
are so elusive and so far beyond
our ordinary way of knowing, I

392
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,300
developed a technique. I called
it, standing at the edge of the

393
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,520
well, the day after a session,
you're still porous around the

394
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,880
edges, but your verbal and
cognitive functions have

395
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,680
returned. So what I would do is
I would play the music that was

396
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,940
used in the session in exactly
the same order that it had been

397
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,800
played in the session, and I
would get back into the mood or

398
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,740
the psychological space of the
that I was in when this music

399
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:29,540
was being played. And from that
condition, one foot in the

400
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,680
session, one foot out, I would
write up that portion of the

401
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,580
experience. And when I was done
with that, I'd shift to the next

402
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,740
piece of music and play it over
and over until I had captured as

403
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,480
best as I could what had been
happening during that music, and

404
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,160
when I was done, I had my draft
of the session. Once I had that

405
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,060
draft, I locked it, I didn't
change it. I learned that by

406
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,660
trying, sometimes trying to
improve the text or make it a

407
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,640
little more positive. Published
that you lose something that is

408
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,840
contained in the original, raw
language. So once I had that

409
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,140
text, I locked it, yeah, and
then I would spend weeks,

410
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,820
months, sometimes basically
studying the sessions, trying to

411
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,740
understand it, put it in the
context of previous sessions. On

412
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,060
average, I was doing about five
sessions a year. That's kind of

413
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,540
statistically, that's what it
worked out. So I had plenty of

414
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:35,660
time in between my sessions to
digest and assimilate them. And

415
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,020
I was also doing spiritual
practice during this time, I was

416
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,300
always meditating. So the day
after a session always began

417
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,960
with meditation, which is a
nice, spacious place to be able

418
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,920
to open up and just let the
energy that had been running in

419
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:58,060
you during a session flow in you
in your meditative space. So

420
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,440
that's basically what a session
looked like I would not eat

421
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,800
anything before breakfast.
Always an empty stomach, because

422
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,340
I would throw up often. Because,
you know, people don't think you

423
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,000
throw up on LSD, but you do. You
know this is it's one of the

424
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,960
symptoms of shifting states of
energy. Your body has some

425
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,100
challenge adjusting to these
more intense states. And I would

426
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,520
eat something light at the very
end of the day.

427
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,200
Simeon Mihaylov: There's so many
things I'm curious about your

428
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,220
particular approach. But one
thing in particular for me is

429
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,480
music. I want to ask you about
the way you use music, because

430
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,000
music and psychedelics have
always had a very special

431
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,860
relationship, I think, and there
have been different approaches.

432
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,580
So, for example, Terence McKenna
is famous for saying five dry

433
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,840
grounds in silent darkness. That
was his recommendation. And he

434
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,020
he once famously joked that if
you come out of a psychedelic

435
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,380
session saying Bach was a
genius. Well, you know,

436
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:03,360
everybody knows that. So his
approach, rather, was to kind of

437
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,560
let the experience take you
where it takes you. But you

438
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,640
were, as I read in your book,
were very particular in the your

439
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,180
choice of music, and it changed
as you progressed in your in

440
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,180
your work. There was also one
very funny moment in which your

441
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:25,100
city put on the wrong piece of
music, but this actually helped

442
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,220
you get out of a very kind of
difficult situation. So yes,

443
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,220
what's your approach with music?

444
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,800
Chris Bache: Well, music does
influence our experience, and I

445
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:43,120
do value working without music.
I mean, I've continued to work

446
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,580
with psychedelics after stopping
my high dose LSD work, but and

447
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:54,280
during this post, LSD work, I
often will just enter into

448
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:01,500
meditative space with Psilocybin
or Ayahuasca. And in the

449
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,880
psychedelic work itself, in the
late years, in the late

450
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,280
sessions, I would often end the
music in the second half of the

451
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,860
session and just move into
meditative space. But basically,

452
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,300
I followed the protocol that was
kind of laid out in the early

453
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,900
psychedelic research and the
understanding here is not that

454
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:31,100
music gives you experiences, but
that music can support the

455
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,780
underlying immersion of your
unconscious into your awareness,

456
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:42,100
so it just kind of provides a
background that makes it easier

457
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:47,380
for you to detach from the
habits of your mind and to go

458
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,820
with the flow, as it were, into
what eMERGE is emerging. So I

459
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,980
think of it as supporting and
reinforcing what happens when

460
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:02,280
you do go simply into the dark
without any music at all. And we

461
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,300
know that there are stages of
the LSD experience. There's a it

462
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,900
takes so many minutes for it to
begin to become active. It

463
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,460
builds in potency again. You
have to look carefully at the

464
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,800
psychedelic you're using the the
curve of activation on it, the

465
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,260
depth of activation. It's
different if you're working with

466
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,160
low doses of LSD than if you're
working with high doses of LSD,

467
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,840
working as I did with high dose
levels, it was a tremendous

468
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,980
acceleration of consciousness, a
tremendous speed with which your

469
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:42,340
body and your mind is adjusting
to the extraordinary increase of

470
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,200
energy and awareness as you
begin to break through the

471
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,040
bounds of personal
consciousness. And so they're

472
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,000
Helen Bonnie's early work on the
stages of psychedelic of a

473
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,240
psychedelic session and the type
of music that supports that

474
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,820
session. So I follow. Of those
early guidelines, which have

475
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,240
been further expanded in the
Holotropic Breathwork network,

476
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,600
which has a good, large library
of musical recommendations, I

477
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:19,740
found I came across early on in
about by about the fifth or

478
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,980
sixth or seven session, I came
upon some indigenous chanting,

479
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,120
types of indigenous chanting,
and I found that that music had

480
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:35,300
a much more powerful impact on
my on my experiences, than

481
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,140
listening to classical music,
even new pieces of Classical

482
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,860
music. And I did listen to lots,
but they still kept within

483
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,580
conventional they kind of kept
within a more conventional

484
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,300
framework. And I found that
indigenous music, that was

485
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,780
foreign, that was unknown, that
I didn't understand the words of

486
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:02,580
and they had a more of a
cathartic opening effect in my

487
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,660
consciousness. So I found it
very useful. And like I began to

488
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,200
collect all manner of indigenous
music and different cultures

489
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,440
from around the world, and I
incorporated them into my

490
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,980
sessions. And then when you are
at peak, when you've gone

491
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,120
through you've announced you've
gone through the purification or

492
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,740
the death process, and you've
transitioned into deeper,

493
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,740
ecstatic reality, into visionary
states. You want music which is

494
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,180
more expansive, which is kind of
gives your mind room to work, so

495
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:40,480
to speak, just very, very
expansive. And then as you begin

496
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:46,000
the long, slow descent. LSD has
a long tail, so that's a long,

497
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,720
slow process, which is really
one of the nice advantages of

498
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,780
LSD. It gives you time inside
the session to integrate,

499
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,440
reflect upon, to compose
yourself with respect to the

500
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,140
experiences that you've just
had. So you want long, gentle,

501
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:11,220
gentle, expansive music in all
of the work until the very end.

502
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,420
You don't want any words in
English or any words in your

503
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,940
native language, words which you
can understand, because you

504
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,840
don't want them to script your
experience best to Well, I found

505
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,360
that I would only really could
use music three times before I

506
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,980
had to let it go for the most
part, because by the time you've

507
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,460
used music several times, it
tends to get saturated with the

508
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,900
experiences that you had with
that music. So when you listen

509
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,680
to the music, it tends to take
you back into where you were

510
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,600
before, not where you are now.
So I would really limit myself

511
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,860
to using music only a few times,
and then I had to find new music

512
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,220
when you're in the downward
slope, when you're coming back

513
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:02,400
into your more familiar life.
Then that applies less. I am

514
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,620
more comfortable using more
familiar music in the spacious

515
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,160
return.

516
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,940
Simeon Mihaylov: I see also,
well, another thing about your

517
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,480
sessions, also, I think which a
person who is not familiar with

518
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,500
your work and who is not
familiar with the psychedelic

519
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,120
work at all would think, okay,
here is this person. He's having

520
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,820
this visionary experiences. It's
so very nice and very

521
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,760
interesting, and he's writing
about them. So it must be very

522
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,840
exciting, very pleasant work.
But I think anybody a little bit

523
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,680
familiar with the psychedelic
experience would know that these

524
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,380
are especially high dose
experiences are very difficult

525
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,340
experiences to go through. So
some especially, I know that

526
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,060
your initial sessions, you write
about them, they were very

527
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,140
expansive, very exciting, but as
time went on, they became more

528
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,200
and more difficult, and
difficult times started

529
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,300
appearing more often and they
were harder to go through. So at

530
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,320
some point, I'm sure it was
difficult for you to to kind of

531
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,260
go through it again, knowing
what's probably waiting for you

532
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,660
that it's going to be a day of
really difficult experiences. So

533
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,220
so in the light of this, how did
you work with daily spiritual

534
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,280
practice to help you prepare for
this, and also, not only for

535
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,080
this, but also to kind of
incorporate your insights into

536
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,020
your daily life. Because, as
you've said previously, these

537
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,500
psychedelic experiences, we
cannot hold on to them, so we

538
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,360
need to find ways to integrate
them.

539
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,760
Unknown: Yeah, yeah. Well,

540
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,920
Chris Bache: let me try to hold
on to two parts to your

541
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,900
question. First of all, the
method of working with high dose

542
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,500
LSD, and then issues of the
challenges that come up. Of the

543
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,760
three things. The challenges
that come up in high dose work,

544
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,500
and third, integrating those
experiences into daily life. So

545
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,700
if I get lost in my answer, you
bring me back to those three

546
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,120
Stan's, early work
differentiated very clearly

547
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,360
between low dose psyche therapy
and high dose psychedelic

548
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,600
therapy, low dose psyche lytic
therapy is kind of much more

549
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,460
similar to what is being done
today. The goal here is to

550
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,560
amplify consciousness, but not
but do it in a way where the

551
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,600
unconscious unfolds itself
gradually, layer by layer,

552
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:48,460
taking us systematically, kind
of more less traumatically, into

553
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,820
the inner confrontation that
heals their psychedelic work was

554
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,840
very different. And what stands
out in my mind is their work at

555
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,060
the Spring Grove Hospital in
Maryland, where they were

556
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,820
basically working with a
different population. They were

557
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,540
working with terminally ill
cancer patients. So they were

558
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,500
working with people who were
going to die. And they were

559
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,420
trying to trigger an encounter
with cosmic reality. They were

560
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,860
trying to trigger, essentially,
an n de, a Near-Death Experience

561
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,300
that would give them a foretaste
of where they were going when

562
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,460
they died. And they this
protocol limited high dose

563
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:36,920
sessions to three sessions, no
more than three sessions. So

564
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,220
this is very different protocol.
It wasn't really trying to heal

565
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,300
all the layers of personal
issues. It was trying to blow

566
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,160
through the personal unconscious
and go into cosmic reality, just

567
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,300
to get a taste, to get a sample.
So I thought, well, if you could

568
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,320
do that three times, you can do
it more than three times, and

569
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,180
just, let's go for it. Let's
just go for it and see how

570
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,580
deeply we can go. And in doing
that, I found it took me about

571
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,900
two years of work, about 10
sessions, to basically go

572
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,600
through what Stan calls the
perinatal level of

573
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:21,680
consciousness, where I lived my
birth and relived various very

574
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,200
strong, physical, emotional
confrontations, existential

575
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,020
crises, questioning the meaning
of existence, the

576
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,680
meaningfulness, the futility of
life, all the things one goes

577
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,180
through in those initial and
early experiences. And then I

578
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,700
went through kind of a classic
ego death experience, where my

579
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,420
my individual identity was
shattered. It was turned inside

580
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,200
out. I was forced to become the
exact opposite of everything I

581
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,960
knew myself to be. And in that
process, Chris bacheous, life,

582
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,200
crispicious historical
existence, ceased to be the

583
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:05,280
container of my consciousness, I
just moved into a more expansive

584
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,480
awareness beyond the historicity
of crispicious life. As I went

585
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,300
deeper, I began to experience a
very, very different order of

586
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,100
challenges that were not
personal. I began to be

587
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,280
systematically taken into vast
territories of pain and

588
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:35,840
suffering, violence and wars and
just brutal, just like Dante's

589
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:43,420
Inferno, except many times
worse, and this was much harder

590
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,260
than experiencing my the doubts
of metaphysical anxiety or the,

591
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,280
you know, my personal ego death.
This was something different.

592
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,380
But here's the thing, I would
spend hours in this condition,

593
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,200
and it was difficult, and going
back into it to the next

594
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,060
session, I had to really steel
myself to prepare myself to

595
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,380
enter into this domain, once I
knew that it was coming. But I

596
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,940
would spend a couple of hours or
a few hours in this process, and

597
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,740
then it would reach a crescendo,
and it would spin me out into

598
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,480
the visionary state. It would
spin me out into the ecstatic

599
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:28,820
visionary state. And when that
happens, the pain of the very

600
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,360
intense pain of the ocean of
suffering was balanced and

601
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,680
proportioned to the great
ecstatic joy that followed in

602
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:42,280
the ecstatic portion of those
sessions. So when you understand

603
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,520
this cycle, when you understand
the pattern that there will be

604
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,680
this very intense period of pain
in some form or another, but

605
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,760
this is going to be followed by
an even deeper immersion into

606
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,040
ecstatic visionary experience

607
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,060
Unknown: you have. Uh,

608
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,440
Chris Bache: it's not just that
the sessions become pain filled.

609
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,740
There is a new layer of pain,
but there's also a new layer of

610
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,220
insight and ecstasy and joy, and
that's what gives you the

611
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,360
strength to return and keep
coming back to these states, and

612
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,660
that tremendous sense of
ecstatic, visionary encounter,

613
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,700
cosmological inquiry. And so as
I went as the the ocean of

614
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,380
suffering lasted two more years,
and I went through that level,

615
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,920
and then I went through yet
another Death-Rebirth process,

616
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,320
and then came into another
deeper level of consciousness,

617
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,540
archetypal reality, and moving
deep into the collective psyche

618
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:49,300
and archetypal psyche, and then
going through yet another death

619
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:55,420
and rebirth, went into the
ecstasy of oneness, the ecstasy

620
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,800
of causal reality for an entire
year, just experience after

621
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:07,020
experience of different levels
of of oneness, parameters of

622
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:14,160
oneness. So the challenge does
increase, but the payoff also

623
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,840
increases as you go deeper. So
it's I've always considered that

624
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,460
trade off a good exchange. I've
always been a volunteer in this

625
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:29,720
process. Nothing was done to me.
I always was willing to go

626
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,700
there, and the rewards that I
was given for the engagement

627
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,480
always made it worthwhile. I
wouldn't trade these 73 days for

628
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,940
anything, any of the treasures
of the world

629
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,540
Simeon Mihaylov: that's
beautiful about the psychedelic

630
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,940
work. One thing that I've
noticed is that they psychedelic

631
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:00,780
work parallels, in a certain
way, just what people would call

632
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:06,060
normal spiritual daily practice.
So let's say, if somebody reads

633
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,540
your book but entirely forgets
the fact that you were entering

634
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,680
into psychedelic states, they
could read it as a report of a

635
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,800
person going through intense
daily meditation practice. Let's

636
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,040
say, because I think these
cycles of purification and then

637
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:28,160
expansive insight and bliss
appear in normal states of

638
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,960
consciousness, so in a merge in
a much kind of smaller scale.

639
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,100
But I think there's essentially
a mirroring, almost fractal like

640
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,500
parallels between psychedelic
state and real life. And kind of

641
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:49,180
why I'm really interested into
how you've used daily spiritual

642
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,800
practice is because I
essentially think that there

643
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,480
shouldn't they should be.
Discontinuity between daily

644
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,580
practice and psychedelics is
very important, I think, because

645
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:08,940
Ram Dass used to say that, you
know, going on an LSD trip is

646
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,760
like being with Buddha or Jesus
in a room for two hours, but

647
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,940
then you have to leave, and then
the artist kind of staying in

648
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,320
that room for as long as you can
without any assessment. So what

649
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,600
are your views on that?

650
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,560
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, I
completely agree with you that

651
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,060
there's nothing unique about
psychedelic experiences because

652
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,460
they are amplifiers of
consciousness. So it's

653
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,480
consciousness that does the
work. In the end, it's not

654
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,120
psychedelics that do any unique
work. It's consciousness. I've

655
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,660
had many readers write me and
say, you know, I've never taken

656
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,080
a psychedelic in my life, but I
completely relate to what you're

657
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,100
describing. It mirrors my own
experience in terms of these

658
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,920
breakthroughs and levels for
this particular part of the

659
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,260
experience. So I know we know
that there is a profound overlap

660
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:04,620
and continuity between our work
in ordinary, spiritual, let's

661
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,820
say non psychedelic spiritual
practice, and psychedelic

662
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,300
spiritual practice. And it's
more than just that. I mean,

663
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,480
basically, in order to
understand what happens in

664
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,500
psychedelic sessions, we have to
have an understanding of what's

665
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:25,460
happening in life, what how life
works. Now for me, reincarnation

666
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,240
is just a fact of existence. You
know, that's my first book was

667
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,600
on reincarnation, and I consider
the empirical evidence

668
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,920
supporting a reincarnational
worldview is just overwhelming

669
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,720
at this point. It doesn't mean
that we understand how it all

670
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,160
works, all the details of it,
but that there is a continuity

671
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,240
arcing through multiple
lifetimes in a larger

672
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,320
developmental evolutionary
process is really important to

673
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,820
understand. So in order to
understand this rhythm of where

674
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,820
we are, we die. Die, and we our
consciousness gets large into

675
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:07,740
the soul territory. We
incarnate, and we get small and

676
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,340
focused, and we die, and we get
large and we incarnate, we get

677
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,720
small and focus, and we keep
going back back and forth. And

678
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,500
it's like every time we
incarnate, we choose a certain

679
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,300
set of issues. We choose a
certain set of challenges that

680
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,560
we face and confront, and as we
face and confront those things,

681
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,940
our life develops it. You know,
sometimes we don't do so well.

682
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,080
We flunk the course. Other times
we do very well. We're past and

683
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:43,360
moved on. And this rhythm shows
itself inside every life and

684
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,560
across multiple lives, when we
are when we go through, if we

685
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,760
look at long strings of our of
lives as in past life therapy or

686
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:56,620
that type of work. And in this
sense, I think what LSD, what

687
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:01,020
any spiritual practice does, and
psychedelic spiritual practice

688
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:06,300
does is that it accelerates this
process where reincarnation

689
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,560
moves very slowly and grinds
very finely. But if you want to

690
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,240
speed up the process, you can
turn awareness back onto itself

691
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,220
and look at where awareness is
coming from, examine, engage

692
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,840
their challenges that you are
facing in the outer world in

693
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,520
their core nuclear form, when
they exist as thought forms

694
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,120
within your consciousness. If
you don't do that, they will

695
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,120
eventually, these thought forms
will manifest as your outer

696
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:39,500
physical reality. But if and
you'll learn from them. But if

697
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,820
you speed up that want to speed
up the process. You can look at

698
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:48,040
them in their nuclear form and
engage them before they manifest

699
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:52,300
in the physical world. This
happens in spiritual practice,

700
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,660
in meditative practice, and it
also happens in psychedelic

701
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,800
practice. So I completely agree
with you. The more I've worked

702
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,000
with psychedelics, the more I'm
convinced that if you want to

703
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,760
open yourself up to these
temporary states of

704
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,140
consciousness, it's very
important to be practicing. Have

705
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:14,220
a daily spiritual practice. In
fact, the deeper the state of

706
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:17,940
consciousness you enter
temporarily, the stronger should

707
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,740
be your daily practice, because
when you open to these vast

708
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:28,640
fields of energy, these vast
territories of consciousness. It

709
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:35,120
places tremendous challenges. It
makes it tremendous strains, in

710
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,300
a way, not only on your mind,
but on your body, on your subtle

711
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:46,360
energy system, and it's really
important, I think, to bring

712
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:53,380
those experiences into a daily
spiritual practice, so that your

713
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,700
the conditions you move into in
your spiritual practice, in Your

714
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:04,200
daily practice, give you the
greater capacity to absorb and

715
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,580
integrate and to navigate not
only the insights but the the

716
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,380
experiences that emerge in your
psychedelic states. In my

717
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,580
psychedelic states, I was given
many practices. I was given not

718
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,080
just teachings and experiences,
but I was basically told, Do

719
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,740
this, do that. You know, I was
given practices, and I would

720
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:30,200
take those practices into my
daily spiritual practice in the

721
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,060
last five years of my work. And
this, I discuss this in the

722
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:43,360
diamond Luminosity chapter I
entered into Vajrayana Buddhism.

723
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,780
I had always been a meditator,
but I began a more formal

724
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,800
relationship with Vajrayana
teachers, and I began to

725
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:56,140
practice within this Buddhist,
Tibetan Buddhist tradition. And

726
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:00,480
I found this was very helpful
for where I was working at the

727
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,620
time, because I was working at
that time in very, very pure and

728
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,680
very intense states of
awareness, diamond Luminosity,

729
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,240
and I was finding that it was
getting increasingly difficult

730
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,700
for this, for my subtle energy
system, to sustain The encounter

731
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:23,840
with the enormous flows of pure
energy in this diamond

732
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:29,240
consciousness. And when I began
to do these ancient practices,

733
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,960
when I began to do Chud in the
various deity practices of

734
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,100
Vajrayana, I found that my
physical and psychological and

735
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:41,620
subtle energy systems were able
to breathe more freely. It was

736
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:47,200
like my Vajrayana practice gave
me a space to enter that was

737
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,400
midway between my physical
consciousness and my psychedelic

738
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,600
consciousness, and by entering
those states, I was able to

739
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:01,800
breathe and flow the. Energy
that came into my psychedelic

740
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:07,740
sessions, I could, I could
channel that energy. I could it

741
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:12,660
just kind of moved more freely.
It gave me a way of dialoguing

742
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,440
with the universe that allowed
my body and my mind to sort of

743
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:21,620
breathe more comfortably. This
was very helpful at the time. So

744
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,340
I completely agree with you. I
mean, the most important thing I

745
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,680
think, to remember about
psychedelics, in terms of

746
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,400
spiritual practice, is you can't
take a psychedelic when you die.

747
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,780
When you die, you go into the
universe. You're all on your

748
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:41,080
own. The mind you take is the
mind you got so knowing that

749
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,400
everything you do in your
psychedelic work should be

750
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,260
preparing yourself for that
final encounter when you let go

751
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:54,160
of the body and you enter into
that world, you can't take

752
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,960
psychedelics when you're dead.
Now, I think psychedelics can

753
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,140
give us can teach us a lot about
where we're going, it can

754
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:08,280
prepare the soul for where it's
going. So that territory, which

755
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:13,500
may strike us as kind of strange
and intimidating for an ordinary

756
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:18,240
person when they die, we can
encounter it as you know, just a

757
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,740
familiar route that we've
traveled multiple times before

758
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:27,200
in our psychedelic sessions. So
I don't I understand the tension

759
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:34,400
for some teachers of classical
meditation and their criticism

760
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,920
of psychedelics as kind of a
false spirituality or

761
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:46,600
distracting experiences. I
understand that, but for me,

762
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:51,640
I've never found it to be an
incompatible approach to

763
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,240
spiritual a deepening spiritual
experience. It's not the same.

764
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:00,420
It does open up different types
of experiences. But if you

765
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,480
understand spiritual practice,
if you understand how

766
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,580
spirituality, what spirituality
is, I think that spiritual that

767
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:15,780
psychedelic work, can reinforce
and accelerate our daily

768
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,260
spiritual practice in ways that
are really very beneficial.

769
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,860
Simeon Mihaylov: Yes, I agree
with that. And also myself, I'm

770
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:29,180
very interested in how one can
achieve synergies between

771
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:34,820
between the two. Now, in this
last answer that you gave, you

772
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:40,240
already touched upon some of the
kind of deeper territories of

773
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,720
your work. So I'm wondering
whether you'd like to move into

774
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,400
this and discuss the cosmic
blueprint that was revealed to

775
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:56,140
you during your work. One, one
of the one of the things that

776
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,280
you talk about is reincarnation,
and I find this very interesting

777
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:06,540
reading you, reading your book
gave me kind of almost a

778
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:10,080
permission to be interested,
intellectually interested in

779
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:15,840
reincarnation and not be shy
about it. And you, your work has

780
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,660
really made me consider
reincarnation in a serious way

781
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:24,080
for the first time and kind of
discuss it with other people. So

782
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,320
you mentioned a number of books,
a number of authors, in fact,

783
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,760
the kind of a large literature
that exists that has documented

784
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:37,880
cases that are suggestive of
reincarnation. So I was curious

785
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:42,160
what has convinced you of
reincarnation in your reading

786
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,960
and in your personal experience.

787
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,160
Unknown: Yeah.

788
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:51,880
Chris Bache: Well, when I began
my teaching at Youngstown State,

789
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,540
I told you that Stan Grof was a
major turning point in my life,

790
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,720
but there was another author who
was also a major turning point.

791
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:04,320
And this is Dr Ian Stevenson at
the University of Virginia, and

792
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:09,300
he's passed on now, but the work
continues at Virginia, and he

793
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:14,400
had spent a lifetime he and his
team studying children from

794
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,760
around the world, different
cultures, different religious

795
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,160
backgrounds, or non religious
backgrounds, children who, as

796
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,160
soon as they begin to be able to
talk, when they're two years

797
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,000
old, they begin to speak very
matter of factly about their

798
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,720
other life that they remember
having lived. They describe

799
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,860
people and places and events.
They often have a very powerful

800
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:41,860
emotional attachment to that
previous life, they will run

801
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:46,060
away from home, sometimes just
to return to the family that

802
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:50,140
they knew in their previous
life. So Stevenson has studied

803
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:54,040
1000s of cases like this, and
he's published hundreds of

804
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,480
cases. Most of the cases he
studied do not meet the highest

805
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:04,080
levels of rigor we. Required for
verification and publication.

806
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,520
But an amazing number of courses
do allow themselves to be

807
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:13,440
verified. So when I read his
book 20 cases suggestive of

808
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,460
reincarnation, it just it
absolutely showed me something

809
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,480
that I had never encountered in
graduate school, never in many

810
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,980
my studies that reincarnation is
a simple fact of life, these

811
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,880
children who know things that
they shouldn't know, that we can

812
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,060
reasonably exclude other
possibilities that they could

813
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:36,200
have come through this knowledge
through normal or physical

814
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,380
channels, their parents talking,
or their neighbors talking, or

815
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,480
something they saw on television
or in a newspaper that we can

816
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:47,320
reasonably eliminate those
possibilities, and we have to

817
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,400
confront the fact that these
children know things that other

818
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:56,260
people that about other people's
lives and have an emotional

819
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,680
attachment and identification
with what with that knowledge

820
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,980
that seems clearly to indicate
that there is continuity between

821
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,400
the life experience of that
previous life and their present

822
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,560
life. And at the end of his
career, Stevenson publishes

823
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:19,800
monument Opus in which he
demonstrated not only that our

824
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:25,280
memories continuous, but in some
cases, even our bodies bear the

825
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,920
marks of events that took place
in our previous lifetime that

826
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:37,700
children he studied. 187 cases
of children who had birthmarks

827
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,880
our pigmentation are seeming
scars on their body that

828
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,140
reflected the death
circumstances of previous life.

829
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,980
So someone who was stabbed in a
previous life, and they have a

830
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,940
memory of that life, had a
birthmark where they were

831
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:59,200
stabbed in a way that replicated
that, or someone who was hung

832
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,480
had scars on their neck that
seemed to correlate this an

833
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,160
absolutely fascinating study.
And from there, once I was

834
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,520
convinced by Stevenson's
research that reincarnation was

835
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,440
simply part of life, I went on
to study the work of multiple

836
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,600
past life therapists who were
working with their clients to

837
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,740
heal the wounds of their present
life. Most of the time when you

838
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,340
work in therapy, the wounds of
your present life go back to

839
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:32,840
some trauma or some disruption,
some unhappiness from our

840
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:38,300
present life earlier in our
life, but he past life

841
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,020
therapists consistently find
that there's a certain

842
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:48,280
percentage of pains which are
not healed when you go back to

843
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:52,120
your form, to your present life,
but when you allow your mind to

844
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:58,720
open into your deeper history,
then all of a Sudden, you are

845
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:04,740
reliving a deeper story. You are
remembering things that happened

846
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,760
when you were a different person
than you are now, but you

847
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,660
remember them with the same
sense of identification and self

848
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:18,000
sense that you have for your
present life. And when people do

849
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:23,180
this, when they go back and
relive the pains and the trauma

850
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:28,400
or the conflicts that were
present in their previous life,

851
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:34,160
it has a healing effect on their
present life. And after reading

852
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:38,060
hundreds of cases like this, it
just became more and more

853
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:43,240
obvious to me that reincarnation
is part of the larger rhythm of

854
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,760
our life. It doesn't mean I
agreed with all the

855
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,760
interpretations of
reincarnation. In fact, that's

856
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,440
one of the things that came up
in my sessions, was an expansion

857
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,540
of the model of what's taking
place in reincarnation. But the

858
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:04,680
fact of reincarnation, the fact
that one life rolls into another

859
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,820
life rolls into another life
with time in between. I mean,

860
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,960
Michael Newton's work, a past
life therapist, life between

861
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,520
life. His books, journey of the
soul, journeys of the soul and

862
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,340
destiny of souls, has done
fascinating work he was doing

863
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:27,260
conventional kind of past life
regression therapy, and he he

864
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:31,640
made a mistake one day in one of
with one of his clients, he gave

865
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:36,020
an ambiguous instruction, and
suddenly he realized that his

866
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:39,500
patients were described. His
patient was describing what

867
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:44,080
happened to them after they died
in the former life they had been

868
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,940
reliving. So he discovered that
people had the capacity not only

869
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:52,480
to remember their former lives,
but to remember what they were

870
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,640
doing in between their incarnate
lives. And so he after he had

871
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,080
regressed hundreds of people
back in. To this in between

872
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,460
state, he began to write a
series of books, journeys of the

873
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:09,120
journeys of the soul, journey of
souls and destiny of souls, in

874
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,040
which he basically compiled what
his clients were telling him

875
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,320
about the interlife state. And
in there it becomes, it's part

876
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:25,100
of his discovery that people
choose consciously their present

877
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:29,120
the conditions of their present
life, that there is a process

878
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:33,500
when you die, there is a
debriefing process, a process of

879
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,680
integrating back into the soul,
integrating into the world of

880
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:41,620
spirit, a process of maybe
healing some of the

881
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:45,280
unhappinesses that have been
collected in your present

882
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,700
lifetime. But then there is a
period of refreshment and

883
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,120
restoration and learning
continues, and there is a social

884
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:57,880
structure to the postmortem
condition. There comes a time

885
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:02,220
when it's time for class to
resume. The soul begins a

886
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:06,840
process of choosing the
conditions of its next

887
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:12,420
incarnation. This is that that
basic let's really opens up a

888
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:18,540
whole new understanding, in this
sense. Now I think that just as

889
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,720
kids and people in college, some
people choose their courses very

890
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,380
carefully and systematically
with great forethought, and some

891
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,160
people choose their courses kind
of haphazardly or randomly, just

892
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,940
picking what comes what works in
their work schedule, and they

893
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:38,720
get different results. I think
it may be also the case for the

894
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,880
soul. Some souls choose more
carefully than other souls. But

895
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,940
the idea that we choose our
incarnation, we choose the

896
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,880
circumstances of our
incarnation, that it's an

897
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:54,520
intelligent process, and by
making choices of what we want

898
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,300
to experience, doing our best in
that experience, expanding out

899
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:03,840
by becoming male, female, rich,
poor, Warrior, Priest, artist,

900
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:09,840
all these different varieties.
We grow faster than we would

901
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:14,280
grow if we lived all these years
as one person, the same person.

902
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:18,900
So sometimes with my students, I
would say, imagine that you are

903
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,000
the creative intelligence of the
universe, and you had two

904
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,440
options. You could create a life
that would live 100,000 years,

905
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,280
or you could create a life that
would live the same 100,000

906
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:35,420
years, but in 100 year
increments, and every 100 years,

907
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,600
they would change the
circumstances of the life at the

908
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,740
end of 100 years. Which do you
think would produce the greater

909
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:47,440
learning? And I think it's clear
that the 100 Year increment life

910
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,640
would produce the greater
learning. That's understanding

911
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:56,260
that underneath the short term
experience of our present life,

912
01:07:56,620 --> 01:08:00,280
there is an accumulation taking
place at the level of the Soul,

913
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:05,460
that the soul is learning, the
soul is accumulating the

914
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:09,780
experiences of all of our many,
many lifetimes. And they aren't

915
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:14,940
that learning is not necessarily
present in each individual life,

916
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:20,220
but it's holding them like a
library in the spiritual

917
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:27,920
reality. Now this was I saw this
also in my sessions. I

918
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,880
experienced, in some cases,
former lives with people that I

919
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,720
was engaged in. In this present
lifetime, there was healing that

920
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:40,600
took place in these encounters.
But I also was taken into a

921
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,780
series of experiences which
pushed the boundaries.

922
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:50,140
There was a particular session
which I call the birth of the

923
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:56,020
diamond soul, in which I
experienced all of my former

924
01:08:56,020 --> 01:09:00,240
lives coming into me very quick
just there was tremendous work

925
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,180
had been done earlier in the
session, and I was in a state

926
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:07,860
where I was just seemingly
integrating streams of

927
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:11,280
consciousness from multiple
lifetimes. And it was like

928
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,380
wrapping string around a kite
spool filaments of white light,

929
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,540
and they seemed to hit a
critical mass at one point, and

930
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:24,680
when they hit a critical mass,
they fused all these lives,

931
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:29,480
fused into a single energy
entity. And when they fuse,

932
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:33,500
there was an explosion of
diamond light that it just

933
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,000
exploded from my chest, and it
catapulted me into a completely

934
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,140
different state of
consciousness. I was an

935
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:45,220
individual, but I was an
individual beyond any frame of

936
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:50,800
reference that I had previously
known. I wasn't Chris Bache, but

937
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,340
I was a being that Chris Bache
was part of, and all of these

938
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:58,000
other former lives were part of,
and this is what I came to call

939
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:04,620
the birth of the diamond soul.
I. Is the idea that life grows,

940
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:08,520
that part of the intelligent
process of life is growing human

941
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,260
consciousness, layer by layer,
semester by semester, as it

942
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:17,220
were, grade by grade, course by
course, allowing us to expand

943
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:20,240
and grow, hopefully, more
intelligent, more compassion. We

944
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:23,360
make mistakes, we learn, but we
learn from those mistakes, we

945
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:28,400
grow, we grow. But the process
is not simply about becoming

946
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:36,380
incrementally, gradually, more
than we were. Sooner or later,

947
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:40,480
there comes a time when all of
those lives, all of their

948
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:47,320
learning fuse and the soul
consciousness awakens within us.

949
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,760
I think in the normal process of
reincarnation, we experience our

950
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:58,180
soul when we die. So we go from
ego to soul, back to ego, back

951
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:04,020
to soul. But if we keep this up
1000s and 1000s of years, 1000s

952
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:09,360
of years, sooner or later, it's
a natural process that the soul

953
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:16,200
wakes up inside time and space.
I think this is what's

954
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,380
happening, not only for us
individually, but it's what's

955
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:23,540
happening for us as a species.
We are in the process through

956
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:28,340
our long, long history, our long
evolutionary journey, our long

957
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:33,620
learning process. We are in the
process of transcending the ego

958
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:39,560
and waking up. The soul is
waking up inside time and space.

959
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,020
This is, I think history is
taking us into a time, into an

960
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:50,020
epic, when the diamond soul is
waking up on Earth.

961
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:57,040
Simeon Mihaylov: That's
beautiful. Concerning this

962
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,340
vision of reincarnation that you
gained through your experiences

963
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:06,360
and through your reading. There
are three particular issues that

964
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,240
I two particular questions that
I have which I think are very

965
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:13,920
difficult to answer. They arise
as many other issues from the

966
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,300
fact that it's difficult to talk
about these things. But the

967
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:23,300
first issue everybody knows, how
can reincarnation? Yes, how can

968
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,600
consciousness travel from one
biological mechanism into

969
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,720
another? But we can leave that
alone, because it's probably

970
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,920
beyond each one of us at the
moment, but then two other I

971
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,900
think the answer is, we don't
know.

972
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,260
Chris Bache: Yeah, no. We don't
know what the physics of the

973
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:43,240
soul is. We don't know how our
memories leave our biological

974
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:50,020
base and how consciousness kind
of reprograms or returns to and

975
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:53,500
integrates with a new biological
body. We just don't have the

976
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:56,980
answer that question. But we
won't begin to find the answers

977
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:59,980
to that question. And still, we
start asking different

978
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:04,680
questions, we have to open up to
a more complex cosmology of a

979
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:10,320
multi level universe, and stop
acting as if our consciousness

980
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,520
is being generated and created
by our brain. That's a reductive

981
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,120
cosmology which doesn't allow us
to even begin to find the

982
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,320
answers to the question you're
asking. So I hope you're right.

983
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,920
We don't know, but I think in
time, we'll get more and more

984
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,880
knowledge in that area.

985
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,880
Simeon Mihaylov: Yeah, hopefully
that's that would be a very

986
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,260
interesting thing to realize how
it works. But also, when you

987
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,420
talk about the soul, that's
something that I'm very

988
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:38,840
interested in, because, let's
say, if somebody is just doing

989
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,600
meditation practice, one of the
key insights, I think, of

990
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,580
meditation, is non self,
Non-duality, the CO arising of

991
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:53,080
everything. So how does that
stack up with the idea of a soul

992
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:58,000
reincarnating? And what is
reincarnating? Is it the doer,

993
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,220
the thing that makes choices in
the life, or is it the weakness,

994
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:05,340
the thing that kind of just is
conscious of all of these

995
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:05,700
things?

996
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:12,000
Chris Bache: Yeah, I've had
those experiences of Non-duality

997
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:16,860
and what Buddhism calls
emptiness, Shunyata, emptiness

998
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:21,500
of self, where there is an
experience of such intimacy that

999
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:25,220
there is no self inside you, and
also no self anywhere in the

1000
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:32,840
world. Everything is just open
and pours and magnificent

1001
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:37,220
experience. And I think it
depends on how you think of the

1002
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:41,920
soul, if you think of the soul,
and I think this is kind of the

1003
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,460
way we have, by habit and by
custom, have thought of the soul

1004
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:49,240
in the past. It's kind of what I
think of as an atomistic theory

1005
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,840
of the soul, in contrast to a
quantum or field theory of the

1006
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:58,120
soul, if you think of the soul
as a fundamentally isolated

1007
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,720
unit, which does. Not change and
is fundamentally isolated from

1008
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:09,420
other souls or other beings,
then you have a problem, because

1009
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:14,100
Non-duality and Shunyata
emptiness is cut is it

1010
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,120
contradicts that atomistic
notion of the soul. But if you

1011
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,860
have kind of a quantum model of
the soul, if you have a soul as

1012
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:27,620
a field, as a as a learning
system, which is never isolated

1013
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,200
from the surrounding being
surrounded from the surrounding

1014
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,100
world, which is always in an
energetic exchange with that

1015
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:39,740
world is always kind of
incorporating information and

1016
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:44,440
energy from in the waves of
life, then I think we can

1017
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:49,240
concept, understand, an
understanding of soul, which is

1018
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,840
one dynamic. It's always
changing. It's never fixed. It's

1019
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:57,940
always evolving through time.
And it's porous. It's a reality

1020
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:04,140
which is porous, and yet it has
individual, an individuality it

1021
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:09,600
has, it is, I think, the
universe is a learning

1022
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,320
environment. It's learning in so
many ways. It's learning at a at

1023
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,860
a species level, but it's also
learning at an individual level.

1024
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,360
We are learning. We are growing.
We are holding on to our

1025
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,920
experience. We remember our
experience, we acquire insights

1026
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,160
on the basis of that experience.
It doesn't mean we're isolated

1027
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,240
from the world, and it doesn't
mean we're static, but we are

1028
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:37,460
developing an individuality
which is a porous individuality.

1029
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:41,200
So in the end, I don't think
there is any contradiction

1030
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:48,640
between affirming an emergent
individuality in creation and

1031
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,200
the fundamental condition of
Non-duality. And I think this is

1032
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,160
also affirmed in the spiritual
traditions. Even the Dalai Lama

1033
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:02,820
has written that what Buddhism
rejects in rejecting it in its

1034
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,560
anata doctrine, it's no self
doctrine. What it's rejecting is

1035
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:13,140
not individuality. What it's
rejecting is a static soul, a

1036
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:16,680
soul which doesn't change in
time, and a soul which is

1037
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:21,440
independent of other realities,
independent of surrounding

1038
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,400
reality. Once you want to, once
you kind of shift your

1039
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:31,820
understanding of soul to this
kind of open field vision, then

1040
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:35,420
I think it's completely
compatible with Shunyata

1041
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,640
emptiness

1042
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:41,800
Simeon Mihaylov: and this open
field vision of the soul. I

1043
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,060
think it also kind of leads into
your observation that

1044
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,460
enlightenment isn't a private
process. You were talking about

1045
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:55,300
how in particular, one thing I
found very interesting is you

1046
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,300
would talk about how your
experiences of purification and

1047
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:02,220
healing, you could see them
affecting not only your personal

1048
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:07,680
sphere, but also the larger
collective of humanity, which I

1049
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,740
found very interesting. And I
wanted to understand how that,

1050
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,300
how that works, and how that
feeds into your vision of the

1051
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:20,300
future human. And yes, please
tell us, say a bit more about

1052
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:20,600
that?

1053
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:28,400
Chris Bache: Oh, that's a big
question. You know, when I began

1054
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,640
this work, I thought I was doing
this work for my personal

1055
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:35,480
edification, you know, from my
personal healing, maybe even my

1056
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:40,600
personal spiritual realization.
But I found that even though

1057
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:44,260
that was maybe my mindset, that
wasn't the universe's mindset,

1058
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:51,340
it wasn't what was going on from
its end. The Mystery of the

1059
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:55,540
collective ramifications of our
work, the collective import of

1060
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:59,800
our work, it's only a mystery if
we start with the assumption

1061
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:04,500
that we are fundamentally
private entities, but in the

1062
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,160
nature of the experience, both
in classical, meditative

1063
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,760
spiritual deepening and in
psychedelic spiritual deepening,

1064
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:16,200
we discover that that's not the
case. We discover that we are

1065
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:20,960
always and forever and always
have been, always will be part

1066
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:26,000
of an interwoven network of
life. And the image I like to

1067
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,780
use for this is the image of a
tree and a leaf, leaf

1068
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:33,020
consciousness and tree
consciousness. So imagine you

1069
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:38,060
were seeing a tree where all you
could see all the leaves, and

1070
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:41,200
imagine all the leaves were
individually conscious. They had

1071
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:45,160
individual personalities. And
imagine that everything that was

1072
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,360
covered in bark was invisible,
so all you could see were the

1073
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:53,020
leaves, but you could not see
the trunk and the limbs of the

1074
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:58,480
tree. And imagine that one of
these leaves decides to explore

1075
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,520
what is the real nature of his.
Or her being. So he goes deep

1076
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,140
within, and he finds that place
in their inner being where they

1077
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:11,820
connect to the twig and pushing
their consciousness deeper into

1078
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:16,140
the twig, into the limb, into
the branch, eventually into the

1079
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:20,280
very core of the tree, and
suddenly has the exploding

1080
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,860
awareness of what a tree is,
sees the tree, experiences the

1081
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:30,500
tree, and therefore knows what a
leaf is. The leaf is not a

1082
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:36,200
separate, private part. A leaf
is a living aspect of a much

1083
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:43,720
deeper, larger being, and that
the well being of the leaf is

1084
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,660
connected to the well being of
all the other leaves in the

1085
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:51,280
tree, that we truly are all in
this together. And when that

1086
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:59,080
awareness dawns, then if that
consciousness works its way back

1087
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,940
up into its leaf again, back
into its leafness Now, it sees

1088
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:08,700
all the other leaves in the tree
as an aspect of it, of this

1089
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:13,680
deeper identity which all leaves
share. It would also say strange

1090
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:19,020
things, like there is no self.
Shunyata, it is anata, meaning

1091
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:23,420
there is no private self. We're
all here together. Compassion

1092
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:27,740
would spontaneously manifest,
because one would know that what

1093
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:31,340
you do to another leaf, you do
to yourself because you're doing

1094
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:35,840
it to the tree. We're all
individually connected. These

1095
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:41,480
are things that surface in all
deep spiritual traditions, in

1096
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:49,600
the psychedelic practice, what I
found is that when I would open

1097
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,640
deeply within quote myself, I
would be involved in healing

1098
01:21:54,640 --> 01:22:00,420
work and cleansing work that was
not related to my personal

1099
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:04,920
history, but expanded beyond my
personal history in some way, it

1100
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:11,340
would be as if I were working to
heal all the leaves on one

1101
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:16,200
particular branch of this
particular tree. And this just

1102
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,620
happens spontaneously, because
nature doesn't hold the

1103
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:23,480
boundaries that we imagine exist
in our private, small mind.

1104
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:29,600
Nature lives as an integrated
whole. Our species lives as an

1105
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,740
integrated totality. So it's
just natural that when we open

1106
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:38,300
up to that totality, as we do
with psychedelics, we we enter

1107
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:42,580
into and we can dissolve
completely into that reality. So

1108
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:46,600
it's not just that the leaf has
a leaf experience of the tree.

1109
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:52,000
The leaf can dissolve into the
essence of the tree and

1110
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,460
experience how the tree
experiences life. The same thing

1111
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:02,220
happens in psychedelic work. We
enter into purification

1112
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:08,760
processes which affect the tree
lows around us and we enter into

1113
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:14,100
ecstatic joy, ecstatic
experiences of intimacy with

1114
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,540
life, intimacy with the divine,
which naturally you can't

1115
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:22,220
contain it. It naturally
radiates through your awareness

1116
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,860
into the awareness of all the
beings around you. All spiritual

1117
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:31,760
traditions have recognized that
our spiritual practice radiates

1118
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,080
through the fabric of the world,
not just the human fabric, but

1119
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:41,500
the fabric of all reality, also
the the animal fabric of the

1120
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:47,800
world. So, you know, I'm getting
a little lost in the thought of

1121
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,400
that. It's just, it's just it
becomes so natural, it becomes

1122
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:59,860
such a repeated experience that
it helps me understand, in some

1123
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:03,300
ways, the Buddhist tradition
that at the beginning of every

1124
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:07,140
meditation session or any
spiritual practice, you begin by

1125
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:11,040
cultivating what they call
bodhicitta, which is the desire

1126
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,600
to save all sentient beings. So
you open you're doing this

1127
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,260
practice not for your personal
benefit. You're doing it for all

1128
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:24,200
beings. At the end of your
practice, you give away all the

1129
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:29,240
benefit to all the beings of the
universe at all the levels. So

1130
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:32,780
what you're doing is not just
for your is not for your own

1131
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,560
benefit. You're doing it for the
benefit of the totality, and in

1132
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:43,060
doing that, you strengthen your
awareness that you are a fractal

1133
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:48,400
aspect of the totality. And in
that awareness, there is great

1134
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:53,740
liberation, there is great joy,
because you know you're you just

1135
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:58,480
allow yourself to live and begin
to live the larger life. In the

1136
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:02,160
larger life is what all those.
Spiritual teachers and saints

1137
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,660
have been talking about the
compassion that treats your

1138
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:12,180
enemy as as friends, the
compassion where you open into

1139
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:18,180
deep time and you know that you
are more, that you are not just

1140
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:21,920
the small you, which usually
takes so much of our time and

1141
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:28,160
attention. You know that what
you are is a piece of life which

1142
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:33,740
has infinite extension and
infinite range and reach, and in

1143
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:39,380
that knowledge, there is the
great relaxation, the great joy

1144
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:46,060
you just it dissolves
alienation. It dissolves

1145
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:50,860
loneliness. One becomes, once
again, what one has always been,

1146
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:57,280
but forgets. One becomes a
joyful aspect of the totality.

1147
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:03,360
Simeon Mihaylov: Chris, here I
have just all the quotes that I

1148
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,120
have taken from your book, and
so difficult choosing which one

1149
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:10,140
to go with. But there is one,
one particular section in which

1150
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:14,040
you I'm going to quote you
directly. Here, you talk about,

1151
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,940
kind of the purpose of this
whole exercise of reincarnation

1152
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:23,060
and learning. And you say, you
say, on the other hand, I also

1153
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:26,060
felt an exquisite tenderness
coming from the Creator who

1154
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:29,180
experienced with us every pain
we had taken upon ourselves.

1155
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:32,780
Humans were so precious to the
Creator that not a single ounce

1156
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,800
of pain, not a single cure was
wasted. The depth of that divine

1157
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,840
care so moved me that no
sacrifice seems too large or

1158
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:44,800
unreasonable, and I think here
you're talking about all the

1159
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,000
suffering that is involved in
this process of learning and a

1160
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,140
vision in which of this kind of
made sense for you, as in it

1161
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:59,200
didn't seem as meaningless
suffering anymore. This remind

1162
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:03,240
me, I don't know if you, if you
have ever read the brothers

1163
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:07,920
karma by Dostoevsky. It's a
great novel that talks about

1164
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,400
these issues. And at one point
there are these two brothers,

1165
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,240
Alyosha and Ivan karmazov, and
they discuss the existence of

1166
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:19,800
God. And basically, Alyosha is a
faithful kind of servant of God,

1167
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,720
very pure of heart, but not so
smart. And then there is Ivan

1168
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:28,220
karmazov, who is exception. He's
essentially a genius, successful

1169
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:33,080
in every manner you can imagine,
but a complete atheist. And when

1170
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:38,300
he talks about why he rejects
God, He gives pages upon pages

1171
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:42,520
of examples of cruelty inflicted
upon children, and actually the

1172
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:47,440
safety had taken that out of
actual accounts of children

1173
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,040
being tortured, being killed,
being maimed. Then this is very

1174
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:55,420
interesting, because it reminds
me of your experiences where at

1175
01:27:55,420 --> 01:28:00,240
certain point of your journey,
you were faced by these not just

1176
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,760
images, the experiences of
children being killed, the

1177
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:07,140
killing of the children. Yes,
exactly, yeah. And I think that

1178
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:10,860
is really the ultimate argument
you can raise against this

1179
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:16,560
cosmic plan. What justifies the
suffering of innocent beings?

1180
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,440
What can justify this suffering?
Because eventually, Ivan

1181
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,620
karmazov says, perhaps there is
a God. Maybe I do believe in

1182
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:27,440
God, but I do not accept the
world that he has created. So

1183
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,700
what's your comment on that?

1184
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:40,660
Chris Bache: That is the hardest
part of all of it, isn't it? How

1185
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:46,540
can we affirm an intelligence,
let alone a compassion behind

1186
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:50,380
existence, operating through
existence, when everywhere we

1187
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:54,700
look around us, there is so much
pain, so much brutality, so much

1188
01:28:54,700 --> 01:29:00,160
horror, compounding over and
over again, so much suffering.

1189
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,680
Unknown: I you

1190
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,740
Chris Bache: know Ramakrishna,
the great Hindu saint, he said,

1191
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:12,240
If you want to understand God,
you must be willing to look

1192
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:19,500
suffering in the face. And I
really, I hold that, and I

1193
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:23,720
really respect that, and I think
it's really true. You you can't

1194
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:28,340
you must understand suffering.
You must confront suffering and

1195
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:34,880
engage suffering if you have any
hope of understanding the true

1196
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:40,760
divine. Now I'm really I'm very
comfortable with atheism, and

1197
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,560
atheism is a rejection of
theism, and depending upon the

1198
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,740
theism that we're talking about,
most of the theisms that I know

1199
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:52,840
deserve to be rejected. Most of
them are too small. Most of them

1200
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:59,560
are the the gods of so many
religions are terrifyingly small

1201
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:03,900
and. That the vision of life
that comes with them are

1202
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:10,320
terrifyingly inaccurate and
inadequate and do not provide

1203
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:16,140
anywhere near an adequate
understanding of existence to

1204
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:21,740
help us understand the enormous
pain that we're seeing. And I

1205
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:27,920
don't think I'm going to be able
to succeed and in answering this

1206
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,340
question satisfactory, but it's
a question I live with, and so I

1207
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,200
can only offer you a few things.
I

1208
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:49,180
in order to understand the
suffering in life, we also have

1209
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:53,980
to understand genius in life, in
order to understand what's

1210
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:58,960
happening in life's deficiencies
children who are born without

1211
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,480
brains, you know, without you
know, we have to understand the

1212
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:09,540
larger trajectory of life. My
sense of it is, and my

1213
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:14,520
experience of is, when I have
dissolved into what I experience

1214
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:18,540
as the creative intention of the
universe. I dissolved into a

1215
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:26,240
process of creation, a process
of manifestation, self

1216
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:33,980
manifestation, first, that was
just vast, just huge and

1217
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:40,340
ancient, just extraordinarily
old. Been going on so long,

1218
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:45,580
billions, billions of years, 13
point 8 billion years, they tell

1219
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:48,280
us, since this big bang. And
we're not at all sure that this

1220
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:54,280
is the first of the Big Bangs so
and that the creative capacity

1221
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:59,080
of the universe extends not just
to, you know, the

1222
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,060
microorganisms, and the
organisms on this planet, but

1223
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:08,460
entire galaxies and stars and
the collapsing of stars and the

1224
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:11,640
emerging of planets and the
evolution of life on the planets

1225
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:17,760
and just countless galaxies,
countless galaxies. So we now

1226
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,800
are the first generation to
truly appreciate the scale of

1227
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,920
the universe that we're involved
in, both of its age and its

1228
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:28,880
expanse. And we've all been
fascinated by the wonderful

1229
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,780
images coming from the Hubble
telescope and other Prana other

1230
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:36,500
scopes that are giving us these
magnificent pictures of the

1231
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:42,640
scale of existence. And it's in
that context, I think that we

1232
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:46,900
have to look at our own
existence, our whole species

1233
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:52,300
existence, and ask, what are we
doing? What's happening here? If

1234
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,480
there is intelligence, how is
this intelligence expressing

1235
01:32:55,480 --> 01:33:00,960
itself here in our life, and in
particular, why is it so hard.

1236
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:05,760
Why is life so hard? Why
couldn't life be made easier?

1237
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:09,480
It's like so I can believe in
God, but I don't believe in I

1238
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:15,720
don't accept the universe that
this God has created. And and I

1239
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:20,780
agree with those deep
sentiments, because they honor

1240
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:26,480
our children, they honor life,
and there is no justification on

1241
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:34,340
the surface like that for their
suffering and their pain. But

1242
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:39,620
again, if we look at this in a
context, a human being is a

1243
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:45,160
growing intelligence a human
being is growing, and its growth

1244
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:49,360
rests upon the shoulders of the
primate kingdom, which rests

1245
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:53,860
upon the shoulders of other life
forms which preceded the

1246
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:58,960
primates and so on down the
evolutionary ladder. If we want

1247
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,720
to assess the condition and
judge the condition. Certainly

1248
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:08,520
we have to ask ourselves the
question, are we at the end of

1249
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:13,200
this process? Are we? Are we all
that there is, is this where

1250
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:17,160
it's going to end? Is this? Is
this what's happening? If you go

1251
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:20,040
to see a play and it's a 10 act
play, and you're only in the

1252
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:24,080
first scene of the first act.
Clearly, you don't have enough

1253
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,380
information to know whether the
play is a good play. You must

1254
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:31,160
see it through to the end. If
you're on a car assembly plant,

1255
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:35,180
and you're only at station
three, and there 215 stations of

1256
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:38,300
the sembly plant, and you're
seeing something being built,

1257
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:42,100
but you don't even see enough to
understand where it's going or

1258
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:47,560
what it is, then you just can't
understand the process. And part

1259
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:51,820
of the advantages, or one of the
great advantages, of working

1260
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:55,840
with psychedelic states, is that
it allows you, under certain

1261
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:01,156
conditions, to expand beyond
this moment of time. Be. It

1262
01:35:01,156 --> 01:35:05,356
allows you to expand and to
dissolve, not only into the

1263
01:35:05,356 --> 01:35:10,036
intelligence that's manifesting
as the universe that's

1264
01:35:10,036 --> 01:35:15,196
manifesting as the life forms in
the universe, but it also allows

1265
01:35:15,196 --> 01:35:20,240
you to experience not only the
distant past of this self

1266
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:25,100
manifesting universe, but also
the future of this self

1267
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:30,740
manifesting universe, entering
into what I call deep time. And

1268
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:33,860
my experiences in deep time have
convinced me that there are

1269
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:38,300
dimensions in which the universe
knows itself, which go far

1270
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:43,960
beyond this present moment, and
in those encounters, in those

1271
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:51,100
dissolving into the deep future,
been able to experience, or have

1272
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:55,120
been given, the experiences of
something of the creative

1273
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:01,680
process, something of the how
creativity is expressing itself

1274
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:08,520
in human beings, and we come
here to make choices. We make

1275
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:12,660
choices, and we learned. We make
bad choices, we have bad

1276
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:15,180
consequences. We make good
choices, we have better

1277
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:19,200
consequences. But we're just
getting started. We only became

1278
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:24,680
self aware about 5000 years ago.
I mean, we only became aware of

1279
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:28,160
the consciousness that lies at
the center of our being, our

1280
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:32,720
common our deep consciousness.
We only began to have access to

1281
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:37,280
that about 5000 years ago. Self
Awareness came earlier, but what

1282
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,680
the self is began about 5000
years ago, and we are just

1283
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:47,260
getting started. We are just
beginning to exercise the full

1284
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:52,300
potential which lies latent
within the human being. And in

1285
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:56,380
that process, in that creative
process, we are dealing with a

1286
01:36:56,380 --> 01:37:05,520
very incomplete creation, a very
incomplete planet, an incomplete

1287
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:10,740
species, and a species which in
some ways is still living out of

1288
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:18,660
very barbaric, primitive levels
of self understanding And in its

1289
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:24,080
primitiveness, inflicts great
damage on the beings around it.

1290
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:27,920
It's like the pain of being of
an individual leaf is so

1291
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,480
terrible we go insane and we
inflict damage on other leaves.

1292
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:35,780
But it's not just that. It's
like

1293
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:45,640
the process of evolution itself
is incomplete. Is still working

1294
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,960
it out, working things out. The
process of organic evolution is

1295
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:56,080
incomplete. Sri Aurobindo said,
humanity is a transitional

1296
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,980
species. We are not the end of
the line. We are simply a

1297
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:04,020
transition going from a lower
order of awareness into a higher

1298
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,980
order of awareness when then,
when we stabilize at a higher

1299
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:11,640
level of awareness, we're going
into yet on higher and a higher

1300
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:17,220
level of awareness, the ability
of mind to be able to influence

1301
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:23,600
matter, The ability of mind to
be able to manifest joy. Grace,

1302
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,860
fruition inside matter is still
being developed. The ability of

1303
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:31,760
our mind to be able to control
the diseases of the body,

1304
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:36,560
they're still being developed.
We are basically so profoundly

1305
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:44,620
incomplete. Nature is so
profoundly incomplete. My basic

1306
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:49,900
response to suffering is that it
does reflect, in certain ways,

1307
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:55,480
the incompleteness of the
universe. It also reflects the

1308
01:38:55,480 --> 01:39:00,340
terrifying demands of learning
through experience of

1309
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:05,040
experiencing the consequences in
some instances, not at all, but

1310
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,700
in some instances, of learn, of
inheriting the consequences of

1311
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:12,780
choices that we've made so that
we can learn from those choices

1312
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:16,380
and make better choices in the
future. But not all suffering

1313
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,360
really derives from human
choices at all. Some suffering

1314
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,480
just devised from what we would
call the cruelties of nature.

1315
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:28,340
This planet is a severe place.
Hurricanes come through and wipe

1316
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:33,800
out 1000s of lives. Earthquakes
wipe out 1000s of lives. Biology

1317
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:41,380
takes out 1000s of children.
This is a very, very intense

1318
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:46,360
world, we must be willing to
look suffering in the face if we

1319
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:54,280
want to understand the deeper,
the deeper intentionality that

1320
01:39:54,280 --> 01:40:01,140
is expressing itself in this
very incomplete. Place in time.

1321
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,400
We tend to sort of see God as
all perfect and static and

1322
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:09,120
unchanging, and therefore we
hold God responsible for making

1323
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:11,700
this that the other. But I don't
think that's the way it is at

1324
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:15,840
all. We are cells in the being
of God. We are cells in the

1325
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,500
being of the Divine. The Divine
is not separate from any of the

1326
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:22,640
pain that the children are
experiencing. But Divine is not

1327
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:26,360
other than or distant from
what's going on, what's taking

1328
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:30,440
place, but we ourselves within
the emerging the divine. We are

1329
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:35,420
aspects of its so the pain is
always felt, always registered,

1330
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:40,100
always held. We are all in this
together, and we are growing

1331
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:44,800
together. Now, here's the thing,
if we were to stop the whole

1332
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,820
process right now, if we were to
hold the creative intent, the

1333
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:52,720
designer, accountable for just
where we are right now, that we

1334
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:57,520
would have to conclude it's a
bastard. He's a bastard because

1335
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:02,640
it's just too much pain. There's
too much pain. But if we were

1336
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:07,020
able to go forward in time, if
we could go even such a short

1337
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:12,060
distance of time of 100,000
years from now, and experience

1338
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:15,300
an evolved humanity, what we are
becoming, what we are in the

1339
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:19,140
process of becoming, we would
experience a much kinder

1340
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:22,880
humanity, a much more gracious
humanity, a much more

1341
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:27,920
intelligent humanity, a much
more compassionate humanity, a

1342
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:33,620
humanity that was much better
able to manage still the

1343
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,500
fluctuations of nature, which
are so painful and so

1344
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:40,960
catastrophic and we just it's
hard to envision where this is

1345
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:46,900
going, where this is taking us
now. This brings me to the

1346
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:51,100
deeper part of your question.
Where are we now in this

1347
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:55,180
process, where what is, what's
happening in our historical

1348
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:59,740
circumstances? What is the
future, the immediate future for

1349
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:00,540
our species?

1350
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:02,760
Unknown: And here,

1351
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,620
Chris Bache: I know that I'm
sharing just my own visionary

1352
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:12,420
experiences. I know that what
may be powerful and true for one

1353
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:15,600
person would not necessarily be
powerful or true for another

1354
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:20,660
person. So I can only share with
you what my experience has been

1355
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:28,940
early on in my sessions, oh,
starting in around the 23rd

1356
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:33,080
session. So for the last 50 of
my sessions, one of the

1357
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:39,680
recurring themes of my sessions
was that where humanity is

1358
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:43,960
going, where we're what's
happening, and the vision was

1359
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:47,740
over and over repeated. We are
coming into a turning point in

1360
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:51,460
history. We're coming into a
decisive before and after point

1361
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:57,940
that we were poised on the edge
of a magnificent transition into

1362
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:03,420
a higher level of functioning,
that there was that there was a

1363
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:09,360
greatness in emerging within
humanity. And when I look around

1364
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,540
at history, I thought I'd say,
Well, I don't exactly see that.

1365
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:16,020
I see people being just as
stupid now as they were, you

1366
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:20,360
know, 5000 years ago, in so many
ways, and just as cruel. But my

1367
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:23,600
sessions kept saying, no, no,
look deeper. There is an

1368
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:28,100
emerging greatness in humanity.
And again, I understand this

1369
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:33,620
within reincarnation, there is
to see humanity. Is not just to

1370
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:38,420
see the present generation, but
is to see the living pulsing of

1371
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:43,660
life, incarnating again and
again over many 1000s of years.

1372
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:47,380
And the greatness that is
emerging is a greatness that's

1373
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:52,660
emerging at that deeper level of
accumulation of the soul, which

1374
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:55,900
is collecting and harvesting,
all the learning, all the

1375
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:59,080
suffering, all the
experimentation, all the

1376
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:03,600
courage, all the innovation
that's been we're cultivating

1377
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:09,360
through all of these lifetimes.
So the My Sessions kept showing

1378
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:15,960
me that there is a greatness
emerging in the human story, and

1379
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,320
that there was a we were coming
into a decisive turning point in

1380
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:23,900
history. But it never showed me
how it was going to realize

1381
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:32,480
this. I had no idea how this was
going to come about. And then in

1382
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:37,220
the 55th session, it took me
into what I call the Great

1383
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:42,040
Awakening session. It took me
deep into the future, and it

1384
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:48,520
took me there in order to allow
me to experience the death and

1385
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:53,980
rebirth of the human species.
And I don't mean that as a

1386
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:58,000
physical death and rebirth, but
a sort of a psycho spiritual

1387
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,080
death and rebirth, but a death
and rebirth. It did involve much

1388
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:05,400
physical suffering and many
deaths. And I had this

1389
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:09,960
experience, not as Chris Bache
or not as even Chris Bache, of

1390
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:15,660
an expanded version of myself,
but I had the experience as the

1391
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:19,800
entire species, my consciousness
had dissolved into the

1392
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:27,980
collective psyche. So I
experience a profound crescendo

1393
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:36,320
of suffering and a birth coming
out of the suffering that was a

1394
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,860
birth of a new human being, a
new form of human being.

1395
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:45,520
Basically, I experience a
historical period of an

1396
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:51,280
unraveling, loss of control, an
inability to control the

1397
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:55,540
circumstances of our life, a
tremendous kind of confronting

1398
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:58,840
of the sins of the fathers. We
are our own fathers, of course.

1399
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:03,480
So a confronting of our past, a
confronting of all the foibles

1400
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:07,320
and the limitations and the
divisiveness of history and the

1401
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:10,440
short sightedness of our forms
of governance that we had

1402
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:15,600
emerged and it was a global
systems crisis that seemed to be

1403
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:20,780
driven by a global ecological
crisis, but a global systems

1404
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:25,100
crisis where humanity was
basically forced, ultimately,

1405
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:31,040
into simply trying to survive.
And for a time it looked like we

1406
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,280
weren't going to survive. It
looked like it was an extinction

1407
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:38,000
event. It looked like we were
going to lose our place in

1408
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,360
existence altogether. But just
when the storm was at its peak,

1409
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:48,400
just when things were at their
worst, it was as if a hurricane

1410
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:53,860
passed over the island and the
skies began to clear. And when

1411
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:57,160
the skies began to clear, there
were many survivors. There had

1412
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,600
been many deaths, but there were
many survivors. And when the

1413
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:03,660
survivors began to pick
themselves up and began to move

1414
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:08,580
forward and find each other,
there sprang forth from within

1415
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:14,160
each of them, individually and
from within the collective, new

1416
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:18,360
ways of knowing, new ways of
feeling, new understandings, new

1417
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:24,080
insights. Fundamentally at its
core, there was the birth of an

1418
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:29,660
appreciation of oneness, an
experience of oneness, not as a

1419
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:35,120
theory, not as kind of an
ideology, but an experience of

1420
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:38,240
that tree that underlies
individual leaf consciousness,

1421
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:43,000
that we truly are one. We truly
are connected to each other, and

1422
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:47,560
in that birth of that awareness,
we began to build a new world,

1423
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:51,460
not the world created by the
ego. And the ego is a

1424
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:55,120
magnificent expression of
creativity. The ego is

1425
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:59,740
magnificent, but the ego is
divided from the fundamental

1426
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:05,460
springs of consciousness and
from each other, and the world

1427
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:09,420
which ego has created is a
divided world. It's a world

1428
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:13,740
which favors some portions of
society at the expense of

1429
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:20,420
others. It's not a world that
works for all, but with the

1430
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:25,460
birth of oneness, with the birth
of this transformation, we began

1431
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:29,240
to build a new world. We began
to build a world which truly,

1432
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:36,740
truly did work for all, in which
there was, there was truly a new

1433
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:41,440
beginning. And this creativity,
these new ideas, they fed upon

1434
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:45,700
themselves. So there was a
cascading of more and more

1435
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:51,100
beauty, more and more knowledge,
more and more understanding. And

1436
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:54,520
I think what was taking place,
what I experienced, was a

1437
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:58,960
collective birth of the diamond
soul, that the soul was waking

1438
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:02,580
up on Earth, that we were waking
up and understanding ourselves

1439
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:07,500
to be not simply 100 year old
beings. We were waking up and

1440
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:11,580
experiencing ourselves to be
100,000 year old beings with

1441
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:16,320
relationships 100,000 years old.
And in that awareness, we not

1442
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:21,380
only experienced a much deeper
compassion with other human

1443
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:25,160
beings and other life forms
altogether, but we experienced

1444
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:28,760
greater transparency to the
creative intelligence of the

1445
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:33,380
universe itself. We were no
longer experientially isolated

1446
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:37,820
from the cosmic intelligence of
the universe, but we could take

1447
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:44,020
in deeper downloads from the
intelligence of the universe,

1448
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:47,920
and with these deeper downloads,
there was no technological

1449
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:52,540
problem which we could not
solve, because we were awake

1450
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:57,580
intellectually at deeper levels.
We could understand things.

1451
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:01,440
Understandings came easier.
There. Was no technological

1452
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:05,640
barriers to what we could
accomplish in this world. This

1453
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:08,940
is the birth, what I call the
birth of the future human. And I

1454
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:13,920
think the future human is the
diamond soul incarnating in

1455
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:19,800
history in my one of the last
great vision of my journey, in

1456
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:25,280
the 70th session when I thought
I was beyond all the meltdowns

1457
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,440
that I'd gone through before.
I'd gone through so many

1458
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:32,420
meltdowns, it put me through the
worst strip down of my entire 20

1459
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:37,820
year journey. It just broke me
down terribly. And I think it

1460
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:40,960
was necessary in order to give
me the experiences that

1461
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,700
followed, and it took me deeper
into the future than it had ever

1462
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:50,200
taken me before. And in this
condition, one of the

1463
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:54,400
experiences that unfolded there
is that it gave me yet again,

1464
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:59,380
and my deepest experience of the
future human, it was as if I was

1465
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:04,560
allowed to try on for size, the
new archetype of the new human

1466
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:10,620
that had emerged had been
birthed in the in evolution, and

1467
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:12,240
just touching this being

1468
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,800
Unknown: was so extraordinary.
Just

1469
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:23,240
Chris Bache: if I try to
describe it, I don't think I can

1470
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:27,920
do it without crying. Just a
magnificent beauty, just a

1471
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:32,780
completely healed humanity,
healed of all the scars that had

1472
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:36,740
accumulated through all those
1000s of years of incarnating a

1473
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:42,700
heart, an explosively large
heart, a magnificent and

1474
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:48,640
magnificent mind capable of
illumination that staggers the

1475
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:52,720
imagination. This is the child
which we're trying to give birth

1476
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:55,660
to. This is the child which I
think we are beginning to give

1477
01:51:55,660 --> 01:52:00,420
birth to in this century. I
think we are entering the dark

1478
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:03,900
night of our collective soul,
and just as in mystical

1479
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:09,120
traditions before, in order for
full spiritual realization to

1480
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:14,400
emerge, there must take place a
dark night of our soul, which is

1481
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:19,140
a time of purification, a time
of confronting the poisons that

1482
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:24,380
are left over from our past
behaviors and opening. And as

1483
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:30,380
this dark night comes to
fruition, there is a a death, a

1484
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:35,060
death to that old self, and a
birth of something new. And when

1485
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:40,840
that new opens, it basically all
the mystics and all the great

1486
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:44,140
saints tell us the same thing,
it makes all the purification

1487
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:49,660
worthwhile. It makes all the
hardships worthwhile. That's

1488
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:53,800
when a mother gives birth, when
she holds her child, then the

1489
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:58,840
pains of labor are forgotten.
They're worthwhile. I think

1490
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:01,500
something like that is happening
for humanity. We are in the

1491
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:06,420
process. We have been gestating
the new humanity for 1000s and

1492
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:10,440
hundreds of 1000s of years,
reincarnation, lifetime by

1493
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:14,460
lifetime, we've been gestating
the new humanity. Gestation

1494
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:19,860
takes a long time. Birth is a
short time. Birth is a very

1495
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:24,500
intense process, and I think we
are in a collective dark night

1496
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:28,520
of the old of the soul. Now we
may just be in the early stages

1497
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:31,400
of it. I think we are maybe in
what John of the Cross called

1498
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:34,820
the dark night of the self,
which is the early stage of

1499
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:39,020
purification and transformation.
But these will be followed by

1500
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:43,240
deeper purification, deeper
transformation, until

1501
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:49,300
eventually, we'll let go of our
past, until eventually, when it

1502
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:53,980
hurts so much to stay as we
were, we'll begin to open up

1503
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:58,540
into who we can be and who we
need to be in order to save life

1504
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:02,820
on this planet. In that process,
I think we're giving birth to

1505
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:07,860
the new humanity. And when we
give birth to the new humanity,

1506
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:12,000
we will look back over the whole
of human evolution and all the

1507
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,300
suffering that has been
involved, and we will say not

1508
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:19,440
that it wasn't real, not that it
wasn't terrible, but that in a

1509
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:25,220
larger order of things, it was
worth it, because now we are

1510
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:30,320
operating at a completely
different blueprint of the human

1511
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:35,480
psyche. So I think we're in hard
times. We're in for hard times

1512
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:39,980
ahead. But I think these are
magnificently important times,

1513
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:45,340
extremely creative times and
times which will demand a great

1514
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:50,140
deal from us, individually and
collectively. But if we engage

1515
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:55,540
them conscientiously, if we
engage them heart and soul, I

1516
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:59,020
think they're going to change
our life individually and the

1517
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:01,980
life of our children. And our
grandchildren and our great

1518
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:08,340
grandchildren forever. So
that's, that's the visions that

1519
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:11,460
were poured into me, and so
that's, I just share them with

1520
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:11,700
you.

1521
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:14,820
Unknown: Wow. That's, uh,

1522
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,140
Simeon Mihaylov: really leaves
me speechless. It's hard. It's

1523
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:22,100
hard. Now I want to say to that,
that's beautiful, absolutely

1524
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:30,560
beautiful. I can see how, I can
see how that removes any

1525
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:35,660
anxiety, really, about death and
about life and about future of

1526
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:41,620
us as individuals of species.
It's just a beautiful, beautiful

1527
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:42,160
vision.

1528
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:44,740
Unknown: So

1529
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:48,820
Chris Bache: every time we die,
you know, of course, at a

1530
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:53,380
deepest level, all the spiritual
traditions tell us no one dies,

1531
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:57,940
we just transition into a
different level of reality. And

1532
01:55:57,940 --> 01:56:01,740
I'm not making light of death,
and I'm not trivializing it all,

1533
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:08,640
but just affirming this deeper
insight that everything we are

1534
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:14,580
survives the death of this body,
and at the end of every

1535
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:20,280
lifetime, we return to where we
came from As a resting place,

1536
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:24,860
and we are restored and
refreshed, and then we return to

1537
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:31,040
the challenges of history, you
know? So it's, it's, we don't

1538
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:35,720
have to go through all the
evolutionary future in order to

1539
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:41,860
know freedom from fear of death.
In fact, one of the, if they

1540
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:44,740
were one thing from my
psychedelic experiences that I

1541
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:49,480
wish I could, I could give to
the world, it would be

1542
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:55,240
eliminating the fear of death. I
not only am not afraid of dying,

1543
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:00,460
I'm looking forward to it,
because death is homecoming.

1544
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:02,280
Always death is home coming.

1545
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:06,480
Simeon Mihaylov: I know
different spiritual traditions

1546
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:10,440
have said that in different
ways, but I find Carl Jung, he

1547
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:13,680
says at one point that life is a
short period between two

1548
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:17,520
infinities, which in the end,
might just be one. So I think

1549
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,160
that's a beautiful way of
putting it. Yeah.

1550
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:22,580
Chris Bache: Beautifully said,
yeah.

1551
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:25,220
Simeon Mihaylov: There is one
more thing that he says that I

1552
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:29,840
want to ask, how you see this in
light of your experiences? Karim

1553
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:35,360
used to say, I can I can either
be good or I can be whole. So he

1554
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:39,140
had a tremendous respect for the
dark side of the psyche, for

1555
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:45,580
evil. Yeah. So how do you see
it? Do you see evil falling away

1556
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:49,780
as our egos fall away when we
become this future human? Or do

1557
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:53,320
you see some deeper logic to
evil continuing and becoming

1558
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:56,320
integrated and then serving some
higher purpose?

1559
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:02,040
Chris Bache: Well, I would begin
by differentiating between

1560
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:06,600
darkness and evil. People often
fuse those, but I think that

1561
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:19,020
they're different. Darkness evil
is a kind of a twisting of life.

1562
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:25,040
It is a process in which life,
in some way, has turned in upon

1563
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:32,780
itself and has cut itself so
deeply off from its source that

1564
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:41,860
it has become twisted cancerous
and needs to be restored, needs

1565
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:46,300
to be healed. Darkness, on the
other hand, is simply part of

1566
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:50,980
the inertia of existence. It's
part. It's kind of like, what,

1567
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:57,400
what the Big Bang explodes into.
It's what it's, what is the

1568
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:03,060
resistance to the creative
process itself. But I think when

1569
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:06,420
When Jung talked about, I'd
rather be whole than be good, he

1570
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:09,900
was claiming all the parts of
his life which weren't

1571
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:13,260
necessarily socially good or
even that he would deem good,

1572
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:16,680
she was claiming the whole of
his life. And I think that's

1573
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:19,320
that happens in spiritual
practice, and it certainly

1574
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:23,780
happens in psychedelic practice.
We grab the whole of our life.

1575
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:28,400
We grab all aspects of it, even
the parts that we're embarrassed

1576
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:32,660
by and the parts we're ashamed
of, are the parts that we feel

1577
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:38,360
are unforgivable. We embrace
them all, and as we embrace them

1578
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:43,780
all, all those twisted or
unintegrated or injured aspects

1579
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:48,400
of our self are brought back
into healing and are brought

1580
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:53,920
back into wholeness, so that
there emerges out of that

1581
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:59,140
wholeness a higher order of
goodness, a different order of

1582
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:05,220
goodness. Uh, but it is, it is
that commitment to embracing the

1583
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:10,860
shadow, to let no corner of our
being be excluded from

1584
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:14,700
redemption. We might say,
nothing can be left out

1585
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:19,320
otherwise. The the system is
incomplete. It's like there's a

1586
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:23,780
chorus, but some of the voices
are gone. We have to have all of

1587
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:29,180
them present for the course to
be complete, so that in

1588
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:33,140
evolution, in our social
evolution, in our spiritual

1589
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:36,320
evolution, clearly, there is
much darkness in the world.

1590
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:40,960
There is much twisted so we
could say there is much evil,

1591
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:45,700
but I don't think of evil as a
cosmological process. I've never

1592
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:49,060
experienced it that way. I've
never experienced evil in that

1593
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:53,440
way. I experienced darkness,
I've experienced confusion, I've

1594
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:57,460
experienced pain and suffering,
but not evil as such. And I

1595
02:00:57,460 --> 02:01:00,240
think that's what Sri Aurobindo
I mean, what Ramakrishna meant

1596
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:03,300
when he said, If you want to
understand God, you must look

1597
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:08,220
suffering in the face. And
suffering doesn't come from a

1598
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:12,420
second principle. It doesn't
come from an evil Demiurge. It

1599
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:15,600
comes from the Divine suffering
is part of the Divine

1600
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:19,560
expression. We have to
understand how life works, and

1601
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:22,580
we must look deep. If we're
going to see the compassion and

1602
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:27,740
existence, we must be able to
look very, very deep, because,

1603
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:31,160
because there is so much
suffering. But, and I think the

1604
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:35,660
suffering is in the process of
being redeemed in history, in

1605
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:42,460
the sense that it is part of a
self learning process, which is

1606
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:46,540
taking us somewhere, and it's
taking us somewhere exciting and

1607
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:51,460
somewhere magnificent. So I
guess I would say that darkness

1608
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:57,640
is being redeemed in evolution.
I don't think, I don't know what

1609
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:01,440
will happen as we make this
transition into this higher form

1610
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:04,920
of humanity. I'm sure that even
if we did make this transition

1611
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:09,360
within 1000 years, say, or even
sooner, into a higher

1612
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:13,380
manifestation of human
experience on the planet, it

1613
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:16,560
doesn't end there. You know,
we're going to keep going for

1614
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:21,560
millions of more years, billions
of more years. So I'm sure there

1615
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:24,200
will be challenges that we'll
face, there'll be thresholds

1616
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:27,920
that we'll face, but along the
way, I think we're we just have

1617
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:31,160
to let go of some of the early
stories that we've been telling

1618
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:35,660
ourselves, that somehow evil has
its hand on the earth, or

1619
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:40,160
somehow that there is a
malevolent force that intends us

1620
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:44,380
to suffer this way, or that we
can escape this suffering by

1621
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:49,180
simply being good, experiencing
salvation and going to heaven

1622
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:53,500
when we die, and leaving the
earth behind and just not being

1623
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,740
here anymore. We just have to
let go of a lot of our old

1624
02:02:56,740 --> 02:03:01,140
stories and open up into a
deeper understanding of the

1625
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:05,820
cosmological process of
creation, self manifestation of

1626
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:07,260
the creative intelligence.

1627
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:13,380
Simeon Mihaylov: Chris, I missed
the realize that I'm taking

1628
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:19,260
quite a lot of your time. So
before we finish, I want to ask

1629
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:22,460
you, now that you've written in
your book, because correct me if

1630
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:27,920
I'm wrong. But you discontinued,
you finished your LSD sessions,

1631
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:32,060
and then you took 20 years, was
it? And then you published your

1632
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:37,220
your book 20 years later. So, so
how has the writing of your book

1633
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:40,720
and then doing of you know,
speaking about your experiences,

1634
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:45,340
how has that changed your
insight and what is left for you

1635
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:47,380
to do in this lifetime? What?

1636
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:58,000
Chris Bache: Yes, learn to cook.
Well, maybe let me back up a

1637
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:02,220
little bit and describe what
happened when I stopped my work,

1638
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:10,200
because that'll lead into the
writing of the book. I stopped

1639
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:14,700
my work in 99 and I stopped it
for a number of reasons, but

1640
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:21,860
foremost among them, I stopped
it because the domain of diamond

1641
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:25,460
Luminosity that I entered. And
in those last five years and 26

1642
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:30,860
sessions, I entered this reality
only four times. And in between

1643
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:33,980
those four entrances into the
diamond Luminosity, there were

1644
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:38,900
very, very intense purifications
and healings and catharsis that

1645
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:47,320
were taking place. But I entered
that joy of dissolving into the

1646
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:54,880
light, and it made coming back.
I reached a point where it was

1647
02:04:54,880 --> 02:05:01,380
just too painful to come back
into time space and. So there

1648
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:07,680
was a sadness in coming back,
and I knew I had to. I couldn't

1649
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:13,800
take being separated from the
universe that deep intimacy

1650
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:18,960
again. I couldn't take entering
into the joy and then coming

1651
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:24,920
back out of the joy anymore that
I had to let go. There were

1652
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:28,640
other things going on. I was
also running enormous energy in

1653
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:32,000
my body that I realized I was
really kind of at a subtle

1654
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,540
energy level. I was running too
hot. I needed to stop and let my

1655
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:39,560
system calm down and let my
subtle energy system

1656
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:44,140
recalibrate. But the primary
reason I stopped is because of a

1657
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:50,680
heartache. I couldn't I couldn't
take coming back anymore, so I

1658
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:54,580
stopped, and I had been given so
many blessings through the years

1659
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:57,760
and had been shown so many
things that I thought I could

1660
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:03,120
just stop and I would continue
to be nourished by the treasures

1661
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:05,700
that I had been given, by the
diamonds that I had been given.

1662
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:11,580
And it that's true, and that did
happen, but that turned out to

1663
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:16,800
be only half of what happened I
found over the years that

1664
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:25,820
followed a deep sadness emerging
in my life, and I began to

1665
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:30,440
realize that underneath all the
things I was doing, publishing

1666
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:35,360
and writing and taking care of
my children and teaching, that

1667
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:42,340
there was a sadness, a longing,
that I was suffering from a loss

1668
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:47,800
of communion with the divine. I
was suffering from a loneliness

1669
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:53,920
with the divine, and I basically
was just waiting to die. I was

1670
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:57,940
living my life, taking care of
everybody, but in my heart, I

1671
02:06:57,940 --> 02:07:04,500
was just waiting to die so I
could return to my beloved and

1672
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:09,120
years went on, and it didn't get
better, and I began to realize

1673
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:13,380
that this is not this is not
good. It's not good living your

1674
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:16,560
life waiting to die. It's good
to be completely fearless of

1675
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:20,360
death, but it's not good to be
waiting to die. That somewhere

1676
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:23,120
along the way, I must have made
a mistake. I must have done

1677
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:27,980
something wrong. Somewhere my
life was screaming failure to

1678
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:33,020
integrate. But because I had
taken so much care to integrate

1679
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:37,040
each individual session, it
wasn't clear where my failure

1680
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:43,780
lie lay. So I turned to find
where I had made a mistake, and

1681
02:07:43,780 --> 02:07:50,080
in time, I came to understand
that there was an imbalance in

1682
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:54,340
my life. It was like I had
plunged myself so deep into the

1683
02:07:54,340 --> 02:08:00,100
transcendent divine that I had
lost my foothold in the manifest

1684
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:04,980
divine. I had gone so deep into
the transcendent dimension that

1685
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:08,400
I had lost hold of the other
truth. I mean, I knew it

1686
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:12,300
intellectually, but I wasn't
able to live it fully. And that

1687
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:16,860
is the truth of the physical
universe. And my being as part

1688
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:21,380
of the physical universe is the
divine. The physical world is

1689
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:29,180
the body of the Divine. So when
I began to see that the problem

1690
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:33,320
was this imbalance between
Transcendence and immanence, I

1691
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:40,780
made a decisive move to embrace
the my physical existence more

1692
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:46,000
completely, to really by a force
of will and by a cultivation of

1693
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:52,240
practices, to live my life as I
was in its incompleteness for

1694
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:56,800
the remaining days on this
earth, and to recommit myself to

1695
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:04,200
Being here inside time and space
on this planet and as part of

1696
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:08,520
this process, and it took me
about 10 years to get fully

1697
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:15,060
comfortable being inside time
and space again, which is maybe

1698
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:18,660
one more reason why no one
should do the kind of work that

1699
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:22,640
I did. You know, I hope that
people don't have to go through

1700
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:26,240
what I went through. I think
maybe it's better to work in

1701
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:30,380
smaller doses and more
incremental stages and make

1702
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:36,080
maybe smaller progress, but also
hold on to more of the progress

1703
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:41,680
that you do make in opening up
to Transcendence. But along the

1704
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:45,340
way, I also learned that there
was a second reason for my kind

1705
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:50,140
of estrangement or unhappiness,
and the second reason was what I

1706
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:55,120
call the sickness of silence.
I'm a teacher. I love to learn

1707
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:58,960
and I love to share what I've
learned, but because of the laws

1708
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:01,260
surrounding psychedelic.
Colleagues, and because of the

1709
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:05,220
our psychedelic phobic culture,
I wasn't allowed to talk about

1710
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:08,460
what I experienced. I wasn't
allowed to bring my psychedelic

1711
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:11,880
knowledge into the classroom. I
wasn't allowed to share it with

1712
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:16,680
my colleagues. So the silence
which had allowed me to do this

1713
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:23,240
work at this time in history was
also not allowing me to fully

1714
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:29,120
integrate it into my personal
life, into my public life. I

1715
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:33,440
integrated them privately,
psychologically as best I could,

1716
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:38,960
but I couldn't integrate them
into my historical presence. I

1717
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:43,440
couldn't be in the real world,
in the physical world, who I

1718
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:47,580
knew myself to be in the
shamanic world. And in this

1719
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:52,680
respect, writing diamonds from
Heaven has been a deep healing

1720
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:57,180
process. To finally, now that
I've retired, and I retired a

1721
02:10:57,180 --> 02:11:01,380
little early in order to write
this book, but to finally be in

1722
02:11:01,380 --> 02:11:06,720
a position where I'm able to say
what I did, to say what happened

1723
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:10,860
to me in these sessions, and to
share the experience of the

1724
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:14,340
universe, and not that I think
my experience is in any way

1725
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:18,420
unique or special, because it's
just I'm one person among a

1726
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:21,800
whole psychedelic community
that's having all of these types

1727
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:26,360
of experiences, but to finally
be able to be completely honest

1728
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:30,260
and candid that this is what
I've been doing all these years.

1729
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:36,320
This is who I am in my inner
life, behind my public persona,

1730
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:42,460
of my academic life, that has
been very healing, and it's also

1731
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:48,940
done some interesting things as
I've was working on the book in

1732
02:11:48,940 --> 02:11:51,760
the years working on the book,
and as I've begun to talk about

1733
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:58,360
it, my psychedelic memories have
begun to congeal and to live in

1734
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:02,580
me differently than They lived
in me before I was talking. So

1735
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:06,780
just to be able to talk about
these things with you and with

1736
02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:11,640
other people has allowed me to
be more whole within myself.

1737
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:14,940
It's like the psychedelic half
of my life and the physical half

1738
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:18,540
of my life are coming together,
and something is happening,

1739
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:23,420
something there is a deepening
of integration and a deepening

1740
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:28,640
of transparency to spiritual
reality, and I don't know where

1741
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:33,020
it's going to go. I truly don't.
I think in three years from now,

1742
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:36,380
I could be in a very different
place than I am now, and I'm in

1743
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:40,844
a different place now than I was
before I wrote the book. So I

1744
02:12:40,844 --> 02:12:45,584
think, you know, Pim Van Lommel
is a near death episode

1745
02:12:45,584 --> 02:12:47,984
researcher, and he wrote a
wonderful book on near death

1746
02:12:47,984 --> 02:12:53,084
episodes, and he says at the end
of the book that his experience

1747
02:12:53,084 --> 02:12:57,584
with people who have near death
experiences is that integration

1748
02:12:57,584 --> 02:13:01,020
can't really take place until
they can talk about their

1749
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:04,380
experiences and share them. And
I think that's true with

1750
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:08,160
psychedelic experiences too,
that at some levels, we can't

1751
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:13,620
fully integrate our experiences
until we can share them. And I

1752
02:13:13,620 --> 02:13:18,720
think writing diamonds from
Heaven has been part of sharing

1753
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:23,120
my history, hopefully that'll be
useful to other people, and

1754
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:26,840
it'll support them in their
work. And as we go into this

1755
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:36,560
intense historical period, so
there's been a birth of a new

1756
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:40,780
joy, in a way, a birth of just
being able to be

1757
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:46,060
who I really am, which is a
flawed human being who has had

1758
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:50,980
some pretty unusual experiences
and loves to be in conversation

1759
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:56,320
with other human beings who have
also had unusual experiences, so

1760
02:13:56,320 --> 02:14:00,340
that we can together see what
our experiences have taught us

1761
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:02,160
about the universe that we're
in.

1762
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:07,620
Simeon Mihaylov: Yeah, well,
Chris, your experiences and your

1763
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:11,940
words are truly diamonds from
heaven. And I'm sincerely

1764
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:16,140
grateful, and I want to express
your gratitude for for well, for

1765
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:18,960
your courage to undertake these
experiences and to share them

1766
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,860
and to speak about them, not
just to me, but to so many

1767
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:25,940
people. And I know I can speak
for myself, and I know for

1768
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:30,020
others that your work really
touches people's people's hearts

1769
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:33,080
and people's lives. And I think
it's very important work. So I

1770
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:36,260
really thank you on the behalf
of not only myself but the

1771
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:43,480
greater collective. So I thank
you very much. Again, I really

1772
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:46,360
don't want to take too much of
your day, but is there anything

1773
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:48,880
that we didn't touch that you
would like to talk about? I.

1774
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:09,960
Chris Bache: Maybe just one
piece, because I think there's a

1775
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:16,920
lesson for me in this, and maybe
a lesson for others. I had an

1776
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:20,540
experience in the 50th session,
which was the second diamond

1777
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:23,600
Luminosity session, the second
time I was taken deep into

1778
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:29,960
diamond Luminosity. And so this
was the deepest I ever got in

1779
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:33,560
any of my sessions, into the
deep structure of the universe.

1780
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:37,580
And I was in a place of
extraordinary bliss and joy, and

1781
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,920
I had dissolved completely into
the boundary less condition of

1782
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:46,120
just pure light, just hyper,
hyper. Clear, clear, clear

1783
02:15:46,180 --> 02:15:54,340
light, just so clear. And just
when I was at this peak of 50

1784
02:15:54,340 --> 02:15:59,440
sessions and all these years of
experience, all of a sudden my

1785
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:04,680
entire visual field rotated 90
degrees, and a space opened up,

1786
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:10,800
and I saw reality Far, Far in
the distance, filled with an

1787
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:15,480
even higher form of light, and a
beam of light came out of that

1788
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:22,880
reality and hit me, and it
absolutely shattered me, and I

1789
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:27,620
realized at that point that the
journey into the divine, or the

1790
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:32,060
journey into the universe, was
infinite. There's no end to it,

1791
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:37,280
because, like many people, I had
thought that you did this work,

1792
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:40,720
you took the journey in order to
get to the end, in order to get

1793
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:46,840
home, in order to get to back to
source, become one with God, or

1794
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:51,880
to dissolve into the primal
void. But I had become one with

1795
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:55,060
the Divine, and I had learned
that there are many levels of

1796
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:58,600
oneness, and I dissolved into
the void. And I learned that

1797
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:04,080
there are many levels of of the
void to dissolve into. But this

1798
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:07,560
experience showed me that even
using this extraordinarily

1799
02:17:07,560 --> 02:17:13,020
powerful method, I would never
ever be able to explore the

1800
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:18,960
universe in its totality. It's
just so big, so vast, with so

1801
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:23,720
many layers to it, such
wonderful expanse. And this was

1802
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:27,200
this represented a fundamental
pivot. First, it just shook me

1803
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:31,340
to the core to realize the true
expanse of what I was involved

1804
02:17:31,340 --> 02:17:39,020
in. And then it relaxed me into
into just a deep sense of

1805
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:43,840
existential relaxation. And this
is why, if I were doing this

1806
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:46,660
work over again, I would be
gentler with myself, because

1807
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:49,900
I've learned that the goal is
not to try to get to some

1808
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,980
destination, not to get to some
place. Because no matter how

1809
02:17:53,980 --> 02:17:57,580
hard I pushed, new doors kept
opening, and new doors kept

1810
02:17:57,580 --> 02:18:01,800
opening. Now I understand that a
better way to think about this

1811
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:07,320
work is that we open ourselves
and we make ourselves porous to

1812
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:11,820
the totality of life, and we let
in as much of this knowledge and

1813
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:15,000
as much of the energy and as
much of the compassion as it's

1814
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:19,740
possible. We let it in, and we
try to hold it and bring it into

1815
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:23,300
our being and enter and become
more porous to it and open to

1816
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:28,700
it. So it's it's not a process
of kind of going out and

1817
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:33,980
exploring. It's really a process
of intaking, bringing it in and

1818
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:37,520
and bringing it into the very
roots of our being. Let it

1819
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:42,100
change not only our mind and our
convictions, but letting it

1820
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:46,540
change our biology. Literally,
it reaches into and changes, I

1821
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:50,560
think, us at very subtle
physiological levels that we're

1822
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:54,220
maybe just beginning to
appreciate and haven't begun to

1823
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:59,140
map yet. And once you understand
that it's not about trying to

1824
02:18:59,140 --> 02:19:04,680
get to the end of this road, but
it's really about becoming more

1825
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:09,900
conscious and more skillful as
we stand between two realities,

1826
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:14,820
one reality in time space and
the real, the reality outside of

1827
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:18,300
time and space, the nurse in the
mother universe and the daughter

1828
02:19:18,300 --> 02:19:21,980
universe. We are in the daughter
universe. We are always

1829
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:27,200
surrounded and infused by the
mother universe. And if we can

1830
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:33,680
stand astride both worlds and
integrate the constant inflow of

1831
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:37,340
the life from the mother
universe in increasing measure

1832
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:44,980
inside the daughter universe,
then that kind of that brings a

1833
02:19:47,380 --> 02:19:53,620
an instantiated joy, an
incarnate joy, a sense of richer

1834
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:58,120
and richer presence inside time
and space. We allow time and

1835
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:01,740
space to become increasingly
trained. As parent to that which

1836
02:20:01,740 --> 02:20:09,240
created time and space. So I
would encourage a gentler, a

1837
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:13,680
gentler psychedelic process, a
gentler entry into the great

1838
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:17,940
expanse. And I would be I'm more
patient now with how long

1839
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:22,340
spiritual unfolding takes than
maybe I was when I was a young

1840
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:22,760
man. You.

1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,440
Chris Bache: We are planet in
crisis. This is very clear.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,460
Everyone knows the list of
challenges that we're facing,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,960
expanding world population,
unchecked, industrial pollution,

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,480
escalating climate disruptions,
increasing drought with the

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,800
associated forest fires, warmer
oceans, with stronger

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,740
hurricanes, rising sea levels,
collapsing water tables, species

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,140
extinction, fished out oceans,
extreme economic inequality,

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,660
unprecedented refugee
migrations, unstable,

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,040
interlocked national economies,
cities and nations going

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,700
bankrupt, stockpiled weapons we
dare not use, and knowing no end

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,460
in sight, it's not an extreme
statement to say that We are

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:04,440
planet on fire, if you subtract
a few from this list or add a

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,760
few cumulatively, the list is
overwhelming. What I would like

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,120
to do today is share a
perspective on the world crisis

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,120
that we are entering and will
continue to deepen over the

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,520
years ahead, on the basis of the
perspectives that were given me,

17
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,060
or the teachings that I received
during my psychedelic

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,600
experiences that I report in
LSD, in the mind of the

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,500
universe. But first, let me give
a little bit of background just

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,100
to my work to set the stage for
what for the visions, the

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,140
sharing of the visions that I'm
going to draw from that work.

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,360
Let me move this over to the
side here.

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,300
Unknown: Okay, okay.

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,400
Chris Bache: So the work I'm the
visions I'm just sharing today

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,720
come from my work, diamonds from
heaven, or LSD in the mind of

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,760
the universe. Now my lineage, my
psychedelic limit lineage is

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,720
squarely in the tradition of
Stan Grof. It was his early

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,740
writing, his books published in
76 and 80 that were the

29
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,400
foundation of my work, which
determined the methodology that

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,960
I used in working with
psychedelics. As you know, those

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,300
of you who know Stan's work, his
work differentiates very clearly

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,440
between two different modes of
working with psychedelics, low

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,680
dose psycholytic therapy, which
is designed to uncover the

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,820
layers of the unconscious
slowly, gradually, with

35
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,020
therapeutic focus. And the
second method, a very different

36
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,180
method, psychedelic therapy,
working with high doses here,

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,380
the goal was less to heal than
to trigger a Near-Death

38
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,680
Experience that would give
terminal patients, terminal

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,580
cancer patients, an experience
of where they were going when

40
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,960
they died, to trigger a near
death episode experience, and

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,960
therefore to relieve death
anxiety. What I chose to do in

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,800
my work was to work with very
high doses. I saw that if this

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,100
could be done safely a few
times, it could be done safely

44
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,900
more than a few times. And what
I did, As Janet mentioned, was I

45
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,620
worked did 73 high dose LSD
sessions over 20 years, between

46
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:29,000
1979 and 1999 at the end of my
end of my journey, I realized

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,120
that I had gone places and had
experiences that were not

48
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,380
covered in the descriptions of
the early psychedelic therapy.

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,260
So I coined the term psychedelic
exploration to describe this

50
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,180
protocol. It's the protocol of
working therapeutically, meaning

51
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,200
in complete isolation with
eyeshades, headphones, a sitter,

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,680
carefully protected, totally
protected from the world,

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,120
isolated and then going very,
very deep. The difference

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,980
between psychedelic therapy and
psychedelic exploration is the

55
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,240
number of sessions, the high
number of sessions used. Now,

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,740
though the method was extreme,
500 to 600 micrograms is a very

57
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,400
high dose of LSD. And I do not
recommend this protocol.

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,260
Honestly, I don't today, there
were circumstances in my world

59
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,420
that allowed this work to be
very grounded. Through all these

60
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,440
20 years of work, I followed the
same protocol, the exact same

61
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,520
set and setting in all the work,
the same sitter, using the same

62
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,960
substance at the same dose
level, even in the same location

63
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,720
in Northeast Ohio, and using the
same recording process by

64
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,500
stabilizing all these variables,
I think it created a very, very

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,280
strong platform that allowed me
to generate particularly clear

66
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,980
access to the deep consciousness
of the universe. In this work,

67
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,920
entering into deeper and deeper
states of consciousness and.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,700
Digesting it as carefully and as
thoroughly as I could. I kept

69
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,440
track of all my sessions, taking
careful note of their dates as I

70
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,220
went through I made a detailed
record of each session within 24

71
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:25,700
hours after the session was over
when you work in a sustained

72
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,520
fashion with this powerful,
psychedelic high doses of LSD,

73
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,200
you go through not one death and
rebirth, but you go through a

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,080
series of deaths and rebirths.
In this image, the drop below

75
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,800
the line represents our time
space, identity, our egoic

76
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,420
identity. And that first turning
of the circle represents the

77
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,620
process of ego death, the first
death and rebirth, the loss of

78
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,460
one's identity as a physical
human being, and one's first

79
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,700
entry into spiritual reality.
The subsequent circles represent

80
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,860
repetitions of the death and
rebirth process as one enters

81
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,840
deeper and deeper levels of the
vast expanse of spiritual

82
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,340
reality. I follow Stan in
adopting his vocabulary to

83
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,680
describe these states as the
psychic level of Transpersonal

84
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:30,200
experience, the subtle level and
the calls of love. I have no

85
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,860
vested interest in cosmology
that goes with this, but it's

86
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,620
simply the principle that
repeating the process of

87
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,900
surrender leads to deeper and
deeper encounters with well

88
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,980
leads to encounters with deeper
structures of existence. Now let

89
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,620
me give a different image for
this. LSD is sometimes likened

90
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,880
to a nuclear bomb of the psyche,
which was the nuclear bomb being

91
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,440
developed in the same decade
that LSD was developed, when you

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,500
do a sustained course of a very
intense psychotherapeutic

93
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,600
process, it sets in motion a
tremendous catalytic energy that

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,560
is sustained over a period of
years. So the sessions get

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,520
deeper and deeper and deeper in
a sustained fashion. And it's

96
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,340
not unlike a nuclear bomb in
this case, which reveals as the

97
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,820
explosion continues, deeper
levels of the atmosphere. These

98
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,900
levels of the atmosphere were
always there, but they had been

99
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,100
previously invisible, and now
the force of this nuclear

100
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,580
explosion brings them into our
visual awareness. Now this is

101
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,600
just an analogy, but something
like this also happens in

102
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,160
sustained psychedelic work. The
deeper you go, if you go in a

103
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,000
very sustained fashion, you
don't simply start over at the

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,600
beginning of every session, but
one session starts where the

105
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,240
subsequent session stopped, and
you go deeper and deeper, and

106
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,860
eventually enter discrete levels
of consciousness, which have

107
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,280
their own discrete rules. And
you acclimate to these levels of

108
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,540
consciousness and learn how to
become consciously aware at

109
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,860
these deep levels. But we're not
talking about, of course,

110
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,140
nuclear bombs. Here we're
talking about entering the mind

111
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,100
of the universe, entering the
great expanse of the

112
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,540
consciousness, which is the
consciousness? Well, how do we

113
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,720
describe this consciousness?
Some would describe it as God,

114
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,420
or the divine I would prefer, or
like to call it the mind of the

115
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,860
universe, the mind of the
cosmos. So in my personal

116
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,640
journey into this mind, into
this vast consciousness, which

117
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,140
holds all of existence, I went
through multiple layers,

118
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,580
experiencing deaths and rebirth
on this journey. So I would

119
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,400
differentiate five basic core
levels of reality that I was

120
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,440
working with in my sessions. The
first took place at the level of

121
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,020
my personal mind, once personal
unconscious. The second at the

122
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:19,860
level of the species mind, the
third at the level of archetypal

123
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:28,760
mind. The mind the fourth at the
level of causal oneness, and the

124
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,900
fifth at the level of what I
call the diamond Luminosity,

125
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,460
which is the source of the name
diamonds from heaven. So let me

126
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,820
very briefly just touch in on
the chapters of the book, to

127
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,040
correlate them with this model
at the level of personal mind,

128
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,220
there is a chapter called cross,
crossing the boundary of birth

129
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,180
and death. This is about what
Stan calls crossing the

130
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,900
perinatal level of
consciousness. We get into time

131
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,940
and space by being. Born, we
leave by dying. When

132
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,960
consciousness is expanding
beyond physical reality, one

133
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,040
enters a very complex domain
where one's experience of having

134
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,180
gotten here by birth and leaving
by death get intertwined in a

135
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,800
complex fashion. One goes
through horrendous existential

136
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,840
crises as one enters into a
process which culminates in ego

137
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:33,320
death and entry into spiritual
reality at the level of species

138
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,700
mind, there are actually three
chapters in the book pertaining

139
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,980
to this level of the work. The
first is the ocean of suffering.

140
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,140
The fifth is deep time in the
soul, and the sixth is

141
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,500
initiation into the universe.
Now I'm skipping some of the

142
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,320
chapters in the book. As you can
see, there's an introductory

143
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,460
methodology chapter, and there's
a chapter three where I give a

144
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,660
typical session day, but these
are the chapters having to do

145
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,680
with the content of the
visionary experiences. It opened

146
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,619
when I entered the ocean of
suffer suffering. I entered two

147
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:17,759
years of work in which I engaged
vast, vast stores of suffering.

148
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:22,099
I experienced myself to become
1000s of human beings spread

149
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:28,159
over 1000s of years experience
great rage and violence and

150
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,659
abuse on a collective scale.
Eventually, I came to the

151
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,019
conclusion that this work was
not about healing my personal

152
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:41,559
psyche or deepening my personal
ego death, that the intelligence

153
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,819
of the universe was using my
sessions to being to bring some

154
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:50,259
type of therapeutic release to
the collective unconscious of my

155
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,919
species, the collective
unconscious of my family. And I

156
00:11:53,919 --> 00:12:00,179
go into this at great length in
the book deep time in the soul

157
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,679
was my first entry into what I
call deep time, which is a mode

158
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,999
of time which lies outside
linear time and space. It's not

159
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:13,919
eternity, it's not timelessness,
but it's a different modality of

160
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:18,719
temporal consciousness. In this
chapter, for a year and seven

161
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:23,419
sessions, I experienced my
complete life start to finish as

162
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,859
a simultaneous whole. It was
both ahead of me, yet to be

163
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:32,059
lived, and yet, from another
perspective, it already had been

164
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:37,279
lived, and I could see it in its
entirety, the experience of deep

165
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,779
time deepened in the next
chapter, initiation in the

166
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:44,859
universe, where the universe
took me far beyond my personal,

167
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:50,499
my personal concerns, and took
me into a series of instructions

168
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:54,279
and initiations into the
functioning of the universe. And

169
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,819
it's here that the story that
I'm going to be telling today

170
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:05,099
began in the middle of this
work. Entering archetypal the

171
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:08,459
level of archetypal mind is
described in the chapter the

172
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:14,219
greater real of archetypal
reality, entering into a domain

173
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:20,779
which was at the one hand, lies
beyond the species mind engaging

174
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,859
the archetypal forces which are
responsible for creating time

175
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:30,559
and space and for the emergence
of the forms that come forward

176
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:37,459
inside time and space, entering
into a level of causal oneness,

177
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,079
where the world ceases to
operate in parts, even the very

178
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:46,359
large parts of archetypal
reality. But the parts become

179
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:50,319
the reality, the parts, the
parts dissolve into the

180
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:55,539
universe, experienced as a
single organic whole, a single

181
00:13:55,599 --> 00:14:00,339
consciousness, dissolving all
the boundaries between beings,

182
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,199
all the boundaries between
levels and one can experience

183
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:08,039
the universe, or I experience
the universe as a single,

184
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:13,379
living, pulsing, throbbing
singularity, a oneness that

185
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:20,599
underlies all differentiation.
The diamond Luminosity story is

186
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:27,019
told in chapter 10. It reflects
four years of work and 26

187
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:32,239
sessions during which I entered
the state of diamond Luminosity,

188
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:36,559
only four times the remaining
sessions during this four year

189
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,139
period were spent in very
intense cleansing as my system

190
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:45,639
worked to acclimate the
enormously powerful energies

191
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:49,239
that were present in these very,
very pure states of

192
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:52,959
consciousness, what I call the
diamond Luminosity, what

193
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,179
Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the
clear light of absolute reality.

194
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,539
And after. That the final year
of visions, a final vision, four

195
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,699
sessions, one year of work. But
the missing chapter, here is a

196
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,499
chapter I want to talk about
today. It is the birth of the

197
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:18,179
future human. And this is a
story which completely surprised

198
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,139
me in my work, because when I
began this work. I thought this

199
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,399
work was about personal healing
or personal enlightenment or

200
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,839
some type of personal
transformation, and yet my work

201
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,499
seems to have been profoundly
connected to the work that our

202
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:42,159
species is doing in history, to
the collective purification

203
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,719
processes and the collective
transformational processes. So

204
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:50,799
in this chapter, the birth of
the future human, I summarize

205
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,739
the teachings that were given to
me over about a 15 year period.

206
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:01,139
It started in session 22 in the
initiation End of the Universe

207
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,439
material. It continued up
through the greater reel of

208
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:07,859
archetype of reality and the
benediction of blessings. It

209
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:13,019
actually also continued into the
final vision material. And

210
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:18,359
session 70 gave me one final
installment in the vision of

211
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:22,819
what is happening at our time in
history. So this is the material

212
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:26,479
I'd like to talk about today.
And just to give you a quick

213
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:31,099
preview of where we're going in
the birth of the future human

214
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:36,079
material, I discuss two
different bodies of visions. The

215
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,039
first I call the visions of
awakening, or a series of

216
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:46,359
visions that I received between
1991 and 1994 over about a dozen

217
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:52,719
sessions. I divided them into
six areas, six discrete

218
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:58,959
visionary themes. I'll come back
to that in a second. The second

219
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,339
installment is one particular
session that states from 1995

220
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:08,759
that I call the Great Awakening.
Now I'm about to turn off the

221
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,819
PowerPoint, but just to give you
a quick preview of the

222
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,259
categories where we're going,
the six themes of the visions of

223
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:27,139
awakening are divine, love, all
humanity, a guiding

224
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:36,739
intelligence, our species as A
single being, collective

225
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:46,419
purification and the future
human, the Great Awakening

226
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:51,999
chapter is a story of one day
when I was taken deep into the

227
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:56,979
future, and there experienced
the death and rebirth of

228
00:17:56,979 --> 00:18:04,139
humanity. So that's where we're
going. Let me close this down.

229
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:15,959
All right inside. So come back
to here. Get me back to zoom.

230
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:23,479
I'm trying to get back to my
Zoom page.

231
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:38,240
Okay, let me stop. Ah, there we
go. Good. All right. Thank you

232
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,680
for your patience, everybody.
You

233
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:50,079
what I would like to do is share
these visions with you today,

234
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:55,419
and I'd like to take a chance do
something a little different. I

235
00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:00,099
could talk about the visions, or
I could try to share the visions

236
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,979
in a deeper, more experientially
oriented way, and that's what

237
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:08,279
I'd like to try to do today. I'd
like to try to share these

238
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,599
visions in a way that would
invite you to hear them at a

239
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,739
deeper level than simply my
talking about them. What I

240
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:22,399
suggest that we do is a little
experiential exercise. I would

241
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:29,179
invite you to sit back and relax
and close your eyes while I read

242
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:34,219
a Condon, a condensed version of
these visions to share them with

243
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:39,439
you as I actually recorded them
myself. My sense is that the

244
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:46,419
spoken word has a initiatory
power that simply describing

245
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:50,499
about things or talking about
things don't have. And I'd like

246
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:54,099
to share these visions with you
in a more direct and

247
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:59,379
straightforward manner. So I'd
suggest to sort of detach from

248
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:02,219
your command. Computer screen.
There's nothing going to be

249
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:05,159
interesting here except me
reading some of these visions

250
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:10,979
for several minutes, and I
invite you to listen to them

251
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:19,199
with a deep heart, with a deep
receptivity. I'm not going to

252
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:22,759
put these visions in context, I
would just simply remind you

253
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,959
that there was a great price to
be paid for receiving these

254
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,959
visions, for where these were
taken. And when I say visions, I

255
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:35,059
don't mean things that I have
seen. When one learns at this

256
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,539
level, one learns by becoming so
you actually must become the

257
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:42,459
reality that you are seeing in
order to have deep knowledge of

258
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:47,199
it. And I know that these
visions will sound perhaps

259
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:53,859
extreme. They will sound exotic,
I would just remind you of the

260
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:58,179
context that these are visionary
statements that come out of

261
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:04,739
years and years of sustained
psychedelic work. So let's begin

262
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:14,879
first the divine love, the theme
of divine love, this was in the

263
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:21,379
early initiation in the universe
material. Now it was taken back

264
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:26,299
to the beginning of creation,
and there I experienced creation

265
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:32,179
as an act of supreme love. I was
overwhelmed by the most

266
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:37,819
extraordinary cosmic love coming
at me from every direction. It

267
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:43,539
was a love unlike anything I had
ever known before, and to awaken

268
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:48,639
to this love was to remember a
primordial decision that I had

269
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:55,959
somehow participated in. All of
us had voluntarily chosen to be

270
00:21:56,199 --> 00:22:02,639
part of the evolutionary process
of creation. And creation was

271
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:10,079
motivated, was driven by a
cosmic love. I then experienced

272
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:14,279
all the suffering that humanity
had endured throughout history

273
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,919
as taking place inside this
love. I realized that all the

274
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,459
suffering inherent in evolution
was noble beyond words. It was

275
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:30,019
all part of a cosmic plan that
we had entered into freely,

276
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:34,759
however unconscious of this fact
we have become along the way,

277
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,599
the nobility of great suffering
voluntarily shouldered in the

278
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,979
name of divine love of suffering
that would stretch across

279
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:49,839
millions of years, suffering
that would become so inscrutable

280
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,379
that it would be used as
evidence that the universe was

281
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:59,679
devoid of compassion. This was
the nobility of humanity's gift

282
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:05,699
to the creative intelligence of
our universe. This was an

283
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:09,419
important vision because it set
the context for all the visions

284
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,919
that followed. And what it says
is, no matter what is coming

285
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,519
forward in history, no matter
how hard the times are that we

286
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,219
are entering, it is all taking
place in the context of the

287
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:26,239
Divine Love that inspired
creation, and our love to

288
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:30,799
participate, and our free choice
to participate in creation in

289
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:37,399
response to this divine love,
The second vision all of

290
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:46,299
humanity out of the seething
desires of history, out of all

291
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:50,019
the violent conflicts and the
schemings of individuals and

292
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:55,539
nations, there was now driving
forward a new awareness in human

293
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:00,719
consciousness. Its birth in us
is no less difficult or violent

294
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:05,699
than the birth of a new
continent. It drives upward from

295
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:10,079
the floor of our being,
requiring a transposition of

296
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:13,979
everything that has gone before
to make room for its new

297
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,739
organizational patterns. The
great difficulty I have is

298
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:24,799
describing the enormity of what
is being birthed. The true focus

299
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,019
of this creative process is not
individuals, but all humanity.

300
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:38,059
It is actually trying to awaken
the entire species. What is

301
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:42,879
emerging is a consciousness of
unprecedented proportions. The

302
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:48,039
entire human family, integrated
in a unified field of awareness,

303
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:53,679
the species reconnected with its
fundamental nature. Our thoughts

304
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:58,719
tuned to Source consciousness,
the scale of what I was

305
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:04,859
witnessing the. Took my breath
away. This was a jarring

306
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:08,519
expansion of my horizon, because
coming out of the religious

307
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,799
traditions and spiritual
learnings that I had

308
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,339
internalized, which really
focused on the transformation

309
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:19,559
awakening of an individual, of
all individuals, this showed me

310
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:24,259
that underneath that there was a
deeper process taking place, and

311
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:28,459
that the creative intelligence
of the universe was working to

312
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:36,079
awaken the entire species. The
third vision guiding

313
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,039
intelligence you

314
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,680
I saw humanity climbing out of a
steep valley, and just ahead on

315
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,640
the other side of the mountain
was a brilliant, sun drenched

316
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,680
world that was about to break
over us. The time frame was

317
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,520
enormous, after millions of
years of struggle and ascent, we

318
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,300
were poised on the brink of a
sunrise that would forever

319
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,040
change the conditions of life on
this planet. All current

320
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,420
structures would quickly become
irrelevant. All truths would

321
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:25,340
quickly be rendered. Passe truly
a new epic was dawning. The

322
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,260
lives of everyone living in this
pivotal time in history were

323
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:36,380
helping to bring this global
shift about. As I witnessed this

324
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,480
scene, I saw that though we did
not know the deep future at a

325
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,220
personal level, there was a more
encompassing level of

326
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,560
consciousness that could see it
very clearly. This was a deeply

327
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,560
moving and clarifying experience
for me, individually, we humans,

328
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,360
could not see what was coming,
and so did not understand why

329
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,580
things are the way they are, yet
isolated from the future the

330
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:11,160
present makes absolutely no
sense to be ignorant of what is

331
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,840
being built would be to be
functionally blind. And our

332
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,840
species is not blind. There is
an intelligence within it,

333
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,060
guiding it an intelligence that
knows the future and is

334
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,800
preparing us for it as
systematically as we prepare our

335
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,740
homes for the change of seasons,

336
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:48,280
the fourth vision our species as
a single being that was taken

337
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,960
deeper into the unified field of
existence and experienced the

338
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,180
dynamics of humanity's awakening
as movements being initiated and

339
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,420
orchestrated by a single
integrating intelligence. I

340
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,100
experienced the evolution of our
species as the systematic growth

341
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,280
of a single organism, a unified
being that all of us are part of

342
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,420
the subtlety of the cooperation
of the parts with the whole was

343
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,980
extraordinary to experience the
incredible diversity of our

344
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,860
species as a single unified
field made many events clearer.

345
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,720
New patterns sprang into view,
and the patterns made

346
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,200
transparent sense. Nothing in
our theological or philosophical

347
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,640
systems does justice to these
facts. What I then saw was that

348
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,420
the unified field of humanity
was moving decisively and

349
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,700
precipitously to become more
aware of itself, whereas

350
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,100
previously it had existed as an
extended fabric, largely

351
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,820
unconscious of itself. Now it
was waking itself up visually.

352
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,960
This took the form of energy
coming together in Swift,

353
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,960
contractive spasms that created
bright flashes of awareness. I

354
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,020
repeatedly saw extended webs of
energy suddenly contract and

355
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:31,100
explode in brilliant flashes. In
the past, these flashes had been

356
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,720
swallowed by the inertia of the
collective psyche and had not

357
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,480
endured now, however, the
flashes were beginning to hold

358
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,860
their own and to connect with
other flashes occurring around

359
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:51,280
the planet. And as I trace the
Black Lives Matter movement, I

360
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,820
think of this vision. I think of
the contraction and the

361
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,260
explosion of light which is
throwing light on these dark

362
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,720
shadows. And. Our culture,

363
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:14,460
the fifth vision, collective
purification. When an organism

364
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,500
is called on from within to
become more conscious, it must

365
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,900
first cleanse itself of the
psychological by products of

366
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:29,000
living at its lower level of
awareness, it must bring forward

367
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,020
the residue of its past and
purge that residue from its

368
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,840
system in order to lay the
foundation for a more refined

369
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,200
level of operation. Our species
was doing this in a wholesale

370
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,580
manner and with great
determination, by crystallizing

371
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:55,240
within itself generations that
embody our toxic legacy. It was

372
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,120
the coordinated exercise of the
self evolution of the species as

373
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,480
a whole, the poisons of
humanity's past were being

374
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,380
brought to the surface in us,
and by transforming these

375
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,180
poisons in our individual lives,
we were making it possible for

376
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:20,400
divine awareness to Enter more
deeply into future generations.

377
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,600
We had volunteered for this role
for both our personal good and

378
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:33,020
the collective good. I saw that
this century formed a watershed

379
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,760
into which the karmic streams of
history were flowing, and that

380
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,580
this, as this process came to
fruition, the future condition

381
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,680
of our species would be beyond
anything we might project from

382
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,720
our current state of
fragmentation. The present form

383
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,020
of humanity is transitional. We
are cells in a super organism

384
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,460
intent on rapid change our very
constitution, the form of our

385
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:15,360
species, is a stage in a longer
evolutionary journey. And

386
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:25,100
finally, the sixth vision, the
vision of the future human at

387
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,880
one point, I was given a brief
experience of the future, human

388
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,520
we are becoming. I was carried
deep into the distant future and

389
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,380
allowed to experience what will
be the abiding state of humanity

390
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:46,960
at that time, what a magnificent
being. Just touching it filled

391
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,880
me with rapture, calm and sheer
delight. It felt clear, warm and

392
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,920
whole. There was an abiding
sense of oneness that went

393
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,560
deeper than just the feeling of
being interconnected. It was a

394
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,880
feeling of being truly one
underneath the diversity of

395
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,560
life, such expansiveness, such
breadth of being. It was fully

396
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,440
embodied spiritual realization,
the tantric awakening of our

397
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,580
entire species, spirit and
matter in perfect balance. This

398
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,760
penetrating glimpse transfixed
me. Its beauty, grandeur and

399
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,340
simplicity pierced my heart.

400
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,500
So for these four years, in the
background of these many

401
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,240
sessions, these messages kept
coming forward, kept presenting

402
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,620
themselves, kept filling in the
blanks in the background helped

403
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,020
me understand what was taking
place in history at the deeper

404
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,980
level that we were on the cusp
of this profound spiritual

405
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,540
awakening that we were had
entered into this voluntarily,

406
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,440
and that everything that was
happening to us was all part of

407
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,620
a larger cosmic plan, which was
all part of The love that the

408
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:24,020
creative intelligence would
share with us in the act of

409
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,480
creation itself. The net result
of these experiences, though,

410
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,060
they gave me a sense of what was
happening. They helped me

411
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,320
understand why things were
unfolding the way they were. It

412
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,360
helped me understand why the
ocean of suffering what was

413
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,040
taking place in these collective
purification processes? It

414
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,500
focused me on the question, how,
how can the entire species be

415
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:56,200
awakened? What will it actually
take for humanity to make this

416
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,200
quantum jump in its awareness,
the visions? Of awakening showed

417
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,340
me that this was the project of
history, but nowhere did it give

418
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,800
me any idea how nature, how the
creative intelligence of the

419
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,920
universe, was actually going to
pull this off. Meanwhile, my

420
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,380
psychedelic journey continued. I
had been going through the

421
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,740
benediction of blessings. I
entered into the diamond

422
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,780
Luminosity work. I had entered
into the diamond Luminosity

423
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,600
twice, with two more to come
down the road. About once a

424
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,800
year, I was entering into the
ecstatic bliss of the diamond

425
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,020
Luminosity. And then right in
the middle of that sequence,

426
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,740
when I was expecting to be taken
again into the diamond

427
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:54,460
Luminosity, instead, I was taken
into the death and rebirth of

428
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:01,320
the human species. I would
emphasize that this experience

429
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,940
completely introduced new
categories for me, because there

430
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,620
was absolutely nothing personal
about the state I was in, not

431
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,120
even the residual personal of
individual, ecstatic awakening.

432
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,160
Instead, there was a wholeness
about it that was species wide,

433
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,860
its movement was the movement of
my species, as often happens in

434
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,880
these sessions, the experience
preceded understanding, and I

435
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,740
simply began to experience new
things, and only slowly did I

436
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:42,460
get my bearings on what I was
experiencing. So this is the

437
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:52,120
Great Awakening session that
took place in 1995 after a long

438
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,440
personal cleansing process and a
long introduction, I dissolved

439
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,360
into the species mind
completely, and there had the

440
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,380
following experiences the core
scenario,

441
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:17,220
and they feel the relative calm,
a small anxiety began to grow.

442
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,744
Slowly, people were looking up
and becoming alarmed. Humanity

443
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,584
was waking up in alarm to events
that had overtaken it.

444
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:35,284
Conditions got worse and worse.
People became more and more

445
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:39,904
frightened as the danger
increased, forcing them to let

446
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:44,740
go of their assumptions. At
deeper levels, there was less

447
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,120
and less for people to hold on
to, fewer Givens that they could

448
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,520
assume, how they would live,
where they would live, what they

449
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,260
would do for a living, how
society was organized, what

450
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:04,800
could be possessed the world as
they knew it was falling apart.

451
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,740
Decades were compressed into
minutes, and I felt the people's

452
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,480
fear deepen as they lost more
and more of what they considered

453
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,300
the normal and necessary
structures of their world. Step

454
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,280
by step, events were forcing a
rapid reassessment of everything

455
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,260
in their lives. The events that
had overtaken earth were of such

456
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,480
scope that no one could insulate
themselves from them. The level

457
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,100
of alarm grew in the species
field, until eventually everyone

458
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:46,360
was forced into the melting pot
of mere survival. We were all in

459
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,040
this together. Families were
torn apart, parents from their

460
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,960
children, children from each
other. Life as we had known it

461
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,560
was shattered at the core. We
were reduced to simply trying to

462
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:07,740
survive. For a time, it looked
as though we would all be

463
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,020
killed, but just when the storm
was at its peak, the worst of it

464
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:18,720
passed, and the danger slowly
subsided. Though many had died,

465
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:26,780
many were still alive as the
survivors began to find each

466
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:32,360
other, new social units began to
form, parents and children from

467
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,140
different families joined to
form new types of families

468
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,720
everywhere, new social
institutions sprang into being

469
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,900
that reflected our new reality,
new ways of thinking, new values

470
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,740
that we had discovered within
ourselves during the crisis.

471
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,900
Every aspect of life was marked
by new priorities, new

472
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,680
perceptions of the good, new
truths and. These new social

473
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,300
forms reflected new states of
awareness that seemed to spread

474
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:11,880
throughout humanity like a
positive contagion. These notion

475
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,500
new social forms then fed back
into the system to elicit still

476
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,040
newer states of awareness in the
people and the cycle of

477
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,300
creativity between the
individual and the group

478
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:29,480
spiraled. The whole system was
becoming alive at new levels,

479
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,200
and this aliveness was
expressing itself in previously

480
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,900
impossible ways. It was as if
the Eco crisis had triggered the

481
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,500
myelinization of nerve cells in
our species brain, allowing new

482
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,160
and deeper levels of self
awareness to spring into being.

483
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,380
And repeatedly, there was the
message, these things will

484
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,420
happen faster than anyone could
anticipate because of the hyper

485
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:04,200
arousal of the species mind,
1000s of fractal images drove

486
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,120
this lesson home again and again
faster than anyone can

487
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,120
anticipate. The pace of the past
was irrelevant to the pace of

488
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,780
the future. I

489
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,000
Yes, there were other components
that were shown me over the

490
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,460
course of my long journey. A lot
of sessions were spent exploring

491
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,900
the dynamics of reincarnation
and showing me what I came to

492
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,000
call the birth of the diamond
soul that all of our former

493
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,280
lives eventually come together
and fuse into a singularity, and

494
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,900
in their that fusion, there is a
release, an explosion of this

495
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:58,300
diamond light inside us and
opening us to A completely

496
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:04,500
expanded sense of identity ego
yields to Soul, the small world

497
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:09,060
of the present body mind, yields
to the much, much larger world

498
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:16,440
of the soul that travels in and
out of time effortlessly. So to

499
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,020
summarize, the core vision that
came from my sessions that help

500
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,820
me personally understand what's
happening in history now under

501
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,400
our feet that humanity is coming
into a time of profound

502
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,440
transformation, a shift in the
collective unconscious of our

503
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,800
species, a shift in the
archetypal blueprint of humanity

504
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,820
and a profound awakening into
oneness. But for there to be

505
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:53,740
this great awakening, there must
first take place a great death.

506
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:00,420
We must be empty to the old
before the new can emerge. We

507
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,100
must surrender our smallness. We
must surrender the ego's

508
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,840
constant self, cherishing with
all the divisions that it brings

509
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,960
between races, religions,
classes, nations and even

510
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:22,760
species, I believe that we are
entering the dark night of our

511
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,320
collective soul. All mystics go
through the dark night before

512
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,960
awakening into the bliss of
oneness. They go through the

513
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,460
dark night, which is a time of
intense purification. And now I

514
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,080
think humanity as a whole is
entering the dark night of its

515
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:45,100
collective soul. It is a time of
emptying, a time of intense

516
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:52,000
anguish, of loss of control and
breakdown, a global purification

517
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,280
unto death that will last
generations. But through this

518
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,900
hard labor, we will give birth
to something truly

519
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,420
extraordinary, more than just a
new civilization. What is

520
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,520
emerging is something is nothing
less than a new order of human

521
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,860
beings. Through the global
systems crisis, our planet is

522
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,456
giving birth to the future
human, a higher form of

523
00:44:21,456 --> 00:44:28,356
humanity, the diamond soul, is
being born in history, and we

524
00:44:28,356 --> 00:44:32,556
are all part of its birth. I
believe that each one of us,

525
00:44:32,556 --> 00:44:36,936
before we incarnated knew what
we were getting into, and we

526
00:44:36,996 --> 00:44:41,860
consciously chose to incarnate
at this time in history and in

527
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,540
the places where we are in order
to contribute to to participate

528
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:53,980
and contribute to the spiritual
awakening of humanity. Thank you

529
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:58,720
very much. And I think we have a
few minutes, if we can, to

530
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,080
handle some questions. Yes, so I
turn this back over to Jason and

531
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:04,800
Jeanette.

532
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,320
Unknown: Hi, gosh, I'm all
choked up. Chris, that was

533
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,980
beautiful. Thank you, right.
Let's have a look at the

534
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:19,380
question. There's one question
here from Katie Carr. Katie, do

535
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:25,580
you want to ask that question
yourself. Jason, can we unmute

536
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:33,260
Katie? Or can I unmute Katie?

537
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,920
Jeannet Weurman: There she is.
I'm here. Thank you so much.

538
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,380
It's actually two questions.
I'll read them out. First, I'm

539
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,820
intrigued in what you said,
massive appreciation, but about

540
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,420
the centrality of the human
species in these visions. And it

541
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,320
seems kind of anthropocentric,
given that we invented the

542
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,600
concept of species anyway. And
I'm wondering about like, the

543
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:07,680
place of non human life in this
expanded consciousness? Yes, and

544
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,979
Chris Bache: this first one, and
then you can ask the second one,

545
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:15,599
how about that? Because this is
a really important question. I

546
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,559
have friends who have spent a
great deal of time at the

547
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,059
interface of the human species
and animal species, and actually

548
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:26,359
immersing themselves into
various animal species with

549
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:30,259
various insights. And my work
has not been like that. My work

550
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:33,799
has been really focused on the
human species. And I don't know

551
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:39,859
why, except for one particular
thing, I think the human species

552
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:44,319
is the most dangerous species on
the planet right now, it is our

553
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:48,219
the imbalances of the human
psyche which are placing the

554
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:52,239
lives and well being of the
other species in peril. If we

555
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:59,019
can heal and make right, make
whole the human species, then

556
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:02,519
the other species will be saved
and they will be safe on our

557
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:07,679
planet. My best understanding is
that my work is really focused

558
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,819
on the human species, not that
it denies the importance of the

559
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:15,299
other species, but that it's
trying to basically get at the

560
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,899
problem where it lives. And
right now, the problem where it

561
00:47:18,899 --> 00:47:23,419
lives is inside the human heart
and our insensitivity to the

562
00:47:23,419 --> 00:47:27,559
larger, deeper rhythms of life
that we share with all the other

563
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:29,839
life forms on our planet.

564
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,680
Jeannet Weurman: Yeah, I hear
that it's like the biggest

565
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,680
potential for purification is
right here with us.

566
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,720
Chris Bache: The essential, if
the human species can be fixed,

567
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,140
so to speak, can be wakened up,
everyone will be safe on the

568
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,280
planet. If we're not saved, if
we don't save ourselves and wake

569
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,880
ourselves up, then all life
forms will continue to be in

570
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,820
danger. Beautiful.

571
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:02,220
Jeannet Weurman: Thank you. The
second question was, after this

572
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:06,420
incredible gift of realization,
it's a big question, what have

573
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,060
you been doing with your life
for the last 20 years?

574
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:17,580
Chris Bache: Good question.
Well, I spent 20 years really

575
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,400
thinking about these sessions
and trying to understand them.

576
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,820
It takes a long time to
integrate experiences this deep.

577
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:32,060
It turned out to be, much to my
surprise, coming down the

578
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,960
mountain of these visions was
almost as difficult as going up

579
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,040
the mountain. And the last
chapter of the book is a chapter

580
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,940
called coming off the mountain,
where I describe some of the

581
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,080
challenges I face, coming away
from the visionary state,

582
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:52,900
entering back into the fully
grounded condition. So what I've

583
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,560
been doing is I continue to
teach. I mean, I taught for a

584
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,320
number of years, and I really
couldn't talk about my

585
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,060
psychedelic practice openly
until I had retired from the

586
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:07,200
university, because I love
teaching, and if I talked about

587
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,040
let people know what I was
doing, it would have terminated

588
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:16,260
my academic career. I continue
to take care of my children, to

589
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:22,580
shepherd them as best as one can
into their adult lives. I have

590
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,420
tried to deepen my spiritual
practice. I've always been a

591
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,320
meditator, always done some form
of spiritual practice, which I

592
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,620
think is really important if
you're going to enter into what

593
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,100
I would call the path of
temporary immersion, which is

594
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,540
working with psychedelics, it's
really important to have a

595
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:45,280
stable practice, spiritual
practice, a daily practice that

596
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,320
takes care of your body and your
mind and helps you integrate

597
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,300
these extreme swings of energy
and these extreme ideas that

598
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,600
pour into us during a
psychedelic session. So I

599
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,580
basically it. So I've been
digesting my work. I've been

600
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,540
finishing out my life process.
In the middle part of my life, I

601
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,080
retired from the university. I
did a little more teaching, but

602
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,820
basically I wrapped all that up
by about 2015 it took me five

603
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:19,020
years to write this book, even
though I had all the sessions

604
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,940
beforehand. It took me five
years first. It took me a long

605
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:27,500
time just to get myself in the
psychological space where I

606
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:32,540
would be willing to share these
experiences, because they are so

607
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,680
personal. I mean, they're so
deep, they are so intimate, they

608
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,440
are about my relationship with
the divine. And it took me a

609
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,340
long time just before I was
willing to let anyone have

610
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:52,300
access to such deep places
within my own life history. But

611
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,660
spirit kept telling me, No, you
don't have the luxury of being

612
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,740
private right now. It's all oars
in the water. Things are

613
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,140
speeding up. People will be able
to use your work in order to

614
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,140
strengthen and support their own
life's journey, as we go into

615
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,180
this time in history. And so it
turned right after I'd finished

616
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,740
my sessions, Spirit said to me
in my meditation, 20 years in,

617
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,900
20 years out, which meant that
it would take 20 years for me to

618
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,620
digest all the gifts that I had
been given in that 20 year

619
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:32,720
journey. And it just so happens
that diamonds from Heaven was

620
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,840
published 20 years after I
stopped my last journey.

621
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,980
Jeannet Weurman: Thank you. I'm
really, really grateful that you

622
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:46,420
started so young, and have
shared with us. Thanks so much.

623
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,660
Chris Bache: Thank you. Katie,
yes, I did start young. I did

624
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:53,680
this work when I was 30 to 50,
and I'm now 71

625
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,900
Unknown: thank you. Okay, is it
okay to move to the next

626
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:08,640
question. So this Jamie Mills,
can we, can we unmute Jamie

627
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,240
Mills, and thank you, Katie, for
your question. It was both

628
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,120
questions, very good questions.
Can we unmute Jamie? I have done

629
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:18,900
Jamie,

630
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,620
hi Chris, thank you for your
heartfelt sharing.

631
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,080
Chris Bache: Thank you. Nice to
meet you.

632
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:35,300
Unknown: As someone with
children, I'm and trying to hold

633
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:43,420
this aspect in awareness I often
struggle with a normalcy of

634
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:50,440
life, as well as with some
awareness of what is to come.

635
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:58,480
And as part of that, I suppose
there's the question of, Do you

636
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:05,280
anticipate seeing more? Seeing
these changes in your lifetime.

637
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,180
Chris Bache: You know, I want to
emphasize that in my visionary

638
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,340
work, I was never given any
particulars of how, when you

639
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:21,980
know, you know how it was going
to manifest. It's it appeared to

640
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:29,240
be a global crisis that was
triggered by a global climate

641
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:34,160
change crisis. It seems to be,
seem to be ecologically driven,

642
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:38,420
that impacted the political
process, the economic process,

643
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,300
our social process, but in terms
of when, how, specifically, no

644
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,800
content whatsoever. I was shown
that it was happening, that it

645
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:52,300
would be happening. I was shown
some of the collect, some of the

646
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:59,740
mechanisms of the process, and
specifically how the role that

647
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:04,260
the collective psyche would play
in catalyzing this change

648
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,720
underneath our feet as quickly
as is needed for us to survive

649
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:16,920
our foolishness. I have
children, like many of us here,

650
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:23,000
and I've been surprised,
frankly, with covid 19, how

651
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,060
quickly we have escalated into a
sense of global crisis, how

652
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,420
quickly we've had the rug pulled
out from under many of our feet

653
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:38,960
we've been had to rearrange our
lives dramatically. To me, the

654
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:45,460
pandemic feels to be like an
overture to a symphony. It

655
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:50,740
starts the process. It touches
some of the themes of the

656
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:56,680
process that we're getting into.
But it is not itself the key

657
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,300
crisis. It is the beginnings of
a series of punctu. Weighted

658
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:06,780
crises that will move and deepen
in the years ahead. And we're

659
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,340
not powerless. In fact, how we
respond in the next 10 years

660
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:16,800
will be very important with how
deep this crisis will be and

661
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,980
will be generated. I think we're
beyond the point of being able

662
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,600
to stop it, but we're not the
beyond the point of being able

663
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:30,860
to influence it. During my
lifetime, I expect that I am

664
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,280
watching it begin, but I don't
think I'll be watching it

665
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,600
finish. I think that work is
going to fall to my our children

666
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,040
and to our children's children.
I suspect this will last

667
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,400
generations, because we're
talking about the pivoting of an

668
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,860
entire planet, and this will
take time. One of the authors

669
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:56,380
who has really laid out the
escalating scale of the crises

670
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,840
that we're facing is Dwayne
Elgin, whose latest book. He's

671
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,900
been an elder thinking through
these issues for decades in his

672
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,800
life, and he's just published
his last book, and it's called

673
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:17,100
choosing earth, and He lays out
the next five decades, decade by

674
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:20,780
decade, how these crises are
likely to be compounding

675
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,680
themselves, and it's all data
driven. It's not visionary

676
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,880
driven. He really does his
homework thoroughly. He's been

677
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,560
monitoring all the international
forecast, crunches the numbers

678
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,520
and gives us a sense of what's
likely to be happening in the

679
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,040
decades ahead. And the whole
last part of the book is, what

680
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,400
can we do? What can an
individual do? We don't have to

681
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,640
simply sit, take this lying
down. In fact, we don't want to

682
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,360
simply take it lying down. We
need to get up and mobilize, and

683
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,980
mobilizing at two different
levels, inwardly, doing our

684
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,480
spiritual homework, confronting
the shadow that we have carried

685
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,100
into this time in history and
outwardly supporting the process

686
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,820
of healing the collective psyche
and confronting the shadow that

687
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:13,320
it has brought into this time in
history. So there's plenty of

688
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,080
work to be done. Thank you.

689
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:22,700
Unknown: Thank you, Chris. We've
got a couple of minutes, if my

690
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,940
clock is right until quarter
past. Do you want to take one

691
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,860
more question? Chris? Or shall
we?

692
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,900
Chris Bache: Yeah, one more is
fine.

693
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:36,140
Unknown: So the next question is
Claudius Schwartz plot, I hope

694
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,840
I'm pronouncing that correctly.
And thank you, Jamie, for your

695
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:45,100
question. Uh, can we unmute?

696
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:50,320
Claudia, Hi, Claudia, Hi, Chris.
We met about one and a half

697
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,940
years ago at the conference in
Philadelphia. Yeah, I really

698
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,820
enjoyed talking to you, and
later I read your book. And

699
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,400
yeah, I'm really fascinated with
your work. So my question is,

700
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,380
from a Christian perspective,
I'm wondering whether the vision

701
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:11,460
of the future human could refer
to something like heaven,

702
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,720
because what you described
sounds a lot like the Christian

703
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,500
descriptions of heaven, but of
course, how you are describing

704
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:24,200
it, it's still on Earth? Yes. So
I'm wondering whether there's a

705
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,560
way we could integrate your
insights with the Christian

706
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,800
teachings, and whether
Christianity has ever played a

707
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,960
role for your explorations.

708
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,040
Chris Bache: Certainly
Christianity did play a role in

709
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,360
my exploration. I was raised in
the Deep South. I was raised in

710
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,960
Mississippi, and I was raised
Catholic, and I got a good shake

711
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,380
from the Catholic Church. I
really, I have no complaints

712
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:52,300
about my experience being raised
Catholic, and in fact, my first

713
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:56,620
vocation in life was to actually
be a Catholic priest. I was in

714
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,740
the seminary for three years in
high school, even then one year

715
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:04,980
in college, and I left that
behind in order to choose a

716
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,100
different course, a course with
children, a course with

717
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:13,440
marriage. My life has been
deeply influenced by all the

718
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,960
spiritual traditions of the
world. I've taught world

719
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,800
religions for years. I consider
all of them dear friends, but

720
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,520
the two which have influenced me
most deeply has been

721
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,540
Christianity and Buddhism. Those
are the ones that I've drawn

722
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,880
most inspiration from. I think
you're absolutely right. I think

723
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,660
what we're looking at is heaven
on earth. That is the vision of

724
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:40,420
moving forward, that this is an
embodiment of heavenly states of

725
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,740
consciousness in our physical
existence. Now, stepping back

726
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,620
very quickly, I know we don't
have much time, so very quickly,

727
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,120
all the religions of the last
5000 years have all been what I

728
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,200
would call up and out cosmology.
The idea is that you achieve a

729
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,800
state of salvation, our
spiritual awakening, and once

730
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,540
you. Achieve that state you
leave. The Hindu word for

731
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:08,760
enlightenment was moksha,
escape, escaping time and space.

732
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,340
I think all of these cosmology
has got half of the message, but

733
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,340
lost half of the message. Hadn't
gotten the second half of the

734
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:20,780
message yet, and therefore they
represent incomplete visions of

735
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,580
history, because it leaves
unanswered the question, what is

736
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,880
the purpose of time and space?
What is the purpose of this

737
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,500
magnificent universe? It's been
called a veil of suffering. It's

738
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,920
been called a place where we
just want to get out of it as

739
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,120
quickly as we can. We want to
get back into the bliss of

740
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,080
divine existence. And I
understand that in the period of

741
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,320
history that it covered when we
began to actually have

742
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:53,620
experiential access to the deep,
deep divine truths, naturally,

743
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,800
we would feel drawn to being
there. And then we could not

744
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,660
realize these truths here, we
would want to be there. But I

745
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:05,160
think the deeper truths are
really coming into our awareness

746
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,780
today, the more we understand
the extreme age and how much

747
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:13,860
intelligence and how much effort
has been invested in unfolding

748
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:18,300
this universe for 13 point 8
billion years, and will continue

749
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,800
to be unfolding for billions and
billions and billions of years

750
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,880
more, the more we begin to
understand a different vision

751
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,740
for humanity. And that is not
that our goal is to awaken and

752
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:38,000
leave but our goal is to awaken
and incarnate Divine

753
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,080
Consciousness here in our body
on this planet, and in this

754
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:49,360
process, cooperate with taking
creation into a new

755
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:55,120
developmental level, truly
heaven on earth, truly, fully

756
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:01,080
awaken spiritual Consciousness
in our physical bodies, our

757
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,560
egoic consciousness, our present
Mind, Body Consciousness,

758
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:08,520
exploded into the larger
consciousness of the soul,

759
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,020
another Christian theme, but a
soul textured with all of its

760
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:16,860
former life history, a
tremendous expansion of the

761
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,660
human heart, because we have so
many Relationships with so many

762
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,560
people over so many centuries,
and also an expansion of the

763
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:29,720
human mind as we open more
easily and more naturally into

764
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:35,480
the divine consciousness that
nurtures all I think it's very

765
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:38,420
it's very compatible with
Christian vision, once We

766
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:44,740
understand and make a couple of
small adjustments. Thank you.

767
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,720
Unknown: Thank you, Chris, do.

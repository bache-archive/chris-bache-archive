Andrew Holecek  0:00  
Everybody. Andrew holochick here, and I simply cannot contain my excitement about my guest for today.

Andrew Holecek  1:56  
an academic. I love to read. I love to devour books, and I have to say, I have never read anything like your last book, LSD and the mind of the universe, and so out of all the books that you've written, this is the one I really want to focus on, because it's no exaggeration to say that it really stretched my mind open, challenged me. And maybe we can talk about some of the areas where I was challenged created both tremendous resonance with my own path and also some dissonance. And so that's a great way to make modern music, right? So maybe, maybe we can create a symphony of sanity with with some questions to you, of which there is no shortage, but one kind of preparatory comment, there's a term by the Eco philosopher Timothy Morton that I really quite like. He talks about hyper objects, and he refers to this in relationship to climate change. When you have something that is just so enormous that is really difficult to wrap your mind around it, it just defies description. It's literally mind bending, mind stretching, and then maybe even mind blowing, and it's no exaggeration that your book and your journey is a hyper object to me,

Andrew Holecek  3:08  
and I can't tell you how it's impacted me and how I want to really get into some of the nitty gritty of what you went through. But in order to give our listeners even a rough idea of what we're going to be talking about, perhaps give us a long elevator pitch. Okay, so this is we have 1000 floors to a sand, right? So this is a long elevator pitch. Share with us, if you would, a little bit about this book before we get into the weeds, and I start exploring particular topics with you, yeah,

Chris Bache  3:45  
well, I know it's a radical book, and I think we are at a pivot point in history, and I think that psychedelics represent a major transition point, a true historical before And after point with respect to philosophy, not just psychology. It generates not only a new therapeutic protocol for healing the personal psyche, but literally, a new way of doing philosophy. It's not really new, because it goes back to the elysinian mysteries and the Ayahuasca traditions in Brazil, but I got involved in it right out of graduate school. I had just finished my PhD from Brown University. I went to work in Ohio, at Youngstown State. I was looking around for where to begin, where to continue my research. I was a pretty deeply convinced agnostic at the time,

Chris Bache  6:24  
wearing eye shades and with headphones, listening to very carefully selected music to support the deepening of the process. So that's where I began. I worked for four years. I stopped for six years again for reasons that I give in the book, and then I resume for another 10 years, and the method, the psychedelic method, as a philosophical method, involves systematically expanding the boundaries of one's consciousness. And let me say that we understand that psychedelics in general and LSD in particular, represent is an amplifier of consciousness. It doesn't give you any specific experiences. It amplifies your consciousness. Makes you hypersensitive for a number of hours at a time. How you use that hypersensitivity very much influences what emerges over a long period of time. If you go to a concert or you just sit down chat with friends, you're going to have a certain level of experience. But if you approach these hours in a contemplative manner, if you approach them as an opportunity to go deep within your consciousness, totally internalized, isolating yourself from the world, a journey begins. It's a journey that has many levels, because as we confront all the things that a hyper sensitive mind throws up to us to confront, and it usually starts with all the fears, all the things we're ashamed of, all the things we're unhappy about, those are the early confrontations that lead to the healing process. But if you keep that up, it keeps going deeper and deeper and deeper. If you navigate this, this journey carefully, I always recorded my sessions within 24 hours, and that's really important, because the more careful you are in recording your session and pondering them, the clearer, the deeper your next session is likely to be. So there's a circle of learning that's involved. So for 20 years, I kept up this systematic practice, and then I waited. I stopped it. I went from 79 to 99

Andrew Holecek  8:38  
and then I didn't write LSD in the universe, I didn't publish it until 20 years later. In 2019 I spent many years analyzing my experiences, pondering them, trying to sort them out, before I was ready to really publicly release this hidden side of my life. My students never learned about my psychedelic work. I kept a firewall between my public life and my private life in this regard, and it's only after I retired from the university that I've really been willing to go public on this side of my life. Amazing.

Andrew Holecek  9:16  
Even there, there's so much to talk about. Let me just if I might ping one question for you. Just briefly, I am a musician. My first degree is actually in classical piano, and so just briefly, why? Why music? What was the role of music and how did it help you? How did you choose it? I don't want to spend a ton of time on this. Yeah, but, I am interested, where did that inspiration come from, and how did, how did it end up supporting your journey? There's early

Andrew Holecek  9:47  
research done on how music influences psychedelic sessions. I have references to that, to the those sources in my work based.

Chris Bache  10:00  
Basically it creates a field and an ambiance that supports you, letting go of your current physical reality, relaxing and yielding to this up rushing of material that comes from the unconscious. There are about five stages in a psychedelic session as the energy is building, as it's peaking, and as you're coming down, it's hours, you know, it's eight hours of the day, and you have to choose music to support each stage of that process. So the music would be very aggressive and very long, chordal sequences with powerful crescendos in the early stages, long, expansive passages in the middle stages, gradually tapering off into quieter and quieter and judgment music at the end. After of after only a year or so, I basically stopped using classical music, which is more commonly used. I shifted to using a lot of indigenous music because I found it to be more powerfully evocative. It helped me go into let go of my conventional reality and enter into unusual reality. Well, that's really interesting, Chris, because in the inner yogas of tantric Buddhism, which I know you're a student of the Vajrayana. Yeah, as you know, the subtle body is actually the kind of frequency or the domain that is literally quite in resonance with sound. And so when we're actually touched by music, it's really our subtle body that is touched. And this is really interesting to me, because when you talk about this journey, which in one way, and I'll be curious to see if this resonates with you, I really appreciated your frequent allusions to the work of Carl Jung, and I

Andrew Holecek  11:53  
don't remember you saying this overtly, but the process of individuation, how it is that bringing the unconscious processes into the light of conscious awareness is what, in fact, constitutes one vector of awakening. And so the reason this is interesting to me is that the subtle body is also connected to the unconscious mind, and so in a certain way. And let me see if this is landing with you. When you're working with this type of music, it's almost as if you're creating a tuning for Invitational harmonic in external auditory mechanisms or mediums that therefore could perhaps evoke correlative inner qualities that help you, in fact, bring these processes into the Light of Consciousness. Is it fair to say something like that?

Andrew Holecek  12:33  
I think that's fair. And, you know, basically, I think that's a good description. The subtle body is very actively involved in the psychedelic process when you open up into deeper states of consciousness, I learned that deeper states of consciousness are higher levels of energy, and so it places enormous demands on your physical body, but particularly their subtle energy body. And so it's very the subtle energy body is very much involved. It's a very you're moving into highly stimulated states, which are not simply psychologically stimulating, but they're energetically subtle, energetically stimulating and physically stimulating. Yeah, that really

Andrew Holecek  13:17  
makes so much sense to me. But I want to put an exclamation point, and return to something that you intimated that you also ping on later in your book, connected to this kind of amplification, using these agents as means to heighten awareness and amplifying the mind. And what you said at the end really struck me, because, in fact, I was a student of chugya Trungpa Rinpoche, a statement that I always took from him to be pejorative negative, that LSD is super Samsara. I originally heard that as a negative, your twist on it was fantastically alchemical or tantric, because now you put a positive spin on it, that in a very beautiful way, the super Samsara gives you the opportunity to bring these unconscious processes into the light of awareness. And therefore, I think the word you use is confront, even confrontation, the word you could say inner jihad, right to wrestle with these inner dimensions as a way, again, in the alchemical or tantric spirit, to transform these super Samsara into nirvana through proper relationship. Is that? Is that one way to talk about what you experienced as well?

Andrew Holecek  14:30  
It is I want to, I want to tag two items there. The first one, again, it all depends on how you meet this super Samsara. Samsara is very addictive. It's very distracting, it's very alluring. And if you increase the your sensitivity to Samsara, it can take you on a journey that just will just distract you and lead you, and it really doesn't take you anywhere. Accept through into more Samsara. But if you use this opportunity in a true contemplative fashion to look deeply at the Samsara that's there, then you you find that you the Samsara will fall apart. You, when really take the samsaric tendencies to their roots, and when you take them to their roots, they become uprooted, and you begin to move into deeper levels, deeper levels of Samsara, but then eventually into the levels that go beyond Samsara, into extra Samsara levels of reality, into the Bardo, but then eventually into extra Samsara levels of reality. Now I want to the second point I want to mention is people use psychedelics for many different purposes, some for recreation, some to hyper stimulate creativity. But three basic purposes are therapeutic healing, which is the dominant way that people are using psychedelics today in the psychedelic Renaissance, to heal the wounds of life, of the personal psyche, second for spiritual realization to accelerate one's awakening, to accelerate the one's awareness of Nirvana, or entering into the condition of nirvana.

Chris Bache  16:14  
And this is why I had started. This is what got me started, like many people in the late 70s, into the psychedelic work, but eventually, very quickly, really, that agenda fell away in my practice, partly because of the very powerful protocol that I adopted. Personal enlightenment fell away as not a significant part of my journey, it came back around in the end, and it was always there, but it wasn't the primary modality, collective awakening became very important that is working on behalf of the human family. The Bodhisattva vow, in a sense, came through very strongly. But eventually my work settled into a third agenda, which I would call cosmological exploration.

Chris Bache  17:13  
what I think of as the consciousness of the universe, or the consciousness of the creative intelligence that's behind the universe and within the universe, and you don't need to explore all those deep pathways in order to awaken spiritually. You don't need to go into archetype of reality. You don't need to go back to the birth of the universe in order to awaken to the truth of your essential nature, as the Buddhist would say, or to your Christ consciousness, as the Christians would say. And so I wanted to differentiate cosmological exploration from the project of spiritual awakening, because if we hold cosmological exploration to the measures or criteria of success of spiritual awakening, I think we're going to miss the mark of what's actually taking place in the journey. Oh my gosh, Chris boy, you're going to the deep end of the pool. Yeah. Wow. So let's unpack this, because I think this is really interesting. This is super important, in my opinion, because it begs a number of questions. One, is the relationship between, excuse me, the individual and the collective, the individual and the cosmos. And therefore, deep, as a scholar of religion and philosophy, deep questions about the nature of mind and reality that I guess, to paraphrase it, there's so many ways to get into this, but 111, question that comes to mind is,

Andrew Holecek  18:44  
is it, in fact, the mind that's in the universe or the universe that's in the mind? In other words, what exactly is the relationship between the individual and the cosmic? And is, in fact, part of what I hear is a dissonance, potential. Dissonance, for me, is a, is a subtle cosmological dualism that there therefore seems to intimate a difference between the individual and the cosmic, that there's still some sense of separation implied there. So maybe help me understand that tease that apart for me, because if I noticed in one of your footnotes, you talk that if you were to pin yourself into a corner philosophically, you would, you would define yourself as a monist. And so how does monism play into this if, in fact, you're intimating a subtle dualism?

Andrew Holecek  19:32  
It's only a functional dualism which all monist traditions recognize. Fun at Quora. I'm a monist at heart. And this comes this not a philosophical position, it's an experiential position.

Andrew Holecek  19:52  
The deeper one goes into one's own consciousness eventually come to that point where, where let. Let me, let me back up and start again. Contemporary thought, scientific thought, tends to see the physical world as the only world that exists. And they tend to see the physical world as operating by mechanistic processes, that there is not consciousness in atomic in chemical processes, and that consciousness somehow pops into existence at some point in the evolutionary process. Now there are lots of philosophical reasons for challenging the adequacy of that understanding of consciousness, and I align with those philosophers who are panpsychists who believe that consciousness, or the what you might think of as or consciousness, a core origin, consciousness is present in physical reality or energetic reality from the very start, and that conscious consciousness isn't added later, but consciousness is part of the emerging universe from the Big Bang forward. So that just mark that okay experientially, when one, when one shatters one's personal mind, when when one reaches the limits where your personal history can no longer contain what's happening in your mind. And when you've excavated through the various levels of your personal unconscious, one drops into a larger field of consciousness. Part of that one of the part of the field you drop into is the field of your species mind. And here's the common ground with Carl Jung the collective psyche. But if you keep working and dropping and dropping and dropping you deep, it drop into deeper and deeper, larger and larger levels of consciousness until eventually you're in very familiar, very territory that's very familiar to the mystics. When they are talking about God consciousness are talking about all as one. The experience over and over again, is that the entire universe, both its physical manifestation and it's the mind that underlies this manifestation is fundamentally a single organism, and that all life takes place within this single singularity, and all life is a manifestation of an emergence of this singularity in diversity. And when we first began to discover this underlying reality, what I would call the mother universe that underlies the daughter universe of the physical world during the Axial Age, you know, about three to 5000 years ago, it was so what we encountered, where we began to get, have the the meditation techniques, or the psychedelic techniques in the early Hindu Soma, to Drop into this reality. It was so intoxicating and so ecstasy filled, that we developed an interpretation of life that said that the purpose, the purpose of life was to get back to that, that there is nothing worth holding on to in physical reality. There is nothing worth holding on to in individuality, what you really want to do is take the drop and put it back into the ocean. You want to dissolve ego and end up in back into the oneness. And I understand that, but I think it's a fundamentally flawed cosmology. Now that we're beginning to understand how old the universe, how big it is, how intelligent it is, how how long it's been working to bring forward the more evolved forms of life that it has to think that after 13 point 7 billion years of evolution, when just a Few 1000 years ago, we've become self conscious enough to be able to penetrate our individual consciousness and discover this underlying cosmic, cosmic consciousness, which holds the entire universe, just when we discover that, then we want to dissolve and disappear out of existence altogether, home. Makes no sense. I don't think that's and what I've learned, or what I've been taught in my sessions, is that the universe wants to support individuality, not the prism, not not the individuality that's imprisoned within solitary, egoic awareness, but a robust individuality of what we might call the soul, which is open and porous and in constant exchange with the larger rhythms of life. This is the both and position that when one awaken spiritually, one literally becomes more. More of an individual than you were before you awakened, you know. So there's a, so there is a, I think that when we go deep, we not only discover the oneness,

Chris Bache  25:13  
and we discover that that oneness is the essence of our individual being. Classic Atman is Brahman. The essence of the individual is the essence of the totality. But now we discover that Brahman delights in manifesting Atman and in growing Atman, and in Atman waking up to its own true nature, and then that waking up is just a stage in a larger evolutionary process of empowerment so that we literally learn to become more and more and more of a conscious synthesis of individuality and spiritual totality. Oh, Chris, oh my gosh. I can hardly contain myself here. What I mean? Talk about diamonds from heaven. I mean, this is your journey. You're not Johnny Appleseed. You're You're Johnny diamond. See, your life is throwing diamonds. But let me just maybe this is an issue of semantics and the nuance of talking. Yeah, what a challenge when you start talking about Non-duality, nature of mind and reality using dualistic mechanisms, you're headed into trouble. So but help me understand a couple things

Andrew Holecek  27:47  
to pen to it, that somehow is, in fact, your beloved that is holding you, guiding you and nurturing you. How do you reconcile that with the teachings on emptiness and non theism? Yeah, it's really not difficult when you when you move into it.

Chris Bache  28:06  
let's focus on the Buddhist teaching of anata, no self, emptiness of self. Shunyata trans, which can also be trans, translated transparency.

Andrew Holecek  28:18  
I think I really endorse the Buddhist position of its radical agnosticism. I think it's an anti theism. So basically, it's a critique that says every theism which is being proposed or has been proposed has structural flaws to it that it so the concept of God, the concept of theism is critiqued as being inadequate, and in its place, Buddhism proposes a pure process understanding of reality, that everything is dynamic, everything is constantly changing. Everything is fluid. Everything is in process. There is no thing which holds its existence by itself. You only exist in the interplay of the whole ocean of causality, of karmic forces, cosmic, down to species, down to individual. It's all an open system. And when you when you wake up to your essential nature, you don't. You don't wake up to a separate thing. You wake up to a fluid process, and you breathe. Now, the fluid process of existence, I take that to heart, and that resonates with my experience, in that every I experienced myself as constantly being guided and instructed and tutored in my psychedelic sessions. But the nature of that consciousness that held me and broke me down and and opened me and then broke me down some more, the nature of that consciousness never revealed itself. As a being, as a person, as a personality, and the very structure of what it was that I was engaging kept expanding and changing. Now in psychedelic states, you don't learn, or you learn by becoming what it is that you're trying to learn about. You don't take the ego there and have an experience of something. You literally shatter and you dissolve and become this. So my experience was that when I began to become aware of this, this other that was holding me and guiding me, and I began to ask it, who are you? What are you? I experienced a death which then dissolved me into a deeper level of reality where I discovered that I was this was myself. It was a deeper level of quote, myself, not my personal self, capital M. And this repeated itself over and over and over for hours on this one particular session, until eventually it brought me into the realization that it's an endless progression. It's it's a seamless consciousness within this vast consciousness. We are an individual consciousness confronting an infinite consciousness. How we experience ourselves at the moment of contact, as we dissolve into it, influence what arises out of this infinite consciousness. And that's that awareness, that this consciousness that I was engaging and discovered myself to be part of was truly infinite and open ended, and that I reached a point 15 years into the journey where I discovered I would never reach the end of it. It was an infinite progression. No matter how many years I did this work, there was always more to discover. So that means, and that, to me, resonates very deeply with the Buddhist position on its critique of theism, its critique of gods that have physical forms of the critique of gods that are come out of human history and that are we can understand to be partial approximations, attempts to understand something which are partially adequate and radically inadequate at the same time. You know so when you move beyond individual consciousness and move into the collective psyche and begin to engage some of the dynamics of the collective psyche. Part of what you engage are all the stories that we've been telling ourselves for 10s of 1000s of years, all the values that have been involved in these stories, which have been reinforcing themselves on all these cultural traditions. And there comes a point where you die out of the collective psyche, just as earlier you had died out of your personal psyche. And when you die out of the collective psyche, you move into a states of awareness which are trans species, which are go far beyond the entire human history. And at that point, you're moving into states of awareness that are radically, radically beyond and clear than any states of consciousness that take place within the collective psyche. And you just you realize that all the stories of our religions are part of the collective psyche story, and that there are the realities far, far, far beyond any of those realities. And I think that Buddhism is pointing to that phenomena. When it says it's fundamentally agnostic, it says you shouldn't restrict yourself to any limiting belief about God. However, you can experience the reality that we're pointing to. We can experience this reality, but our understanding of it will always be partial and fragmented.

Andrew Holecek  34:14  
Oh, my goodness. So geez, every one of these little snippets brought off for a couple hours on this. Yeah, there are a couple of things here that really stood out for me, Chris and again, there's, there's, these are really seed syllables for massive arenas of for conversation. But one is, is what you talk about so beautifully in your book. And I have not read living classroom yet, but I literally just got it in the mail, and that is this radical, revolutionary

Andrew Holecek  34:41  
new pedagogical approach, which you talk about, and I love it. This, this transition from kind of Newtonian, atomistic pedagogy, individuality, separate from others, to kind of a quantum entangled pedagogy where using that mixing metaphor is the connective tissue of consciousness that you're really.

Andrew Holecek  35:00  
So you're learning by becoming I mean, what a fantastic thing to say, which, by the way, has resonance in both the Hindu and Buddhist traditions through what my language is the Gnostic pedagogical approach of hearing, contemplating, meditating, which is ingest, digest, metabolize, until the teachings actually are purified, filtered from conceptual defilements into full somatic empowerment, embodiment, and there that's where true knowing comes from. And so I love that aspect of your journey, that that it introduces a type of pedagogy that is completely resonant with the classic wisdom traditions. You experience this through your journey, I also want to come back to and this is key to me, and this was a really, really big experience for me when I did my three year retreat where I experienced what you're referring to for the first time in my life, and I wrestled with it, Chris, because it really at that time, it wasn't dissonance with my obviously limited understanding of emptiness and non theism, where I did feel I was being held and loved by something bigger than me. And this really created a rut for me, because it was like, Hey, wait a second. I thought there was no externality. I thought it was all solipsist. You know, it's not solipsistic, but it's just mind only. So how, how can there be an external agency without capitulating to the god principle? And so what I want to share with you, that, again, your book was such an inspiration for me, is that, in a very real way, when I was doing these guru yogas and devotional practices properly, my mind broke. I died to a limited self sense I had, you know, we can come back to this in a little bit. There's just tremendous hardship and pain before that breakthrough occurred, and then the minute that happened, I felt this complete container, mandala, holding environment of love and, dare I say, and this is in quotations, an external agency that was, in fact, holding me. And then what became unbelievably interesting to me, Chris was, in a certain way, in the third year of my retreat, I lost something. I lost some of these initial qualities. And so it first, it was like, Wait a second, I Where did my magical nature of mine go and, and I was, I really entered a kind of a dark night of the soul within my three year retreat. And a lama came in and said something that just floored me, that it was a female Lama that said the dakinis can bestow awakening, and they can take it away. And, and I said,

Andrew Holecek  37:39  
What? What

Andrew Holecek  37:41  
like that was like, you know, it was like a big Bong just hit my head. But it was so true, it felt like somehow it had been taken away. And it took me decades, Chris, to finally understand the really brutal, painful, powerful lesson that was developing in my retreat. And you mentioned this a little bit in the very last chapter of your book, which I thought was just absolutely genius, that I was getting stuck in a kind of almost spiritual bypassing, or Transcendentalism, in the negative sense, that I was dissolving into these completely formless realms where I became the universe. And I realized, on one level, when this agency, for lack of a better term, took it away the and this is my thought bubble, probably akin to some of the thought bubbles that entered you. It was like the command was, you will find me in form, or you will not find me at all. In other words, it was almost as if don't get stuck on this formless stuff. Don't get stuck in the transcendental aspect. Come back to the earth. Come back to the imminent, come back into body. And that turned out to be one of the most radically challenging. And eventually, over 20 years of trying to incorporate that revelatory experiences of the retreat was that, no, it's not about this ascent into this fundamental Godhead. That's just half the journey. The other half, the evolutionary half, is taking that and bringing it riveting, it molding it back into the earth. And so I want to pause just to share that story with you, because when you share that in your book, it was like, Oh my gosh, this is exactly resonant with what happened in my own experience. And so I want to return to, if you don't mind, help me further understand, and this will help many of my listeners, who are Buddhists, who really work in the realm of non theism and emptiness, this so called agency, the beloved, that, in fact, can embrace, that we can call on, that we can work with, that we really are not alone. We can take refuge in these greater forces to help us along our path. So sorry for the long winded interjection, but I want to because I appreciate very powerful my own experience, not just a theoretical thing. This is a big deal in my own practice life.

Andrew Holecek  39:52  
Yeah, you know, maybe it's a footnote to my. Earlier comment to bridge into this new wing. I think Sri Aurobindo critique of Buddhism is correct

Chris Bache  40:08  
in that he he criticizes Buddhism for not sufficiently confronting the fact of existence, the the extraordinary power and majesty of existence in in rejecting anything static and anything in form, in its agnosticism, in its anti theism. And it's I'm not taught teaching all of that as well and good. But he says, We have to come to Terence with the fact of the magnitude and the genius and the majesty of the universe of which we are part. Now Buddhism may say, well, thank you very much. We don't need that. What we really need is freedom from our suffering. I'll take the freedom from suffering, and I'm not going to engage in the metaphysical quote speculation and our bend those responses. It's not an either or, and it's a certain kind of a capitulation to not confront some of the magnitude of

Andrew Holecek  41:12  
the breath of life. And I think that now to move more towards what you were describing, I mean

Andrew Holecek  41:26  
when we have these breakthroughs, when we do the work and we go through the purification processes, and we face our shortcomings, and we let go, and we let go, and we immerse ourselves deeper and deeper, and then when we have these melting experiences, where, as you say, we are embraced, we are held by orders of of genius and orders of love beyond anything we had ever experienced before. And one can go deeper into that, there's there's, I've learned that there's so many levels of oneness. And there's even levels of of of the void, of the fertile void, though that seems like a contradiction. There are levels of that, and you can go deeper and deeper into that. And it feels initially like an external or an other because it wasn't there before, or we didn't experience it before, but we do now, and it's it clearly is not inside of us. It feels outside of us because it's holding us. But the more sorry I'm having something peeping off back here, it's okay. It's all good. The more you go back and forth into that condition and back out again and into it and press it, of course, the more you realize that you're just waking up to your own nature. You're awake because your nature and this universal nature is the same nature that our essential nature is this vast expanse, this love that floods us from outside is actually a love which is welling up also from with inside. The challenges is stabilizing those insights and bringing them into our daily experience. Now I think this is a this is a challenge of all spiritual practice. Of course, we go on these long retreats, we get into subtle, subtle territories. We come back to the honking horns, and it's just it's so difficult to hold on and to integrate day to day. And this is particularly the case, I think, in psychedelic practice, whether you're using psychedelics as a spiritual practice, or whether you're using psychedelics, as I did, as a measure aiming at cosmological exploration. Because in my experience, in what I did, I think I pushed myself far, far deeper into the consciousness of the universe than I could ever, ever internalize and stabilize in this lifetime. And I came to realize during my time, after I came off the mountain, after I stopped my work when I was beginning to kind of just come off the mountain, come away from that long period of practice that I had, I had created an imbalance, an unwitting imbalance. I thought that because I had integrated each session thoroughly and carefully and conscientiously, that I could step back from my sessions and I could take all these blessings with me. And I learned that I had basically leaned so heavily into Transcendence that I had sort of lost my foothold in imminence. And I knew from my experience. Experience is that the entire universe was the body of divine are the body of this infinite consciousness. I knew that I was never outside of divine reality, inside physical reality, but I could not hold that awareness. Yet inside physical reality, I know that there are beings who do the Great Beings are always one's guides in these things. But I had, it's kind of like you, I think what, what I was kind of kicked off of the path, kicked off of the mountain by the sessions themselves. I did not know I was ending them. They were being ended. But there came I had these last sessions, which basically let me know that it was time to end. And one of the things I learned in the process of ending is that I had to not expand my consciousness. I had to not alter my consciousness in any way if the states of being that I had experienced in my sessions were ever going to come and awaken fully inside my historical existence. So I had to sit with the shell of my historical existence if I was ever going to fully integrate these vast bliss, domains of ecstatic presence. And I think, I think I did go farther than was good for me, and I have been in a completely different but equally important process since I stopped my sessions, the way the sessions put it, or the way my meditation put it is, there is the dying of discovering, and then the dying of keeping.

Chris Bache  46:52  
And I had done the dying of discovery, but now I had to do the dying of keeping, and that's a different process.

Andrew Holecek  47:00  
Wow. I mean, you're stopping my mind with every one of these, so many things here, but a couple things, whoa.

Andrew Holecek  47:09  
So much about this is mind bending. It's really mental yoga, stretching almost to the breaking point. And so a couple questions here is, and I wrestle with this. I mean, your the integrity of your being, Chris, your presence, the clarity of your writing, the elegance of your scholasticism, your academic predispositions and the like, I have to say, have been incredibly important for me to substantiate the veracity of your journey. And I see it with the mobility of simply the way you're presenting yourself. It's like this is the real deal. The real deal, but it is such a mind stretch. And so a couple of things along this beautiful challenge of stretching into the notion of, I love your nomenclature here, psychedelic practice. I've never heard that before. So talk to us a little bit about this revolutionary notion Greek, you know, the skids have been greased by Michael Pollan, James Kingsland, Stan Grof, these amazing predecessors, the shoulders upon which you now stand where you can now silently but radically proclaim the validity of Entheogen, psychedelics as path. So talk a little bit more about the practice of psychedelics, how to work. This is a path. And then to come back to before I forget, parenthetically,

Andrew Holecek  48:33  
the the importance of integration and the danger of disintegration. In other words, were you ever afraid of going insane, that you were stretched beyond your capacities to contain, and instead of stretching, you snap. So again, there's two big noodles thrown there. The first noodles, yeah, the first and I think in many ways, probably the most important, is talk to us about psychedelics as practice and path, and then to come back, maybe a little bit about the process of integration versus disintegration, sanity versus insanity.

Andrew Holecek  49:07  
Yeah. Well, you know, in different interviews that I've done, I make the point that I've never tripped. People say, you've done 73 trips. I say, No, I've never tripped. I've done sessions. These are therapeutically focused sessions. But actually, I'm in my own mind, I think of the Japanese term sashin. The sashin is a meditation retreat. It's a period of time set aside for spiritual, intense spiritual practice. So when I talk about LSD sessions, I could be talking about LSD sashin. It is a period of time set aside for therapeutic work, for spiritual work, for cosmological work. And there are certain just as in a sashin that. Your daily right? Life changes. You change your schedule, you change your eating you change your sleeping patterns, you change your rhythm. In order to focus and intensify this practice, just as you did when you did your three year retreat, everything changes around this long period of sustained introspection. The same is true in the psychedelic process. The critical the underbelly of using psychedelics as part of a practice of transformation, an organized practice of transformation. The underbelly is that it's temporary. You only have these states for a few hours at a time, and even if you use them diligently, you still only have them for a few hours of a time at a time, which is really the major reason why I stopped. It became too painful for me to keep coming back from these states, until eventually, I made a deal with my beloved, my name for this intelligence, whatever it is, that it would not bring me back into these dimensions again until I could stay it became It was just too painful to come and go. But before you get to that point, you can do a lot of cleaning, you can you do a lot of healing, and you would, you can do a lot of good for other people in that. What happened in my work, after about two and a half years, when I went through this, what Stan calls the perinatal process. And all you go through this, reliving your birth, confronting all the fears of death, confronting the fundamental existential crisis of whether there is any meaning in existence, eventually going to a complete shattering of your individual egoic reality. I thought, Oh, that's great. I've gone through an ego death. It was a shattering experience. Things are going to open up now go into clean sailing, not what happened. What happens that everything cranked up all over again. The suffering got worse, and it expanded for two years of practice into larger and larger levels, 1000s, hundreds of 1000s of people, 1000s and 1000s of years, I had entered the hell realms. And at first I thought this is like a deeper level of ego death. But eventually I came to understand that, no, this was not about me at all. This was not about fundamentally, my personal transformation, on my personal awakening, or even my personal healing. This was about trying to heal some aspect of the collective psyche, that there is an organizational structure, a consciousness, that that is our species consciousness, and all the wounds of history that are left unresolved are not only left unresolved at an individual soul level, but they are left unresolved at the species level. So all the wars we fought, all the terrible things we've done to each other, all the trauma, to the extent that that trauma is not healed, it it resides as unfinished business within the collective psyche. And every spiritual practitioner who goes deeply enough in whatever methodology they're using is given, often an invitation, if they choose to exercise it, to lift some of that suffering, not out of their personal life, but to lift some of that suffering out of the collective psyche, and for reasons that I think are sole choice that became a large part of my work. And I think there's nothing really special here. I mean, this is what any mother who sees a child suffering is going to do if she can do something to try to help that child suffering, to alleviate it. Any father worth his salt is going to try to help a suffering child, if we are given the opportunity, we're going to try to help other people who are in pain. This is just the normal workings of life. So to me,

Andrew Holecek  54:31  
in fact, it became a mystery to me why the collective suffering stopped, why I wasn't allowed to stay in there anymore, when clearly there's continuing collective suffering in the human psyche. Why was I taken into deeper levels beyond that, levels which are very difficult, very challenging, but they were not involved with collective pain. I'm losing the second.

Andrew Holecek  55:00  
Part of your question that you would ask, yeah, no, happy, happy. To throw it back up, because there's and there's so much richness coming out that's returning to this notion of we circumambulated this but haven't really directed. Talked about if the place of fear and well of integration versus disintegration, did you ever actually fear, especially coming back to the so called real world for your sanity? I mean, did you ever feel you're going to become so unhinged? Because let me just say this very briefly, Chris, one of the things that was profoundly resonant with with your work, and this is what just blew me away, this kind of on one level I've come to see psychedelics is a type of Tantra. And by this, what I mean is, and this has been a radical change in my more conservative nature, being more traditionalist and paying homage again. There's tremendous genius to the power of tradition. But there are also some near enemies, ossification, redefining even the tradition itself losing tributaries of new information and growth. And so I used to be really somewhat disdainful of these kind of psychedelic approaches. Is chemical mysticism in the pejorative sense, these kind of cheap fixes. But I've really changed my tune in that I now see them as a type of Tantra. By that, what I mean is that in Tantra, body is as important as mind. And now we're talking about body, very subtle body. We're talking about chemical body. We're talking about body at the level of neuro chemistry, basically. And so I think again, within the context of psychedelics as practice and path, it actually can fit in an expanded rubric of Tantra, where body, in this case, chemistry, is as important as the mind that is evoked. And this kind of neuro pharma, phenologic, neuro phenomenological way to use the neuro end to bring about these phenomenal states. And so with that in mind, yeah, the question was the role of fear, fear and integration versus disintegration, and how that relates to your ability to contain this information

Andrew Holecek  57:11  
you I had, I did come into places to go through A Death-Rebirth cycle is always an ordeal at one level or another. It always involves a surrender to the unknown. It always involves yielding to a certain fear that's holding your system locked in place. And there were places where at advanced stages of the game that I truly did fear for my sanity, or at least I knew that I was going someplace that was completely beyond anything which I could hold on to. I could not hold on to sanity as I had known it. And it was like going over a waterfall, and you just but once you go through that, once you go over that waterfall, and you experience that death, and you experience waking up in a new reality as a new being, a new kind of being, not only a new and improved you, but a different kind of being, where, for hours at a time, you can experience the universe as it experiences itself completely beyond any human right frame of reference once you experience it. That is the nature of the cycle. And this is one of the great gifts that I got from Stan Grof, was the absolute conviction that if you let these experiences take you wherever they want to take you, even though you don't understand them, even though you don't understand why it's happening this way, and it's extremely painful. If you surrender completely, it will always take you through a crisis, and it'll catch you on the other side, and it will receive you, and there, there is a blessing waiting for you on that other side, and for me, coming back from a session, it's never I have no trauma from any of my psychedelic history. I can listen to the music I used and even the most horrifying aspects of the journey, and I love it. I'm completely comfortable with it. I can talk about any of the difficult portions without any resonating, any trauma, because when you take it all the way through, you complete the cycle. Things get bad. They get worse. They get worse. They get very, very bad. But if you let surrender, it'll take you through to a completion, into ecstasy, and then what you bring back is this entire cycle. You bring back the knowledge that things get bad, but things things get great, and that's the rhythm of death and rebirth. That is the spiral of death and rebirth. Now that doesn't mean and I thought as long as that was going on, I was. Teaches that you know that I was holding everything in balance. What I did find, however, is that other thing we talked about, you can go so far into the ecstasy, you can go so deep into Transcendence that literally learning how to live with your memories becomes a major challenge. So as a spiritual practice, this practice is different from classical spiritual practices, which are much more emphasizing kind of holding on to everything, relatively speaking, holding on to where you go in smaller increments. I have an I have an understanding of how the universe works, but I don't live within that reality on a 24/7 basis. The great beings live within that reality on a 24/7 basis. So being able to, I'm speaking out of my memory, and it's good to have memories of these realities. I mean, I really think that changed my life. But it's one thing to be speaking out of memory. It's another thing to be speaking out of an immediate present, right here, living experience of this reality and learning you can internalize so many profound memories that it literally becomes challenging to live with those memories. They haunt you for the rest of your life, and they haunt you in a good way. They're not. They don't haunt you in any negative way. You literally are haunted by the beauty of the universe, right? And so you just, you try to live it and embodiment as best as you can. Yeah.

Andrew Holecek  1:01:58  
Do you think? Do you think, Chris, one of the things that really struck me was what you just paraphrased, and I have to say, in this part of the book, I struggled with this part of this part of the book, when you were talking about just all the pain, all the hardship, all the death, the unbelievably wrenching section about the dying children, was I was almost too much. And so, yeah, I hung in there, and I'm glad I did, in a certain way, almost metaphoric of you're hanging in there. But is it possible that that perhaps the what was being invited was developing a one taste relationship to both the heaven and the hell, that there would in fact, be no preference and no because that's what they say, allegedly, the very highest stages before the 11th Bhumi, the highest kind of membrane barrier before awakening, is no preference whatsoever for Samsara, nor Nirvana in discovering the inseparability. So do you think on one level that the agency was somehow eliciting the teaching lesson of great equanimity, that, in fact, relate to the agony in the same way you relate to the ecstasy, to realize that there's fundamentally no preference for either that, that that may have been what was being suggested there? Does that resonate with you.

Andrew Holecek  1:03:22  
I understand the teaching, and that teaching does come up and reflect certain aspects of the journey. I'm not sure that it reflects this particular aspect in a in a satisfying way. I have a different way of understanding because you're talking here about the ocean of what I call the ocean of suffering. And you know, one of the things I describe in the book is insights that came much later in the session, that I don't think everybody has to go into something like the ocean of suffering. I don't think everybody has to go into the hell realms or spend as long in the hell realms as I spent there. I mean, I don't think people need to be afraid of going through what I went through as kind of a necessary part of any kind of spiritual journey or cosmological exploration. I think that this was something that my chose, my soul chose to do before I was born. It manifested so quickly in my sessions after a couple of years, and it was such a tenacious and sustained part of my journey that I came to understand that this was literally a soul's choice. And I say this without pride at all, because I think there are many, many, many beings in the world today who have made the same choice. I think we are living in a critical time in history. We are living in a time when the sin. Of the fathers literally are just pouring out of us. And I don't I quote The biblical passage, not to put this all on men, but that really the limitations of our up to now standard, of our evolutionary standard, are just pouring out of us because we are being challenged to move into our next evolutionary step, not only as individuals, but as the species that the creative intelligence of the universe is trying to awaken not only individual spiritual practitioners, but the game is collective now it's desperately trying to awaken the entire human species and the the hell realms that one are literally manifesting on Earth as part of this collective detoxification process. And I think there are many beings who are have taken the Bodhisattva vow into their life and are working to alleviate suffering, collectively, socially, politically and also psycho spiritually. Because I think this century is different than earlier centuries, because there's a boiling taking place as a there's a there's a turning which is taking place deep within. And so I assume that I knew what I was getting into, and I volunteered for this work, and I know that this it's a hard chapter to read, even though I cut it down to the minimal form, it's difficult material. And yet I've had so many people write me and say, I know exactly what you're talking about, because I've been, I've been going through these experiences for years, or I went through them and I didn't understand them. You've helped me understand them some. But I think it's, it's not an unusual experience, once we understand that what's taking place here is a collective dynamic. It's something that we as an individual may have started, but the universe uses our individual initiative to accomplish something of its purpose of its agenda, and its agenda is to heal the human species in order to clear out the dross that is holding us back, to make more room for the infusion of grace, our energy or awareness that is coming to carry humanity through this crisis that we are coming into. We literally cannot afford to be a planet that's run by egos anymore? Yeah, for sure, we're just killing the planet. We need to be a planet that's run by awakened souls, and by that I mean beings who have a conscious awareness of their history, so that they know that they are not simply egos, separate private cells that they have an awakened soul consciousness where they know themselves to be spiritual beings in dynamic relationship with other spiritual beings, including non human beings. In this world, you know, animal kingdom, and when we wake up in that way, and we discover how old we are and how many generations we've been doing this, and we discover the breadth of our human of our relationships with other beings, then Naturally, we make different choices. We make more inclusive choices. We make choices for the long term, we make choices on that serves the good of all. And right now, I think we desperately need to be making choices that are inclusive and work for the good of all.

Andrew Holecek  1:08:55  
Yeah, that's really beautiful. With your permission, and if you don't want to go here, that's fine. I want to turn again. I have to contain both my enthusiasm and the energy of like, Oh my gosh. We need to talk about that. We need to talk about that. So I'm letting so much slide that it's fantastic. But with your kind permission, I want to turn to this issue of the the scientific and academic elephant in the room. How do we know if anything, any of this is actually true? How do we know issues of replica bill, replicability? I mean, how do we know if, if what you're seeing is idiosyncratic to your own biochemistry, that this and again, in the best sense of the word, not pejorative, this is your trip. Yeah. And how do we know that if seven, if 1000 other people did exactly what you did, that they could even come close to replicating your insights? Or would they, in fact, have their own particular, biological, historical, phenomenological, whatever matrix? Context whereby they would see and write a different journey, a different book, through 20 years of exploration. So the issue here is the problem of proof and universality. What would happen if 1000 people did exactly what you did and they came up with 1000 different visions? I mean, how certain are you that what you're experiencing is actually true, or simply your enculturation, your your own unique biochemistry and all the histories that bring about the narrative that you're sharing with us. So are you okay? Okay, going in this direction?

Andrew Holecek  1:10:33  
Absolutely, that's a really important question. I mean, that's like a foundational question, because if it, if this is only echoes from my own personal psyche, or even echoes from the collective psyche, then it has a certain kind of epistemic value, but it doesn't really have sufficient epistemic value that we that warrants our attention. And I discussed this all the way back in dark night, early dawn, in the first chapter, where I'm outlining what it this psychedelic philosophy, and there's a section there called the epistemic warrant of psychedelic experience, where I flesh out this question and look at what the issues are involved In this, in questioning whether these experiences truly do have epistemic value. So that's I just point there. Also Ken ring and I have had a dialog about this. Ken is good friend, wonderful researcher near death. Episode, I used his books for years in my classes. He challenged me on the same questions, and we did a dialog. Eventually we published it in I'm blanking on where it is. I should have this at the tip of my tongue, it's online. Yeah, it's online. It's quite the essay. Is our deep psychedelic experiences trustable? Yeah, and if it were just my experiences, that would be one thing. But here's, I think, the great value of Stan Grof work, where Stan Grof has collected psychedelic experiences from hundreds, if not 1000s of people over decades, and he's integrated them into a certain model of what happens at different stages of the journey. My experiences fit squarely within the broader phenomenological discussion of experiences that he has already outlined. And so I think that he provides, in a sense, a broad epistemic warrant for look, taking seriously my maybe a little unusually intense, or maybe a little unusually deep my experiences. But there's not too much new here. When you look at the full breadth of experiences that he's reported in his many, many books, culminating in his great master work, the way of the psychonaut. So there's a deep, you know, overlap. There another point, I think I'm thinking of Michael sabhm, who was a cardiologist in the early days of the near death episode movement, and he was very upset that people were talking about coming back from a cardiac arrest and talking about spiritual realities. He didn't believe in any of that stuff, and he was going to systematically disprove it. And he eventually wrote a book in which he came to the conclusion this stuff is real, and he differentiate between what he calls the local event and the transcendent event that when somebody has is in surgery or has a cardiac arrest, they get out of that they have a sensation of getting out of their body, and they can experience what's going on in the local arena, the surgical theater, the waiting room down the hall, the hospital, what's going On in the parking lot outside, and then they go into the light, and they leave physical reality, and they go into a transcendental reality. He says, We can't evaluate the transcendent experience that they have, but we can evaluate the accuracy of their local experience, and that's what he tries to do whether what they think they experience locally is, in fact, verified, verifiable in that world. And he provided evidence that in fact it was. Now that doesn't prove that the transcendent experience is true, but it certainly increases the credibility that if it's the local experience is true, the Transcendence experiences gets a little bit more little boost of credibility. The same thing happens in psychedelic experiences. Many psychedelic experiences are such that they can be verified information about the conditions of birth or circumstances of birth, the things that people learn that they really. We can reasonably exclude the possibility that they had learned through natural means, and yet, it turns out that these things can be validated. That plays here. The other part, though, is, I think, cross validation, other people having similar experience,

Andrew Holecek  1:15:18  
communal confirmation, exactly now,

Andrew Holecek  1:15:21  
what we find is this, when people start working with psychedelics, if you took 100 people from 100 different backgrounds, different socio cultural backgrounds, different trainings and whatnot, they would have very different experiences, because psychedelics, or LSD, is an amplifier. It doesn't take you to a particular experience that amplifies your mind. And because we have different histories, we come in contact with different experiences. However, Stan reports that when people go through the perinatal Death-Rebirth process, our experiences get very, very concentrated and very standardized, we begin to deal with issues which are not idiosyncratic, but are universal, fundamental existential issues, and that when people navigate the Death-Rebirth experience, every person that he has experienced who goes through that process comes back with a an understanding of spiritual reality, which is fundamentally compatible with each other, that there is a spiritual world that was waiting for us and receives us from then it's a matter of evaluating our individual explorations of that spiritual world. Now, what I did in my first in my first book on psychedelics, near dark night, early dawn, I put together three areas of inquiry, psychedelic research, near death episode research and out of body research, particularly the work of Robert Monroe, founder of the Monroe Institute of Applied Science, author of three books exploring the out of body state. And I asked whether these cosmology is that emerge from these separate bodies of exploration, out of body research, near death episode research, psychedelic research, are their cosmological visions diverging, or are they converging? And once you look at them carefully, they are converging. They are clearly converging. So that's addressing the question Are, are these experiences trustworthy? Now, in my dialog with Ken ring, I present other reasons why I think they're trustworthy, and that is for every time I had my own cultural expectations fulfilled, because I'm educated in world religions, I'm educated in comparative spirituality, I have an understanding of certain of these things, but for every time I've had them confirmed, I've also had more experiences that that shatter my expectations. I learned things I was not expecting. I learned an understanding of reincarnation, how reincarnation works, and where it's taking us that I was not expecting at all. I wasn't expecting anything about the birth of the future human. There was nothing about my conditioning, which led me to think that humanity was coming into this crossroads. There were so many things that I was shown so consistently that were far and beyond anything that I had personally expected, that I think one can reasonably conclude that this is a confrontation with truly an independent reality. And I mean independent, I have to qualify that, but a reality that it was not simply echoing back to me, my own expectations. And if you study the work of other people who push deeply into these conditions, into these states, I think we find a fundamental convergence, which doesn't mean we're seeing the exact same thing. But the issue is, do our do our visions overlap? Are they coherent with each other? Do they overlap? Now, clearly we're only at the very early stages of this inquiry. What's important is not any one person's experience. What's important is when we get, if we were to be able to get a standardized protocol, take 100 people, 1000 people with some type of standardized protocol, with very, very different backgrounds, and put them through the same regimen of internal, introspective work, then we get all of their testimony, all of their experiences, put them all on the table, and begin to look at, what is it that's consistent and what is idiosyncratic? That's where, where we're going. We're just are not there yet. We're only at the very early stages. So I have no doubt that some of the things may be somewhat idiosyncratic to me. But. I think that when we get to that point where we have hundreds of people putting their testimony forward, we're going to find much more consistency and overlap than we find divergence.

Andrew Holecek  1:20:13  
Oh, my goodness. So so so many things here as well. What a beautiful answer. Crystal really the difference between correspondence epistemology and coherence. Epistemology, I mean, the truth is born of coherence is the type of knowing that you're alluding to here. But this begs the question of aspirations around this. And so pardon the tongue in cheek reference here. But I was this came to me out of who knows where, where you know, where do you see yourself in 20 years? Do you see yourself and again? If you don't want to go here, fine, but how do you see yourself? Are you a shaman for our age? Do you see yourself? And this is where the play on Word comes in, not establishing the church of LDS, but the church of LSD, right? So do you see yourself? Not the Latter Day Saints, but you know LSD. So do you see yourself? Do you see yourself? And I think you understand the heart of my question, founding a church where, in fact, you know you have a place where you can, you now can create, as a visionary, as a revolutionary, a holding environment, a mandala container that can allow future Psychonauts to actually embrace this as path, because otherwise, where is this going to go? Are you just a unique and really interesting blip, or is are you portending the possibility of really creating a tradition of Psychonauts using rigorous to whatever extent they can, methodologies, frameworks? I think you see where I'm coming from here. You know what's next in terms of people say, somebody comes to you and says, Chris, I'm so blown away by your book. I want to take psychedelics as a practice. I want to create this as a path. What do I do? Where do I go?

Andrew Holecek  1:22:09  
Well, the first thing I tell that person always is, please, don't do what I did. Do it gently. Be gentler. Be more careful. I think I'm a symptom of a cultural pivot that we're making. I don't think I'm important, and as we make this cultural pivot, I think I will just sort of disappear under the wave of history as a somewhat early explorer. But I think we are making a pivot that's going to include and is embracing the value of psychedelics now, right now, you know, we basically did about 25 years of this work, and then in 1970 6970, it was all made illegal. Then we went into this long dry period until 2014 when Scientific American published an editorial basically on the front page of that saying that it's time to let scientists determine, not politicians determine whether psychedelics have therapeutic value. So right now, there's this tremendous Renaissance taking place. Universities all over the world are studying psychedelics, are establishing centers for studying psychedelics. A tremendous explosion. We're starting where we started back in the 1950s exploring these potentials for healing the personal psyche. We're looking at post traumatic stress, healing addiction, healing death anxiety, healing depression. We're really focused on using these substances in therapeutic applications and under control scientific conditions. And this is, and that's perfectly where we ought to be. We need to now that we've started this inquiry again, we need to be very rigorous, establish the protocols, do the documentation, look at the brain wave pictures, so on and so forth. Sooner or later, however, we're going to discover the same thing we discovered far back, and I'm not talking about the popular 60s psychedelic movement, though that too. But the serious researchers, the Stan Grof and that early generations Ralph Meister, that generation of researchers, discovered that these substances have philosophical value, not just psychotherapeutic value. They give us entire insights into the structure of the deep psyche. They can even give us insights into the structure of the cosmos, into the structure of the cosmology of the mind. And if we take PhDs who have people who have PhDs in physics and astronomer they can. Literally come back with deeper insights into the realities that they are, that they are educated to understand. I often have wished that I had PhDs in astronomy and physics, because then I would be able to understand so much more than I was able to understand given the background that I had in humanities. We're making this pivot, I think that just as psychotherapists are creating all sorts of creative protocols for exploiting the therapeutic potential of these substances, it's only going to be a matter of time before we develop philosophical protocols which for systematically exploring these states of consciousness, going into them in a rigorous manner, coming back, recording them, evaluating them, looking at our experiences in the in a social context for social validation, or asking that question, embodying putting our experiences in the context of other bodies of knowledge looking at how these experiences correlate to quantum physics, for example, or correlate to super string theory. I think this is, this is not me. I'm going to be gone 20 years. Hell, I won't be around in 20 years. I don't think I'll be around nearly that long. I'll be gone and and actually and two, I should say it took me a long time to even be willing to share these experiences, because I know how upsetting or controversial they are. I literally thought of writing the book and letting it be published post human, yeah, exactly, because I didn't want to deal with the fall out of it. And I think what happened with

Andrew Holecek  1:26:47  
Wolfgang Pauli in his conversations with Carl Jung, right? He didn't want any of that revealed until after he died. But anyway, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to

Andrew Holecek  1:26:53  
cut, yeah, and I just, I thought, but you know, the mother told me, said, No, you can't do that. She said, she said this, we need all oars in the water. She said, You didn't give yourself these visions. We gave you those visions, and they were never given to you for your private edification. You were holding these visions in trust, and that she wanted me to share them, not because it's not important that they're my visions. She wanted me to share them because they would support other people in their spiritual practice, other people in their social work, to help us through this very, very intense time of history that we're coming into, all hands on deck. And so I did the book, and I don't have any I don't have any agenda. I think what's what's clear is that there is a social pivot taking place, and that's what's important as we move forward collectively, the work, which is being done in graduate programs and medical schools all over the country. That's what's important. I think I'm a little bit ahead of the curve in terms of the philosophical discovery only because of the very, very intense methodology that I used. But I don't think I'm really that far ahead of the curve. There is a professor from Southern Methodist University called Bill Barnard, who's written two fantastic books, one on William James and one on Henri Bergson, a fine academic, Bill Barnard and he's publishing a book from Columbia University Press this year called liquid light, Which basically is a philosopher's reflections on his extended experiences with Ayahuasca and living with the Sante Daime community in Brazil. Beautiful book, magnificent book, and symptomatic one more academic who's willing to go public on their psychedelic experiences and not simply recording them and saying all this is, you know what's important, but evaluating them critically, digesting them and offering them as part of a ongoing historical discussion. So we're making this pivot. It's, it's happening,

and it's, it's radically brave. Chris, I want to acknowledge your bravery on this. And again, this is a stretch for for me, because I'm being introduced, over the last couple of years to how conservative I am. In some levels, I always thought myself as this liberal, far out kind of guy, but I realized, in my own way, I have my, I wouldn't say, blind spots, but natures of being conservative that that really know, being challenged stretched open and going, Wow, this is fantastic. And one of these is the just the generous courage of writing a book like this, because you know this from the traditional admonitions, He who knows does not speak, He who speaks does not know. And so here you are. You're speaking all over the place, and I used to really question it. And then, you know. The beautiful book by me. Je Rinpoche, if you haven't read it, in love with the world amongst journey through the Bardo life and death. It's an amazing journey of his intimate sharing that is profoundly inspiring. Your book. Vi, in certain sense, violates the code of secrecy, but I think we're living in unusual times that require unusual slash extreme measures. And so I, for one, really applaud your courage that you are you are stretching the boundaries in so many levels, in terms of pedagogy, radical innovations and path and also courage and sharing. And so you were about to say something, I want to return to what you're about to say, but I really deeply thank you for that, because the other tradition, to Kuhn Rinpoche said sharing experiences inappropriately, and that's the key, is like being in a dark cave with a candle and giving your candle away, you're left in the dark. Opportunity is transformed into obstacle. And so I this is both an applause for what you're doing and perhaps a commentary elicited from you in terms of inviting more and more of the sharing so that people can realize there is a chorus of sanity coming out. Yeah, radical, innovative, innovative ways of learning.

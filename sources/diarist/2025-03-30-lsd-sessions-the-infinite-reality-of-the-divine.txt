Did you connect with a being, or beings, or angels or other divine entities? And if you could share a little bit about what that realm was like

in all the years when I was doing this work, and all the work I did, I never encountered a being, a divine being. Said, I'm God. You know, this is what I am. It wasn't like that. It was like I would go deeper into a level of consciousness, and I would experience a communion with this consciousness, and this consciousness would teach me. It knew me, it would teach me and show me things, and it would crush me, and then bring me forward into still deeper levels, and I would go into those deeper levels, and I would enter into communion with those levels and and I internalized the energy of those levels, and I was with this consciousness, but it never crystallized into a specific form. I always felt its presence. It guided my sessions. I could enter into dialog with it. I could enter into communion with it. It would, it would dissolve me into itself. But it never crystallized into a what you might call a personality of God, or a person of God, and it just kept getting larger and larger, deeper and deeper, more and more vast. And I think that many of our theologies of God, or thinking about God, is really based upon what I would call the early encounters with an infinite intelligence, that that this infinite intelligence is far larger, far too large to ever be concretized in the historical lineages that we recognize in the world. Traditions.

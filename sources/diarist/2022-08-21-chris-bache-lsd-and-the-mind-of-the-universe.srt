00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,120
Unknown: Our program tonight was
brought to us by Heather

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,860
tishbein. She is a personal
friend of Chris's, and so I'm

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,880
going to ask her to introduce
him, Heather.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,600
Heather Tischbein: Thank you,
Daddy. I'm just over flowing

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:30,740
with joy to be able to share my,
not really friendship, but my

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:38,660
acquaintanceship with Chris,
with my ions family. I met Chris

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,960
20 years ago through the
Holotropic Breathwork network,

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,660
and Stan Grof and I read his
book back then, dark night,

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:56,020
early dawn, Steps to a deep
ecology of the mind, and got to

10
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:01,980
participate with him in person
in a workshop. So that was 20

11
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,980
years ago, and when his new
book, LSD and the universe of

12
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,820
the mind was advertised on the
shift network with the seven

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,560
weeks seminar, I immediately
signed up for that and read the

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,060
book and participated in that
seven week program. In the

15
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,600
intervening 20 years, I had a
health crisis and spent a couple

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,180
days in in a coma off planet,
which I actually remember that

17
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,980
experience and what Chris
describes as kind of the over

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,240
the thematic energy of the mind
of the universe is exactly where

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,120
I was and what I experienced
when I was off planet and on

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:03,780
life Support. Chris's work has
had an impact on my life around

21
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,620
understanding who I am as a
human being on planet Earth, as

22
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,560
as both a part and the whole
simultaneously. And I can't even

23
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,520
put into the words the help it's
been in helping me coming

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,140
through, really resolving and
appreciating. I know this might

25
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,920
sound weird, but the gift of
early childhood sexual trauma

26
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,700
and but more importantly than
all of this deepening of

27
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,200
understanding has been my felt
experience of genuine comfort

28
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,860
around when in His presence and
and in the in the world view

29
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,440
that he puts forth in this
latest book, I just feel so much

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,520
love and comfort for Chris Bache
in the world. So it's with

31
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:04,860
immense gratitude that I welcome
Chris to my ions family here in

32
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,080
southwest Washington and beyond.

33
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,499
Chris Bache: Well, thank you
very much, Heather, and thank

34
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:17,879
you everybody for inviting me
here and letting me be spend

35
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,899
this time with you. So let's get
into it. We'll see where we go.

36
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,959
We have this topic we're looking
at today, the birth of the

37
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,299
future human is a huge topic, so
we're going to have to trim it a

38
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:35,299
little bit and shape it, but
we're going to dig into it. I'd

39
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:40,899
like to jump into it and see how
far we can actually go into the

40
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:46,119
center this issue. So first I'm
going to share my screen and

41
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:54,999
throw this PowerPoint up here.
Okay, all right, and this is

42
00:03:54,999 --> 00:04:02,099
coming through for everybody.
All right. Well, it will come as

43
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,059
no surprise to anyone in this
group. Let me move this down

44
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:14,579
here, but we are a planet in
crisis. Everybody knows the list

45
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,119
of challenges that we are
currently facing. We are

46
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:21,919
confronting an escalating
climate crisis, growing droughts

47
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,019
and forest fires, more flooding
and stronger hurricanes. Our

48
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,799
reservoirs are drying up and
water tables are collapsing.

49
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,019
Rising sea levels, research is
now showing us that we have

50
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:42,039
already baked in by 2050, a 12
foot rise in the oceans, and we

51
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,419
know from projections what that
means in terms of changing club

52
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:53,439
flood, coast lines and eco
refugees. We are facing the

53
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,579
worst species extinction since
the extinction of the dinosaurs.

54
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:01,319
We're dealing with fist fished
out oceans. These extreme

55
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,839
economic inequality and unstable
interlocked national economies

56
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,119
and weapons so powerful we dare
not use them. We are, in

57
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:18,059
essence, world on fire. We are
entering a time of planetary

58
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:25,519
emergency. Is up here a little
bit. There we go, of planetary

59
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,259
emergency, and it's happening
much faster than we ever thought

60
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,359
it would even 10 years ago.

61
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,240
Umar hot

62
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,600
egg, a British economist, wrote
an essay recently, we're not

63
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,140
going to make it to 2050 in
which he says, quote,

64
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,700
skyrocketing inflation, growing
shortages, runaway temperatures,

65
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,740
killing heat, failing harvest,
shattered systems, continents on

66
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,380
fire and masses turning to
lunacy, theocracy and fascism As

67
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,160
a result, this is the condition
we find ourselves in today. What

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,600
I'd like to do is offer a
perspective on these events that

69
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,620
comes from my psychedelic
experiences reported in my book,

70
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,600
LSD, in the mind of the
universe. So first, I'd like to

71
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,640
give a short overview, to give a
context for the visionary

72
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,920
experiences that I'm going to be
sharing with you today. I'm

73
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,480
going to be touching on my
psychedelic work and the book,

74
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,540
LSD in the mind of the universe,
but I'm not going to go into it

75
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,320
in great detail, except for that
portion of the Book having to do

76
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,900
with the birth of the future
human, and you'll get a sense of

77
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,580
it from my initial comments. And
if you'd like to invite me back

78
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,660
for another time, we can spend
the time going into the overview

79
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,080
of the book more deeply. Let's
begin.

80
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,799
Yeah, here we go.

81
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,180
Should have thrown that up
earlier. All right, here we go.

82
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,800
Now. My work derives from Stan
grofs work, and these two books

83
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,480
changed the course of my life. I
finished graduate school in 1978

84
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,340
and read realms of the human
unconscious at that time, and my

85
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:24,080
life pivoted. I did the work
that I eventually did as a

86
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,000
philosopher, not a psychologist,
not a therapist. I was primarily

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,660
trained in philosophy of
religion, and was interested in

88
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,760
the philosophical potential of
psychedelics to explore the deep

89
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,140
structure of consciousness, and
through that, the deep structure

90
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,640
of the universe itself. Now in
his work, Stan differentiates

91
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,140
clearly two different types of
working, psychedelic therapy,

92
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,000
low dose psyche lytic therapy
and high dose psychedelic

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,800
therapy. Psychedelic therapy, as
it was practiced at Spring Grove

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,320
Hospital in Baltimore was
restricted to three sessions.

95
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,220
Here they were working with
terminally ill cancer patients,

96
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,640
and the focus was to try to
trigger something which

97
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,080
approximated a near death
episode, to help them with death

98
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,500
anxiety. They weren't trying to
heal them. They were trying to

99
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,480
help them with with the anxiety
that arose, arises when it's one

100
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,680
is facing death. So I thought,
Well, okay, if you can do high

101
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,500
dose work three times, you can
do it more than three times. And

102
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,140
what I ended up doing was 73
high dose LSD sessions between

103
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:46,420
1979 and 1999 and now this is a
very aggressive protocol. It's

104
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,780
not one that I would recommend
today, knowing what I know

105
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,420
today, I would do it
differently, where I starting

106
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,640
over again, but that's just what
I did. I did this work as

107
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,100
systematically and rigorously as
I could. I followed the same

108
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,220
protocol, and this is a
therapeutic focus. I was always

109
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,380
lying down with eye shades, with
a sitter. I use the same

110
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,000
substance, the same dose level,
the same set and setting, same

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,780
sitter, same recording process,
even the same location. All of

112
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,160
these variables can influence
one's experiences in

113
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Non-ordinary states. So it was a
very stable position from which

114
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,480
to engage in the dialog with the
universe and communion with the

115
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,020
universe. I saw myself at the
time simply doing an extended

116
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,440
course of psychedelic therapy,
but when I got to the end of

117
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,940
this work and was looking back
over it as a whole, I realized

118
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,760
that there was something
different going on than was

119
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,000
described in the early
literature on psychedelic

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,500
therapy. This the protocol may
be the same, but when you

121
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,780
extend. The number of sessions,
as many as I did, it really

122
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,320
unfolds into different
challenges and gives you

123
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,120
different opportunities to
engage the universe. So I gave

124
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,520
my work a different name, and I
call it psychedelic exploration.

125
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,800
The protocol is psychedelic
therapy. All internalized

126
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,980
sessions, all working with
supportive music, so on, so

127
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,180
forth. The difference is the
number of sessions. In my case,

128
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,700
73 sessions. Now let me clarify
further. Just I think it's

129
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,840
important to differentiate,
especially since there are many

130
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,980
different uses of psychedelics,
let me just mention three of

131
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,640
them. The first is the
therapeutic the use of

132
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,940
psychedelics for therapeutic
healing, which is, of course,

133
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,840
our current focus in the
psychedelic Renaissance taking

134
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:59,260
place. Now. Second to that is
using psychedelics for spiritual

135
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,760
awakening, not quite the same as
therapeutic healing, but

136
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,660
somewhat different. And this is
actually why I initially got

137
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,500
into this work. Was to
accelerate what I thought of as

138
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,600
my individual spiritual
enlightenment, but the protocol

139
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,980
I adopted was so powerful that
it really took me beyond healing

140
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,940
and beyond spiritual awakening
into a process that I would

141
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,520
describe as cosmic, logical
exploration. I did this work to

142
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,020
explore the deep structure of
the cosmos itself. I did this

143
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,060
work as a philosopher. I
wouldn't do it the same way if I

144
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,240
were doing it again, and I do
not advise people to do what I

145
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,920
did. But I came through it. I
survived it reasonably intact.

146
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,780
And now I'd like to share some
of the results from this work. I

147
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,160
kept very careful, detailed
records of my sessions, always

148
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,600
within 24 hours of every
session. And I'd like to give a

149
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
little bit of context for the
visions that I'll be sharing.

150
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,040
When you do this work, you go
through a Death-Rebirth process

151
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,240
that everybody is familiar with.
The first one is, is ego death.

152
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,720
And this line here represents
the the horizontal line

153
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,480
represents the line between
physical matter and spiritual

154
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,020
reality are between ordinary
consciousness and Transpersonal

155
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:33,140
consciousness. And the open line
represents the vast expanse it

156
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,940
opens to us in Non-ordinary
states of consciousness, and the

157
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,040
drop at the bottom of the line
represents our individual egoic

158
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,280
awareness. And that first
circle, that red circle,

159
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,960
represents the Death-Rebirth
process that takes place in

160
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,100
psychedelic work, egoic death
and any spiritual practice where

161
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,720
one is transitioning one opens
one's consciousness beyond our

162
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,200
individual ego into the vast
expanse that lies beyond

163
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,600
individual awareness. Now Ego
Death catches most of the

164
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,860
attention in the literature
today, but what I found in my

165
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,920
work is that if you work
consistently with a very

166
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,740
powerful methodology like I did,
you go through not one death,

167
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,600
but many deaths. As one goes
deeper and deeper into the

168
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,040
universe, one comes to a series
of thresholds, a series of

169
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,360
gateways, where one must go
through yet another death in

170
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,860
order to enter into this deeper
level of existence. And it isn't

171
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,720
simply a repetition of ego
death. It's really different, a

172
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,560
different kind of death that
reflects the different levels of

173
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,780
reality. One is working at Stan.
Differentiation is writing

174
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,580
between psychic levels of
Transpersonal experience, subtle

175
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,760
levels and causal levels. And
I'm going to use that language.

176
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,940
I use that language in my book,
but I don't have any vested

177
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,560
interest in any particular
cosmology or cosmic logical

178
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,400
ladder. It's the principle that
is important that the universe

179
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,060
has many levels, and as one
enters into those levels

180
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,380
systematic, if you do it
systematically, there is a

181
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,840
gradual unfolding level by level
as one goes deeper into the

182
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,140
universe and into these states
of consciousness, at least,

183
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,920
that's how it manifested in my
work. It doesn't necessarily

184
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,100
have to be that way for
everybody, but that's the way it

185
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,600
manifested for me. Now, when I
got to the end of my work and

186
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,860
was beginning to crunch all of
my experiences and beginning to

187
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,700
prepare for the writing that I
did, on the basis of those

188
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,340
experiences, I differentiated
five fundamental levels or

189
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,720
categories of experience, or
levels of kind. Consciousness

190
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,240
that my work unfolded into. The
first was one's personal mind,

191
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,520
one's personal unconscious. The
second is the species mind, or

192
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,440
the collective unconscious. The
third is archetypal mind,

193
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,420
the fourth causal oneness

194
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,660
and the fifth diamond
Luminosity. And let me just very

195
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,520
quickly go through and place the
chapters of my book in that

196
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,000
context. Just to give you a
context for what we're talking

197
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,400
about, there's a chapter on
crossing the boundaries death,

198
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,640
which is basically telling the
story of crossing what Stan Grof

199
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,680
calls the perennial level of
consciousness. It 10 sessions

200
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,260
and two and a half years of work
on the species mind. There is a

201
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:02,160
chapter called the ocean of
suffering, and a chapter called

202
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,380
deep time in the soul. And it
took me a total of about four

203
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,060
years to get to this point in my
work, and at that point, I

204
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,660
stopped my work for six years
for reasons that I give in the

205
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,260
book, and I resumed it six years
later, and when I did the

206
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,100
purification part of my session,
which was the ocean of

207
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,660
suffering, began exactly where
it had stopped six years

208
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,620
previous. And I won't go into I
can't explain all of this in

209
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,640
detail, but the ocean of
suffering was opening up to vast

210
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,980
territories of collective pain
and anguish, which I first

211
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,580
thought of as a deepening of ego
death, but I later came to

212
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:50,740
understand that I was tapping
into or that something was

213
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,680
guiding in me, in my sessions,
to tap into the memories of our

214
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,600
collective suffering that our
species still stores in the

215
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,900
collective psyche, anything
which is not integrated at the

216
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,380
end of an individual life gets
stored at the level of the

217
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,280
collective psyche. And the
patient in this work had become

218
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,680
not just me, but the patient had
expanded to become, in some way,

219
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,840
the entire species of my family.
When I resumed my work after the

220
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,100
six year hiatus, the ocean of
suffering began exactly where it

221
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,300
had stopped, but in the ecstatic
portion of my sessions, I

222
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,380
entered a series of initiatory
experiences where I was taken by

223
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,260
the universe and given a series
of cosmic logical initiations.

224
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,820
It was like cosmology, 101,
teaching me how the universe is

225
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,080
organized and structured in
certain ways. Eventually, this

226
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,660
work came to a culmination. I
went through yet another death

227
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,940
and rebirth process and entered
what I came to call archetype of

228
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,500
mind, the greater real in the
chapter, the greater real,

229
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,840
archetypal reality. And here I
talk about the quasi platonic

230
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,100
level of archetypal
consciousness and the quasi Jung

231
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,660
Ian level. And I say quasi
platonic because it was it

232
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,120
affirmed Plato's core insight,
that there was a reality behind

233
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,040
the reality of time and space
which ordered time and space.

234
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,980
But I did not experience
archetypes the way Plato

235
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:37,400
experienced them. I did not
experience them as eternal ideas

236
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,960
in the mind of an unchanging
God, but I experienced them as

237
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,000
vast, living, dynamic, cosmic,
logical process, processes that

238
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,560
were so large I could not wrap
my mind around them. At the

239
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,800
quasi Jung Ian level, I
experienced repeatedly

240
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,740
dissolving into the species
mind, and I was given repeated

241
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,100
instructions on how the
collective unconscious, or how

242
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,660
the species mind functions as an
integrated whole, that all of

243
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,520
our individual minds are wired
into this vast collective mind,

244
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,560
and our individual psychological
issues and even our physical

245
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:27,800
diseases are part of the
psychological stresses and

246
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,380
strains and even the diseases of
our entire species, and that our

247
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,640
individual healing directly
contributes, both physically and

248
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,640
psychologically To the healing
of our species. Then this work

249
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,360
culminated, after 18 months,
into yet another death and

250
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,920
rebirth process which took me
into causal oneness, which I

251
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,900
describe in a chapter called a
benediction of blessings, where

252
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,500
I was given a year of extra
ordinary life. Blessings of

253
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,200
oneness, of non dual
consciousness, of Shunyata

254
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,080
dissolving into the meta cosmic
void, experiences of profound

255
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,740
cosmic love. It was truly
totally existentially life,

256
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:28,820
satisfying time. And then I
entered into the five years, the

257
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,780
last five years of my work, the
diamond Luminosity work,

258
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,060
described in the chapter the
diamond Luminosity here, I

259
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:44,740
entered beyond the collective
psyche beyond even the oneness

260
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:51,340
of existence into a super,
rarefied celestial domain of

261
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,320
exquisite diamond light. Now, I
had known light many times up to

262
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,720
this point, but this was a
higher order of light than I had

263
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,140
ever encountered before. All
right, I'll just stop there. And

264
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,500
and then I came into the final
piece of work, the final year of

265
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,540
work, the final vision, which
then led to the last chapter.

266
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,220
Whoop. Let me back up the last
chapter, chapter 12, coming off

267
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,740
the mountain. Now, you see, I've
skipped a chapter here, and

268
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,520
that's the chapter I really want
to focus on today, the birth of

269
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,460
the future human. I really wish
I had written this in a

270
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,980
different order. The order
should be a benediction of

271
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,300
blessings, and then the diamond
Luminosity, and then the birth

272
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,560
of the future human, followed by
the final vision. But, ah, well,

273
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:51,160
this is the order in which I
wrote it. In the birth of the I

274
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:57,820
summarize a series of visions,
experiences that I was given

275
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,500
over many years. In the work, I
kind of pulled them all out of

276
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,660
different sessions and
consolidated them into this

277
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,060
particular story, the birth of
the future human. All of those

278
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,260
sessions that are summarized in
this chapter actually began as

279
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,260
far back as the initiation into
the universe, material and so on

280
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,540
and so forth. But I really focus
them the story of her simplicity

281
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:34,160
in this particular chapter. So
what I'd like to do now is focus

282
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,660
on this theme of the birth of
the future human. And there are

283
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,040
three components, two of them
we're going to focus on today.

284
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,080
The first one is a series of
visions that I call vision of

285
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,580
awakening. It's a series of
visions that I was given between

286
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:58,420
1991 and 1994 so you can see how
long ago this was. This goes

287
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,960
back over 30 years, visions of
where humanity was in its

288
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,720
evolutionary development. This
was followed by a major session

289
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,500
that I call the Great Awakening
session, which took place in

290
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,440
1995 which was then later
followed by the final vision

291
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,680
that that occurred in the 70th
session, very near the end of my

292
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,140
20 year journey. So what I want
to focus on today is the visions

293
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,300
of awakening and the Great
Awakening. So first, the visions

294
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:47,680
paper over the course of my work
dropped into my session.

295
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,220
Scattered throughout my sessions
was a series of visions that

296
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,420
kept coming back to this theme
of human evolution. Kept

297
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,900
describing the city a situation
that humanity was entering and a

298
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,520
turning point that humanity was
coming to in its evolutionary

299
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,980
destiny. And I organized these
visions into a series of six

300
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,660
visions, which I give these
names, the visions of divine

301
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:23,840
love, all humanity, guiding
intelligence, our species as a

302
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,400
single being, collective
purification

303
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,220
and the future human.

304
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,620
So what I'd like to do is just
go back first and read you some

305
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,800
excerpts from these visions. And
I can talk about these visions,

306
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,240
but I think it might be maybe a
deeper way to transmit the

307
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,340
content of these experiences by
actually sort of sharing some of

308
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,960
the visionary material
themselves. And I invite you to

309
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,380
enter into a receptive state.
State, you're welcome to close

310
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,120
your eyes, a receptive state
where you can hear what I'm

311
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,720
going to be sharing with you
from a deeper than simply

312
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,940
rational place in your
consciousness. Now I should tell

313
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,660
you that my sense is what I'm
doing with you is reminding you

314
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,740
of something that you already
know. What's it's not important

315
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,060
that I had these visions. If
these are significant, it's

316
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,320
because of what they tell us
about humanity and what they

317
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,400
tell us about all of us and all
of the work that we are doing as

318
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:47,080
we incarnate in this generation.
So first divine love in this

319
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,640
session, which dates back to
1991 I was taken back to the

320
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,080
beginning of creation and their
experienced evolution in the

321
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,440
context of a larger cosmic
agenda. Suddenly, I was

322
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,580
overwhelmed by the most
extraordinary cosmic love, a

323
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,860
love unlike anything I had ever
known. To awaken to this love

324
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,320
was to remember a primordial
decision that I had somehow

325
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,040
participated in. In fact, I came
to understand that all of us had

326
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,140
voluntarily chosen to be part of
the evolutionary process of

327
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:33,440
creation in response to this
divine love, I then experienced

328
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:38,180
all the suffering that humanity
had endured throughout history

329
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,740
as taking place inside this
love, I realized that all the

330
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:51,400
suffering inherent in evolution
was noble beyond words, it was

331
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,500
all part of a cosmic plan that
we had entered into voluntarily

332
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,820
along the Way, and even we had
entered into freely, however

333
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,820
unconscious of this fact we had
become along the way, nobility

334
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,340
of great suffering, voluntarily
shouldered in the name of Divine

335
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,120
Love, suffering that would
stretch across millions of

336
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,340
years, suffering that would
become so inscrutable that it

337
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,760
would be used as evidence that
the universe was devoid of

338
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,280
compassion. This was the
nobility of humanity's gift to

339
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,140
the creative intelligence of the
universe. All of the suffering

340
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,380
that humanity had endured and
will endure in the decades

341
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,660
ahead, you're part of a
conscious

342
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,780
there are no victims here.

343
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:59,980
Second theme of all humanity,
the quote from the session,

344
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,600
the great difficulty I have is
describing the enormity of what

345
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,240
is being birthed. The true focus
of this creative process is not

346
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,180
individuals, but all humanity.
It is actually trying to awaken

347
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,720
the entire species out of the
seething desires of history, out

348
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,160
of the violent conflicts and
scheming of individuals and

349
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,200
nations, there was now driving
forward a new awareness in human

350
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,060
consciousness. Its birth in us
is no less difficult or violent

351
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,760
than the birth of a new
continent. It drives upward from

352
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,260
the floor of our being,
requiring a transposition of

353
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,520
everything that has gone before
in order to make room for its

354
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:57,820
new organizational patterns.
What is emerging in history is a

355
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,420
consciousness of unprecedented
proportions, the entire human

356
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:09,780
family, integrated in a unified
field of awareness, the species

357
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:15,180
reconnected with its fundamental
nature. Our thoughts tuned to

358
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:20,540
Source consciousness. The scale
of what I was witnessing took my

359
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:33,440
breath away. The third set of
visions. I saw humanity climbing

360
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,580
out of a steep valley, and just
ahead on the other side of the

361
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,280
mountain was a brilliant, sun
drenched world that was about to

362
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,860
break over us. The timeframe was
enormous, and I should mention,

363
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,400
perhaps it should have mentioned
sooner that time became very

364
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,300
porous in my work. First time
opened up in terms of my

365
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,900
personal life, but then time
opened up in terms of our

366
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,000
species life. I. Planetary life
and the life of the cosmos

367
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,160
itself. So I was regularly taken
into vast, trans temporal

368
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:15,180
landscapes. After millions of
years of struggle and ascent, we

369
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,140
were poised on the brink of a
sunrise that would forever

370
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,260
change the condition of life on
this planet, all current

371
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,340
structures would quickly become
irrelevant. All truths would

372
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,620
quickly be rendered passe.
Truly, a new epoch was dawning.

373
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,660
The lives of everyone living in
this pivotal time in history

374
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,840
were helping to bring this
global shift about as I

375
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,500
witnessed this scene, I saw
that, though we did not know the

376
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,660
deep future at a personal level,
there was a more encompassing

377
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,760
level of consciousness that
could see it very Clearly. This

378
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,320
was a deeply moving and
clarifying experience,

379
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,540
individually, we humans could
not see what was coming, and so

380
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,700
did not understand why things
are the way they are, yet

381
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,080
isolated from the future the
present makes absolutely no

382
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,320
sense to be ignorant of what is
being built would be to be

383
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,380
fundamentally blind, and our
species is not blind. There is

384
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:33,380
an intelligence in it, preparing
us, guiding us, an intelligence

385
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,220
that knows the future and is
preparing us for it as

386
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,740
systematically as we prepare our
homes for the changes of

387
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:56,440
seasons, next our species, as a
single being, I was taken deeper

388
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,720
into the unified field of
existence and experienced the

389
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,120
dynamics of humanity's awakening
as movements being initiated and

390
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,640
orchestrated by a single
integrating intelligence. I

391
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,200
experienced the evolution of our
species at the systematic growth

392
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,380
of a single organism, a unified
being that all of us were part

393
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,200
of the subtlety of the
cooperation of the parts with

394
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,240
the whole was extra ordinary to
experience the incredible

395
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,820
diversity of our species as a
single unified field made many

396
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:43,660
events clear. New patterns
sprang into view, and the

397
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:49,540
patterns made transparent sense.
Nothing in our theological or

398
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:55,780
philosophical systems does
justice to the facts. What I

399
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,100
then saw was that the unified
field of humanity was moving

400
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,460
decisively and precipitously to
become more aware of itself.

401
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:11,700
Whereas previously it had
existed in an essence, in as an

402
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,340
extended fabric, largely
unconscious of itself. Now it

403
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:23,240
was waking itself up visually.
This took the form of energy

404
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,800
coming together in Swift,
contractive spasms that created

405
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,320
bright flashes of awareness. I
repeatedly saw extended webs of

406
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:40,040
energy suddenly contract and
explode in brilliant flashes. In

407
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,960
the past, these flashes had been
swallowed by the inertia of the

408
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,880
collective psyche and had not
endured now, however, the

409
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,840
flashes were beginning to hold
their own and to connect with

410
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,820
each other, with other flashes
occurring around the planet.

411
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,160
The visions address collective
purification, which I think is a

412
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:13,560
particularly important concept
in order to understand what's

413
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:21,200
happening in history, in this
century, when an organism is

414
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,240
called on from within to become
more conscious, it must first

415
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,140
cleanse itself of the
psychological byproducts of

416
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,820
living at its lower level of
awareness. It was bring forward

417
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,600
the residue of its past and
purge that residue from its

418
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,420
system in order to lay the
foundation for a more refined

419
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:49,000
level of operation. Our system,
our species, was doing this in a

420
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,980
wholesale manner and with great
determination, by crystallizing

421
00:34:53,980 --> 00:35:00,480
within itself generations that
embodied our toxic legacy. It

422
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,220
was the coordinated exercise of
the self evolution of the

423
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,600
species as a whole. The poisons
of humanity's past were being

424
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,680
brought to the surface in us,
and by transforming these

425
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,800
poisons in our individual lives,
we were making it possible for

426
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,660
divine awareness to enter more
deeply into future generations.

427
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,660
We had volunteered for this role
for both our personal good and

428
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,820
the collective good. I saw that
this century formed a watershed

429
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,580
into which the karmic streams of
history were flowing, and that

430
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,080
as the process came to fruition,
the future condition of our

431
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,480
species would be beyond anything
that we might project from our

432
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,960
current state of fragmentation.
The present form of humanity is

433
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,560
transitional. As Sri Aurobindo
said, we are cells in a super

434
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,400
organism intent on rapid change
our very constitution, the form

435
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,860
of our species is a stage in a
larger evolutionary journey.

436
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:29,240
Lastly, the future human. At one
point, I was given a brief

437
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,040
experience of the future human
we are becoming. I was carried

438
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,720
deep into the distant future and
allowed to experience what will

439
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,400
be the abiding state of humanity
at that time, what a magnificent

440
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:52,120
being. Just touching it filled
me with rapture, calm and sheer

441
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:59,320
delight. It felt clear, warm and
whole. There was an abiding

442
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,480
sense of oneness that was deeper
than just the feeling of being

443
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,240
interconnected. It was a feeling
of being truly one underneath

444
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,600
the diversity of life, such
expansiveness, such breath of

445
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,760
being. It was spiritually
embodied realization, the

446
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,940
tantric awakening of our entire
species, spirit and matter in

447
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,740
perfect balance. This
penetrating glimpse transfixed

448
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:41,200
me. Its beauty, grandeur and
simplicity pierced my heart, the

449
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,940
net result of all of these
experiences was to give me a

450
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,860
deep understanding of the
challenge that humanity was

451
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,400
entering, the challenging period
of history that we were ending,

452
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,240
and what was going on underneath
the surface of historical

453
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,140
events. And it focused me on the
question, how can the entire

454
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,220
species be awakened, as I've
seen, what would it actually

455
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:13,080
take for the whole of humanity
to make this quantum jump in

456
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,720
awareness? I had been shown over
and over again in many different

457
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,880
forms, that this was the project
of history at this point, but

458
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,420
nowhere was I shown how it would
be accomplished.

459
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,900
At this point,

460
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,300
I entered into the diamond
Luminosity work, where about

461
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,980
once a year, once every five
sessions or so, I entered into a

462
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,220
deep state of mystical
absorption into the crystalline

463
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:49,780
body of the Divine. I had
entered into two such

464
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,420
experiences in the 40th and 45th
sessions, and I was expecting in

465
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,960
the next session, the 55th
session, to enter into the

466
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,420
diamond Luminosity. Again,
instead, that's that's not what

467
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:10,860
happened. Instead, in 1995 as my
family and I were preparing for

468
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:17,280
the Christmas holidays, I had
experience of in a session in

469
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:23,780
that I came to call the Great
Awakening session. I experienced

470
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:28,160
what I'm going to describe, not
as an individual, but as the

471
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,840
entire species. I had been
dissolved into the collective

472
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,280
unconscious so many times and at
so many different levels, and

473
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,320
all of that seemed to be
preparation for what unfolded

474
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,280
itself in this session. This
session was so deep and so

475
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,080
challenging and so difficult to
navigate that it really took

476
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,720
years for me to assimilate it
fully into my life.

477
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,920
I was dissolved.

478
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,960
Into the collective psyche, and
I experienced what humanity as a

479
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,660
whole would experience in the
decades ahead. So let me share

480
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,220
with you the core scenario
pulled out of this visionary

481
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:21,920
experience in a field of
relative calm, a small anxiety

482
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,600
began to grow. Slowly, people
were looking up and becoming

483
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:31,700
alarmed. Humanity was gradually
waking up in alarm to events

484
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,020
that had overtaken it.
Conditions got worse and worse.

485
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,280
People became more and more
frightened as the danger

486
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,500
increased, forcing them to let
go of their assumptions. At

487
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:50,140
deeper and deeper levels, there
was less and less people for

488
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,280
people to hold on to, fewer
Givens that they could assume,

489
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,020
how they would live, where they
would live, what they would do

490
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,300
for a living, how society was
organized, what could be

491
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,460
possessed. The world as they
knew it was falling away.

492
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,680
Decades were compressed into
minutes, and I felt the people's

493
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,140
fear deepen as they had more, as
they lost more and more of what

494
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:23,360
they had considered the normal
and necessary structures of

495
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,340
their world, step by step,
events were forcing a rapid

496
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:33,380
reassessment of everything in
their lives. The events that had

497
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,580
overtaken earth were of such
scope that no one could insulate

498
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,820
themselves from them. The level
of alarm grew in the species

499
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,960
field, until eventually,
everyone was forced into the

500
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,240
melting pot of mere survival. We
were all in this together.

501
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,620
Families were torn apart,
parents from children, their

502
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,960
children and children from each
other. Life as we had known, it

503
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,940
was shattered at the core. We
were reduced to simply trying to

504
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:11,940
survive. For a time, it looked
as though we would all be

505
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,700
killed. But just when the storm
was at its peak, the worst of it

506
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:23,300
passed, and the danger slowly
subsided. Though many had died,

507
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,880
many were still alive. As the
survivors began to find each

508
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,220
other, new social units began to
form. Parents and children from

509
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,700
different families joined to
form new types of families

510
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,340
everywhere, new social
institutions sprang into being

511
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,580
that reflected our new reality,
new ways of thinking, new values

512
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,240
that we had discovered within
ourselves during the crisis.

513
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,820
Every aspect of our lives was
marked by new priorities, new

514
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:03,360
perceptions of the good, new
truths these new social forms

515
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,380
reflected new states of
awareness that seemed to spread

516
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,420
through the survivors like a
positive contagion. These new

517
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:17,400
social forms then fed back into
the system to elicit still newer

518
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,720
sites, states of awareness in
people and the cycle of

519
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,600
creativity between the
individual and the group

520
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:30,500
spiraled the entire system was
becoming alive at new levels,

521
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,280
and this aliveness was
expressing itself in previously

522
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:39,080
impossible ways. It was as if
the Eco crisis had triggered the

523
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,200
myelinization of nerve cells in
our species brain, allowing new

524
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,800
and deeper levels of self
awareness to spring into being

525
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,200
repeatedly. There was the
message, these things will

526
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,820
happen faster than anyone can
anticipate because of the hyper

527
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:03,600
arousal of the species mind,
1000s of fractal images drove

528
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,460
this lesson home again and again
faster than anyone can

529
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:13,920
anticipate. The pace of the past
was irrelevant to the pace of

530
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,700
the future and

531
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:31,076
my visions did not give me any
details about how or when this

532
00:44:31,076 --> 00:44:35,516
would take place, except that we
were entering a profound global

533
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:40,496
systems crisis that was being
triggered by a series of of

534
00:44:40,796 --> 00:44:45,580
ecological crises around the
planet, and this was of a scale

535
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,560
and a magnitude that was
historically unprecedented. I

536
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,420
was also shown many teachings
that I won't go into now, but

537
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,920
are in dark net, early dawn, and
in LSD, in the mind of the.

538
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,840
Universe. That point that showed
me, gave me insights into the

539
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,620
dynamics of the collective
psyche, that basically, the

540
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:15,180
suffering that we were entering
into was so widespread and so

541
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,980
profound that it would impact
not just individuals, but it

542
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,180
would actually reach through the
lives of the individuals to

543
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,960
impact the collective
unconscious itself, and it would

544
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,700
drive the collective psyche into
what a scientist might call non

545
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,840
linear conditions. And just as
physical systems, when they are

546
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,020
driven into non linear
conditions, can do remarkable

547
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,420
things, seemingly impossible
things. Likewise, the human

548
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,140
psyche, the collective psyche,
when driven into non linear

549
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:52,540
conditions, hyper aroused by the
suffering of its people. In that

550
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,580
condition, it was capable of
doing previously impossible

551
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:02,700
things. In this respect, the
suffering that we are entering

552
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,840
into, and it's certainly not
punishment, and it's not a sign

553
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,400
of failure, but it's actually
instrumental in helping us let

554
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,160
go of the past and let go of our
narrow, petty, egoic history and

555
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,960
enter into A deeper communion
with the creative process of the

556
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:34,520
universe. Now this brings me to
the next question of, what form

557
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,720
will the future human take?
Because I think we are going

558
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,120
through a transformation which
is so deep, it's not simply a

559
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,960
civilizational turning point,
and it's not simply a

560
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,440
destruction and rebirth of our
economy and our industrial

561
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,520
culture to a greener planet and
a greener culture and a greener

562
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,680
body politic. It is a
transformation which is actually

563
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,300
reaching deep into the
fundamental substructure of the

564
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,140
human psyche. The crisis we are
entering is a crisis of

565
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,560
consciousness. In that respect,
it's an evolutionary

566
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,000
consciousness, because we can no
longer afford the luxury of a

567
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,360
planet which is being run by
egos with this sense of separate

568
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,680
private our separate private
existences, even well

569
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:34,040
intentioned egos, we need to
grow into a deeper, more mature

570
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,380
sense of self for this planet,
in my Understanding, my context

571
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:44,920
for understanding the future
human is reincarnation. Now, my

572
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,120
first book life cycles was about
reincarnation. I considered an

573
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,920
absolutely fundamental concept,
and I think it's a concept which

574
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,320
we have ample empirical evidence
to document. I think that the

575
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:04,260
issue of reincarnation has, over
the last 50 years, moved from a

576
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:10,080
speculative theological table to
an empirical psychological

577
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,580
table. I think Ian Stevenson and
other researchers have given us

578
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,360
a vast quantity of evidence that
should convince any clear

579
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,640
thinking, critical person that
reincarnation is a fact of life.

580
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,260
But in the course of my
sessions, I was given an

581
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:32,180
understanding of reincarnation
that seemed to go beyond the way

582
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,440
that idea is presented in the
Eastern and even Western

583
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,280
mystical traditions,
classically, reincarnation is

584
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,080
presented as a an individual
form of individual evolution,

585
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,500
where we make choices, we
inherit the consequences of

586
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,100
those choices. We grow
incrementally, step by step,

587
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:59,440
becoming more compassionate,
more respectful, more

588
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,900
intelligent over long, long
periods and 1000s of lifetimes,

589
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:08,160
but eventually mature into a
spiritual awakening. We come

590
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,280
into a spiritual awakening where
we make contact with we resume a

591
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,900
deep experience of our inner,
divine nature, and at that

592
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,240
point, we can leave time and
space. The Hindu term for this

593
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,460
experience was moksha, escape,
escape, not only from ego, but

594
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:34,220
escape from time and space
itself. In Buddhism, Nirvana is

595
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:39,080
followed at death by the deeper
state of pari Nirvana, final

596
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:45,100
Nirvana, which is carrying on
beyond a type of enlightenment

597
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,420
that goes beyond physical
existence. All of the cosmology

598
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:55,720
of the last 5000 years, and both
Western and Eastern traditions,

599
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,740
have been basically what I would
call up and out cosmology, the

600
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,660
goal. Goal is to achieve some
type of fundamental transition,

601
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:08,400
either salvation or
enlightenment, so that when you

602
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,080
die, you can leave time and
space behind. But that leaves,

603
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,860
of course, unanswered the
question, what is the purpose of

604
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,260
space and time to begin with?
What does creative intelligence,

605
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:26,000
when, before the creative
intelligence manifested space

606
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,160
and time. What? What was it
thinking? Why did it do so? What

607
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:38,360
is the purpose of space, time
itself, the understanding of

608
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,100
reincarnation and the experience
of reincarnation that developed

609
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:47,920
in my sessions basically
outlined a different trajectory.

610
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,740
There was one particular session
where and I had done, I had done

611
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,560
past life therapy, and I was
familiar with the number of my

612
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,040
previous lives, and I had worked
in healing them, and I had

613
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,380
written life cycles 20 years
before, but I came into a

614
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:09,240
session where suddenly all my
former lives began to come into

615
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,360
me and to begin to wrap
themselves around me. It was

616
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,380
like wrapping a filament of
white light around a kite spool,

617
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:23,780
until eventually all of those
lives fused into one, and when

618
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:29,060
they fused into one, a brilliant
diamond light exploded from my

619
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,740
chest, and I was catapulted into
a state of consciousness far

620
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,580
beyond anything that I had ever
experienced before. Up to that

621
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:43,720
time, I was both an individual,
but I was an individual within a

622
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,740
frame of within a context and a
frame of consciousness beyond

623
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:52,300
anything that I had ever known
previously. And I came to call

624
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:57,280
this the birth of the diamond
soul. And I think this is the

625
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,680
fundamental trajectory of human
evolution that we have been

626
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,480
incarnating for 1000s and 1000s
and hundreds of 1000s of years.

627
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,460
We and in this evolutionary
process, we have been growing

628
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,840
and growing and growing, and we
are coming to a point where the

629
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:21,140
next step in our evolutionary
development is not simply taking

630
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:26,360
one more evolutionary step in
this long evolutionary

631
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:32,540
progression. But actually is a a
fusion, a coming into an

632
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:36,800
integrating, first healing and
then integrating all of our

633
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,500
former lives into a single
consciousness, a consciousness

634
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,820
that we can call the soul, the
consciousness. I think we return

635
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,960
to soul consciousness after we
die, after incarnation, we

636
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,500
expand into the soul. We
contract into egoic awareness.

637
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,460
We expand into the soul. We
contract. And if we keep this up

638
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,460
over and over again, 1000s and
1000s of years, eventually,

639
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:07,680
sooner or later, the soul, the
large consciousness that holds

640
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:14,820
all of our experience, awakens
inside time and space. And when

641
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:20,660
the soul awakens inside time and
space, heaven is born on earth,

642
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,120
and there is no felt need to go
elsewhere. I think all of the up

643
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,540
and out cosmiclogies are
basically incomplete.

644
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,520
Cosmiclogies That made sense in
the time in the context in which

645
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:39,560
they were born, but I think they
are an incomplete vision of what

646
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,800
the project of existence is

647
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:50,620
young souls become old souls.
Old Souls eventually become

648
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,120
complete souls, and that's what
I think of as the birth of the

649
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,260
diamond soul. Now many people
have had these visions. They

650
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,520
have had this understanding.
They use different words to

651
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:07,980
describe it. Some people talk
about Homo noeticus, homo

652
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,840
luminous, homo spiritualis. But
there are so many people who

653
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,760
have this deep intuition that we
are on the cusp of a major

654
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,300
transition in the human story.
And I think this transition is

655
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:29,360
literally the birth of the
diamond soul inside history. And

656
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,840
this is taking place not just
for individuals, not just with

657
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:38,540
individuals, but it's taking
place for the entire species. We

658
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,760
are in the process of giving
birth to a new species on this

659
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,200
planet, and the nature of this
species is implicit in the

660
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:55,000
history that we have, that we
bring to this event in order to

661
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:00,060
solve the crisis that we are
entering into in history, we. We

662
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:05,580
desperately need to grow up as a
species. In this context, from a

663
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,600
reincarnational perspective,
growing up means owning and

664
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,420
integrating the larger
consciousness that has been

665
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,520
gestating within us for 1000s of
years, owning it, seeing the

666
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,440
world through its eyes, and
letting its accumulated wisdom

667
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:27,260
shape our choices. The soul
lives in history differently

668
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:32,480
than the ego. The soul knows
that its relationship with this

669
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,820
planet extends beyond the limits
of its present life. It knows

670
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,800
that the earth we leave behind
is that the is the earth we will

671
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:47,500
inherit in our next incarnation.
It knows this, and it acts

672
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:53,560
accordingly. So to summarize,
the core vision that came

673
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:59,380
through my sessions, humanity, I
think, is coming into a time of

674
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,380
profound transformation, a time
of planetary compression and

675
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,720
accelerated development, a deep
shift in the collective

676
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:14,640
unconsciousness of our species
is taking place, a shift in the

677
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,780
archetypal blueprint of
humanity, a shift that's taking

678
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:23,360
place Literally, kind of in the
it's a plate tectonic shift in

679
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:29,720
the collective psyche. And one
way of describing this is a it

680
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:35,240
is a profound awakening into the
truth of oneness, but not an

681
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,080
awakening that dissolves the
individual, but awakening that

682
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,180
liberates the individual into a
deeper and higher sense of

683
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:48,760
participation in not only the
human community, but also into

684
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,800
the Celestial community. For
there to be a great awakening

685
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,580
like this, there must first take
place a great death, and this

686
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,100
death is all about purification.
It's all about letting go,

687
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,480
healing and letting go of all
the terrible things that we've

688
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,780
done to each other, for all the
attitudes that have divided

689
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:15,840
oneness, and all the the hatreds
and the animosities and the

690
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:22,100
racism and the genderism and the
speciesism that has clouded the

691
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:27,080
earlier stages of human
evolution. We must surrender our

692
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:32,120
smallness, the ego's constant
self, cherishing with all of its

693
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:39,020
divisions between people, races,
religions, classes, nations and

694
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:45,220
even species, I believe we are
entering the dark, a dark night

695
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:51,040
of our collective soul, a time
of emptying, a time of intense

696
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,540
anguish, of progressive loss of
control and systematic

697
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:01,620
breakdown, a Time of global
purification unto death that

698
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:07,320
will last generations. But
through this hard labor, we will

699
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:12,720
give birth to something extra
ordinary, more than just a new

700
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,000
civilization. What is emerging
is nothing less than a new order

701
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:23,000
of human being through the
global systems crisis, our

702
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,740
planet is giving birth to the
future human, a higher form of

703
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:33,380
humanity, the diamond soul, is
being born in history, and we

704
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:40,360
are All part of this
transformation. Thank you very

705
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:40,840
much.

706
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:55,540
Yeah, okay, I'll stop this year
now. Yeah, wow,

707
00:58:57,219 --> 00:59:00,179
Unknown: that was amazing,
Chris, thank you so much. I

708
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:04,919
mean, I personally know the
truth of what you're saying from

709
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:09,539
my own intuitions and my own
brief experiences. Yeah, well,

710
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:14,699
thank you so much. So let's open
it up. Let's take a take a

711
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:18,419
minute to breathe, I guess, and
then let's open it to questions

712
00:59:18,419 --> 00:59:19,619
and conversation. Yeah,

713
00:59:25,856 --> 00:59:29,696
and if you'd like to start just
unmute and speak,

714
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:35,216
Chris Bache: yeah, I really do
see myself just reminding you of

715
00:59:35,216 --> 00:59:39,236
things you already know, things
you knew before you incarnated.

716
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:43,600
My sense is that everybody
chooses, every one of us has

717
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:49,360
chosen to incarnate voluntarily,
that we chose the incarnation

718
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,020
that we are now in knowing
beforehand what we are getting

719
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:58,360
into. We may have forgotten once
we incarnate, but we knew before

720
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,860
we were born, and we will
remember. When we die, it's that

721
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:07,740
we are all carefully placed in
order to participate in this

722
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,240
collective transformation.

723
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:19,859
Beautiful, Chris, this whoops.

724
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,799
Jonai: This is Janae, and I this
is absolutely beautiful. And I

725
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:30,499
kept thinking all the way
through, what do I do with what

726
01:00:30,499 --> 01:00:36,259
I just learned in terms of
science and the new DNA testing

727
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:40,599
that's been done, epigenetics,
the fact that we have the same

728
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:52,839
genome as the what's called
inadequate and anatomically

729
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:59,979
modern humans back in the
200,000 period time and What,

730
01:00:59,979 --> 01:01:05,639
and what I'm coming to is that
this is all. This is all when it

731
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:08,819
when it actually comes out. I
mean, most people don't even

732
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:11,819
know about it yet, but when it
actually comes out, it's

733
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:15,359
preparing us. It's preparing
it's giving us what we have

734
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:19,139
right now, and it's giving us
the opportunity to move on from

735
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:22,999
there. That's kind of the way I
look at it. And I the one thing

736
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:25,579
I kept thinking all the way
through, how long is this going

737
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:28,759
to take? And you answered it in
the end, it's going to go

738
01:01:28,759 --> 01:01:33,379
through several generations, or
maybe many generations. But this

739
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:39,019
is where we this is where we
jump off and fly and move.

740
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:43,839
Chris Bache: And, you know, I
don't have any visionary

741
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:48,159
experience of how long or the
how or the details I wasn't

742
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,359
given that kind of detail. So
for that, I have to go to the

743
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:55,959
experts like everybody else. I
have to go to the scientists who

744
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:59,619
are really plotting the
escalating climate crisis that

745
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:03,659
we are entering in the social
sciences who are looking at the

746
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:07,259
broader social and political
ramifications of these crises.

747
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:14,339
But my sense is that the 21st
Century is pivotal. I mean by by

748
01:02:14,459 --> 01:02:21,679
2020, by 2050, well, first, let
me recommend, and you notice

749
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:24,859
that I haven't talked about,
what can we do? How do we

750
01:02:24,859 --> 01:02:27,799
respond to this crisis? How do
we participate in it? And we can

751
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:30,199
talk about that. But one of the
people who has thought

752
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:34,579
extensively about this and
written about it beautifully is

753
01:02:34,579 --> 01:02:38,539
Dwayne Elgin, and his latest
book, his most recent book is

754
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:43,899
his book choosing Earth, and
he's a social activist. He's an

755
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:49,179
evolutionary thinker and a
futurist, and his wife has

756
01:02:49,179 --> 01:02:54,099
created a film based on the book
called facing adversity,

757
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:58,239
choosing Earth. And it's both.
He's Dwayne is giving away the

758
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:01,619
book and his wife is giving away
the film. You can find, you can

759
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:04,739
get a PDF from Amazon on the
book, and you can find the film

760
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:12,419
online in the in the book Dwayne
outlines what science is say,

761
01:03:12,419 --> 01:03:17,159
telling us about the next five
decades, you know, and each of

762
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:21,499
those decades, the crisis
deepens precipitously, and we

763
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:27,619
are now in the decade of the the
great on the falling the falling

764
01:03:27,619 --> 01:03:32,059
apart, beginning of a sense of
falling apart. Institutional

765
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:35,899
value systems are falling apart.
This will continue to accelerate

766
01:03:36,259 --> 01:03:40,099
into the great unraveling. I'm
sorry. Let me back the great

767
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:44,019
unraveling followed by the
falling apart, followed by the

768
01:03:44,259 --> 01:03:52,659
deep crash. By the time we get
to 2050 we're going to be

769
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:57,639
looking at a deeply, profoundly
different world than we are now.

770
01:03:57,939 --> 01:04:04,499
And so my sense is that this
this crisis of near extinction.

771
01:04:04,499 --> 01:04:07,859
And because we are looking at,
you know, when you really look

772
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:10,619
at the people who are looking at
the numbers and how many

773
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:14,399
billions of human beings are
going to likely to be dying as

774
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:18,719
we run into shortfall of
harvest, and so on and so forth,

775
01:04:19,379 --> 01:04:23,119
we are looking at a near
extinction event, and extinction

776
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:28,579
is a tremendous accelerator of
evolution. So my sense is, if we

777
01:04:28,579 --> 01:04:32,239
don't make it this transition in
this century or close to this

778
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:37,099
century, we very well might not
make it at all. So I do expect

779
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:40,779
it to take several generations,
but I do expect the 21st Century

780
01:04:40,779 --> 01:04:43,719
to be focal in this transition.

781
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:46,299
Thank you.

782
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:51,039
Thank you. Jean, I see that you
have your hand up.

783
01:04:55,119 --> 01:05:00,091
You're on mute. Jean, i. Me

784
01:05:07,712 --> 01:05:10,532
Jean Fox: there. Sorry about
that. There you go. Yeah, I

785
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:15,452
mentioned in the chat that in
2007 I met a Chandler who who

786
01:05:15,452 --> 01:05:23,660
wrote about this and in a lot of
detail, and he gives it, gives

787
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,460
all, gives it for free. We'll
share his information for free.

788
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:35,060
It's not for profit, but it's
just that it's, it's nature

789
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:41,260
cleansing itself in preparing us
for the next step. And we're all

790
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:47,920
we're always stuck in our minds,
but what we need to do is be

791
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:52,180
present with each other, says
the in the who's ever going to

792
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,380
be left through all these
processes? We just have to show

793
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:02,040
up for each other and solve the
problems and moment by moment,

794
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:08,580
because all we have is each
moment. And if we're stuck in

795
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:13,920
our minds and isolating from
each other, in our houses, in

796
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,880
our jobs, we're not going to be
there to support each other.

797
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,620
Look what's happened in Kentucky
or any of these places where

798
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:25,820
there's a disaster, we're in the
middle of a disaster. In the

799
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:30,920
disaster isn't it's not time for
planning, it's time for doing.

800
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:38,000
So we have to really just, when
somebody needs something, do it

801
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,080
for them. Help what, whatever we
can do to help each other,

802
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:46,240
because it's hard, yeah, yeah.

803
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,280
Chris Bache: We have to become
the human being that the world

804
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,900
needs right now, both on an
internal level, we have to face

805
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:00,300
our shadow. We have to heal our
shadow. We have to become more

806
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:04,200
whole within our souls, but also
on a political level, on a

807
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:09,840
social level, I think there's a
synergy between the world is

808
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:14,820
trying to become one, to grow
past the nation status, the

809
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:19,260
nation state idea, it's trying
to become one. And there's a

810
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:24,260
synergy between our in our soul
is trying to become one. We

811
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:28,580
carry the history of humanity
inside us, as well as our

812
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:32,600
society carrying it outside of
us. So as the world is trying to

813
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,960
become one, we are trying to
become one. There's a

814
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:41,680
synergistic dance between inner
and outer here, and so this are

815
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,640
stepping into this means
stepping into it, and each of us

816
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,820
has a little bit of a different
way of stepping into it, because

817
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:52,180
we all carry a different karmic
agenda. We all undertook

818
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:55,960
different responsibilities as we
incarnated. There is both an

819
01:07:56,020 --> 01:08:00,040
internal and an external, a
psychological and a social

820
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,120
dimension to this
transformational process.

821
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:08,580
Jean Fox: And we are. We are the
Earth. Yeah, of the Earth, we're

822
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:15,720
so we're tending, tending our
gardens. And this other channel

823
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,660
that I was talking about. His
name is John tettmer, says we're

824
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:23,120
going back to an agrarian
society, whatever, whatever

825
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:28,580
humanity is left to be one with
the earth, to be work in harmony

826
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:38,540
with the earth, and evolve again
from there in A equal, symbiotic

827
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,500
Yeah, instead of raping.

828
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,720
Chris Bache: And in that
context, let me just mention

829
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,440
that some people have asked me,
Why do you focus on human beings

830
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:54,100
so much and don't talk about
experiences of other species?

831
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,400
And of course, many people who
work with psychedelics in a

832
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:01,620
shamanic kind of context of many
experiences of with other

833
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:07,140
species, and that I've had a few
of those experience. But the

834
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:10,440
main track for me has been
working with the humans, the

835
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:14,820
collective human psyche. And I
think this is because humanity

836
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:18,660
is the greatest threat to life
on this planet right now. And if

837
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:22,580
we can heal the human species,
then all the other species on

838
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:28,040
the planet will be safe. And
it's not that I don't respect I

839
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,340
don't think they're inferior to
human beings or so on so forth.

840
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,180
They absolutely are just as
precious as human beings are.

841
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:41,980
But in order to ensure their
well being, we have to heal

842
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:42,700
humanity.

843
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,960
Jonai: We're the ones that are
destroying them. Yes,

844
01:09:48,219 --> 01:09:50,079
Chris Bache: they were here
first. Yeah.

845
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,260
Unknown: So Regina, you have
your hand up,

846
01:09:53,800 --> 01:10:00,420
Regina: yes. Thank you so much.
I wanted to know how you. Do it

847
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:06,420
differently, that you would do
it differently. Now I'm just

848
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,260
curious.

849
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:18,240
Chris Bache: I would vary the
dose level. I would work with

850
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,980
high doses sometimes, but low
doses at other times, I would

851
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:30,260
also balance LSD with other
psychedelics like Psilocybin or

852
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,740
Ayahuasca. Each of those
psychedelics, all of them, have

853
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:38,480
in common the amplifying effect
of amplifying the sensitivity of

854
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,400
consciousness, but they do so in
slightly different ways, they

855
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,940
kind of bring out different
aspects of the spectrum of

856
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:50,500
consciousness. So that LSD tends
to sort of drive towards the

857
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:56,500
high cosmic logic ceiling.
Psilocybin tends to sort of be

858
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:00,220
work closer to the emotional
body, closer to the physical

859
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:04,080
body. Ayahuasca tends to do that
as well and bridge a little bit

860
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:10,080
step farther and deeper out. So
I would balance high doses

861
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,580
versus low doses, synthetic
psychedelics and organic

862
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,880
psychedelics. And I don't think
there is a fundamental core

863
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,800
difference between synthetic and
organic psychedelics, but I

864
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:26,000
would just differentiate those
two here. And one of the other

865
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,120
reasons I would do it
differently is because I

866
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,140
thought, when I began this work,
first, I thought this was all

867
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:37,220
about my personal
transformation. Well, well that

868
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:40,900
was that went out the window.
It's not about personal

869
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:44,920
transformation, it's about our
collective transformation. But I

870
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:50,440
also thought that the goal was
to get to some end state. You

871
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,020
know, people talked about
becoming one with God, or

872
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:58,120
becoming entering into the
primal void, or somehow reaching

873
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,700
some end condition. And so I
drove hard to reach that end

874
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,180
condition. But the way it worked
is that every time I would get

875
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:09,420
into what appeared to be a
homecoming state or an

876
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:16,440
absolutely soul satisfying
existential bliss, by keeping

877
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,380
driving, I would be taken into
yet another level of

878
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:22,340
consciousness and yet another
level of consciousness, until

879
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:26,060
eventually, I had one pivotal
experience in my 50th session,

880
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:32,420
where I was shown that it's an
infinite progression. You'll

881
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:36,500
never reach the end of it. The
Divine fabric is an infinite

882
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,740
fabric, and that's so one of the
reasons I would, I would do it

883
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:46,480
differently, is because I'm, I
think the goal is not to reach

884
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,740
some destination or some end
state. The goal is to become

885
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:55,540
transparent and to let as much
of the of the Divine into our

886
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:59,980
lives as possible, and to live
in that abiding and to deepen

887
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:03,720
that abiding communion. So I'm I
was a young man when I did this

888
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:07,380
work. I'm a little more patient
with the slower methods of

889
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:11,640
transformation than I was when I
did it. Thank you for that,

890
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,960
because I've been coming to that
realization myself. And it's

891
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:21,260
like there is no end. It's
forever. It is forever that, in

892
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:25,280
itself, is very difficult to put
your mind around. It's like,

893
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:28,700
yeah, yeah.

894
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:32,420
Regina: So that was, I guess I
would for myself, say that is

895
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,580
the ultimate surrender to be
able to do

896
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:38,060
Chris Bache: that. Yeah. And
whatever transition we're going

897
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:41,560
through in this next 100 years,
or whenever, whatever we're

898
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,160
going through, it's not the end
point for the human story,

899
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:48,700
right? We're going to be on this
planet for millions and millions

900
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:53,140
of more years if we survive this
potential extinction event. And

901
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:56,500
so we're going to keep growing.
We're going to go beyond the

902
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,080
diamond soul. We're going to
keep growing and growing and

903
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,680
growing. The creative
intelligence of the universe

904
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:06,360
does not seem to think in small
scale. It thinks its landscape

905
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:11,700
is vast. It thinks in galactic
proportions. It thinks in

906
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:17,820
magnitudes of time, far beyond
what we've even begun to try to

907
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:22,640
conceptualize in our religious
traditions of the world. I think

908
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,180
science has basically erased the
Blackboard and given us a

909
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:32,600
completely larger landscape,
which as our experience of this

910
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,200
landscape deepens, we're going
to have a deeper understanding

911
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,180
of the intelligence that
saturates this landscape, in a

912
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:44,260
way that even science is a hard
time admitting today, but it's

913
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:44,980
getting there.

914
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:50,020
Regina: Yeah, just the thing of
impatience alone, just that one

915
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:54,520
thing alone. Yeah, how different
it would be if we really, truly

916
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,140
were just able to be, yeah.

917
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:03,300
Unknown: Yeah. That, Victoria,
you have your hand up,

918
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:08,160
Chris Bache: yeah. Well, you
keep moving around on my screen.

919
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:16,260
Boy, I just was such a deep
experience. Felt like every cell

920
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:24,020
in my body was saying yes, and
so I wonder if did two questions

921
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,740
that are personal, so if you'd
be willing to talk about it,

922
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:33,860
just your ability to really
trust what has your experience

923
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:38,360
has been and what has been shown
to you, and then how you

924
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:44,080
incorporate that, I guess, in
the moments of your life, you

925
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,680
know, it's it's like, okay, what
do we do this moment, next

926
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,700
moment, next moment.

927
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,520
No. One of the things, one of
the great gifts I got from Stan

928
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,920
Grof was the understanding that
when you go into these deep,

929
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:07,380
cathartic, high, amplified
states of consciousness, you're

930
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,320
going to start to go into get
into stormy weather, you're

931
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,440
going to get into hard,
challenging circumstances.

932
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,340
Things are going to unravel on
you, and you're going to have an

933
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,860
instinct to pull back. You know,
this is a bad trip. You just

934
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:23,000
don't want to be here. This is a
terrible, terrible terrible

935
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,760
thing to happen, but if you are
willing to embrace it, if you

936
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,060
give yourself over to it, if you
let it take you wherever it

937
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:32,660
wants to take you, even though
you do not understand it at all,

938
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:35,180
you do not understand what's
happening. You don't understand

939
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:38,660
the logic of the whole thing.
But if you surrender to it,

940
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,960
it'll take you into a crisis,
which eventually peaks, and then

941
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,020
some part of you will fall away.
You'll you'll go through some

942
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:52,720
type of death, and then you will
awaken into a different reality,

943
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:57,460
as a different being with a
different set of capacities in a

944
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:02,160
deeper level of the universe, so
that you learn to trust the

945
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:08,820
cycle. It is a cycle process so
that you you open, you engage,

946
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:14,160
you surrender, and then you are
reborn, and you bring back the

947
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:20,760
entire cycle of both the trauma
and the ecstatic rebirth. So

948
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:31,400
that is a that develops a kind
of trust, which you learn by

949
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:36,500
practicing it. You learn by
doing it. And today, now, as I

950
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,200
have backed away from doing this
work, I mean, I stopped my

951
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:43,540
intense work in 99 so I've had a
long time to live with those

952
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:51,520
experiences, which will bring me
to your second question. And as

953
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:56,860
I've watched the shadows of
history deepen, I have to fall

954
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:01,200
back on this deep trust. And I
mean, it's I fall back on it

955
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,100
because I don't know how the
universe is going to work out.

956
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,820
What I've just seen tips of I
don't know how it's going to do

957
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:13,320
it and and my heart reaches out
in compassion to the billions of

958
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,560
people that are on the planet
going through very, very

959
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:22,340
challenging circumstances. In
the end, you either trust or you

960
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:26,720
don't trust. I choose to trust
that the creative intelligence

961
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:30,080
knows what it's doing, that the
creative intelligence that gave

962
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,560
birth to the galaxies and gave
birth to the planetary systems

963
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,620
and gave birth to life on this
planet, and so brought self

964
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:40,100
awareness into the life on this
planet, it knows what it's

965
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:46,660
doing. I choose to trust that it
believes that we are ready to

966
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:50,740
make this transition, and that's
why it has allowed it, or it

967
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:56,620
supported its emergence. How I
live with these things? Well,

968
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,560
it's not always been easy. I
mean, integrating integrating

969
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:06,840
individual sessions has always
been easy because I I followed a

970
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:11,580
strict therapeutic protocol
which maximizes the procedure of

971
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:16,080
clear contact and clean
integration. And I can't

972
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,200
emphasize this enough if you go
into psychedelics and you're in

973
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,160
a helter shelter environment and
you're kind of, you know, at a

974
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,220
concert, or you're doing the
set, and the other you don't

975
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:29,360
necessarily have clean contact,
and therefore integration can be

976
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:35,660
complicated, but if you have
clean contact and and careful

977
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:39,200
attention to integration,
Recording your experiences,

978
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,760
remembering your experiences,
pondering your experiences,

979
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,060
giving voice to them, giving
poetry to them, giving artistic

980
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:50,620
representation of them. You can
hold on to more and more your

981
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:59,860
experiences. However, I found
that I went so deep on my.

982
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,380
Particular journey I went deeper
than I think was probably wise

983
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:11,160
for me to go. And what became
challenging was not to manage

984
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:14,400
the pain part of the
experiences. What became

985
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,560
challenging, in the end, was
managing the ecstasy. It took me

986
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:26,360
so deeply into the divine bliss
and into the ecstatic nature of

987
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:32,000
transcendent reality. That when
I stopped my sessions, the

988
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,860
physical world just began to
lose its appeal. It began to

989
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,480
lose its luster. It could not
compare to the intensity of that

990
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:44,260
Rapture. Now I know that there
are great spiritual beings, and

991
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:47,020
they have always been my
mentors, but there are great

992
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:50,740
beings who can live consciously
in the physical world and in

993
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:56,080
this great transcendent bliss at
the same time, and all honor to

994
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:02,100
the great ones. But in my
personal case, I went deeper

995
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:07,260
than I was able to sustain the I
was able to remember them. I was

996
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:12,120
able to record them and hold
them in my memories, but I

997
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:16,800
wasn't able to live in them.
24/7, and that made living

998
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:22,160
challenging, and I spent
literally decades after I

999
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:27,680
stopped my sessions, actively
working to integrate those

1000
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:33,560
sessions into my daily life. And
writing LSD in the mind of the

1001
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:39,320
universe and going public as a
psychedelic professor was

1002
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,220
actually part of my integration
process, because one of the

1003
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:46,120
burdens of doing this work was
the secrecy I had to, had to

1004
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,620
use, and this secrecy that
allowed me to do the work also

1005
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:54,700
made it difficult for me to
integrate that work, because I'm

1006
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:58,120
a yacker, I'm a talker. I love
to learn and share what I

1007
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:02,220
learned. And here I as a
philosopher, I was cultivating

1008
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:05,700
these very, very profound
experiences, but I wasn't

1009
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,280
allowed to talk about them. I
couldn't bring them to my

1010
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,740
students. I could not bring them
to my colleagues at the

1011
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:16,380
University. And so beginning to
sort of talk about them, to

1012
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:22,040
systematically integrate them
into into some rhyme and reason

1013
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:26,300
in dark night, early dawn, and
then in LSD, in the mind of the

1014
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:32,600
universe, has been one of the
ways in which I have stabilized

1015
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:37,160
them and integrated them and
made my peace with them, because

1016
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:42,460
with that book, I have become in
the outside world, what I was in

1017
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:49,660
my inner work, and in that there
is great peace, and beyond that,

1018
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:53,680
it's an ongoing process. I don't
think I will complete

1019
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:58,000
integrating this work in this
lifetime. I think what

1020
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,760
integration means changes as the
experiences go deeper, what

1021
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,100
integration means when you're
working at the personal

1022
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:08,340
unconscious, or even the
collective unconscious, it's

1023
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:12,600
different than when you're going
into radically trans, temporal,

1024
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,320
trans, spatial states of
consciousness. So that right

1025
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,840
now, I don't think we really
even understand fully what

1026
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:24,920
entering into these states of
consciousness is doing to us. We

1027
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:30,920
are kind of our early enthusiasm
for our ability to enter into

1028
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:35,060
these states, we haven't quite
caught up with ourselves in that

1029
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:39,860
way. So we have a lot of work to
do in the area of integration,

1030
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:43,480
and in that context, I would
mention a book called

1031
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:49,000
psychedelics and psychotherapy,
edited by Maria Papa Spira and

1032
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,220
Tim Reed, which is an excellent
book on specifically addressing

1033
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:59,560
the question of integration. And
I have an article in the book.

1034
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,920
What was the name of that book,

1035
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,940
psychotherapy, psychedelics and
psychotherapy.

1036
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:12,540
And so thank you for that. And
do you find just one last

1037
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:22,040
question, do you find, you know
when the the ego? Do you? Do you

1038
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,300
find yourself really being more
aware of what your state is and

1039
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:31,520
each moment and choosing? Or is
it beyond that?

1040
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:38,120
Again, I want to go back to what
I showed in the very the early

1041
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,560
slide, the difference between
therapeutic healing, spiritual

1042
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:45,940
awakening and cosmic logical
exploration. Your question is

1043
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:50,440
basically asking, how do these
experiences affect my spiritual

1044
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:54,760
condition, my my psycho
spiritual condition, my

1045
01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:01,200
spiritual state, if I were
seeking spiritual. Awakening I

1046
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:05,460
would do, have done a completely
different protocol. I think

1047
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:10,680
working with low doses would be
the approach that you would want

1048
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:16,440
to use if you were really
seeking what the classic state

1049
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,160
of enlightenment or you have to
kind of work with where the ego

1050
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:24,620
lives in the world to realize
that kind of abiding

1051
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:31,640
transparency, where you can
enter into a kind of

1052
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:35,900
transparency where you relax
into the present and relax into

1053
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:41,200
the infinity of eternity now,
and relax into the oneness that

1054
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:48,100
holds all things in existence.
Cosmic logical exploration is a

1055
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:56,800
different agenda, and so my
whatever I whatever I can

1056
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,960
integrate from those cosmic
logical experiences, what I can

1057
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,320
and cannot integrate does not at
the Spiritual Awakening level,

1058
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:18,840
does not really impact the truth
that emerged as in the Cosmic,

1059
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,520
logical adventure. As a
philosopher, I wanted to

1060
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,900
understand how the universe
worked and the experiences that

1061
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,980
the universe gave me as I
pursued those that question are

1062
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:35,480
not experiences that I can
stabilize and integrate. 24/7,

1063
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:41,500
some of them may be, but many of
them I can't. So I do spirit. I

1064
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:45,040
was doing spiritual practice
meditation through all of my

1065
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,880
work through all the years, and
continue to do so. And one of

1066
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,980
the ways I do spiritual practice
today is to cultivate the

1067
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:59,500
conscious recall of my memories,
not to try to get stuck, not to

1068
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:05,220
be stuck in my past, but because
my memories are my deepest

1069
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:10,740
experience of the universe, and
by cultivating that conscious

1070
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:16,260
recall of those experiences, it
allows me to enter into a state

1071
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:22,700
of transparency where I enter
into something approximating a

1072
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:28,820
version of that intimacy, again,
beautiful. It's it's not an

1073
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:33,440
abiding 24/7 thing for me. It
comes and goes. It's a daily

1074
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,400
practice thing.

1075
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,160
Thank you so much.

1076
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,620
Unknown: Jonah, you have your
hand up again.

1077
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:50,800
Jonai: Yes, you can hear me.
Okay. That kind of leads into my

1078
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:56,800
question or comment when you
say, cultivating the conscious

1079
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,920
recall of your experiences. Does
this include past life? Does

1080
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,540
this include everything I mean,
past life, this life, whatever

1081
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:07,500
happens to be, come into your
mind when you're doing that

1082
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:08,580
well.

1083
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:13,020
Chris Bache: In my psychedelic
work, I did encounter some

1084
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:17,880
former lives. I also have
encountered former lives. In my

1085
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:25,580
hep meal therapy work that I did
for three years. So but here I'm

1086
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:33,200
specifically focusing on my
psychedelic work. And, you know,

1087
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,200
it's it's interesting. I don't
really focus very much on

1088
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,500
integrating my former lives. I
think I somehow have done enough

1089
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:43,600
house cleaning that they are
kind of okay. They're kind of

1090
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,760
comfortably tucked away. It's
more the cosmic logical the

1091
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:52,540
memory of cosmic logical access
that I cultivate,

1092
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:56,560
I what I am,

1093
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:01,320
is kind of strange, because you
know when, when you look at

1094
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:05,640
people who have deep spiritual
experiences, usually they have

1095
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,580
them in the context of a
meditation tradition or

1096
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:14,640
contemplative tradition, and
they can often hold on to the

1097
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:18,240
experiences that they've tapped
into, sometimes, not always, but

1098
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:22,100
often, this approach is
different, and it's why I

1099
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:25,520
emphasize as a methodology
chapter in the book. This is the

1100
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,500
path of temporary immersion.
It's not the path of abiding

1101
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:34,640
presence. It's a path of
temporary immersion. You have to

1102
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:38,480
come to terms with the
temporariness of the conditions

1103
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:43,060
that you have entered and use
those hours in order to affect a

1104
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:47,740
long term, abiding change in the
condition of your of your

1105
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:55,360
psyche, but you and you, just
because a person may have had an

1106
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:58,660
extra, ordinarily powerful or
beautiful experience or cosmic

1107
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:01,680
experience, doesn't mean. That
they have necessarily become a

1108
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,880
beautiful or powerful or cosmic
being. A lot of people made that

1109
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,680
mistake in the early days. We've
learned from that we have to

1110
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:14,280
constantly be remembering these
are temporary experiences.

1111
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:19,800
What's important is what we can
do the day after our session.

1112
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:25,040
Jonai: Right? Right? Everything
is an opportunity, and it's

1113
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:30,740
there to learn in some way. As
the way I look at it, in 1998 I

1114
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:33,440
was just jumping into the nine
gates Mystery School, which

1115
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:37,760
you're familiar with, I'm sure.
And then it all went from there.

1116
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:42,040
I had done some preliminary work
to that, to get ready to do

1117
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:46,060
that. And then, but, but I
wanted to bring up was

1118
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:50,320
reincarnation, which was kind
of, it's kind of, and the new

1119
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:55,540
trajectory that you mentioned in
terms of reincarnation, you said

1120
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:03,900
all of the last all I wrote down
all of past lives fused into

1121
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:08,100
one, and it's kind of, and I've
done a lot of past life stuff. I

1122
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:12,240
mean, from there I went through
into esthetic studies and and

1123
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:17,640
experiential training in ancient
archetypal techniques, ancient

1124
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,540
techniques, and all that kind of
wisdom techniques and all that

1125
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:26,240
kind of thing. And I did, I did
a lot of past life. It wasn't it

1126
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:30,560
was because it's karmic issues,
taking an event and going back,

1127
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:33,620
and then there was a forgiveness
process at the end of that. And

1128
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:37,580
it's it changes the energy of
it, and in changing the energy

1129
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:44,140
of that past life experience, so
to speak, it's a story. It makes

1130
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:47,680
a tremendous difference, because
that energy is no longer

1131
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,940
affecting us. I mean, it
changes, you know, the emotional

1132
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,660
and everything and so and I
didn't. I did quite a bit of

1133
01:31:55,660 --> 01:32:02,760
that for myself. I also helped
other people do it. But so it

1134
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:08,700
is. It's accepting whatever has
happened in the past. And if you

1135
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:13,440
need, if something is up and you
need to forgive it, fine, and

1136
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,620
you go from there. But then
you're also saying, in this

1137
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:24,380
lifetime, all of that is also a
part of it, and in the future,

1138
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:30,380
the future, and whatever is. And
so you're expanding. And another

1139
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:33,980
thing as I listen to you talk
and think about I'm an avid

1140
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:38,120
reader, and I haven't, I kind of
shut down on that for a while,

1141
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:42,580
but, but I'm back into it now,
because I'm trying to update you

1142
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:47,800
know myself, and so I can learn
from reading your book, from

1143
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:53,920
hearing you talk. I can, I can
somehow not exactly relate to

1144
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:59,200
any kind of a way. I can you
went through all of the

1145
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:05,160
psychedelic part of getting
there, but I I feel an

1146
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:09,900
understanding of what you're
saying, yes, and so I sort of

1147
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:12,780
feel like I've always been a
person who, I likes to learn

1148
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:15,780
from other people's experiences,
right? Because it takes so much

1149
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:19,740
less time than me trying to go
through all those experiences. I

1150
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:22,880
mean, you went through how many
years of this, and here's where

1151
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,560
you are, and now you are sharing
this with everybody. So we have

1152
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:32,480
a place to start, yeah, and we
can go from there, yeah. And

1153
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,360
that's what I'm counting on. I
started counting backwards on

1154
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:41,380
birthdays when I from 60. I had
read something about 120 years

1155
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:44,440
our bodies should be able to
last. So I thought, okay, 60

1156
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:47,440
years old if I stop counting
backwards and don't get into

1157
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,800
this senior thing of aging and
dying and everything and go

1158
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,920
backwards. And somebody said,
Well, what if you get to zero?

1159
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,500
And I said, Well, I'll just hang
out there for however long it

1160
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:00,780
takes. And so that's another I
mean, that's just not 100 that's

1161
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:05,520
120 and who knows, you know. And
with the with the current, with

1162
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,960
our soft technology, as, as Greg
Braden calls it, all of that,

1163
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,560
that technology we have in
within us,

1164
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,300
Unknown: to to

1165
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:21,620
Jonai: to repair and reflect,
refraction and rejuvenate and

1166
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:27,320
everything. You know, I'm really
focusing on that that's real.

1167
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,120
So, yeah, okay,

1168
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,420
Unknown: thank you. Johnny, so
Jean, do you did you have

1169
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:33,560
another question? I just

1170
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:37,100
Jean Fox: had one quick
question, if someone were want

1171
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:40,900
to do, do you recommend, Chris,
if you're want to do your own

1172
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:46,720
journeying, guided, or self
guided. So I feel like I've done

1173
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:51,340
some of my own and it's yeah,
sometimes it can be scary by

1174
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:54,700
yourself absolutely so go ahead.

1175
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,280
Chris Bache: I really recommend
if you're going to work with

1176
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:01,260
psychedelics, that you work with
somebody. Who really knows the

1177
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:05,160
landscape, who knows the
territory? And now I don't. I

1178
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:09,420
have a particular glitch around
guided experiences, because I

1179
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:13,020
don't the role of a sitter is,
to me, is not to guide a person,

1180
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,920
but simply to help keep you safe
and focused while you do your

1181
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:22,880
inner work the universe guides
you. Sit here's role is to keep

1182
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,140
you safe, keep you protected,
and help keep you focused. And I

1183
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:31,400
if you're going to amplify
consciousness, I think it's

1184
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:36,560
really important to work with
somebody who is has therapeutic

1185
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:43,480
skills and has knowledge of this
territory, and just to loop back

1186
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:48,040
just a little bit, psychedelics
here are not the issue, not the

1187
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,240
primary issue. In fact, the name
of this book, LSD, in the mind

1188
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:54,880
of the universe, was given by
the publisher. That's not what I

1189
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,360
call the book. I call the book
is diamonds from heaven because

1190
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:03,360
it's a story of initiation.
Psychedelics are secondary. You

1191
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,540
can enter into these states
through any number of different

1192
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:11,820
spiritual technologies,
spiritual techniques and the

1193
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:14,940
visions that I've shared with
you today are they're not unique

1194
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:18,300
to psychedelics. They they have
surfaced in spiritual

1195
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:21,740
traditions, in channeling
traditions, in indigenous

1196
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:26,900
traditions, psychedelics is
simply another technology for

1197
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:32,000
accessing these deep states of
awareness, right? So, and I

1198
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,980
would encourage you, please,
anybody, don't do what I do did,

1199
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:40,600
and please be careful if you're
going to work with psychedelics,

1200
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:45,460
be very careful, very
conscientious, because when you

1201
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:50,200
open these doors, you can get in
over your head. And there are

1202
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,680
people who open these doors and
walk away traumatized and

1203
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:58,780
scarred for years. Okay, so I
want to be very careful.

1204
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:05,100
Jean Fox: There's so many,
there's, you know, a

1205
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:10,200
psychotherapist. Then there's
lot of different groups, yeah,

1206
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:15,720
but it's hard to discern. It's
very kind of recommendations of

1207
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:19,200
how to find your, you know, even
trusted friend.

1208
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:23,540
Chris Bache: Yeah, things are
changing, of course, as it was

1209
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:28,520
mentioned earlier. You know,
mushrooms are becoming legal in

1210
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:32,420
various places. Hundreds and
1000s of people are being

1211
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:36,740
certified as past as psychedelic
therapists. The future is

1212
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:39,980
opening up in ways we could
never have anticipated 15 years

1213
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:43,900
ago. Thank you. Michael Pollan,
you know, and all of those,

1214
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:47,080
we're entering a new and
exciting era, but we're still in

1215
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:51,580
a transition, because it's
still, you know, it's still in

1216
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:52,300
the gray zone.

1217
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:57,940
Unknown: So thank you. So we're
running out of time, but I'm

1218
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:00,120
going to have two more
questions, Ron. I'm me.

1219
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:08,700
Chris Bache: So I really
appreciate that last question

1220
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:13,560
and your answer, Chris, I think
this is extremely important in

1221
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:18,840
this topic. And I again, I had
said before that I speak from a

1222
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:22,040
different type of experience
than you had. You were doing

1223
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:29,120
science. You were tracking
things very carefully. When I

1224
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:32,900
talked about that, I'd had some
experience with micro dosing

1225
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:38,840
before it was called that. That
was a social thing, but I will

1226
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:43,000
say that my last session and I
did have a few larger dose

1227
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:49,960
sessions that I did my very last
session, I think satisfied me,

1228
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:57,460
because I did a solitary
session, and I was in nature,

1229
01:38:57,940 --> 01:39:02,340
and I remember the emotional
place that it took me was very

1230
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:09,360
strong and very poignant. I was.
I had tears of both what I now

1231
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:16,440
know are both joy and grief.
Because I was, I was really

1232
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:20,840
appreciating the oneness of the
magnificent beauty of all of

1233
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:28,520
creation around me, and it's
amazing complexities. And at the

1234
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:32,540
same time, I was having grief,
because I was aware of what

1235
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:37,220
we're doing to our world and who
we are as humans and all of our

1236
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:43,180
failings now at the moment,
because I didn't have a sitter

1237
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:48,580
and I didn't have any science or
good counsel, someone keeping me

1238
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:53,920
safe and keeping me on track
with my experience to make it a

1239
01:39:56,740 --> 01:40:02,160
healing experience or a
therapeutic experience. Years, I

1240
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:06,900
thought I was having a bummer,
because I was so emotional, I

1241
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:11,820
didn't know how to cope with
that at the time, and only now

1242
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:17,040
in in looking back, you know, 50
years ago, no 40 years ago,

1243
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:22,520
that, and having this topic
become more public, and being

1244
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:26,600
able to read and and listen to
people like you speak about it,

1245
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,500
I could say that I've probably
spent my whole life integrating

1246
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:41,320
that, you know, and so it's it's
been okay, but I want to really

1247
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:46,540
chime in, in a very simple
street wise guy sort of way to

1248
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:53,560
say it. This is not to be done
lightly, and even even with

1249
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:59,140
micro dosing, without, without
having someone be a sitter and a

1250
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:03,480
guide and and doing that, I
would really, I would really

1251
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:09,000
caution it, and then, especially
with the larger doses, I so

1252
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:13,260
appreciate how you went into
detail about your answer to that

1253
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:18,720
last question from, I'm sorry I
forgot your name is a jean. So

1254
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:24,920
thank you, Chris, thank you so
much for all of this. Thank you.

1255
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,180
It's, I've, I've really
appreciated it very much.

1256
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:31,100
Unknown: Thank you. Thank you,

1257
01:41:31,459 --> 01:41:33,559
Georgina. You get the last
question.

1258
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:40,780
Georgena Eggleston: It's too
Yeah, what is really, really

1259
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:46,000
short is LSD country, indicated
for those people with a

1260
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,040
diagnosis of traumatic brain
injury.

1261
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:55,300
Chris Bache: That is a question
that I'm not competent to ask.

1262
01:41:55,420 --> 01:42:00,480
It should really be answered by
clinical professional. I would

1263
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:05,700
imagine it would depend upon the
nature of the of the injury. But

1264
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:09,540
really, let me, I won't, let's
yield that to the people

1265
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,340
who should answer.

1266
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:14,700
Georgena Eggleston: So the other
question is, is you gave the

1267
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:21,380
quote by the British
professional at the beginning, I

1268
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:26,600
got, certainly the sense of
lack, limitation and fear. And

1269
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:30,140
as we've been talking about the
precipice and what we're going

1270
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:36,320
into, it sounds like those are,
the consciousness, lack,

1271
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:41,500
limitation, fear, here we are.
How can, how from your

1272
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:46,720
experience, what? What do you
say to my interpretation of

1273
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:50,980
that, for all of us going into
this crisis?

1274
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:01,080
Chris Bache: Yeah, you know,
some people said, have said, If

1275
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:04,260
we focus too much on the
negative, we actually will bring

1276
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:07,080
about that negative. We will
think it will bring it into

1277
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:11,700
existence. And I think I
understand that, and I do

1278
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:15,000
understand self generating
realities and so on so forth.

1279
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:20,280
But I don't think that's the
primary danger. Now, the primary

1280
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:24,260
danger is not facing those
realities, and that if we don't

1281
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:28,100
face those realities, we can't
mobilize to address them. If we

1282
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:33,620
don't really understand and face
in a cold, sober fashion how

1283
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:39,020
overextended the we are with
this planet, we will never be

1284
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:42,700
able to bring about a change, a
fundamental change, of our

1285
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:48,880
individual and our social way of
living on the planet. So to me,

1286
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:54,340
I would rather sit with people
who are facing that, who are

1287
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:59,200
engaging the grief of what we
have done to the species on this

1288
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:04,320
planet and to the planet itself,
to work with that issue and take

1289
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,160
that all the way down to a
resolution, and then move

1290
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:12,300
forward and through it. And
there are, of course, Joanna

1291
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:16,620
Macy people who are doing this
type of work. I think a great

1292
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:22,340
deal of grief work is needed as
we confront the damage that

1293
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:27,800
we've done, but then we move
into, okay, let's get on top of

1294
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:30,260
this. Let's move forward. Let's
make these changes that are

1295
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:30,920
necessary.

1296
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:32,120
Georgena Eggleston: Thank you.

1297
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:37,460
Unknown: Okay, well, thank you
so much. I'm going to put it

1298
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:44,140
back on the gallery view. So
thank you so much, Chris, this

1299
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:51,580
is amazing and inspiring and
really powerful. Thank you for

1300
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:56,560
your years of work, for all of
us, all of humanity, for Austin

1301
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:03,600
to have this in insight into
what. Were about, and I'm going

1302
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,780
to read your book, both of your
books. Which one would you

1303
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:08,280
recommend I read first?

1304
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:12,600
Chris Bache: Oh, I always
recommend that people start.

1305
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:16,380
First of all, you can read LSD
in the mind of the universe.

1306
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:20,160
It's it's a much simpler book to
read than dark night early dawn.

1307
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:23,300
It does not require dark matter
at dawn, dark naturally, Dawn is

1308
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:27,560
pretty academic, muscled, but
LSD in the mind of the universe,

1309
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:31,460
I wrote that to be accessible to
a wide range of people. But

1310
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:34,940
personally, I find, if you don't
know the literature on

1311
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:38,060
reincarnation, I often think
it's best to start with the life

1312
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:41,800
cycles, which is my book on
reincarnation, because

1313
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:47,560
reincarnation is fundamental to
what emerges in LSD, in the mind

1314
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:48,520
of the universe.

1315
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:53,380
Unknown: Okay, thank you so.
Thank you everyone for joining

1316
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:57,400
and for your comments and
questions and thanks again,

1317
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,740
Chris, this is wonderful. I
think we might have to have you

1318
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:03,840
back to talk about your book
later on. So thank you so much

1319
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:07,920
again, and thanks everybody, and
we'll see you next time. Thanks

1320
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:13,320
so much Dottie and Heather. Much
love Yes, and thank you again,

1321
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,180
Heather for bringing us. Chris,

1322
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:17,400
Chris Bache: thank you so much.

1323
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:23,900
Unknown: Bye, everyone. Thank
you. Thank you so much. Bye.

1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,780
Andrew Holecek: So welcome
everybody to our ongoing edge of

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,640
mind podcast, where I have the
great honor and delight to spend

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:15,120
a little bit more time with this
remarkable thinker, psychonaut,

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,500
explorer of the mind and heart,
Christopher Bache, and really

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,020
continue to unpack unfold some
of the many aspects of his

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,380
remarkable journey that we
introduced in round one of my

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:33,200
conversation. And so I will
reiterate a very brief bio of

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,340
Chris, and then we're just going
to jump right in and slowly

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,120
venture into hopefully some
rich, deep waters. So

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,040
Christopher Bache is a professor
emeritus in the Department of

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,220
Philosophy and Religious Studies
at Youngstown State University,

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,880
where he taught for 33 years,
fellow at the Institute of

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,460
Noetic Sciences. He was also
adjunct faculty at the

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,200
California Institute of integral
studies and on the advisory

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,560
board for Grof Transpersonal
training and the Grof

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,920
Foundation, an award winning
teacher international speaker

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,860
who's the author of three books
and lives in Portland. You're

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,060
still in Portland, right?

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,240
Chris Bache: Actually, we're in
Weaverville, North Carolina now.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,560
Just Oh, okay,

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,680
Andrew Holecek: well, I'm glad I
asked Yeah, yeah. So Chris,

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,340
thank you again for for taking
time to return and unfold with

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,220
me some of the remarkable
implications of your journey. So

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,140
at the outset, deep of gratitude
for you.

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,840
Chris Bache: It's a pleasure to
be with you today. Andrew, thank

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,920
you for the invitation.

27
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,679
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, really, I
deeply appreciate it. And so

28
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:38,119
what I thought what we could
explore is I was re reading some

29
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,619
of the material, especially the
latter chapters in your journey.

30
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,619
LSD, in the mind, in the
universe, that's mostly what

31
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,699
we're going to be unfolding, but
also conjoined with the living

32
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:51,519
classroom, because there's
obviously some wonderful

33
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,239
interconnectivity between those
narratives that will be woven

34
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,219
into this. But I thought what we
could we could introduce is a

35
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,059
narrative, of a topic that's
very near and dear to my heart

36
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:07,259
right now, so much so that I'm
writing one book on it, and

37
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,619
probably two. And I think we
pinged on this just a wee bit in

38
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,279
our first session, but I want to
explore it in a little bit more

39
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:20,159
detail now, because to me, I
think using your languaging it

40
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:25,999
this this narrative of openness
and contraction is really, I've,

41
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,879
I've come to see it as kind of
the combustion cycle of the

42
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,119
spiritual path. And so I thought
we could start with that

43
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,899
narrative as a way to, perhaps,
like a, like a fractal,

44
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,859
reiterate the entirety of your
journey within the session

45
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,879
itself. In other words, start a
little bit more with this

46
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,859
narrative and maybe continue to
expand, to open into deeper and

47
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:51,519
deeper dimensions. As in fact,
your journey, both during the 20

48
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,459
years and after, took you
through as a way to really talk,

49
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,439
both in a kind of philosophical
and also. And the reason I love

50
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,419
these terms somatic sense, I
love the notion of openness and

51
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,959
contraction, because these are
things we can feel. I mean,

52
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,039
they're not just cerebral,
intellectual story lines. These

53
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,359
are things that we can feel in
our body, mind matrix. And so I

54
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,839
would like to dive into that
with you as we perhaps set our

55
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:27,319
direction towards what I
consider to be the climax of

56
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,959
your book, The diamond
Luminosity. But because that

57
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,899
light is so bright, that space
is so open, that we perhaps can

58
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:38,839
dilate the aperture of our
awareness, our hearts and minds

59
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:43,239
a little bit more slowly and
start by by sending a question

60
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,419
in your direction about how
this, your journey, could be

61
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:54,699
articulated in this expression,
this kind of pulsation. Or the

62
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:56,919
Hindus talk about it
beautifully, and the tradition

63
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:01,679
of spanda, the doctrine of
vibration, which I'm starting to

64
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:04,859
see now, and I'll share some of
my own experiences and insights

65
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,059
of openness, contraction,
openness and then contraction.

66
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,419
So maybe we could start there
and then that, I think will lend

67
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,679
us gradually into wider and
wider and perhaps greater

68
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:17,759
degrees of openness.

69
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,820
Chris Bache: Okay, you bet
that's good place to start. So

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,360
in my understanding, in my
experience, psychedelics, in

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,620
general and in particular, LSD,
which was my primary medicine in

72
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,240
this journey, is an amplifier of
consciousness. And so When

73
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,980
consciousness is amplified,
signals which are quiet, get

74
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,880
large, get loud, and you have a
sensation of your becoming aware

75
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,980
of more and more how you meet.
That increase of awareness, how

76
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,260
you engage what emerges is
seminal in the process. If you

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,440
engage the shadow consciously,
it. You confront those things

78
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,200
which keep you habitually
contracted and small. You engage

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,540
those fears, or whatever it is,
you take them to their source,

80
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,100
to the root. They resolve
themselves, and when they

81
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,300
resolve themselves, your
consciousness is free to open

82
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,640
into more spacious places. Every
time you let go of something

83
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,820
which is holding your
consciousness in a fixed pattern

84
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,440
or holding it small,
particularly initially your your

85
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,880
time space identity, your
historical egoic identity that

86
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,280
tells us who we are. But if you
can let go of that you discover

87
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,880
that there are these dimensions
beyond your time, space

88
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,740
identity, which are even more
truly, really what you are. And

89
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,400
if you keep this going, you go
through multiple layers of

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,140
consciousness. There's a point
where you have to let go,

91
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,700
surrender or die, not only to
your individual identity, but to

92
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,600
your identity as a human being.
Per se, there is a deeper sense

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,460
of humanity that defines that
holds the limits of your

94
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,200
knowing, and there's a going
even deeper. There's a sense of

95
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
time, space, identity. You let
go of your entire existence,

96
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,460
including all your
reincarnational experiences of

97
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,800
time space as a framework for
holding experience. And your

98
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,780
experience flows beyond time and
space, and this is an entirely

99
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,740
natural process, I think thought
of as a broader conjecture. My

100
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,620
understanding of what happens
inside a psychedelic session is

101
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,160
that it basically accelerates
and intensifies what is taking

102
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,540
place in nature all the time. So
when we are born, our

103
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,740
consciousness contracts into our
an individual, egoic time,

104
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,000
space, identity. When we die, we
expand. There's a sense of

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,720
expanding back into the souls,
back back into deeper spiritual

106
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,020
awareness. When we're born, we
contract. When we die, we

107
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,560
expand. And so what happens in a
session? It simply accelerates

108
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,900
and intensifies this natural
process which is taking place in

109
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,200
history over a longer period. So
what it allows you to do is to

110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,080
accelerate that process and to
start by burning off more karma

111
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,820
than one might get around to
otherwise, and that's the same

112
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,940
thing that happens in
meditation, of course, too. Same

113
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,440
dynamic. And it's

114
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,240
Andrew Holecek: interesting,
isn't it? My favorite running

115
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,940
definition of meditation these
days is habituation to openness,

116
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,720
and I find it there's so many
implications of that, Chris,

117
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,940
because I mean parenthetically,
the Buddha we know

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,240
etymologically, usually
translated as the awakened one.

119
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,080
But I've also heard renderings
as the opened one. And so the

120
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,500
reason I find this beautiful,
for a number of reasons, is

121
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,580
encountered distinction. We're
the contracted ones. And so by

122
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,180
bringing this, the reason I
think this is so important is

123
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,480
because by bringing this
process, this phenomenology,

124
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,260
into the light of our conscious
awareness, we can better

125
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,280
sensitize ourselves to it in a
more somatic sense. It's against

126
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,980
something. This is something we
can feel. This is not just a

127
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:39,380
cerebral, intellectual thing. We
can feel this process of

128
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,240
contraction and openness within
our very Soma. And for me, what

129
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm curious Chris is two things.
One, how early in your journey

130
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,720
did this become apparent to you?
I mean, how I can't remember all

131
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,420
your sessions with great
specificity, but where did this

132
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,480
narrative become identifiable
for you? How did it help you as

133
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,660
you continue to go further, and
then parenthetically, just so I

134
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,660
don't forget this as well. The
other thing I find around this

135
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,240
narrative that's so helpful that
you were suggesting at the

136
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,820
outset is that we're practicing
this, whether we know it or not,

137
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,680
where we are, either on the path
of practicing habituation to

138
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,520
openness, or if we don't know
it, and most of us don't, by

139
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,020
default, we're practicing
contraction every time we

140
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,260
capitulate to grasping to
beliefs, to a sense of, I mean,

141
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,580
virtually everywhere that is our
default contraction. And so

142
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,180
again, I know I'm throwing a
couple things out there, but I

143
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,700
think this is so foundational
for me that after decades, when

144
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,760
I look back, it's like, oh my
gosh, I can really look with a

145
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,540
new sense of understanding from
this altitude, wow. My whole

146
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,200
journey has been this kind of
pulsation, opening, expanding,

147
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,460
how much of that can I deal then
metabolizing, contracting, so

148
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,800
little bit around that, little
bit more on that.

149
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,780
Chris Bache: Sure it actually
started in the very first

150
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,960
session. My very first session,
I hit an experience where I

151
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,080
could not remember anything
about myself. I could not

152
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,220
remember who I was, what I was,
I couldn't remember what I did

153
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,960
for a living. I could not
remember whether I was a man or

154
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,040
a woman, I was absolutely
jammed. And I looked in 1000

155
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,900
mirrors. I couldn't find any
piece of individual, egoic

156
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,460
identity, and it was, of course,
very jarring, frightening in the

157
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,180
beginning, and then later in the
session, my sense of identity

158
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,520
returned. But it that experience
was really important, because it

159
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,440
told me, at first, it gave me an
insight into the dynamic. It

160
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,380
shook me up, and it showed me a
certain measure of the true

161
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,500
cost, you know, because I had
read about ego death, and I

162
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,280
thought, Oh, good, let's do it,
and I hadn't appreciated, this

163
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,760
is a true death. This is a loss
of your identity. And it

164
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,940
basically taught me to The Art
of Letting Go and the art of

165
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,260
surrender, because if you can't
control your self identity,

166
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,420
identity, and that's about as
basic as it gets. And so later,

167
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:25,040
when the ante kept increasing, I
knew that the key to navigating

168
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,540
whatever was coming was to
surrender, let it go and it it

169
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,480
stopped me from trying to hold
on to something familiar, hold

170
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,160
on something I could identify
with. And that just then, that

171
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,720
just went on. It escalated from
there, about two and a half

172
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,580
years later, when my individual,
egoic identity was turned inside

173
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,960
out and just crushed, I went
through a collapse of that

174
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,180
smaller state, and they rebirth
into a deeper state, and then

175
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,080
later through after the ocean of
suffering, After spending two

176
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,960
years in that you know,
surrounded by the historical

177
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,260
suffering of humanity and these
unfinished memories, painful

178
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,340
memories, there was a death
process which then catapulted me

179
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,080
into a deeper level of reality,
beyond the collective

180
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,800
unconscious, into archetypal
consciousness. And this pattern

181
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,380
just kept repeating itself so
but it started very early on,

182
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:31,340
and then, then it's just the
texture of the openness differs,

183
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,500
the context differs, the purity
of it differs. There's a lot of

184
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,020
light, of course, engaging
fields of light, but I found

185
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,720
that light itself also has
gradients, their various kind of

186
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,860
levels of purity of light,
levels of clarity of light. And

187
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:58,420
so the actual content of
openness is it changes in the

188
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:04,920
work. But the phenomenon that of
opening into something larger,

189
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:12,360
something deeper. Now I want to
caution this little bit qualify

190
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,040
it the sensation and the certain
stages of work and what I would

191
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,160
call the psychic and subtle
levels of consciousness. The

192
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,860
sensation often is of getting
larger. And I think this is

193
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,580
characteristic of subtle level
reality, subtle level of states

194
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,080
of consciousness, and then
later, much later, in the

195
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,660
journey, this experience was
just reversed. That is, I was

196
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,720
experiencing huge fields of
light, contracting into the

197
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,040
present and just exploding me
into that, into some different

198
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,500
state of consciousness. But
everything was contracting,

199
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,900
contracting. So I began to
realize that the whole subject,

200
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,160
I even began to wonder whether
we had Miss identified the

201
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,960
nature of psych of psychedelics
by calling them mind openers.

202
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,440
Yeah, I understand. But at
another level, they are Mind

203
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,620
Mind contractors, where you're
contracting deeper and deeper

204
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,040
and deeper into the present,
present, present, present, until

205
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,540
you drop into a very different
experience of that present. So

206
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,240
openness, we just want to be
careful to recognize that

207
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,760
there's a there are different
modalities.

208
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,519
Andrew Holecek: It's a multi
isn't it, Chris, it's a

209
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,439
multivalent term, right? It has,
it has different iterations and

210
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:38,599
context. And several things come
to mind here. That contraction

211
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:41,079
into the present moment is very
interesting in the in the

212
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,539
languaging that I'm familiar
with, and you may be familiar

213
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:46,419
with this too. Pamasambhava
talked about it as the fourth

214
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:50,859
moment, which one can only
actually access through the

215
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:54,639
conduit of the present moment.
So what an interesting kind of

216
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,379
juxtaposition and almost clash
of traditional approaches where

217
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,359
I don't want. Level by
contracting in the healthy

218
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,759
sense. And again, this is, I
think, super important, because

219
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:09,119
in and of itself, contraction is
utterly non problematic. We

220
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:12,299
couldn't operate in the world
without that aspect of that

221
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:16,679
pulsation. And so we tend to
clamor towards openness as that

222
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,899
somehow being the ultimate
spiritual thing. I think

223
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,859
provisionally, there's some
truth to that. But if we can't

224
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,799
merge that openness with our
contraction, then contraction

225
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,339
becomes the bad boy, the bad
girl. And we look at it in a

226
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:32,119
kind of a limited way, but in my
experience, in Padmasambhava,

227
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:35,779
use this language of the fourth
moment you contract, you

228
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,559
condense into the portal, the it
becomes the portico, into the

229
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,399
timeless beyond, where you come
to the present moment, and then

230
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,059
that blows up, so to speak, into
the fourth moment, which

231
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,639
Transcendence, even the present
moment itself. And I think

232
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,759
that's helpful, because we're
going to start to tread into

233
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,399
waters where languages will
because it's dualistic and

234
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,419
nature becomes problematic. And
as you know, in the Buddhist

235
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,499
tradition, one has to be, or is
invited to be, incredibly

236
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:08,339
articulate precise, in order to
realize when we use this term

237
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,339
exactly, how are we using it in
what context. And so I think

238
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,679
therefore, it seems like, Well,
wait a second, isn't the whole

239
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,499
thing about opening? Well, yes,
but it's also honoring the

240
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,099
process of contraction, and how
that can lead to this.

241
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,340
Chris Bache: Yeah, you know,
you're mentioning Padma Samba.

242
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,300
It gives me an opportunity to,
once again, emphasize the point

243
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,260
that there are correlations, and
I'm grateful for the

244
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,520
correlations between my
experiences and those recorded

245
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,400
by the Great Beings. The Padma
Samba was of the world, the

246
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,660
great contemplatives. But this
path that I was on is not that

247
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,980
contemplative path. It's a path
of temporary immersion. So when

248
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,640
I'm describing things, it always
has to be understood that this

249
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,040
is a temporary experience, which
then to unpack the spiritual

250
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,800
potential of that temporary
experience. You know, we can

251
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,580
have that conversation, but
it's, it's not the same as when

252
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,200
you come into these experiences
using what you might think of as

253
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,340
the slow bake method of
sustained contemplation, you

254
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,200
know. So I just always want to
be careful to keep apples and

255
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,200
oranges separate, and because so
many people good point, they

256
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,060
think, Oh, I've had a tremendous
revelatory enlightenment

257
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,060
experience. And that's, you
know, it says, well, good for

258
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,140
you, but, but that's, it's,
that's a temporary experience

259
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,480
Andrew Holecek: that is
unbelievably important. I mean,

260
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,820
how does the saying go? An
enlightened experience does not

261
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,400
make one an enlightened being. I
mean, that's, as you know,

262
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,580
that's a difference in Tibet
language, in between experience

263
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,660
and realization by definition.
Yeah, experience always has a

264
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,060
beginning and an end, yeah. And
in order to mature that, and

265
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,520
that's very interesting, because
that that's a large part of the

266
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,920
path where I think a lot of
people really get tripped up. I

267
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,000
speak from my own experience,
you have these tremendous

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,080
metanoias, these openings. You
think you're enlightened. And

269
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,140
then what do you do? You grasp
after that, and you just replace

270
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,840
a chain made of lead with one
made of gold. And so yeah,

271
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,780
therefore understanding that
there's, there's the path,

272
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,600
quality of of continuing that.
And so just to reinstate a

273
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,860
couple things when you're
talking about deeper states,

274
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,200
just to make sure I'm
understanding you, Chris, it

275
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,200
seems to me that you're also
saying a deeper state is, is

276
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,040
somewhat synonymous with, with a
more open state that is, you're

277
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,960
waking in, you're also expanding
and then, and then, perhaps, as

278
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,560
you pointed out, that that it
then points or directs to us how

279
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,520
it is that we're constructing
this self sense, moment to

280
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,980
moment. This is the other thing
I think, that is incredibly

281
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,540
important, that we tend and I'm
speaking from like confessional

282
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,900
thing, we tend to think that the
ego structure, the self sense,

283
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,560
is this monolithic, reified
entity. And this is where we can

284
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,700
learn a lot from our scientific
brothers and sisters in science,

285
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,540
physics and neuroscience, it's a
process. It's not a product. The

286
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,260
self sense is constantly being
constructed. And therefore, when

287
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,080
you go through this type of de
construction, or demolition

288
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,220
derby, by immediate implication,
you can see through the process

289
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,120
of demolition, the process of
construction, and therefore, how

290
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,100
we are responsible for the way
we contract and we do so largely

291
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,180
for purposes of protection, fear
and the like. But is that? Is

292
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,400
that a fair representation of
what you discovered?

293
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,640
Chris Bache: It is, it's, it's a
fair representation, and it's a

294
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,280
way, it's a description which
fits better, in some ways, the

295
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:48,280
early stages of the work, where
you are still kind of working at

296
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,160
insights which help you
understand your individual way

297
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,260
of being in the world. And then,
you know, I describe my work

298
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,720
fundamentally. Play as a work in
cosmological exploration, where

299
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,200
not only do you leave your
individual ego behind, you know,

300
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,360
at least temporarily and you
leave, but you leave deeper and

301
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,200
deeper levels behind, at least
in my experience, and are given

302
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,980
the opportunity to explore how
the universe constructs its

303
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,560
reality, how archetypal reality
structures time and space

304
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:33,800
reality, how oneness manifests
in the diversity of all physical

305
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,460
of all life forms, of all
atomic, Nuclear, quantum life

306
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:44,740
forms, how the pure void of
emptiness is that mysterious,

307
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,240
fertile essence which is giving
birth to time and space. I mean

308
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,460
the vast, you know, the vastness
of time and space, moment by

309
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,240
moment, minute by minute. So it
is, you know, very useful to

310
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,100
understand your personal way of
contracting, the personal way of

311
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,760
you, know, sustaining your
smallness. But for me, I mean,

312
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,860
not trained as a philosopher, I
wanted to understand the larger

313
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:20,100
spectrum of reality, and so the
invitation that that was given

314
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,700
to me was just to explore how
time and space is made. And I

315
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,720
wish, I mean, I so often wish I
had a PhD in physics and

316
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,900
astrophysics. I mean, I could
have understood so much more of

317
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,180
what I was being shown. But you
know, always, the universe can

318
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,480
only communicate to you
successfully, that which you

319
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,640
have the capacity to understand.

320
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,100
Andrew Holecek: Yes, exactly.
Oh, that's what a fantastic

321
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,460
statement, Chris. Because to me,
it's like, and this is what you

322
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,420
suggest towards the end of your
book, when you were wrestling,

323
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,480
struggling, working with this
process of integration, how, in

324
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,360
a very real way, you using this
particular mechanism, dis

325
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,260
integrated, opened, open, open,
open. And then And then, really,

326
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,000
in my language, in here, using
frameworks that we're both

327
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,280
familiar with, that this notion
of in the Indic Traditions, this

328
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,160
pedagogical approach, I think we
might have hit it last session

329
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,920
of of hearing, contemplating,
meditating, my language and

330
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,820
ingest, digest, metabolize, and
what, the way I read your

331
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,840
experience, that I think is
really worth talking about, is

332
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,860
that you you open to such an
extent, and I can speak a little

333
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,840
bit from my own experience, that
then the issue became one of

334
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,600
digestion and metabolism. And
the reason I mentioned this,

335
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,180
that I think has tremendous
applicability, is that

336
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,580
sometimes, when we look at
things like psychosis, and you

337
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,760
were treading sometimes that
thin membrane between

338
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,340
Transcendence in psychosis, the
loss of self sense, that the the

339
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,260
issue of integration, bringing
that in in a certain way, and

340
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,040
pardon my kind of play on
languaging here is that

341
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,180
psychosis can be, in fact, a
type of eating disorder that you

342
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,440
actually open to such an extent
that then you actually don't

343
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,660
have the capacity, you don't
have the infrastructure, the

344
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,260
wherewithal to digest and
metabolize. And then, instead of

345
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,060
opening body mind. You blow body
mind, and sense of reference is

346
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,060
then completely so decimated
that that is one way to perhaps

347
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,480
talk about the whole psychotic
aspect and the risk, perhaps

348
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,180
some of the perils of doing this
type of deep diving.

349
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,980
Chris Bache: I understand and
you're certainly right that

350
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,480
doing this type of work does
carry certain risks and has to

351
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,880
be approached cautiously and
with careful support structures

352
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,440
in place and careful self
monitoring and so on so forth. I

353
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,820
don't think, and I do understand
the relationship between

354
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,660
psychosis and Transcendence, and
I think it was at Huston Smith

355
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,020
who said a mystic is someone who
learns how to swim in the

356
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,080
waters, in the vast waters, and
a psychotic drown.

357
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,740
Andrew Holecek: That is like
actually, Lang, already Lang,

358
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,520
yeah,

359
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,440
Chris Bache: in my case, I
understand the psychotic looking

360
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,160
qualities of loss of self that,
but I would not ever I would not

361
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,780
describe my experiences walking
that particular edge. And if I

362
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,440
had gotten into a situation
where I felt I was at that edge,

363
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,660
I would have changed course. I
would have done something

364
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,280
differently. My experience was
that by working in a very

365
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,640
carefully clinical type,
modality and opening

366
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,160
systematically. The universe
really opened me systematically,

367
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,700
in a way beyond my calculation.
But it opened me very, very

368
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,400
carefully, and so it peeled me
carefully, and it broke me open,

369
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,800
layer by layer by layer, if it
had. Pulted me, you know,

370
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,520
beyond, beyond beyond so
quickly, then I could have had

371
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,820
problems integration. But in my
experience, I always opened and

372
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,340
I always congealed comfortably
and carefully. And if I had not

373
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,020
congealed comfortably and
carefully, then I would have

374
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,320
been given pause, because that's
a symptom of something really

375
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:31,040
going wrong. So it's not the
depth of loss of self which

376
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,600
marks the psychotic episode. I
think it also has to do with a

377
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,800
kind of confusion, but I
absolutely agree you have to

378
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,140
walk these waters very
carefully. I seem to have a kind

379
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,980
of a natural constitution. I
mean, you know, I started this

380
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,340
work. I never came from any
traumatized background, just the

381
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,000
ordinary, you know, pains of
growing up and whatnot. But I

382
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,340
had fundamentally, a core,
strong self, and I also had a

383
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,900
capacity, it's in my natal
astrological natal chart, a

384
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,700
capacity to open and an interest
in opening up into the vast

385
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:18,060
expanse of consciousness and to
contract back. So if you don't

386
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,520
have that natural capacity, or
if you're bringing in disruptive

387
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,400
trauma or other qualities in
your person, then very much this

388
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,500
work may not be for you. You
know, it's a

389
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:32,899
Andrew Holecek: little bit like
Jack Engler famously said, and I

390
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:34,879
think it's appropriate
statement, you have to be

391
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:38,239
someone before you can be no
one. That's right there. I think

392
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:41,139
that cannot be overstated, that
there the ego itself,

393
00:26:41,139 --> 00:26:43,239
fundamentally, is non
problematic. It's a

394
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:46,179
developmental stage. It's just a
form of Arrested Development.

395
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:50,259
And so if you don't have that
stable self sense, then, in

396
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:54,639
fact, then instead of dis
differentiating, you dissociate.

397
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:57,459
And then that's where it becomes
somewhat problematic. Then the

398
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:00,659
ability to find that identity,
to find some refuge, becomes

399
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,359
really somewhat disconcerting.
But Chris, towards the end of

400
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,539
your book, I want to come back
to this just a little bit,

401
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,359
because my understanding of what
you're sharing towards the end,

402
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,959
like what, what dictated
stopping after the 73rd journey

403
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:17,879
was, and I found this one of the
most compelling, pardon the pun,

404
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:21,319
electrifying parts of your book.
Where it was, it was as if your

405
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,079
body, mind matrix, had become so
open. And we talked about this

406
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,639
last time. This is so important.
This kind of tantric work, body

407
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:31,999
is as important as mine. When
you're opening your mind, you

408
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:35,299
are opening your body. And as
you open your body, even the

409
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:38,419
classic inner yogic sense, all
these energies, what they talk

410
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:41,739
about is the winds come through.
And if those winds aren't

411
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,599
written properly, they can throw
you and so if I understand what

412
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,499
you said towards the end, in a
certain way, your system was

413
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:54,699
running too hot. You there was
so much energy, so much release

414
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,239
that, again, this is this
returns us to this digestion,

415
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:02,099
metabolism component. It was
like my cup runneth over. I

416
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,579
have, I have enough experience
here to spend the rest of this

417
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:09,179
life, or other lives now,
digesting this feast. Yeah, and

418
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,179
so isn't, isn't that a fair way
to recapitulate what you said at

419
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,879
the end, that you stopped the
feast because there was just too

420
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,919
much to eat, so to speak.

421
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,340
Chris Bache: I think, I think
that's a fair description. In my

422
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,180
case, I don't, I think it's not
because I didn't ride the wind

423
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,460
successfully. I think I rode the
wind successfully, but I rode

424
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,120
the winds too long in the sense.
I mean, they were just, they

425
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,560
would stretch me out so so wide
and so deep. And I think this

426
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,000
is, you know, in the early
stages of psychedelic use, both

427
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,480
individually, and I think
culturally, we get excited by

428
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,540
having being able to have
contact with the transcendent

429
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,780
dimensions. And that's so
liberating. And it's so

430
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,680
intellectually, you know,
opening to us to the

431
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,240
intelligence that lives in the
universe, that is the universe,

432
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,360
Unknown: but

433
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,460
Chris Bache: our our tradition
is our theological and even our

434
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,660
contemplative traditions, I
think, tend to accept at the

435
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,920
very highest levels, tend to
underestimate the dimensions of

436
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,840
the Divine, or underestimate the
dimensions of the Universe, so

437
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,240
that leads us to underestimate
how vast the world is that we

438
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,340
can open into. And psychedelics
do give us the capacity, even

439
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,900
when they are used well, and I
hope I use them skillfully and

440
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:45,340
responsibly, but even when I did
that, it basically opened me so

441
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,680
deeply into such intimacy with
the universe, transcending time,

442
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,200
transcending space, and even
though I contracted back, okay,

443
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,980
the memory or the beauty and.
Memory of the communion was just

444
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:11,580
so dear and so intense that I
could not, I could not take

445
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,240
return and coming back. I just
couldn't do it anymore.

446
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,700
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, you
couldn't. You couldn't go to the

447
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,860
train station and leave your
lover one more time,

448
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,080
Chris Bache: right? Yeah, yeah.
And I just, just had to stay

449
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,900
here and let her come to me in
whatever form was possible by me

450
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,180
not going into a non ordinary
state, but staying here and

451
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,540
letting and just digesting like
you say, I picked up a lifetime

452
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,660
and more of experiences to
digest.

453
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,060
Andrew Holecek: So let me ask
you this, and I hope it's okay

454
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,360
if we go into, I mean, the book
itself is so intimate, it's so

455
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,380
personal, that I don't think I'm
violating any borders with you.

456
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,020
But if I go into areas where
it's like, yeah, I don't want to

457
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,140
go there, you will not offend
me. But what you said at the end

458
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,580
so much was the end of the book.
I was really moved by this,

459
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,640
because in a certain way, when I
look back over my own life,

460
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,140
Chris, it became more articulate
over the last couple of years.

461
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,520
My entire life has been is a way
learning how to prepare to die.

462
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,240
I mean, I wrote a book by the
very title, and in the most

463
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,720
elegant way, that journey has
actually brought me more fully

464
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,060
into life than I could have
imagined. So my passion for

465
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,760
death is that has actually
brought me more fully into life

466
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,480
than I could have possibly
imagined. And so I have a deep,

467
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,040
deep fascination, interest in
death, dying, thanatology. To

468
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,640
me, really, the whole spiritual
path is death in slow motion,

469
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,680
opening, titrating, opening on
our terms. But will you share at

470
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,260
the end? I thought was so
beautiful, just to expand we

471
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,640
said here that I in a certain
way I couldn't wait to die, that

472
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,880
I couldn't wait to return to my
beloved. But let me, let me ask

473
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,640
you this, how do you think, why?
What do you expect will happen,

474
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,740
and why do you think somehow
you'll be more prepared for her

475
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,340
ultimate embrace with a
dissolution of your body at the

476
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,920
moment of death than you are
now. I mean, are you perhaps

477
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,100
again? I don't know. Kidding
yourself is very open question.

478
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,700
What is the intuition or the
felt scent that says I can't

479
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,920
wait to dissolve into the
embrace of the beloved at the

480
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,980
moment of death? And then why?
Why do you think you'll be able

481
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,000
to handle that any differently
than you can handle it now,

482
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,680
Chris Bache: I don't think I
would handle it differently at

483
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,800
the moment of my final death,
whenever that takes place, then

484
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,080
I could handle it now. I think
if I were to die right now, the

485
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,800
training that I went through in
my psychedelic work, and it is

486
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,700
just as you say, it is a
training to die, and that

487
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,120
training actually becomes a
training in how to live.

488
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,580
Because, you know, there's like
two realities in the world.

489
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,180
There's the domain of light, I
think of it as pure light, and

490
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,260
then there's the green reality,
which is manifest physical

491
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,860
world, which is the world of,
you know, the world that we are

492
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,120
part of, nirmanakaya. So there's
Dharmakaya and nirmanakaya, and

493
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,840
they are interpenetrating. They
are the same reality experienced

494
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,340
in different modalities. And
what we experience as death is

495
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:22,820
really just a an intersection of
a moment of intersection between

496
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:29,240
these realities. And as you
awaken, you don't you awaken

497
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,180
into a deeper into the fact of
the constant intersection, the

498
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,960
constant simultaneity of these
realities. So what happens when

499
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,700
we die physically and what
happens when we die spiritually,

500
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:52,780
are really deeply one in the
same in a way, and I feel like

501
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:58,240
in my sessions I went through, I
was taken into my own death

502
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,820
process multiple times. I can't
really count how many times I

503
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:08,220
died, and so I have a sense that
I know the pathway well. I read

504
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,780
the literature about the Bardo
confusions that can distract us

505
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,980
and prevent us from returning
fully to a Dharmakaya when we

506
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,820
die. And I recognize that, and I
have, I feel like I've dealt

507
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:33,080
with many of those, and I, I may
be wrong, you know, we'll find

508
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,160
out, yeah, find out the final
exam, right? Yeah, but I have a

509
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:45,220
sense that, to me, death is will
be not only joyful as it is for

510
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:52,720
everybody, but easy, because I
don't feel a deep clinging to

511
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,400
not only my personal identity,
but I don't feel a deep clinging

512
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,360
to human existence or to time
space. Uh so and you're

513
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,120
absolutely right, all spiritual
practice. And I think of

514
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,140
psychedelic practice as I try to
do it as a spiritual practice,

515
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,640
you know, a session. I call them
sessions, not a period of

516
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,920
spiritual practice. Yeah, they
are preparing you for that

517
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,480
moment of death, and if
everything goes well, you do get

518
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,260
to die before you die. Remember
the word those who die before

519
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,340
they die do not die when they
die. So that what would be

520
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,120
lovely if I could experience
what I think of as full

521
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,380
liberation would be if she came
to me while I was still in my

522
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,800
body, and I got to live in the
death state. Yes, I was alive in

523
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,000
the physical state, but it's so

524
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,060
Andrew Holecek: beautiful, and
this is so important.

525
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,520
Chris Bache: This view

526
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,260
Andrew Holecek: alone can
irrevocably, radically alter our

527
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,560
relationship to the end of life
and transition. And by the way,

528
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,100
we should make a deal with each
other. Chris, when I was reading

529
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,360
your book, I thought of the same
thing, that both the use of the

530
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,920
word psychedelic and death. I
think these are branding issues.

531
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,340
We need to rebrand these terms.
So every time I read

532
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,220
psychedelic, it was like
impressed by this ridiculous

533
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,540
condition button to that word.
And so I'm talking about playing

534
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,780
here, but you should replace
every instance of psychedelic

535
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,560
with Entheogen. I should replace
in my work of death and dying.

536
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,560
I'm really going to actively try
to do this because death is such

537
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,460
a reified ridiculous notion. I'm
going to do my best to every

538
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,920
time I use that word as
mindfulness to speech, replace

539
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,420
it with the word transition,
because otherwise death seems so

540
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,540
final, it's so solid, and it's
like this terrible, monolithic

541
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,380
thing, yeah? But no, it's not,
you know, what did Marie Curie

542
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,680
say? Beautifully. He said,
nothing in life is to be feared.

543
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,220
It is only to be understood,
yeah? And so what we're doing

544
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,800
here is this tremendous
understanding. So I want to talk

545
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,800
a little bit about this, because
this is so important for us.

546
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,220
Chris Bache: Well, let me before
we go in the next let me just

547
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,700
hope respond to something you
said, okay, one of the things

548
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,400
that I write about in the book
in the diamond Luminosity

549
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,860
chapter, is, once you've died so
many times and at so many levels

550
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,820
of consciousness, the very
concept of death loses its

551
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,760
meaning because you Learn you
cannot die. The form you are can

552
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,240
die. Everything about all your
understandings and all your

553
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:33,080
history can die, but you cannot
die at that point. You know, in

554
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,640
that diamond Luminosity chapter,
when I made my first transition

555
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,780
into the diamond Luminosity, the
name of that chapter I gave that

556
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:47,080
is the death state. And the song
which I've sung in that chapter,

557
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,100
you know, my, my, if you what we
would usually call the song of

558
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,420
realization, was the death
state, you know. And it the

559
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,840
death state is the awakened
state. It is the it is the

560
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,220
reality state.

561
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,099
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, you're the
very impression. This is exactly

562
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:08,279
the question I was going to ask
you, that when you went through

563
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:14,699
these repetitive openings,
releases and deaths, it became

564
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:18,539
easier. In fact, you became more
familiar with it, right? The

565
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:22,939
very Tibetan word for meditation
to become familiar with. So it's

566
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:25,639
only because, again, we don't,
we're not we don't understand

567
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:29,179
it. We're not familiar with it.
Hence we fear it. And so you die

568
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,019
over and over and over. You
become more familiar with it,

569
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,559
you understand it, you befriend
it, and you go, Oh my gosh. This

570
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,979
is just this natural state of
openness that is only fearful in

571
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:45,039
reference to the ego structure,
to the form which we're

572
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,859
exclusively identified with,
that we're so afraid of letting

573
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,759
go of. So just, I want to
reinstate this. Yeah, it's just

574
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:56,319
so important. It becomes easier.
The more frequently you die in

575
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:59,919
meditation or through these
sessions, or whatever, the more

576
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:03,959
familiar you get with it until
it becomes like his holiness.

577
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:07,679
Karmapa said at the moment he's
transitioned in this beautiful

578
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,939
interview, two days before he
died, nothing happens. Nothing

579
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:16,139
happens to get to that point to
say with utter conviction,

580
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:19,619
nothing happens. Yeah,
unbelievable,

581
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,600
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah, death
becomes your best friend. Truly.

582
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,480
It becomes your best friend. In
your practice, you're always

583
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,820
looking for your best friend.
Now I just want to qualify again

584
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:37,640
a little bit, just the unusual
scope, though, the hardest strip

585
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,140
down that I went through in any
of my sessions, the most

586
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:47,920
extreme, you know destruction of
was in the 70th session, in the

587
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,660
last, what I consider the last
vision I was given in among many

588
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:58,540
major visions. And so at one
level earlier, and I had gone

589
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,800
through so many deaths, and they
do. Get easier, and you look

590
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,740
forward to them, and you embrace
them, and so on and so forth.

591
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,000
And yet I have to put that
beside this particular phenomena

592
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,860
where the transition was not
easy. I didn't resist it. I gave

593
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:20,420
into it, but it was really
extreme, and that's because my

594
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,720
session, or the consciousness
guiding my session was taking me

595
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,580
into an extremely radical state
of consciousness that was deeper

596
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,480
into deep time than it had ever
taken me before. It was giving

597
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:41,200
me one last, culminating series
of teachings that required an

598
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,060
unusually large canvas, and so
it had nothing to do with

599
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,780
personal enlightenment or
personal ego death or something

600
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:56,560
like that. So once again, we
always have to contextualize all

601
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,360
of our observations in terms of
the level of consciousness that

602
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,360
we're working with but in
general, I think you're

603
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,240
absolutely right. The more you
die, the more comfortable you

604
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,580
get with it, but and, and to be
able to say, as the Karmapa did

605
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,100
nothing, nothing happens, is to
be in a cherished, cherished

606
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,700
state,

607
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,980
Andrew Holecek: isn't it? Yeah.
And if we really understand

608
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,080
that, again, returning to the
narrative, the contraction,

609
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,200
openness, narrative, openness
narrative, if we truly

610
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,620
understand and feel in our in
our heart of hearts, that when

611
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,620
we die, it's the ultimate grand
opening, right, there we go.

612
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,800
It's the grand opening. And if
we understand that these are

613
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,560
little miniature openings, we
become more familiar with those

614
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,860
in our meditation state. I mean,
how much of the path is letting

615
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,180
go of identification to thought
the body to exclusive

616
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,080
identification with form. It is
absolutely death in slow motion,

617
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,380
and therefore towards the end of
life, then we really actually

618
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,560
have, like you said, it's a
complete reversal of our normal

619
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,800
fear. Now we actually have
something to look forward to,

620
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,980
instead of going into the Bardos
looking through the rear view

621
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,940
mirror. That's what makes
everything so painful. We

622
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,700
actually now have something to
look forward to is the big

623
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,620
unwind. The big unwind, yeah,
the final exhalation, the final

624
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:15,360
openness, which is absolutely
fundamentally ecstatic. It's

625
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,960
this release into the into the
blood. And so this is so

626
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,360
important, and I love your
languaging here of the return to

627
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,860
the Beloved. Because if we have
this again in a heart of hearts,

628
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:32,420
if we know that we are going to
return to the embrace of the

629
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,240
Beloved, you're going to return
to your lover at the moment to

630
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,060
death and be held in this
ultimate holding environment. Oh

631
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,180
my goodness, does that change
our relationship to the end of

632
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,080
life? I am going to return to
the embrace of the cosmic

633
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,860
mother. Wow, these are then you
die as a sinner with a smile on

634
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,160
your face, instead of kicking
and screaming and making a

635
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,640
really difficult transition. So
this cannot, in my opinion, be

636
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,680
overstated, because this will
radically change the way we

637
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,060
relate to old age sickness. As I
look down and this apparatus has

638
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,000
served me pretty well for
decades, is starting to crumble.

639
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,840
Yeah, instead of Oh crap, it's
oh wow, yeah. It's like,

640
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,440
whatever,

641
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,660
Chris Bache: yeah. It's the one
wonderful joy and mercy of life

642
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,480
that they it can't stop you from
dying. You know, it's like, the

643
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,860
older you get, every you get one
foot closer to joy and ecstasy

644
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,180
and the whole attempt to, you
know, cryogenics, to not die and

645
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,660
to freeze the body, that's just
sort of so sad. I mean, it's

646
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:41,200
just so terribly sad. And it's
not, you know, yeah, it's such

647
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,020
that's why, you know, I taught
near death episode research for

648
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,320
years in my courses, along with
reincarnation research and other

649
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:52,180
things. And over and over and
over again when students, when I

650
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,840
went with students through this
wonderful literature, and they

651
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,440
watched how those people's lives
were totally changed. Their

652
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,420
relationship to death was
totally changed by their

653
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,960
temporary experience of what's
on the other side of death, and

654
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,860
having experienced the beloved
in their own form of the beloved

655
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,920
that had an experience of
softening permanently their own

656
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,220
fear of death and changing their
expectations. So this is, you

657
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,740
know, this death research is
really, really a powerful psycho

658
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,940
spiritual work.

659
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,059
Andrew Holecek: I couldn't agree
more, the work of Greyson and

660
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:35,119
Eben Alexander and others who
come back with these really

661
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,019
remarkable stories. And I think
this also is worth reinstating

662
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:44,559
that I believe it's like, I've
never had an official n de, but

663
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,639
I've had what I call meditative
and the ease. And to me, it's

664
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:51,699
like you don't have to have
these over and over for them to

665
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:55,779
change your life. You just need
one. And it's because, and I

666
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:58,299
wonder if this resonates with
you, it's because they're so

667
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:05,519
true. There's. So real that it
just takes one to completely

668
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,819
change the texture of your life.
And this is, as you know, they

669
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:12,419
are using these agents now to
remove fear of death for people

670
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:16,259
who are just terrified, one
session, one session will

671
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:19,619
completely open you to the point
where all fear of death is done

672
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:20,959
and over with. That's no small

673
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:24,739
Chris Bache: as you say it.
People say, Well, how do you

674
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:27,499
know what you whether what you
experienced was real? Maybe it

675
00:45:27,499 --> 00:45:30,859
was just a complicated
hallucination or self fulfilling

676
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:34,759
prophecy, and it's like, no, you
know what reality feels like,

677
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:38,359
and this is more real than the
physical real. It is a hyper

678
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:42,879
reality. It's just, it's
objectivity is unmistakable,

679
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:46,479
yeah, and you don't have to, you
don't can't quibble with it.

680
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:49,539
Don't need to argue with it.
Don't need to question it's

681
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:52,239
just, it's obviously true,

682
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,580
Andrew Holecek: exactly, and
then really, again, come back

683
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:59,500
and come back to the contraction
thing. It is, in fact, egos,

684
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:04,680
inability to digest, metabolize
that that then contracts against

685
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,240
it and fights against it is a
type of reducing valve. I love

686
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,960
Huxley. What Huxley said, the
brain reducing valve that. And

687
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,480
on one level, we need it,
because it's like you said, we

688
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,040
don't have the capacity to be
developmentally that open. And

689
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,300
so we, on one level, we need
this type of reduction in order

690
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,960
to survive. But really, I would
argue that's what constitutes

691
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,660
growth. Is reducing the reducing
valve continuing to open until

692
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,760
we can actually become this
ultimate openness in this and in

693
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,420
that sense, become the cosmos
itself. And so this ties into

694
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,760
what we're talking about last
time that. And I love what you

695
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,500
said about this, that in order
to become, I don't remember your

696
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,020
exact terms, but something like,
in order to become one with the

697
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,500
universe, we first need to
become one with the self. And

698
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,860
you could say they're the same,
right? Can you say a little bit

699
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,600
more about that? How that was,
yeah, kind of played out in your

700
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,660
own experience, because I think
again, this is where we go and

701
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,980
we die, right? We become nothing
simultaneously. We become

702
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,520
everything.

703
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:14,640
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, the
experience was to become one

704
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,120
with all of existence. You know,
we would say, to become one with

705
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,520
God, to become one with the
universe, to become one with

706
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:28,640
one. We can't do that if we're
not one within ourselves, if we

707
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,960
have unintegrated pieces of
shadow or ego fragments or

708
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:38,660
untouchable wounds or bruises.
So when you when you move into

709
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:43,600
intimacy with life, life life
itself brings these unintegrated

710
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,260
pieces to the surface, so you
can make your peace with them,

711
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:52,000
and so you can reabsorb them, so
you can be become whole and

712
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,180
coherent within your own being.
Because how could you become one

713
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:03,300
with life if you're not one with
yourself. And so it's not, you

714
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,600
know, just these things develop
synergistically. The deeper your

715
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,840
experience of oneness with life,
the deeper your experience of

716
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,340
oneness with yourself, until
they're stopped, until these

717
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,720
divisions, just they disappear
inside of yourself. And I think

718
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,760
one of the wonderful qualities
we appreciate about awakened

719
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,500
beings is there, is there
integrity? Is there oneness,

720
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,120
their sense of deep relaxation
within themselves, which is a

721
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,640
outgrowth of their intimacy with
life itself?

722
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,200
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, and isn't
that? Isn't that fantastic, the

723
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,120
way it yet again, this
reiterates the process of

724
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,800
reiteration itself, that by
learning to, in fact, embrace

725
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,520
ourselves, and again, talk about
practical my tree, loving

726
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,020
kindness, learning to, in a
Certain Way, unite, befriend

727
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,280
every aspect of our usually
disenfranchised spectrum of our

728
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,760
being, all the parts that we
reject that we then throw into

729
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,580
the unconscious mind that keeps
a large part of the unconscious

730
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,400
mind going. And so therefore, to
me, Chris, it's like when we

731
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,860
understand the divine nature of
reality, which includes the

732
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:24,440
divine nature of the the entire
spectrum of my being, then what,

733
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,280
without this framework, would be
considered the shadow elements,

734
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,320
the thing, the parts of
ourselves that we don't want to

735
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,920
embrace, that we that, therefore
we spend our lives on a certain

736
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,580
very sophisticated avoidance
strategy. If we understand

737
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:41,740
through this view, say, Yes,
befriend every aspect of your

738
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,280
own being. I mean, again, like
with death, this radically

739
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,380
changes the way we relate to the
unwanted, so called aspects of

740
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,220
our own spectrum. We're being
right here and right now. We

741
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,640
learn how to open, open and say
yes to whatever takes place, and

742
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,020
then that type of integration, I
love, this. The interjection of

743
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,220
the integrity we feel people
then leads to fundamental

744
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,860
integration with the so called
outside world altogether.

745
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,639
Chris Bache: Yeah, and one of
the, one of the last pieces, of

746
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,059
course, well recognized in the
spiritual traditions, is the

747
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:19,679
importance of giving up private
enlightenment, you know, because

748
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,199
that's just spiritual shadow, so
that the more you know,

749
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:28,219
everything you do for others is
part of is your awakening, and

750
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:31,999
everything you do for yourself,
including trying to become

751
00:50:31,999 --> 00:50:34,399
enlightened, it gets in your
way.

752
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,920
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, yeah,
yeah. This and again, this

753
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,180
brings the social nexus of the
path into play, which I love,

754
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,760
what you write about in your
book that we tend to think and I

755
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,540
think provisionally So, if we
look at the term Hinata in its

756
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,080
kind of pedagogical approach,
there's a lot to be said about

757
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,040
start at home, start where you
are, clean up with your stuff.

758
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,360
But the near, but the near enemy
of that is then you become a

759
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,860
little bit myopic, little bit
near sighted. And for me, I say

760
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,700
this with as part of my path. I
mean, on one level, I'm the

761
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,940
happiest when I'm down in my
study, writing, being my nerd

762
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,260
and on retreat. But then, like I
did my long retreat, by design,

763
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,280
with others, you can't wake up
without others, and therefore

764
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,400
then others become your path,
the we aspect, the social,

765
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,120
cultural aspect. I think this is
incredibly important. I speak

766
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,660
from my own experience, because
otherwise, then the solitary

767
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:36,500
path, the solitary realizing
path, can become a real trap

768
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,560
that that again, in the
narrative of opening, opening,

769
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,480
we then work with the people
that press our buttons. We've

770
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,940
installed those buttons, so
that's interesting. But

771
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,240
bringing, bringing, you know, I
hit a little run in this morning

772
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,720
with the guy who cuts my lawn,
and I paid very close attention

773
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,200
to that. I said, Oh, first of
all, I capitulated to my habit

774
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,960
patterns. It was like, Oh crap.
There was that again. And then

775
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,440
as I stepped away for a second,
I said, Oh my gosh, that was

776
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,580
Padmasambhava teaching me about
patience and so to me, as I come

777
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,840
out, and I come out in my really
long three year retreat, my

778
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:14,040
aspiration now is to enter
lifetime retreat with this view

779
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,900
that all these annoying again,
that's just my projection, all

780
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,120
these annoying aspects of my
reality now, those are my path.

781
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,860
And I love this because there's
tremendous power in tradition.

782
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,680
And path is it's traditionally
put forth. But there's also

783
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,120
colossal enemies, and one of
these is just that is that you I

784
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,480
can only do this one all the
atmospheric conditions are right

785
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,340
in my own life, right? And as
the world is going to crap right

786
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,520
now, I think this becomes a
little bit more helpful for us

787
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,480
to bring this kind of view to so
called unwanted experiences, so

788
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,540
that we can bring those onto our
own path, realizing that they

789
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:57,460
are our path. Yeah, yep. So
anyway, it's like you're

790
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,660
interviewing me. I need to back
up a little bit. I get so

791
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,760
excited I can't help myself.
With your permission, Chris, I

792
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,020
want to transition into what,
again, I thought was just such a

793
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,340
dazzling section in your book.
Let's talk a little bit more, if

794
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:18,660
you would, about the the light,
the diamond Luminosity you

795
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,420
mentioned several times early
on, this, this phenomena of

796
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:28,820
light, this is, to me, among the
most profound aspects of the

797
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:34,460
whole shebang. And so if you can
maybe walk us through your

798
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:40,060
exploration of this light and
how it worked with you on the

799
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:44,680
path to introduce you to, I
think, is this, this fundamental

800
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,660
kind of matrix of reality?

801
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:52,059
Chris Bache: Well, this
transition took place 15 years

802
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:57,099
into my work. So I had already
gone through ego death. I'd gone

803
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:01,199
through the ocean of suffering,
of collective suffering. I had

804
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:06,539
navigated through archetypal
reality, both the sort of

805
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:13,319
Platonic archetypes and the
tissue of our of our species

806
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:17,999
mind, the tissue of the human
psyche, and then had been taken

807
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:22,999
into this year of incredible
blessings, of of experiences of

808
00:54:22,999 --> 00:54:28,219
oneness, of Shunyata, emptiness,
of self, cosmic love, primal

809
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:33,319
void. You know, I felt
profoundly existentially

810
00:54:33,499 --> 00:54:37,519
complete. I mean, I I felt like
I had been asked to give

811
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,839
something in the ocean of
suffering, work, and I gave it,

812
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:45,159
and the universe had just
rewarded me with just a cascade

813
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:49,359
of blessings that left me
feeling profoundly existentially

814
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,979
complete. I mean, I had been
given a deep experience of and a

815
00:54:53,979 --> 00:54:57,459
new understanding of
reincarnation that transcended

816
00:54:57,879 --> 00:55:01,859
classical, you know, Easter. And
understandings of reincarnation.

817
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:05,459
I had been taken into the birth
of the diamond soul. I had been

818
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:09,479
given many visionary experiences
of where humanity was going in

819
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:12,899
the future human. And I reviewed
these things, just to sort of

820
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,299
give a context. And along the
way, I had experienced light

821
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,939
many times in different
modalities in different forms.

822
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:28,819
And then in the I came into a
time when I went through yet one

823
00:55:28,819 --> 00:55:33,679
more very, very intense death
process, which took an entire

824
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:38,959
session, and then the next
session I began immediately and

825
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:43,899
trust transported into the
fruition portion of the session

826
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:49,479
in which I was taken into this
light that was beyond any light

827
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:53,619
that I had experienced before. I
dissolved into a Luminosity that

828
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:59,199
was absolutely spell binding and
intoxicating. And in my notes, I

829
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:04,919
called it the death state,
because it I entered it in a

830
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:11,279
form of dying, which was an
ultimate form of dying. It a key

831
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:17,819
point. I was surrounded by a
swirling circle, a disc that

832
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:22,699
contained all the moments of my
life and I would fall from the

833
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:27,379
center into this circle and
touch one of some aspect of my

834
00:56:27,379 --> 00:56:32,719
life. And I would instantly die
into the state of Luminosity,

835
00:56:32,899 --> 00:56:36,199
and then be brought back to the
center and fall in a different

836
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:39,799
direction, touching another
different set of experiences.

837
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:44,619
And as soon as I did, I would
instantly be taken into this

838
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:48,159
death state. And this went over
and over, happened over and

839
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:54,519
over, until eventually there was
no going and coming. There was

840
00:56:54,519 --> 00:57:00,839
just a permanent abiding, or at
least a session abiding, in this

841
00:57:00,899 --> 00:57:07,199
transcendent Luminosity, the
death state, I would say

842
00:57:07,259 --> 00:57:14,639
ecstasy. And it's true, but it's
it's a different than earlier

843
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:20,239
forms of ecstasy. It just the
most striking characteristic of

844
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:24,739
it, for me, was its clarity,
clarity, clarity, clarity. I

845
00:57:24,739 --> 00:57:27,499
mean, it was the context within
which all thinking and all

846
00:57:27,499 --> 00:57:32,119
feeling took place. But in
itself, it was hyper, hyper,

847
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,659
hyper, hyper clear,
breathtakingly clear. Just took

848
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:42,819
my breath away, and I understood
the teachings that even just

849
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:48,759
touching something like this for
one second dissolves 1000s of

850
00:57:48,759 --> 00:57:54,159
years of wandering around in the
shadows of Samsara, it, and I,

851
00:57:54,279 --> 00:58:00,059
as I came to understand it, this
was what I understood to be

852
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:05,399
extra samsaric reality, and a
particularly intense version of

853
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:09,359
extra samsaric reality. At first
I thought of it in terms of

854
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,859
sambhagaya because of the
extreme bliss of it. But as I

855
00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:17,279
really went back to the sources
and studied them more carefully,

856
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:21,139
I came to associate it with
Dharmakaya, the clear light of

857
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:26,839
absolute reality. The next
session, when I went back, of

858
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:31,039
course, all I wanted to do was
get back into this condition. I

859
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,519
had no interest in exploring the
other dimensions that I had gone

860
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:40,059
into, but I did, wasn't taken
back into this experience, and I

861
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:43,479
wasn't taken back for another
year and five more sessions,

862
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:48,219
very intense purification, very
intense kind of cleansing and

863
00:58:48,219 --> 00:58:53,259
healing, other things going on.
And it was after a year that I

864
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:59,439
went into the diamond Luminosity
for the second time. And this is

865
00:58:59,439 --> 00:59:02,159
what happened over the next
several years, that it would

866
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:06,239
take about a year of very, very
intense work, and then I would

867
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:11,339
die awake and again into the
diamond Luminosity. The second

868
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,879
time I went into the diamond
Luminosity was the deepest

869
00:59:14,879 --> 00:59:21,139
experience of it that I had any
time in any of my sessions. And

870
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:27,619
it was in that deep immersion
that I had my cosmological

871
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:33,859
vision completely reversed and
turned upside down. I had the

872
00:59:33,859 --> 00:59:38,179
experience of a reality of Light
Beyond the diamond Luminosity,

873
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:44,919
light I award my field pivoted.
I saw reality Far, Far in the

874
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:49,419
distance that was just
exquisitely beautiful light. A

875
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:54,459
ray of light hit me, and it
completely shattered me. And I

876
00:59:54,459 --> 00:59:58,119
called it the absolute light.
You know? It was a light beyond

877
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:03,091
even diamond Luminosity and. In
that one second, I understood

878
01:00:03,451 --> 01:00:06,691
that it's an infinite
progression, and I had to give

879
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:11,251
up completely the idea of ever
coming to some type of end

880
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:15,031
state, because always, my
spiritual tradition had taught

881
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:17,971
me there were end states. That's
why I was doing this work, to

882
01:00:17,971 --> 01:00:23,899
reach home, or to become one
with God or to become, you know,

883
01:00:23,899 --> 01:00:27,439
one with the universe and some
fundamental, you know, dissolve

884
01:00:27,439 --> 01:00:31,339
into the meta, cosmic void. And
I began to realize that with

885
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:35,659
that instant, I realized, no,
it's an infinite progression,

886
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:41,919
and death will keep coming back
as long as you keep pushing,

887
01:00:41,919 --> 01:00:47,799
because you never going to reach
the end of it. At that point in

888
01:00:47,799 --> 01:00:51,039
the next time I went into the
depths, into the diamond

889
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,099
Luminosity, and the fourth and
final time I went into the

890
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:58,059
diamond Luminosity, I wasn't
going deeper into the diamond

891
01:00:58,059 --> 01:01:01,919
Luminosity, but the diamond
Luminosity was crunching itself

892
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:08,099
more deeply into my being, and
all the lessons were shifting

893
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:12,719
and pivoting around that it was
dissolving the structure of my

894
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:16,079
body. I mean, I could feel it
crunching itself into my

895
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:23,479
cellular makeup and very, very
intense physical detoxification,

896
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:29,059
purification processes. And then
this eventually culminated in

897
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:35,599
the fourth session into the in
the experience of giving me an

898
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,839
initiation into the Buddha
nature, into the pure nature of

899
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:50,079
mind, and I began to understand
that that magnificent reality,

900
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:55,059
which has no beginning, it has
no end. It always is, always has

901
01:01:55,059 --> 01:01:59,139
been. We never have stepped out
of that. We never step into it.

902
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:05,519
It is the it is the abiding
foundation of all existence that

903
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:11,819
is, in a sense, the embodied
diamond Luminosity. It is, it is

904
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:15,719
the closest I've come to to
experiencing what diamond

905
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:21,199
Luminosity is like in the body.
My other experiences of diamond

906
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:24,859
Luminosity, or diamond
Luminosity as they exist as an

907
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:31,759
extra physical reality, an extra
Samsara reality. But this was an

908
01:02:31,759 --> 01:02:38,539
experience of pure light as the
foundation of my very physical

909
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:42,759
existence. Okay, that was the
last time I experienced the

910
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,419
diamond Luminosity. From there,
I went through a couple of

911
01:02:46,419 --> 01:02:51,099
experiences, then the final
vision in the 70th session, and

912
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:55,959
then basically the consciousness
guiding my work wrapped it up,

913
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:59,079
gave me a last set of
instructions and sent me on my

914
01:02:59,079 --> 01:02:59,559
way. Oh, I

915
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,559
Andrew Holecek: just want to
take want to take 15 seconds to

916
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,379
pause and just digest that a
little bit.

917
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:16,499
Chris Bache: I understand. I've
been digesting it for 20

918
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,420
Andrew Holecek: years, because
the the ineffable enormity of

919
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:27,920
it, it, this, this, it's a
wonderful is you're sharing this

920
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,500
with me, Chris. And by the way,
thank you so much for trusting

921
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:36,440
to do that. I find this very
interesting dance between kind

922
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:41,440
of the mythopoetic aspect of my
being and rendering just bathing

923
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,580
in the artistry of what you
shared versus Okay, formulating

924
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:51,160
whatever in terms of my
references. And so I mean, on

925
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,760
one level, I almost hesitate to
say anything, because what can

926
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:57,640
one say without just kind of
literally watering it down,

927
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:03,660
distorting it but with your
understanding, Chris of of

928
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:07,500
Buddhist nomenclature, because I
remember in your book, you also

929
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,880
shared somewhat interesting
synchronicity, that when the

930
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,580
diamond Luminosity was
introduced to you in this way,

931
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:18,720
literally almost same same day
kind of thing, the Vajrayana

932
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,320
then became part of your journey
and your path. And so using that

933
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,220
languaging is very interesting
for me. When you say these

934
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:32,120
things. I find it very, very
interesting, humbling

935
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:39,620
exploration of my referencing in
will, capacity or lack thereof,

936
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:42,280
to understand it okay, like, for
instance, oh, that sounds like

937
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,180
the Dharma talk. Oh, that sounds
like the Dharma Datu. And I

938
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:50,740
really hesitate to say that,
because on one level, you, I

939
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,280
think you understand it, shrink
wraps the enormity of what

940
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:59,260
you're saying into these names.
But on another level, we can sit

941
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:03,180
here in silence. Or we can do
the best we can with language to

942
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,420
talk about something that
transcends language and so we do

943
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:11,220
with we can. Yeah. So with that
said, Would you, would you,

944
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,820
would you resonate with your
understanding of the Buddhist

945
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:19,020
tradition and descriptions of
someone analogous states clear

946
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:22,460
light mind. Is that another
quality that comes in that could

947
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,420
say this, you use the term
diamond Luminosity. Interesting

948
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:30,440
Vajrayana is the diamond path.
But using, and again, without

949
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,820
any violation of your own
personal experience, are there

950
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:41,020
other Tibetan languaging or
Buddhist terms that would relate

951
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,900
to what you experienced that you
could say that really sounds

952
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,560
like the Dharma data you've used
Dharmakaya before. But again,

953
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,460
I'm trying to simply relate,
using my reference structures,

954
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:52,720
to what you're sharing.

955
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:57,399
Chris Bache: Yes, there are, I
mean, clear light mind, to me,

956
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:04,139
is maybe closer to the nature of
mind in term that quality in

957
01:06:04,259 --> 01:06:09,599
this is I still, I still am
digesting, I'm still trying to

958
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,159
appreciate some of the
differences between the diamond

959
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:18,419
Luminosity as an extra samsaric
reality, and Then the diamond

960
01:06:18,419 --> 01:06:24,559
Luminosity as at the foundation
of nirmanakaya existence. So

961
01:06:25,759 --> 01:06:33,199
there certainly are many
correlations and and again, all

962
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:37,099
honor to the Great Beings who
have explored these dimensions

963
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:41,499
much more deeply than I've been
able to so I mean, always,

964
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:47,679
always humble student, truly
humble student of the great

965
01:06:47,859 --> 01:06:53,859
teachers. In this respect, I put
the names as best as I can to

966
01:06:53,859 --> 01:06:56,979
clarify or to qualify, but
you're right. I mean, it's

967
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,179
tricky because you can this can
get shrink wrapped, and that

968
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:05,159
just stops the mystery and just
lets the mind back in where it

969
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:08,639
really doesn't belong. So let me
just give this a step into a

970
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:10,079
little different framework. The

971
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:20,779
universe is 13 point 7 billion
years old. Our planet it's about

972
01:07:20,779 --> 01:07:25,459
four and a half billion years
old. When we plot the the

973
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:30,379
evolving structure of Homo you
know, we go through home,

974
01:07:30,979 --> 01:07:35,179
erectus, Homo sapiens, you know,
the various stages we got, the

975
01:07:35,179 --> 01:07:39,559
big brain, the 50% increase in
our brain, about 100,000 years

976
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:46,119
ago, self awareness begins to
emerge. You know, along the way

977
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:51,639
and about three to 5000 years
ago, we began to develop the

978
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:55,059
technology, the spiritual
technology, that allows us to

979
01:07:55,059 --> 01:07:59,559
concentrate our mind and bring
us down into that part of our

980
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:05,519
being where we are not of the
private self, but we touch the

981
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:10,319
life of the world. We touch that
which is universal. And there's

982
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:13,979
this tremendous aha, this
awakened sense, and we've

983
01:08:13,979 --> 01:08:19,199
applied all sorts of names to
that experience of our true

984
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:27,919
nature, our essential nature.
Now, what whatever this is, and

985
01:08:27,919 --> 01:08:30,739
I think you and I have a pretty
good sense of what that

986
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:37,759
experience is, what this is. It
is the tip of the iceberg of the

987
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:42,819
unfolding, the intentional,
exquisite unfolding of this

988
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:46,719
trans, extraordinary
consciousness that we might call

989
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,419
divinity, or maybe not want to
call it divinity, this unfolding

990
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:56,799
which has been gestating in
creation for 13 point 7 billion

991
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,279
years, and that's only in this
big bang. We don't know how many

992
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:03,539
other expansions and
contractions of earlier

993
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:07,439
universes precede this
particular Big Bang explosion?

994
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:14,819
We don't know. I mentioned this
just to underscore the enormity,

995
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:20,479
the profoundness of the reality
within which awakening takes

996
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:26,179
place, and the reality within
which even deeper and deeper and

997
01:09:26,179 --> 01:09:29,959
deeper awakenings take place, as
have been recognized by our

998
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:34,459
spiritual traditions, our
spiritual additions are only

999
01:09:34,519 --> 01:09:39,559
345, 1000 years old, and that's
a lot of time for an incarnating

1000
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:45,699
soul to penetrate into the
deeper texture of existence. But

1001
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:51,579
if we were to go forward in time
100,000 years, and that's a wink

1002
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:56,859
of cosmic time, but if we went
forward 100,000 years, surely,

1003
01:09:56,979 --> 01:10:01,799
reasonably, we would expect our
great. Great spiritual teachers

1004
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:06,539
to be having deeper experiences
of the universe than our best

1005
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:11,279
spiritual teachers today are
capable of having, because it's

1006
01:10:11,339 --> 01:10:14,939
it's an ongoing developmental
process of exploring the deep

1007
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:19,559
mystery. So on the one hand, I
want to honor and affirm the

1008
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:25,639
categories and description.
Descriptions of the beings who

1009
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:30,679
have lived up to this point in
time, and I place my experiences

1010
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:35,779
at their feet, and I I seek
their guidance and understanding

1011
01:10:35,959 --> 01:10:40,779
what has taken place. But just
as the absolute light came from

1012
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:45,579
a reality far beyond whatever
the diamond Luminosity is.

1013
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:51,159
Likewise, evolution is
continuing. Evolution is

1014
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:58,899
developing, and we are nowhere
near even 10% of human

1015
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:05,519
development. And so I would
expect and almost demand that we

1016
01:11:06,419 --> 01:11:11,999
expect deeper and deeper and
deeper capacities for spiritual

1017
01:11:11,999 --> 01:11:18,119
experience to continue to
emerge. So on the one hand, we

1018
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:22,879
want to use the categories to to
help us hold on, to illumine,

1019
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,539
understand. On the other hand,
we don't want to shrink wrap

1020
01:11:26,539 --> 01:11:31,219
them. We want to stay open. And
staying open in this way, I

1021
01:11:31,219 --> 01:11:37,519
think, is to stay open into is
to stay open to a deeper

1022
01:11:37,519 --> 01:11:42,399
intimacy with the beloved, to
stay open to the light that is

1023
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:47,019
the light that gives birth to
the world, second by second.

1024
01:11:47,799 --> 01:11:49,779
Andrew Holecek: That's really
that's exquisite. And what comes

1025
01:11:49,779 --> 01:11:53,679
to mind again is this wonderful
kind of fundamental archetypal

1026
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,219
narrative of openness, where on
one level, the invitation here

1027
01:11:57,219 --> 01:12:01,859
is an ideological openness that
we can very easily, again, the

1028
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:06,059
near enemy of tradition, like
you, I have tremendous, oh, my

1029
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:09,719
goodness, tremendous allegiance,
respect for tradition. But if

1030
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:12,959
tradition isn't you, I think you
understand this in the best

1031
01:12:12,959 --> 01:12:16,619
sense of the word. Isn't
modernized without being edited

1032
01:12:16,619 --> 01:12:20,539
and distorted, then it can
become ossified. You can reify

1033
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:23,539
even the tradition, and then we
become closed around our

1034
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:27,319
ideologies and belief systems.
And so what I hear you saying

1035
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:30,619
that I really appreciate is this
idol ideological openness.

1036
01:12:30,619 --> 01:12:34,639
Let's, let's keep even open to
that. But Chris, if I might a

1037
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:39,979
question of clarity, and then a
few other things when you, when

1038
01:12:39,979 --> 01:12:43,599
you use the word extra Samsara
that that is not a term that's

1039
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:47,799
in my common vocabulary. What
What do you mean when you talk

1040
01:12:47,799 --> 01:12:52,059
about the light as extra do you
mean post trans Samsara? What do

1041
01:12:52,059 --> 01:12:53,259
you mean by extra

1042
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:56,500
Chris Bache: Samsara? I mean
beyond the Bardo, beyond all the

1043
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:02,460
layers of the Bardo, beyond all
Samsara, at a place where the

1044
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,860
patterns of cyclic existence
have been eclipsed. My sense of

1045
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:12,840
it is that in between, you know
the physical reality and the

1046
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,560
rhythms of physical reality.
When we die, we enter into

1047
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:20,600
various patterns of Bardo
reality, various spiritual

1048
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,760
states, but eventually that says
many, many, many layers, 1000s

1049
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,300
of layers, but one can go beyond
that in what is the nature of

1050
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:34,280
reality that's beyond the Bardo
existence? Yeah, the Buddha

1051
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,640
refused to describe it very
wisely, right? Says, you know,

1052
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,040
just experience it for yourself.
And you know, and my sense is

1053
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:46,420
that outside of that, what
happens in the upper Bardo and

1054
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,840
it the light gets brighter and
brighter and brighter until you

1055
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:54,220
move into a world which is all
light, it's just all light, and

1056
01:13:54,220 --> 01:14:01,860
the quality of Light is is it's
different because it's trans

1057
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:08,160
Bardo and all individualized
existence, and here I have to be

1058
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:15,600
careful, because I for one, do
not see individuality as the

1059
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,500
energy enemy of Spiritual
Awakening, because when we

1060
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:25,340
stabilize deep, deep spiritual
awakening. Our individuality is

1061
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,700
limit, liberated, not
extinguished. So I don't want to

1062
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:32,300
say that in the domain of extra
Samsara Luminosity, there is no

1063
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:41,200
individuality, but it is an
extraordinarily translucent or

1064
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,100
an extraordinarily transparent
individuality.

1065
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,900
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, I'm going
to make it a practice to just

1066
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:57,820
pause and work with my usually
incredibly habituated reflex to

1067
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,380
fill the space after you make
these i. Amazing statements,

1068
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:06,060
because I want to rest in the
somatic impact of what you're

1069
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:10,140
sharing and not capitulate to my
usual intellectual contractive

1070
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,460
predispositions, which I don't
think pay respect and honor to

1071
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:20,900
what we're trying to discuss
here. But let me ask you this,

1072
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:23,900
Chris, so when this is very
interesting, I mean, there's so

1073
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:29,000
many very profound principles
being explored and even

1074
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,660
challenged here. So I'm
wondering how what you're

1075
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:38,720
sharing with this. And I was, I
was probably as surprised when I

1076
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,620
read this as you were when you
experienced it, the the

1077
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,160
dissolution of the so called
omega point, that there isn't

1078
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:51,520
some final destination. And I'm
wondering how you might

1079
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,380
reconcile or balance what you
experience as this endless

1080
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,560
evolutionary unfolding with
things, so to speak, quote,

1081
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,900
unquote, like the changeless
nature. And the reason I

1082
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,900
mentioned this is one way that
I've played with this, and

1083
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:11,280
again, wonderful to be open
challenged along these fronts,

1084
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:15,720
is that on one level, emptiness,
in this case, emptiness is

1085
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:21,080
Dharmakaya. Emptiness doesn't
evolve. Form evolves. And so I'm

1086
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,500
wondering how that lands with
you. When, when the Buddhist

1087
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:28,820
tradition talks about Buddha,
nature is changeless nature. How

1088
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:32,660
can something change and evolve
that doesn't have form? That's

1089
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:38,840
the an oxymoron. Form evolves,
not emptiness. So how does that

1090
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,220
land with you? How do you again?
It's like, oh, they we're

1091
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:47,740
getting down to the razor's edge
of everything here. So how do

1092
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:51,640
you is that a dissonance with
you? Or where? How do you play

1093
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,600
with that?

1094
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,900
Chris Bache: It's, I don't feel
it as a dissonance, and it is a

1095
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:02,880
deep mystery, which I don't
pretend to fathom in any

1096
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,940
profound, you know way. So I'll
just share a few bits and pieces

1097
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:21,260
on those occasions when I have
relaxed into, fallen into, been

1098
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:26,420
drawn into the unchanging
condition, the unchanging

1099
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:31,220
reality, the reality within
which everything arises and

1100
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:37,520
passes away and it itself is not
impacted at all. It is, it

1101
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:45,160
appears to be, the fertile
empty, the fertile void. I want

1102
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,000
to hold back emptiness there,
the fertile void from within

1103
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:56,860
which all existence springs.
Now, if we then step into the

1104
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:05,520
existence that springs from
within this cosmic, fertile,

1105
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:11,220
emptiness or void, what's
happening. And we just look at

1106
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:14,460
the big bang, and we look at the
magnificent story of the the

1107
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:19,620
explosion of energy and the
congealing into matter and the

1108
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:23,060
formation of galaxies and the
formation of solar systems and

1109
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:28,940
Sun Life, and then emergence of
life and the emergence of self

1110
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,540
and then self awareness, and so
on and so forth. Clearly,

1111
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:37,220
existence seems to be going
somewhere, and it seems to just

1112
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:42,040
delight in in the in form and
the unfolding and

1113
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:46,660
complexification and making self
aware and awakening and and

1114
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:51,700
empowering and the the
empowering of the soul, as our

1115
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:55,960
former life memories become
conscious and we wake up to our

1116
01:18:56,380 --> 01:19:00,900
100,000 Year identity, not just
our 100 Year identity. So form

1117
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:05,340
is going somewhere, and that
which is driving form is going

1118
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:10,800
somewhere, and it's it's just
the magnificent creativity of

1119
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,580
the universe. And that's why you
know the mind of the universe,

1120
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,580
because I didn't want to call it
God, and that's why I got to

1121
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,840
ever really comfortable with the
word Entheogen, because that has

1122
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,720
Theos and our understandings of
God are so limited, so I yield

1123
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:32,300
into the cosmologist language of
the universe, because we measure

1124
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,320
the universe in light years 6
million million miles, and it's

1125
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:41,560
billions of light years across
that bag that huge. And yet,

1126
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:46,660
when we right now, as we become
self conscious as this, you

1127
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:51,880
know, complex biped, and we drop
our awareness down to the center

1128
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:58,360
of our self, what we find is
this magnificent reality which

1129
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:03,780
feels to be a. Unchanging, and
yet it seems to be at the center

1130
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,340
of everything which is changing
beautiful. So it seems to be

1131
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,720
clearly kind of a both. And so
the Divinity, if we use the word

1132
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:20,580
divinity for it, the divinity
which delights in existence has,

1133
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,220
at least, and I don't know
whether this is ultimately true,

1134
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,580
because we may just be
scratching the surface even now,

1135
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:36,200
but it's nature, that infinite
nature, that it seems to be at

1136
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:43,240
some level, unchanging at the
center perpetual change, and

1137
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,580
that's kind of the best I can do
about it.

1138
01:20:45,879 --> 01:20:50,139
Andrew Holecek: I think it's
fantastic, and it's again,

1139
01:20:50,139 --> 01:20:57,519
completely revelatory of
conceptual frameworks, just

1140
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:06,359
because concept can't relate to
the seeming paradox. It doesn't

1141
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:09,479
mean reality doesn't abide by
those paradoxes, right? It's

1142
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:12,659
only a parrot. It's only a
paradox to the conceptual mind.

1143
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,280
Chris Bache: It has no problem,
exactly, exactly.

1144
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,400
Andrew Holecek: It's only when
we try to shrink wrap it that we

1145
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:25,820
enter into the world of paradox
and irony. On one level, to me,

1146
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,140
this is beautiful, because this
is, in fact, one of the ways

1147
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:34,640
that I've come to register this
marvelous dissonance. Isn't the

1148
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:39,440
right word. But when, when
duality tries to open and wrap

1149
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,220
itself around Non-duality,
which, of course, they cannot

1150
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:46,720
do. One characteristic of that
is, in fact, this irony,

1151
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:52,000
paradox, things that, like the
Niels Bohr, I love what he

1152
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:55,000
introduced the notion of
complementarity. You know, the

1153
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,320
phenomena can be, it's not
either or it's and they can be

1154
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:04,500
both light and particle, we you
can be both. Chris Bache and the

1155
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:09,060
cosmos, who says you can't be
both? If Aristotle says we can't

1156
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,020
be both. You know, we live in
his we live in his world. And so

1157
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:18,900
one other really important thing
for me here, Chris is there does

1158
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,520
seem to be we talked, I believe,
very briefly about this last

1159
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,400
time, I want to return to it,
because this is important to me

1160
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:31,820
in terms of path quality. In
fact, very notion of path on one

1161
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:35,660
level, there seems to be a
suggestion in your languaging,

1162
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:40,340
in in what you're sharing here,
what you shared in your book,

1163
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,880
this quality of return. I want
to return to the beloved. I want

1164
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:51,520
to return to the light, longing
to return. And perhaps this also

1165
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:56,800
lies in with this whole notion
of paradox, but I'm also

1166
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,800
wondering how we can play with
that, with what, to me, seems

1167
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,160
the more immediate aspect of
this is a large part I mentioned

1168
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:10,200
this because this is a big part
of my current path is is really

1169
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:15,540
decimating the notion of path
itself. That how fair is it, in

1170
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:21,080
fact, to say the issue of return
is a provisional approach

1171
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,500
description, and then perhaps a
more absolute approach would be

1172
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,440
around recognition that you're
not you don't really need to

1173
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:33,380
return to anything. The issue is
recognition and self liberation.

1174
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:37,520
So does that somehow speak to
you when, when you reference

1175
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,840
longing to return to the mother,
to the beloved, to the clear

1176
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:46,240
light that, again, denotes the
subtle dualism I have to return,

1177
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:51,820
versus No, I just need to remove
the cataracts of confusion, open

1178
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:56,740
the aperture of my heart and
mind, and there the light the

1179
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,780
mother is right in front of me
right now.

1180
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:03,240
Chris Bache: Yeah, absolutely. I
think that's a fair observation.

1181
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:12,060
Return implies absence, and the
nature of union dissolves

1182
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:16,500
absence, and so it dissolves the
category of return, and it

1183
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:21,440
encourages a different set of
categories, because it's like

1184
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,560
the eternal here, the eternal
now. It's just here all the

1185
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:30,200
time. And so I think that's
absolutely true, that it's a, it

1186
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:34,160
is. It fits at one level, but
then it dissolves itself at a

1187
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:39,440
deeper level. Now, having said
that again, I want to

1188
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:45,340
contextualize this within my
particular journey, which is not

1189
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:51,040
the same as the journey of
spiritual awakening. So the

1190
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:56,260
journey of spiritual awakening
is this art and craft of

1191
01:24:56,260 --> 01:25:03,780
awakening into a releasing. All
the constrictions of the present

1192
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:07,260
self, so that we can live in a
state of an abiding

1193
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:12,540
transparency, or Shunyata, to
life as it flows through us like

1194
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:18,480
wind blowing through the trees,
and we simply we rest in the

1195
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:24,620
abiding present of the universe
as it continues to unfold.

1196
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:30,560
Cosmological exploration is
different. It's kind of like

1197
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,480
getting into a rocket ship and
going into a different at a

1198
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:39,560
different solar system in the
galaxy, maybe even going into a

1199
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:46,000
different galaxy all together
and and that is pushing the the

1200
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:53,260
capacity of experience, pushing
the limits of awareness, so that

1201
01:25:53,800 --> 01:26:00,040
the condition of remembering
reaches beyond even The nature

1202
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:05,160
of mind. It's not about simply
if, if I were had been seeking

1203
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:11,700
only to awaken into the abiding
present, I would have adopted a

1204
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:15,660
completely different strategy. I
think, I think Myron stole

1205
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:19,500
Roth's recommendation of working
with very, very low doses of LSD

1206
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:23,240
in meditation practice would be
a better strategy. But the the

1207
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:27,740
strategy I used, working with
very, very high doses of LSD,

1208
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:32,120
pushes consciousness so far
beyond enlightenment and and I

1209
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:36,440
say that humbly trying not to
confuse the categories, not like

1210
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,440
I'm enlightened and I'm more
than enlightened, not like that

1211
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,740
at all, but it's going beyond
the state of the abiding

1212
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:49,000
condition of emptiness into the
unchanging reality underneath.

1213
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:53,080
It's going deeper into physical
reality, deeper into

1214
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,980
consciousness. Reality. Where
does consciousness come from?

1215
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:01,080
What are the prototypes that
inform the very structure of

1216
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:06,600
time and space, the prototypes
that inform the nature of of

1217
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:12,180
archetypal consciousness within
the human psyche. What are the

1218
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:20,100
very forms that that are giving
birth to time and space? What is

1219
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:24,080
the light that gave birth to the
world, not just the gave birth

1220
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,560
to our moment to moment exotics,
but the light that gave birth to

1221
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:33,020
the universe from that
condition, there is a sense of

1222
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:38,060
return, entering that condition
and then coming back from that

1223
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:42,280
condition. And that's why I
think what you say is absolutely

1224
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:47,320
true within a spiritual context,
as we usually mean, spiritual

1225
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:51,760
return is an oxymoron. It's
better to use other categories.

1226
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:56,560
But from within a context of
cosmic exploration, maybe

1227
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:02,700
there's a place, because I
personally cannot imagine how I

1228
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,420
could personally, maybe other
beings could and can, and God

1229
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:11,280
bless them, but I cannot imagine
how I could personally live in

1230
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:15,720
some of the places that I have
touched. And so I can only visit

1231
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:21,140
them as a as a visitor, as a
sojourner. And so I come back

1232
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:26,120
and I try to bring back as much
as I can. I try to cultivate

1233
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:31,400
whatever I can of that condition
in my daily life. But I know

1234
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:36,920
that the vast majority of that
reality I will never be able to

1235
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:41,260
bring back in this lifetime,
maybe 100 lifetimes from now,

1236
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:45,340
maybe so I don't know, but I
will never be able to. And

1237
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:50,320
therefore, in that context,
return has a certain ring of

1238
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,160
truth to it.

1239
01:28:53,380 --> 01:29:00,780
Andrew Holecek: Wow, with again,
several things that come to mind

1240
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:07,620
here. And again, I You're a
philosopher. It's interesting.

1241
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:12,960
This is very compelling term for
me. I think in many instances,

1242
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,080
things become philosophy because
they haven't become direct

1243
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,100
experience yet. So then we use
that slight pejorative thing,

1244
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,780
that's philosophy. And so what
you're sharing here is, is

1245
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:27,980
really quite something. And I
wouldn't say this is, is, this

1246
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:30,800
is simply to discuss it. I
almost said the word challenge

1247
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,000
it, but that's not the right
word to discuss this, that what

1248
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,480
comes to mind. And so educate
me. Teach me are again, I'm

1249
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:47,080
completely admissive of my
frameworks, because I honestly,

1250
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:52,540
unless I sit here in silence, I
don't have a choice. In fact,

1251
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:57,040
silence is the language of God.
All else is poor translation.

1252
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,320
I'm a poor translator, but I'm
doing. Best. So when you

1253
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:06,480
something that that rubs me, and
I love the rub, because that's

1254
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:14,640
what creates the pearl. How do
you reconcile? Teach me when you

1255
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,560
talk about this, this
difference, and this is

1256
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,560
foundational for you, but it
does challenge me when you talk

1257
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,560
about, in fact, the difference
between the individual versus

1258
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:27,560
the cosmic. Because let's, let's
take, for instance, the

1259
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,500
reference point that does speak
to me, Chris, that that I'm

1260
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,520
finding some refuge in here that
maybe is limited of Advaita

1261
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:40,420
Vedanta, for instance, that how
do you reconcile the duality

1262
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:43,660
that's inherent in your
statement that separates

1263
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,080
individual from cosmological
because if, in fact, you're

1264
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:51,280
saying that that deal still does
imply a duality. And so for me,

1265
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:56,020
I I'm wrestling, playing,
dancing with this idealistic

1266
01:30:56,020 --> 01:31:00,040
I'm, you know, in Buddhism, as
you know, chitta, Mantra, yoga,

1267
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:05,340
Chara, the world is heart, mind,
spirit. There you're what you're

1268
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:10,140
saying here seems to intimate,
still some other cosmological

1269
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:16,920
versus individual. And so how do
you work play with that in terms

1270
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,480
of the what you were talking
about earlier, reconcile that

1271
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,480
with oneness. Now, because on
one level, I seem to hear a

1272
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:27,740
monism for you, but now you're
talking about dual aspect

1273
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:31,520
monism. Again, I feel like I
think you understand it. On one

1274
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,060
level, it's like, oh, please no,
don't become a philosopher. Here

1275
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:40,160
I am talking about such
beautiful stuff, and here I am

1276
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:44,740
dual aspect, monism. Oh, please
just go away. But I want to

1277
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:47,440
understand this a little bit
more, so that when I leave this,

1278
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:51,040
I'm not merely left with a
wonderful which is probably the

1279
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,920
best, this wonderful
transmission from your

1280
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,460
experience. But how do you play
with that? Is there, in fact, an

1281
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:02,460
inherent cosmological dualism
when you say individual versus

1282
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:06,000
cosmic versus a modernism that
you seem to suggest throughout

1283
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:06,720
your journey.

1284
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:11,580
Chris Bache: I don't see any
dualism in it. And if there is a

1285
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:15,900
dualism, it's not of my making.
It's of the universe's making.

1286
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:22,160
The universe begins as one in
some fundamental core, you know,

1287
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:27,620
pre BIG BANG, instant Big Bang,
it begins as one and it

1288
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:31,280
manifests diversity. I didn't
choose that. You didn't choose

1289
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:35,120
this. We didn't choose it. The
Universe chose to manifest

1290
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:40,100
diversity. We are part of that
diversity, and the universe

1291
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:46,840
chose to empower in its process
of self emergence, it chose to

1292
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:53,560
empower life to become self
aware and self empowering. So

1293
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:57,280
read, the soul grows and grows
and grows. The soul is that

1294
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,540
consciousness which holds the
awareness experience of all of

1295
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:04,260
our lifetimes, multiple
lifetimes. So we're expanding.

1296
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:09,060
We're growing and growing and
growing. We didn't choose that.

1297
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:13,500
We didn't make ourselves we are
discovering a world that was

1298
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:17,400
designed before we even billions
of years before we even showed

1299
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:21,380
up on the scene. So we show up
in the scene, and we begin to

1300
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:24,500
try to make sense of it, and we
begin to try to understand these

1301
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:28,040
things. And one thing is very
clear, that there is a part, and

1302
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:31,220
there is the whole. There are
many, many parts, and there is,

1303
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:35,000
there is the whole. And when we
when our spiritual experience

1304
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:41,020
deepens, we have experiences of
the whole. And at the same time

1305
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:45,940
we experience ourselves as a
part. And how do we reconcile

1306
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:50,320
those? I think we reconcile them
with a deep understanding of

1307
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,640
emptiness Shunyata and emptiness
here is simply emptiness of

1308
01:33:54,640 --> 01:34:00,300
self, that when we open to the
wholeness of life, it's

1309
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:04,920
immediately obvious that there
is no separate self. We are part

1310
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:08,640
of life. We are an abiding part
of life. We are a bubble in the

1311
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:12,780
ocean. We are part of the
process. That's why, to me,

1312
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,440
oneness and emptiness are two
different sides of the same

1313
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:20,600
coin. It's simply the experience
that I'm living and breathing

1314
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:23,840
every molecule of my being,
every thought of my being, every

1315
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,020
consciousness, every soul,
everything I am, is part of the

1316
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:31,280
manifestation of the universe. I
am the universe in that respect,

1317
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,580
and yet I'm obviously just a
little bitty part, a little

1318
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:37,700
bitty planet, a little bitty
solar system, in a galaxy within

1319
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:42,580
multiple building 2 trillion
galaxies. So we are part, and we

1320
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:48,460
are we. Our Nature is the diet,
is the totality of the whole. In

1321
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:53,140
that respect, there is no
duality, except the duality

1322
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:56,500
which is forced upon us by the
conditions of life. But there's

1323
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:00,840
no ontological duality. There's
a functional duality. De but I

1324
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,900
don't even like to use
philosophical categories and

1325
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:06,780
metaphysical categories, because
that traps us within human

1326
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:10,380
thought. In the history of human
thought, and the history of

1327
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:13,800
human thought, particularly in
the western philosophical

1328
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:18,600
tradition, is so constrained it
is not rooted in deep

1329
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:23,360
experience. It's rooted in
sensory experience and highly

1330
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:27,140
intellectually refined sensory
experience, which is why I

1331
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,840
think, of course, when we turn
the to the contemplative

1332
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:33,500
traditions, different
philosophical insights emerge,

1333
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,840
or different insights emerge
because it's a deeper

1334
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,860
experience. And I think that's
the significance of psychedelics

1335
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:43,600
for the West as a philosopher,
they not only give us new

1336
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:47,620
clinical categories and clinical
insights and opportunities to

1337
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:51,640
heal the personal psyche, but as
a philosopher, they open up the

1338
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:57,340
entire world of cosmic
experience. And so as we try to

1339
01:35:57,340 --> 01:36:00,780
digest those experiences and
articulate them and understand

1340
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:06,480
them. It allows us to draw from
a deeper set of experiences,

1341
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:11,520
which allows us to basically
entertain a deeper set of ideas.

1342
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:16,020
So I had a training as
philosophy of religion. I might

1343
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,660
point to that only to
differentiate myself from the

1344
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:23,360
good psychologists who are
working in clinical context. But

1345
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:27,200
I don't speak like a
philosopher, do I? And I don't

1346
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:30,620
do the things that philosophers
do, and they would disown me in

1347
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:35,720
a minute. They are. They do
disown me, you know? So to me,

1348
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:39,620
there's no duality. There's a
functional duality, which is

1349
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:43,780
basically just a bubble on the
ocean of time and existence

1350
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:47,380
Andrew Holecek: that that's an
incredible response to basically

1351
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:55,300
a very subtle, thorny issue. One
one question Chris from the very

1352
01:36:55,300 --> 01:37:00,420
outset, is when you had the
experience of the diamond,

1353
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:08,340
Luminosity, post session, post
meditation. Where does that

1354
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:13,200
light go? What is the
relationship of that light to

1355
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:18,660
the phenomenal display of the
world and appearance? Does the

1356
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:25,880
world emerge from that light. Is
the world an expression of that

1357
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:30,380
light, or both? So, so you, you
seem to, not seem you, you

1358
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:35,960
entered return to a Luminosity
state, and when you, so to

1359
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,600
speak, came down, came out of
it, this world appeared. What is

1360
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:45,100
the relationship of the
discovery of that light to the

1361
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,940
perhaps covering up, or that's
my languaging. Where does that

1362
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:53,200
light go? How is it what is its
relationship to appearance?

1363
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:55,660
Chris Bache: Yeah, good
question, which I'm not

1364
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:59,920
competent to answer, but I take
some pointers from science and

1365
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,400
some pointers from my
experience, the light doesn't go

1366
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,700
anywhere. Of course, the light
is always there. We gain access

1367
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:12,900
to it for a period of time, but
we withdraw from the light into

1368
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:16,440
Plato, would say, the world of
shadows. But to me, that

1369
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,800
denigrates the beauty, the
magnificence of physical

1370
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:24,380
reality. Scientists tell us that
all the world is made of

1371
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:27,440
molecules. Molecules are made
out of atoms. Atoms are made out

1372
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,840
of subatomic particles.
Ultimately, we get down to

1373
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,560
quarks. In the end, matter is
made out of light. Yeah,

1374
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,280
correct. So if the scientists
are telling us that matter is

1375
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:41,980
made out of light, and if we go
into our mind and drop into the

1376
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:45,820
deepest levels of our mind, and
we encounter light. It's like,

1377
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:50,680
well, you know, there's that
this is such a synergy there. So

1378
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:55,000
my understanding is that the
light of doesn't disappear. The

1379
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,060
light is manifesting the
physical world. The light is

1380
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:01,620
manifesting as the physical
world. That means, when we

1381
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:07,020
really sit with the whole trying
to hold it all together, we get

1382
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:13,380
to experience the physical world
as the manifestation of the

1383
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:21,500
Unified being, of being which is
light it manifests. And

1384
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:26,060
everywhere we touch the world,
we find genius in the creation

1385
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:30,920
of solar systems and how stars
live and die, and in DNA and in

1386
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:35,060
ecosystems. Everywhere we're
touching the world, we find

1387
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:38,840
layers and layers and layers of
genius. And if we keep digging

1388
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:43,240
down deep enough, we fall into
quantum reality, you know, dark

1389
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:46,480
energy, dark matter, light. They
call it dark energy, dark

1390
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:50,260
matter, but it really should be
light energy, light matter. You

1391
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:56,680
know, light, light, light. So if
I live, if I get depressed, and

1392
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,800
I live in a state of sadness, or
I live in, live in a state of.

1393
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,780
That disconnection, then that's
only that's only my own mind

1394
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:10,080
throwing up shadows of illusion.
But when I'm clear, when I

1395
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:15,420
return to clarity, I see the
world as a miracle. Yeah,

1396
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:19,920
manifestation. And I love that
the Prophet Muhammad said that

1397
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:24,980
the only miracle he would cite
for the truth of what he was

1398
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:27,080
teaching was the miracle of the
universe.

1399
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:35,180
Andrew Holecek: And isn't it
worth again? I'm sure you know

1400
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:40,360
this, but perhaps it's worth
just reinstating that when you

1401
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:46,660
say, I experience it, perhaps it
experiences itself right there

1402
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,920
on one level. Yes, we use that
languaging. But even then, it's

1403
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:55,660
almost it's, it is impossible to
talk about this without

1404
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:59,560
stumbling into this. It's, it's
this, as you know, reflexive

1405
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:02,460
awareness of the light itself.
And so, yeah, I'm wondering,

1406
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:07,680
Chris, is it, is it fair to say
that then, I mean, this is so

1407
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:12,000
integral to the whole thing,
it's literally enveloped in the

1408
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:19,620
term enlightenment. This is a
and so I of all the teachings,

1409
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:23,660
both in physics, cosmology and
spirituality, the ones that

1410
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:27,140
captivate me the most, that that
I find the most ineffably

1411
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:32,000
profound are, in fact, these
teachings of Luminosity, which

1412
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:36,620
inseparable from emptiness. Is
emptiness slash Luminosity, is

1413
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:42,700
it? Is it fair to say that that
what we know is our self sense

1414
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:47,740
when we condense and contract
from the Unity I'm using my

1415
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:51,580
language in here. Please correct
me if I'm wrong, from the unity

1416
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:57,820
of that formless light back into
reified form in the worlds that

1417
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:01,980
that arises from that
contraction, that that that's a

1418
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:07,080
process of dissociation, that on
one level, we we again, again,

1419
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:11,100
the narrative of openness, when
we completely open, die to

1420
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:15,660
reality, it reveals itself in
this undifferentiated, ineffable

1421
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:21,020
unity of of light, and that when
we can condense, reincarnate,

1422
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:26,780
back into form the minute we do
that the world appears as self

1423
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:31,760
another, and we simply lose
memory. We lose the recollection

1424
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:36,800
of this, this fundamental
expression of the beloved as as

1425
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,220
this body of infinite Luminosity
and emptiness.

1426
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:45,280
Chris Bache: I think there is a
sad way of doing that, and then

1427
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,920
there's a happy way of doing
that, or so maybe there's a

1428
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,700
pathological way, but then
there's an entirely healthy way,

1429
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:55,300
and imagine it this way. I mean,
let's use God language

1430
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:59,680
temporarily, just because it's
kind of handy if, if we were to

1431
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:06,240
become one with God for an hour.
And if God is the essence and

1432
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:10,320
totality of all life forms, then
we would be becoming one with

1433
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:14,940
all life forms. And just imagine
the nearby life forms in your

1434
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:18,840
neighborhood that that would
involve becoming one with all

1435
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,780
the Beatles and ants and grasses
and seeds and cockroaches, I

1436
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:26,780
mean all the human beings and
all their manifest forms.

1437
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:29,180
There's so many layers and
layers and layers and layers of

1438
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:33,140
life. So when we say about,
well, we're becoming one with

1439
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:36,200
God, we don't really mean, oh,
my God. We became one with the

1440
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:38,720
billions and billions of ants
that are, you know, right in my

1441
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:43,060
neighborhood. But in fact, if
God is one, if all life is one

1442
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:46,840
in God, then that's what
involves. So what happens, I

1443
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:51,520
think, is that we do become one
with one. We kind of reconnect

1444
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:57,040
to the one. But the happy way is
that when we come back, I don't

1445
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:00,300
come back into being an ant, I
don't come back into being a

1446
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:05,220
toad or bird, I come back into
being Chris, a human being, and

1447
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:12,240
there is a happy and healthy way
in which I come back into this

1448
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:17,280
individual life form which
recognizes that its essence is

1449
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:21,440
the same as the essence of those
ants and birds and toads. No

1450
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:25,460
better, no different. It's more
complicated, but the essence is

1451
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:29,660
the same. There is that profound
kinship with all of existence. I

1452
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:33,680
happen to be a human bubble.
They are other kinds of bubbles.

1453
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:38,720
Together, we make up the unified
existence of the totality. Let's

1454
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:43,840
sing in celebration. We work
together. We didn't choose it.

1455
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:48,880
We didn't create it. We are
awakening up within it. It is

1456
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,080
the design of a deeper
intelligence, a deeper

1457
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:56,620
organization that's that's
manifesting itself in joyful

1458
01:44:56,620 --> 01:45:01,920
diversity. We we. We can enjoy
the diversity. We can

1459
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,860
acknowledge it and be
comfortable within it, and I

1460
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:07,740
don't think there's anything
pathological about it. In fact,

1461
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:12,420
there's an ecstatic joy in
celebrating being a human being

1462
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:18,420
in the in the now, if we exalt
our humanness at the expense of

1463
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:20,960
other life forms, and we're
willing for them to go extinct

1464
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,620
in order to allow us to buy a
bigger you know, bigger and

1465
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:28,040
better and whatnot. Of course,
there's a steep, deep pathology

1466
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:33,440
there. But when it's truly
liberated, our our individuality

1467
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:38,240
is recognized as a gift, just an
extraordinary gift, and a

1468
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:42,880
responsibility. We have to
handle that responsibility in

1469
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,700
order to protect the well being
of all the life forms that we

1470
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:50,800
are part of, that that are
around us. Then the de the sense

1471
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,700
of our common ground, the sense
of the common ground out of

1472
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:59,200
which all life emerges, I think,
deepens and deepens and deepens

1473
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:03,420
and so I don't really this is,
again, a sort of eco psychology

1474
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:09,360
and eco spirituality. We can't
really awaken as a as a separate

1475
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:14,760
self, without simultaneously
awakening as an earth self, an

1476
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:16,200
earth being.

1477
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:21,080
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, that's
that's fantastic. And and talk

1478
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:25,100
about applicability. Sometimes
it's easy to think that these

1479
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:31,940
are kind of elite, treasured,
sterile, Ivory Tower spiritual

1480
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:36,860
experiences, but really these,
there's nothing more practical,

1481
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:41,140
more applicable. This. This is
the farthest from being

1482
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:46,240
philosophy, this is the most
radical transformation in view

1483
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:52,000
from which activism, whatever
you want to call it, enlightened

1484
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,200
activity, extraordinarily
practical, applicable behaviors

1485
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:59,740
and actions arise spontaneously
from this. And I think this also

1486
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:05,100
cannot be overstated, because,
to me, my big bug these days,

1487
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:10,620
if, if what we're discussing
here is can't be of benefit to

1488
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:14,700
what's happening in the world,
it's irrelevant. And this is far

1489
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:18,720
from irrelevant. This is, this
is absolutely foundational for

1490
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:23,840
this is right view. It is
ultimate basis. You from this,

1491
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:28,400
from this foundation,
spontaneously, without thought,

1492
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,800
arises the activity that is is
appropriate for this day and age

1493
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:41,920
and so Chris as we well, let me
ask you this, when I, when I

1494
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,220
hear you, you talking about
these experiences. These are,

1495
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:48,820
these are types of Samadhi
states. You're you're entering

1496
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:53,320
into particular absorption
states, like when you're bathing

1497
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:56,440
in the light, you become the
light. That's a type of that's a

1498
01:47:56,440 --> 01:48:02,760
luminous Samadhi. Why does it
end? Why? Why? Why does post

1499
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:09,540
meditation, post session still
take place? Why? Why not abide

1500
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:15,240
in that light eternally? What
brings what's what brings you

1501
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,960
back in? It seems, on one level,
it's involuntary, right? So, in

1502
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:25,040
a certain way, we're talking
about rebirth processes. What is

1503
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:31,580
the rebirth process? Involuntary
due to the unpurified habitual

1504
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:34,760
patterns that still bring us
back because of their karmic

1505
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:39,740
power. Why? Why does the Samadhi
and Yeah,

1506
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:43,780
Chris Bache: well, once again,
there are some beings for whom

1507
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:48,340
their Samadhi does not end. But
even those beings experience a

1508
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:53,020
movement in and out. You know,
they live at different levels at

1509
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:58,660
different seconds of every hour.
I would say my Samadhi ends

1510
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:04,560
because I'm not. I'm a being who
cannot sustain those levels of

1511
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,940
purity or those levels of
clarity in my current condition.

1512
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,040
So the habits of consciousness
reassert themselves, the habits

1513
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:19,260
of my embodiment reassert
themselves, and I once again, am

1514
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:23,660
kind of looking at the world
through the levels of awareness

1515
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:27,920
that I can manage in my embodied
existence. But in a sense, there

1516
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:35,360
is a again, we spirit. Is the
goal spiritual awakening, or is

1517
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:39,080
the goal cosmological
exploration? If the goal is

1518
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:42,520
spiritual awakening, then there
is a way in which we can

1519
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:48,460
realistically aim to enter into
a kind of Samadhi which is

1520
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:54,520
abiding and allows us to live
with a profound sense of freedom

1521
01:49:54,760 --> 01:50:00,360
within the context of life. If
the if the experience. Mental

1522
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:07,560
trajectory is cosmological
exploration. Then the burden of

1523
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:12,060
that at least as in this path
that I practice, and I'm just,

1524
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:15,180
let's just stay there and not
talk about the comparative other

1525
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:19,320
paths. The burden of that
discovery is that it's

1526
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:24,200
temporary. The burden is that
it's a Samadhi state, or maybe

1527
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:29,360
even Samadhi is not the right
word for it, to go beyond, to

1528
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:33,320
experience the future, to
experience the future of

1529
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:38,480
humanity in a realistic, graphic
sense, to experience the purpose

1530
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:43,780
of time, space, existence, and a
profound expansion of time that

1531
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:48,700
allows you to span millions and
millions of years of history and

1532
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:53,500
understand and absorb it, to
take it in. I mean, I don't how

1533
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:58,120
could one possibly live in that
condition and have breakfast,

1534
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:05,880
really? So that's just no if you
want to understand those things,

1535
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:08,460
here's a way of doing it, but
then you have to, you have to

1536
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:12,900
come back, and now you have to
live in my 72 year old self, and

1537
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:18,120
I have to cut the grass, and I
have to do my things, and that's

1538
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:24,500
okay, because if, if you do it
well, there is a happy way of

1539
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:30,200
coming back, yeah, and
integrating and recognizing the

1540
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:34,700
limits of what you experienced.
It's a temporary condition. No

1541
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:39,440
big deal not to make too much of
it, learning more as I go. You

1542
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:43,900
know, just so there's a there's
a healthy way, and then there

1543
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:48,520
were all sorts of unhealthy ways
of doing it, but hopefully

1544
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:55,480
healthy way it is. There is an
abiding calm and trust, an

1545
01:51:55,480 --> 01:52:01,140
abiding trust in the wisdom of
the universe, in its self,

1546
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:03,420
emergent glory, yeah,

1547
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:10,680
Andrew Holecek: would it be fair
to say, Chris, therefore that, I

1548
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:15,300
mean, I hear rebirth,
reincarnation. We're basically

1549
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:20,900
talking about this fundamental
process. Is it fair to say that

1550
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:28,100
rebirth really takes place in
two dimensions of experience,

1551
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:32,600
the degree of openness we can
tolerate, in other words, what

1552
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:37,820
what they're there by, can bring
the end of and this is important

1553
01:52:37,820 --> 01:52:42,040
term for me that differentiates
my understanding of Buddhism

1554
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:48,160
from other traditions. What ends
the process of involuntary

1555
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:53,620
rebirth is, in fact, the ability
to coming back to this central

1556
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:57,700
narrative of openness, to open,
open, open, open, open to such a

1557
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:01,080
new degree. We're so familiar
with it, we're so comfortable

1558
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:06,840
with it that fundamentally, when
that state is revealed at the

1559
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:11,340
moment of death, we we abide in
and as that fundamental

1560
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:16,020
openness, and then when we do
return, as you know, we do so

1561
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:19,680
out of love, manifestation of
compassion, of chuku phenomena,

1562
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:24,620
voluntarily embodying our
wisdom, not involuntarily

1563
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:27,860
embodying our confusion. And at
that point, it's not that

1564
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:32,240
rebirth ends, involuntary
rebirth ends. And just like you

1565
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:38,840
said, done, the play Leo rolper
continues, infinitely out of

1566
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:41,500
love and compassion in the
service of others. Is that a

1567
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:46,660
fair way to share or express
your understanding of this?

1568
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:52,420
Again, I'm trying to dance
around the dissolution of the

1569
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:55,720
Omega point, right, that this is
the final goal. But on one

1570
01:53:55,720 --> 01:54:00,660
level, yeah, on one level, it is
the final goal for self, the

1571
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:04,560
cessation of that self, but then
it's just the beginning of this

1572
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:07,560
endless voluntary display of
wisdom and compassion.

1573
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:11,580
Chris Bache: I think it's a very
fair description. I think what

1574
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:16,500
ends is the involuntary nature
of reincarnation. And we

1575
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,900
transition into voluntary
incarnation, and with that

1576
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:25,160
comes, I mean, and I think we,
our future incarnations are not

1577
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:28,460
the same as our past
incarnations in this respect.

1578
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,580
And the way I've language this,
the way it was shown me in the

1579
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:39,080
sessions, is that long term or
short term. I mean, in long

1580
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:44,440
term, however, it manifests
itself intermittently. I think

1581
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:49,420
in the end, we all become tool.
We all become voluntarily

1582
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:55,960
incarnate, the human when the
entire planet is populated by

1583
01:54:56,020 --> 01:55:00,360
self, consciously incarnated
beings, humanity. Will have

1584
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:07,140
transitioned to a new level of
its evolutionary trajectory. And

1585
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:10,260
the way this was presented to me
in the sessions was the re the

1586
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:13,980
birth of the diamond soul. So
all my former lives at one

1587
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:18,180
point, started coming into me,
coming into me. And when they

1588
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:23,240
hit, they hit a critical mass,
and they fused into one. And

1589
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:27,080
when they fused into one, this
diamond light blew out of my

1590
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:31,760
chest and catapulted me into a
deep, deep, deep state of

1591
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:35,000
consciousness that was
individualized. It was

1592
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:40,120
individual consciousness, but it
was individuality actualized in

1593
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:45,160
a way that I had no previous
experience of, and I think that

1594
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:50,200
that's where humanity is going.
All of us are incarnating every

1595
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:52,420
generation. Billions and
billions of people are

1596
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:55,120
incarnating, incarnating over
and over again, over and over

1597
01:55:55,120 --> 01:56:00,780
again. Sooner or later, the
entire species not only becomes

1598
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:05,520
awakened, but the entire species
gives birth to this deeper

1599
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:09,180
spiritual awareness which has
been gestating inside it all of

1600
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:11,940
this time, all these hundreds
and hundreds and 1000s of

1601
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:16,800
lifetimes, until we awaken into
our deeper awareness, which is

1602
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:19,620
not just the awareness of
enlightenment, to the awareness

1603
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:22,580
of awakening, but it's the
awareness of our history. It's

1604
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:25,340
the awareness of our
relationship to the universe.

1605
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:28,820
It's a deeper intimacy with the
intelligence of the universe,

1606
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,840
the deeper intimacy with all
life forms on this planet. This

1607
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:38,180
is When soul consciousness, and
I don't mean soul in a anti

1608
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:41,500
Buddhist way, but in a way
that's compatible with Shunyata

1609
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:45,880
emptiness, but soul
consciousness awakens, so that

1610
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:51,040
we awaken to the being that we
are in the community of beings

1611
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:56,500
as they are on a planet at this
particular stage of its

1612
01:56:56,500 --> 01:57:02,160
evolutionary development with
billions of years ahead of us,

1613
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:06,720
and so I think we're just
beginning to see the edges. When

1614
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:10,260
we first encountered
enlightenment to 5000 years ago,

1615
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:17,580
we called it escape moksha. We
escaped Samsara, right? Let me

1616
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:21,140
get out of here. But now we're
beginning to understand now we

1617
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:27,680
want to awaken here and in the
awakening here we humanity makes

1618
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:34,460
a pivot into a new stage of the
evolutionary story, and a not

1619
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,560
not just a larger stage, but a
more peaceful stage, peaceful of

1620
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:43,960
heart, non violent, more
compassionate, more insightful,

1621
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:47,980
more creative. That's the kind
of planet that I think we're

1622
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:52,060
giving birth to right now. And
all of our individual spiritual

1623
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:56,140
aspirations and and pure face
purification aspirations and

1624
01:57:56,140 --> 01:58:00,660
healing aspirations and justice
aspirations, all of this are all

1625
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:05,160
organically part of this deeper
story. And the deeper story is

1626
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:09,360
that humanity is coming to a
point where it no longer has the

1627
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:12,960
liberty of living at the lower
level of maturity that it's

1628
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:16,740
lived at in the past. We cannot
afford. We can't run a planet

1629
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:23,480
run by egos. We have to grow up.
And when we grow up, we grow up

1630
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:26,660
into this higher form of
spiritual awareness that the

1631
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:29,840
spiritual teachers have been
telling us about for 1000s of

1632
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:34,340
years. But this begins a turning
point in human history. That's

1633
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:37,400
what we're trying to give birth
to, what I call the future.

1634
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:40,720
Human people give all sorts of
different names to it. We can

1635
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:46,240
all feel it in our bones. It's
Maitreya. It's that higher level

1636
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:49,900
of realization that is working
its way to us.

1637
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:52,480
Andrew Holecek: You know, that's
really, really exquisite. And

1638
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:56,980
I'm wondering, if you know, I
understand the languaging, but

1639
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:02,220
I'm wondering if growing down
might be a more appropriate

1640
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:05,100
embodied aspect, because the
growing up is again

1641
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:09,900
fundamentally moksha, escapist,
FedEx my consciousness to a pure

1642
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:15,600
land when it's really waking
down into the majesty, somewhat

1643
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:20,100
nice way to start to close
things up with The integration

1644
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:24,200
of your work, the waking, down,
bringing, metabolizing,

1645
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:27,020
digesting, incorporating,
literally incorporating,

1646
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:30,140
bringing into Soma body. You
know this, this vast

1647
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:33,620
realization. But Chris, if, if
you don't mind me being slight,

1648
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:38,000
devil's advocate here, that's
just for my stance. Sure, I I've

1649
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:43,780
become very interested,
fascinated for some decades with

1650
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:50,500
development, structural
development, not just not just

1651
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:54,280
spiritual. And this is where I
like integral approaches. And so

1652
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,660
I take utter, complete delight
in this vision. And make

1653
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:06,300
aspirations that's may it be, so
that we can all become tukus.

1654
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:11,940
But I'm also wondering, again,
wishful thinking, you talk in

1655
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:16,680
your book about these
evolutionary breakthroughs, when

1656
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:22,280
I look at the world and i i see
what's happening, and we can't

1657
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:28,460
even agree as a society to wear
a mask for the benefit of each

1658
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:35,780
other. Why? Why should there be,
at this point something special

1659
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:39,980
that would occur, like a meteor
hitting this earth of sanity,

1660
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:42,760
wisdom and insight that would
shake us from our collective

1661
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:47,080
slumber and bring us to this
collective evolution and

1662
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:51,280
awareness. It doesn't seem to
work that way. Evolution

1663
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:55,780
stumbles and trips along these
very painful, laborious, long

1664
02:00:56,680 --> 02:01:02,100
stretches of time. I revel in
what you're saying, but I'm less

1665
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:06,240
optimistic than I used to be,
that I look at this world and I

1666
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:09,900
put my finger up to the winds
that are blowing, and it doesn't

1667
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:12,360
it's not blowing in the right
direction, yeah.

1668
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,940
Chris Bache: So be getting
worse. They seem to be going

1669
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:16,080
away, right?

1670
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:19,680
Andrew Holecek: So I'm curious
outside of of your experience,

1671
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:24,020
and that that's ultimate refuge
for you. What else outside of

1672
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:28,940
that, if there is anything else,
gives you the conviction to say

1673
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:32,840
that that we're heading towards
this evolutionary break through

1674
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:37,820
as a species. Can the big
question these days, will we do

1675
02:01:37,820 --> 02:01:42,700
it in time? I personally I'm not
so sure. I try to retain my

1676
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:45,820
optimism, yeah, but it's
conjecture on my part, so I'm

1677
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:51,160
curious how that that challenge
slash rub lands with you. The

1678
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:53,980
development doesn't seem to work
this way.

1679
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:59,560
Chris Bache: Yeah, outside of my
visionary experience, I have

1680
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:05,040
nothing to say, I you know, we
all look at the data. We all see

1681
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:09,000
what's going on. We see the
stupidity and insanity around

1682
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,760
us. We see a growing eco crises,
series of eco crises. We

1683
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:19,920
anticipate the desertification
of the middle America. We see

1684
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:23,840
fat and famine on the horizons
already started, but penetrating

1685
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:28,580
into middle class experience
slowly, we see the we're told

1686
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:33,140
that the oceans a 12 foot rise
has already baked into the into

1687
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:39,920
reality, unstoppable by 2050 12
feet by 2050 where we can

1688
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:43,060
calculate How many billions of
people will be flooded out of

1689
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:46,540
where they live and where I
mean, we know we're coming into

1690
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:50,740
extremely difficult times. We
see the forces of conservatism.

1691
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:53,680
We see the reactionary,
regressive forces that are

1692
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:58,720
manifesting in politics
internationally. We see a higher

1693
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:02,580
concentrations of wealth into
smaller and smaller numbers of

1694
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:07,560
people, we see very, very
dangerous and forbidding trends.

1695
02:03:07,620 --> 02:03:15,360
And so outside of my visionary
experience, I have no certainty

1696
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:21,680
or surety that this is going
someplace good. So the nature of

1697
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:29,960
my experiences, if there and if
there is any, well, the nature

1698
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:39,800
of my experience is that,
starting about around 1992 93 I

1699
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:43,660
started having these consistent
visions coming in completely by

1700
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:47,260
surprise, just as I had not
anticipated that one could

1701
02:03:47,260 --> 02:03:50,740
possibly do any type of
therapeutic work and healing

1702
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:54,580
some aspect of the collective
psyche. I had no idea that it

1703
02:03:54,580 --> 02:03:59,260
was even possible to consider
having insights into humanity's

1704
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:04,560
evolutionary trajectory. But
now, once I lived with this for

1705
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:08,280
years, I began to understand
that this is a natural thing,

1706
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:12,840
just as we have, as we go deeper
within our personal life, we

1707
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:16,800
have a deeper understanding and
experience of our trajectory of

1708
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:21,800
our personal life. One can go
deep If one lives in service of

1709
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:24,980
the collective, one can have a
deeper and penetrating

1710
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:29,900
understanding of the collective
trajectory. And in that context,

1711
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:33,860
my experience has been
consistent over years and years

1712
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:36,980
and years of psychedelic
experience and visionary

1713
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:41,260
experience, first many years of
basically saying humanity is

1714
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:44,260
coming to a turning point. We're
coming to a before and after.

1715
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:47,980
We're coming into a to a dawn of
something fantastic. We're

1716
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:51,640
coming to a genuine spiritual
awakening that everything that

1717
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:54,640
our spiritual traditions have
been describing for the

1718
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:57,880
individual. Guess what? It's not
an individual thing. It's

1719
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:01,140
collective thing. This is a
call. Collective dynamic, the

1720
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:04,680
forces of the Collective
Unconscious are activated, not

1721
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:09,900
just my personal unconscious.
And then at that critical time

1722
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:15,900
in 1995 when I had the 55th
session, and it and it when I

1723
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:19,680
was expecting to be taken back
into the diamond Luminosity, it

1724
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:24,140
dissolved me into the collective
psyche. It dissolved me into the

1725
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:28,340
collective unconscious. Took me
into deep time, into an expanded

1726
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:33,380
sense of time. And in that
state, I experienced the death

1727
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:37,220
and rebirth of humanity. I
experienced a global systems

1728
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:42,160
crisis that led to billions of
people, billions of people

1729
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:47,140
dying, just a total unraveling
of cultures we have known it, of

1730
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:51,520
civilization as we've known it,
a complete i i experienced our

1731
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:56,320
entire species losing control of
its story, losing control of its

1732
02:05:56,320 --> 02:06:00,780
life on this Planet, just being
put under enormous, terribly

1733
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:08,040
crushing pressure of death and
destruction. And it looked for a

1734
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:11,400
time, it felt for a time as
this, this was an extinction

1735
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:16,140
event, that we were really going
extinct as a species. But that,

1736
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:19,860
and I was given no details. I
wasn't giving a timeline. It

1737
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:25,880
wasn't given anything, given the
experience of the species going

1738
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:32,540
through a Death Event on this
planet, all of us together, and

1739
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:39,440
then I experienced that the
storm began to pass. The storm

1740
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:43,960
began to subside, and those of
us who are still alive picked

1741
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:50,380
themselves up and began to
rebuild, and what we were was

1742
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:54,580
different than what we had been
before and what we be, what

1743
02:06:54,580 --> 02:06:57,880
began to happen was a
synergistic of conscious

1744
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:02,340
Creativity, a synergistic of
compounded freedom, a synergy of

1745
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:06,720
compounding insight, a new set
of values, a new set of

1746
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:10,500
understandings, a new set of
capacities were manifesting

1747
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:15,360
themselves, that humanity as a
whole was going through a

1748
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:21,200
process that every spiritual
aspirant has had knowledge of a

1749
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:25,460
complete collapse of reality,
saying known it, and a waking up

1750
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:34,640
into a more spiritually animated
whole, magnificent, beautiful,

1751
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:38,000
conscious awareness that
humanity was going through this

1752
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:43,300
process. And then in the very in
my 70th session, the very, very

1753
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:47,440
last session, once again, it
gave me kind of a capstone

1754
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:52,180
experience, which took me deep
into the future. And it showed

1755
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:58,120
me the archetypal structure of
this future human, the

1756
02:07:58,180 --> 02:08:04,260
archetypal form of it. And
truly, I mean, it brings tears

1757
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:07,380
to my eyes, just to even
remember it, to think of it.

1758
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:12,780
This is a this is a truly
different form of humanity. It's

1759
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:17,640
like the best of the best of us
in it, our hearts healed, our

1760
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:22,940
minds opened. Outside of my
visionary experience, I have no

1761
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:28,640
reason for suggesting what I
have suggested as that humanity

1762
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:32,240
is coming to this turning point,
this evolutionary pivot point. I

1763
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:35,180
know that evolution has dead
ends, and, you know, whole

1764
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:38,720
species die off, and whole
planets could die off, and I

1765
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:42,700
know that there's no cognitively
compelling reason for having

1766
02:08:42,700 --> 02:08:48,100
hope. And as we enter the next
century, as we enter what's

1767
02:08:48,100 --> 02:08:53,620
going to happen in this century,
we are going to lose hope again

1768
02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:56,860
and again, and that's why I
think it's really important to

1769
02:08:56,860 --> 02:09:00,600
have a vision, an understanding
of what's taking place at a

1770
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:06,300
deeper level, because it's going
to get bad. I mean, really

1771
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:11,580
realistically, we could be
looking at more than half of the

1772
02:09:11,580 --> 02:09:16,740
human population of Earth lost,
and we'll watch it on television

1773
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:21,980
every night, and it's just it's
going to wrack us with terrible

1774
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:27,260
pain, but inside, we're going to
be led to do things that we

1775
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:30,620
would not otherwise do. We're
going to be we're going to be

1776
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:34,340
cracked open in this pain and
suffering, just as in a

1777
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:38,180
meditation, deep meditation,
justice and deep psychedelic

1778
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:42,760
experience, we will reach deeper
into ourselves and we have ever

1779
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:47,200
reached before, and we will
accomplish something that we

1780
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:53,860
might never accomplish without
this ordeal of pain. Now, the

1781
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:57,580
other thing that I was shown in
the 55th session was some of the

1782
02:09:57,580 --> 02:10:01,740
mechanism responsible for doing.
Doing this that was in I was

1783
02:10:01,740 --> 02:10:04,740
shown this over and over and
over again, taken through it and

1784
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:08,760
until I it was made sure I
understood it. And I'll just

1785
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:12,660
mention it here and point to the
book. And that is, it has to do

1786
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:18,240
with the functioning of the
collective psyche, and in this

1787
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:23,120
time of accelerate, accelerated
and intensified individual

1788
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:26,660
suffering. It's not just our
individual psyches that are be

1789
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:31,880
activated, but all of the
suffering of humanity gathers in

1790
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:37,460
its process at a centralized
level, as more as morphogenic

1791
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:43,540
feel. Sheldrake has helped us
understand and so that the

1792
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:46,000
scenario that was unfolded was

1793
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:52,000
the collective psyche will move
into such a highly energized

1794
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,080
state that it will begin to
operate as a non linear system.

1795
02:10:56,080 --> 02:11:00,100
Are far from equilibrium system,
and we know something about how

1796
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:03,360
physical systems operate when
they enter into non linear

1797
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:08,100
conditions. They are capable of
accelerated change. Small

1798
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:14,880
perturbations produce expanded
outcomes. Creativity emerges

1799
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,320
from within the system in
unprecedented way, hydrogen and

1800
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:22,820
oxygen combined to produce
oxygen, I mean, to produce

1801
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:28,340
water. Things happen that are
unanticipated according to a

1802
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:32,120
system operating in linear
systems. And this was shown me

1803
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:35,420
that this future is going to
take place, this pivot is going

1804
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:40,660
to take place much faster than
we could ever imagine if we used

1805
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:44,620
our calculation based upon the
past, it's going to take pace

1806
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:49,480
faster, more quickly. It's going
to be deeper than anything that

1807
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:52,960
we could imagine in the past.
Now I I know that sounds like

1808
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:56,380
optimism run amok, and I
understand and everybody has to

1809
02:11:56,380 --> 02:12:00,480
make their own decisions on
this. All I can do is simply

1810
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:06,720
here, report the vision and let
it go at that. And then we're

1811
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:09,000
all in this together, you and I,
and our children and

1812
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,920
grandchildren, we're all in this
together.

1813
02:12:11,100 --> 02:12:15,000
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, yeah. I
mean, it's interesting. Part of

1814
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:19,440
me says, May it be so, and
another part of me says, May it

1815
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:26,840
not be so, then I'm wondering,
Chris, as we start to wrap up, I

1816
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:30,140
know your time is valuable.
We've covered so much amazing

1817
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:37,640
material, really, and
prescriptions, what, what? I'm a

1818
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:42,400
level, some, some things are
implied with our time together,

1819
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:49,480
but prescriptions, what what to
do, or in a certain sense, not

1820
02:12:49,480 --> 02:12:55,720
to do, how to bring our
individual, empowered selves or

1821
02:12:55,720 --> 02:13:01,140
lack thereof, to to actually
help this world, both now and

1822
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:05,160
you know, for our ancestors. So
some let's, let's end on some

1823
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:07,680
prescription notes, if we might,

1824
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:11,580
Chris Bache: in terms of the
transition that I've been

1825
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:16,860
describing, someone that I know
and love and respect very

1826
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:22,160
dearly, who has thought a great
deal about what we can do, how

1827
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:27,200
we can accelerate this process,
how we can remove the worst of

1828
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:34,880
the pain and move into the this
new future better quicker. Is

1829
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:39,500
Dwayne Elgin and his book
choosing Earth is a beautiful

1830
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:44,080
book, powerful book, small book.
He lays out what he thinks the

1831
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:47,080
next five decades are going to
look like, and it's not a pretty

1832
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:51,940
picture, it's it's a frightening
picture. But he also lays out a

1833
02:13:51,940 --> 02:13:55,960
series of prescriptions, of
prescriptions for how we can

1834
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:59,800
engage this future, how we can
bring about a safe landing, how

1835
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:04,260
we can change and engage
socially, individually and

1836
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:10,320
socially. And I think he his
advice is worth much more than

1837
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:13,620
mine. Dwayne Elgin choosing
Earth, and he's giving the book

1838
02:14:13,620 --> 02:14:18,000
away. You can get a PDF on
Amazon. It's giving he's giving

1839
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,860
it away because it's so
important. He's not trying to

1840
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:24,980
hold on or make money on it
himself. He's it's all in

1841
02:14:24,980 --> 02:14:30,080
service of humanity. I would
step also add to that reminder

1842
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:34,580
that from a reincarnation
perspective, each one of us,

1843
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:38,420
every one of the 1000s and 1000s
of listeners in your program,

1844
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:42,460
and all of us around the world,
we chose to be incarnated at

1845
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:47,020
this time in history. We chose
to be incarnated at the time and

1846
02:14:47,020 --> 02:14:50,860
place that we incarnated with
the talents and challenges that

1847
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:54,340
we brought into this
incarnation. We are exactly

1848
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:57,940
where we are supposed to be in
order to make a creative

1849
02:14:57,940 --> 02:15:01,500
offering to this time and.
History, we don't have to go

1850
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:05,940
look elsewhere. The only real
question is, do we have the

1851
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:12,060
courage to actualize, to
activate the potential that we

1852
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:17,100
are standing on right here,
right now, once we make that

1853
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:22,280
commitment, that our life, my
life will count towards the

1854
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:25,760
good. Then we look around us and
we say, Okay, what needs to

1855
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:30,740
happen? What? What are we trying
to become? And then we put our

1856
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:34,160
hands to work. And since we're
all different and we all have

1857
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:37,400
different missions and different
agendas, some of us are in the

1858
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:39,920
medical field, some of us in the
political field and

1859
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:43,240
philosophical field and creative
field, and hard labor, all these

1860
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:50,020
things, every human talent will
be required to bring this about.

1861
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:54,100
So it's not a matter of kind of
looking elsewhere. It's simply a

1862
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:58,060
matter of looking at where one
is already incarnated to make

1863
02:15:58,060 --> 02:16:02,760
service spiritual practice is
important, facing the shadow,

1864
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:07,260
clarifying the shadow, becoming
open and individually receptive.

1865
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:12,180
Community is important, not only
practice community, but social

1866
02:16:12,180 --> 02:16:17,820
community, learning how to do
more with less, sharing,

1867
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:22,340
restructuring society, political
community is really important.

1868
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:28,220
We see what happens when ego
runs amok in our politics. All

1869
02:16:28,220 --> 02:16:32,180
these things are needed. All of
these things are important. All

1870
02:16:32,180 --> 02:16:35,600
we have to do is look around and
see what needs to be done and

1871
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:37,340
give ourselves to it completely.

1872
02:16:38,959 --> 02:16:46,659
Andrew Holecek: Wow, wonderful.
Wow. Anything that you wish I

1873
02:16:46,659 --> 02:16:47,739
would have asked

1874
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:52,660
Chris Bache: any, any, I don't
know, yeah, it's in serious

1875
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:54,700
territory, partner, yeah,

1876
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:58,480
Andrew Holecek: rich, but as we
really wrap up, I mean, there's

1877
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:02,700
so many summary statements here,
but any, any other final

1878
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:06,960
thoughts or questions you felt
should have been directed your

1879
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:09,780
Chris Bache: way? No, you know,
you mentioned the living

1880
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:13,080
classroom in the beginning, and
it's not, it's too late to go

1881
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:17,460
into a large excursus. But the
basic, the core of that book,

1882
02:17:17,460 --> 02:17:22,580
which doesn't mention
psychedelics, is the core truth

1883
02:17:22,580 --> 02:17:29,540
that's manifesting there is that
consciousness is unified from

1884
02:17:29,540 --> 02:17:34,700
the start, so that everything we
do in our individual sphere, our

1885
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:40,720
individual field, radiates out
around us 360 degrees. It all of

1886
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:44,500
our spiritual practice, all of
our actions, everything we do

1887
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:49,660
radiates around it, touches and
interacts with the consciousness

1888
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:53,860
of the beings around us. Knowing
this, then we take more

1889
02:17:53,860 --> 02:17:57,580
responsibility for making sure
we're sending out, you know, a

1890
02:17:57,580 --> 02:18:01,380
positive experience in the
world. You know, beneficial

1891
02:18:01,380 --> 02:18:08,700
experience, and we are never,
ever, ever isolated from those

1892
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:12,600
around us. We it may be
invisible, it may be subtle, you

1893
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:18,360
know, but it's always there. And
the more we act on that basis,

1894
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:22,460
the more we activate the
strength of those sinews that

1895
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:26,420
bind us to life. And if this is
true, of course, not just for

1896
02:18:26,420 --> 02:18:30,320
human beings other human beings,
it's true for all the life forms

1897
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:33,620
that surround us. And that's the
core teaching of the living

1898
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:38,540
classroom, that there's an
atomistic quality to teaching,

1899
02:18:38,780 --> 02:18:42,880
and then there's a quantum
quality to teaching. So like you

1900
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:46,060
and I have been having kind of
a, in some ways, an atomistic

1901
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:49,960
conversation, but we can trust
that there's a quantum, a

1902
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:53,620
quantum quality to our
conversation, yeah, yeah,

1903
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:58,480
Andrew Holecek: field effect
that is that extends beyond our

1904
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:03,360
limited self sense, which is
illusory in nature, and we have

1905
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:06,120
these, I think, the wonderful
way to end, because really, it

1906
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:10,020
invites us to really discover
that we have so much more power

1907
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:15,060
than we think in both negative
and positive ways, and the

1908
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:18,000
thoughts that we hold, the
aspirations, the motivations,

1909
02:19:18,540 --> 02:19:23,960
It's not just encapsulated in
this little ball of skin. It

1910
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:27,860
just, it's a pebble radiating
out throughout the cosmos, not

1911
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:31,100
just this world. And I think
really understanding that will

1912
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:35,540
empower our ways to benefit the
world. So Chris, I can't thank

1913
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:38,660
you enough for spending so much
time with us. I It's really

1914
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:41,500
quite remarkable. I'm thrilled
to have spent this time with

1915
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:44,320
you. I've learned so much. I
applaud your bravery, your

1916
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:48,460
heart, your capacities in doing
this. It's marvelous, and it's

1917
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:49,720
really being of great benefit.

1918
02:19:49,719 --> 02:19:53,799
Chris Bache: So thank you for
the conversation, Andrew, thank

1919
02:19:53,799 --> 02:19:57,159
you for your work, bringing this
conversation and many similar

1920
02:19:57,159 --> 02:20:00,719
conversations into the world.
Conversations change. Lives.

1921
02:20:01,019 --> 02:20:03,539
Thank you for what you do, and
just thank you for the

1922
02:20:03,539 --> 02:20:06,359
opportunity to talk about these
things together. It's been,

1923
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:08,640
Andrew Holecek: it's been a
delight for me too, and like we

1924
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:11,520
talked briefly last time, this,
this, I haven't really thought

1925
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:15,060
of it before. The dialog, the
conversation, the sharing, is

1926
02:20:15,180 --> 02:20:17,700
actually a quality of path
itself is new for me, and I

1927
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:20,480
haven't really thought of it
that way. So it's a wonderful

1928
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:23,660
insight of many that you shared.
So thank you so much for

1929
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:27,140
everything. Let's do it again
with the next book that comes

1930
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:27,500
out.

1931
02:20:28,459 --> 02:20:32,059
Chris Bache: Oh no, help me, but
I'm always happy to have a

1932
02:20:32,059 --> 02:20:33,259
conversation with you.

1933
02:20:33,379 --> 02:20:34,999
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, really,
yeah. It's such a delight,

1934
02:20:34,999 --> 02:20:37,759
Chris, till next time, thank you
so much for your time. Good

1935
02:20:37,759 --> 02:20:41,799
heart. Love and blessings. Love
and blessings. Thank you, bye,

1936
02:20:41,979 --> 02:20:42,279
bye.

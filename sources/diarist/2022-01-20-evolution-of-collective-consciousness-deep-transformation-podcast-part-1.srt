1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,740
Roger Walsh: Roger, welcome to
today's episode of deep

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,240
transformation, self, society,
spirit. I'm Roger Walsh, and our

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,740
co host is the distinguished
John Dupuy and guest today is

4
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,340
the truly remarkable Chris
Bache, who is a internationally

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,240
known professor of Philosophy
and Religious Studies, an

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,620
author, an award winning teacher
and an internationally known

7
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,020
speaker, usually in these
dialogs, John Knight tries to

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,280
stay in the background. But the
topic of today is so remarkable,

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,540
the experiences described so
literally out of this world,

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,520
that I want to just give a take
a moment to give a context for

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,300
the discussion, compared to the
world's many cultures, Western

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,040
culture is unusual in a variety
of ways. In fact, researchers

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,800
have recently described this as
weird, W, i, e, r, d, Western,

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,380
industrialized, educated, rich
and democratic, and so much

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,360
research has been done on
Westerners, that it was assumed

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,300
that our characteristics were
pretty much common to the

17
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,380
world's cultures. But now we're
beginning to see that that's not

18
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,060
true, and that other cultures
have their own richnesses and

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,960
gifts a wide variety. One very
important distinction between

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,920
traditional Western culture and
most of the world's cultures is

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,640
in their attitude and use of
altered states of consciousness.

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,880
The anthropologist rica bush and
on discovered in her world world

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,940
survey that over 90% of the
world's cultures have

24
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,740
institutionalized altered states
of consciousness, meaning that

25
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,380
they use a variety of practices
to induce specific states of

26
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,980
consciousness and then mine them
for the information and wisdom

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,220
they use and look they and
venerate states such as dreams,

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,200
hypnosis, a trance of various
kind and states induced by

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,380
meditation, contemplation, yoga,
asceticism, a wide variety, and

30
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,420
these cultures, anthropologists
now call Police polyphasic,

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,480
meaning that they draw the
understanding of reality from

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,360
many phases of consciousness. By
contrast, Western culture is

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,380
pretty unique in having been
until very recently, a

34
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,340
monophasic culture, in that we
draw our understanding of

35
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,740
ourselves in the world almost
entirely from the usual waking

36
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,540
state and kind of look down on
other states as inferior or

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,400
deluded or distorted in various
ways. But that's begun to

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,160
change, and it began to change
in the 60s, of course, with an

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,400
introduction of psychedelics to
the culture, which was soon

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,740
followed by an influx of Asian
practices, meditation, yoga,

41
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:27,320
contemplations, and after that,
by the rediscovery and rebirth

42
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,320
of Western contemplative
practices, so that now we have

43
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,600
in the West a wide variety of
practices for inducing altered

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,820
states. And the West is
undergoing a dramatic and very

45
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,380
important but often unrecognized
transformation from a monophasic

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,340
culture to a polyphasic culture,
one in which we are now

47
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,000
beginning to appreciate and
research and draw our

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,080
understanding of ourselves and
Reality from multiple states of

49
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,220
consciousness, one of the most
potent and remarkable ways of

50
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,760
inducing all the states is with
psychedelics. That's what

51
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,720
started our own Western cultures
transformation, and it's now the

52
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,620
subject of a lot of solid
research at places like one of

53
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,860
the leaders is John Hopkins
University, where scientists and

54
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,340
clinical clinicians are
discovering that psychedelics

55
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,520
have, just as the original
research in the 60s and 70s

56
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,700
found a wide variety of
therapeutic applications and and

57
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,960
perhaps most surprising, very
profound spiritual applications,

58
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:53,260
the capacity for inducing
profound openings to radically

59
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,940
altered states in which which
profound vistas and

60
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,200
understandings of ourselves and
re. Howard has become available.

61
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,500
That, of course, is not new to
the rest of the world, but this

62
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,180
is new to Western research, and
the findings are quite

63
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,620
remarkable. So we're very
fortunate in having with us a

64
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,340
man who has devoted his life to
the research of these curious

65
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,440
chemicals, and has done it both
through academic research and

66
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,720
comparative cultural analysis,
but also through a remarkably

67
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,180
intense, long, lasting,
carefully analyzed and

68
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,780
documented systematic
exploration of the use of these

69
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,900
chemicals themselves, his
experiences are nothing less

70
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,960
than extra ordinary, and have
far, far reaching implications

71
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,100
for our understanding of the
fundamental nature of reality in

72
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:58,120
ourselves. He did this in as a
systematic investigation into

73
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,000
the fundamental nature of
reality, and he was able to

74
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,600
reflect on his first hand
observations with the eye of a

75
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:17,160
trained researcher, philosopher,
theologian. And then he pulled

76
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,380
together cross cultural,
historical and religious

77
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,980
evidence to bring to bear on his
own investigations that so these

78
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,740
are some of the remarkable
things our guest, Chris Bache

79
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,360
has explored. I mentioned that
he was a prolific author, and

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,260
His books include dark night,
early dawn, subtitle steps to a

81
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,420
deep ecology of mind. He's also
taught about and written about

82
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,380
education and as an award
winning educator himself, and

83
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,640
his book is titled The living
classroom. And most recently, he

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,380
wrote the literally mind
boggling book LSD in the mind of

85
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,320
the universe, in which he
detailed his exploration of

86
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,360
psychedelics and the insights
they opened for him. So that's a

87
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,200
long introduction, but it felt
important to give a context for

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,460
these very remarkable
experiences that Chris will be

89
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,900
gifting us with in sharing his
his insights over the many years

90
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,040
of deep, systematic exploration.
I've just spent the weekend

91
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,880
going back to the book. I read
it a couple of years ago in

92
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,940
manuscript form, and was
impressed enough to write a

93
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,540
review for it, and I've been
spending the weekend with it,

94
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,360
and once again, I feel like I've
had my worldview expanded

95
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,980
multiple times and my
understanding of myself and

96
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,400
reality challenged multiple
times, all in very valuable

97
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,020
ways. So Chris, that's a long
introduction, but it's truly a

98
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,200
delight and an honor to be with
you today, and thank you so much

99
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,160
for being with us.

100
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,360
Chris Bache: Thank you, Roger.
It's a very warm introduction,

101
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,720
and I'm just delighted to be
here with you and John today.

102
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,320
It's a pleasure.

103
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,980
Roger Walsh: Well, there are
many places we can we can go

104
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,980
with this, and hopefully we
will, but Roger,

105
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,340
John Dupuy: allow me to give my
little two cents, please. Yes.

106
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,240
Last week, Roger asked me, Would
you like to have Christopher

107
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,080
Bache on? I was like, seriously,
yes, and I had one week, or less

108
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,460
than a week, so immediately, I
ordered the book and I got the

109
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,340
audio version. Thank God, and
that's what that's kept me

110
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,900
through the weekend. But I just
want to put out there, your book

111
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,920
dark night, early dawn, was one
of the more important books for

112
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,040
me, personally, that I've ever
read. So when your name came up

113
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,640
again, the possibility to have
this conversation. Now, I'll

114
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,060
tell you what I I can't remember
all the specifics, but after 20

115
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,460
years, it's been a while when I
first read it, I had a

116
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,660
stabilized understanding of
Non-duality based on my

117
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,580
explorations and journeys and
vision questing and fasting and

118
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,360
prayers and meditation and all
that. And I kind of got it, but

119
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,860
the way you expressed it,
something in that book just

120
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,300
consolidated it, and it has been
accessible to me in a stable

121
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,820
form ever since then. So that's
that's a tremendous gift. So

122
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:40,780
this, this book that I have been
listening to is unlike anything

123
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:47,140
that I've experienced, and it is
either you're absolutely sane or

124
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:53,440
you're completely insane. I my
experiences along these lines,

125
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,620
says this really stinks of deep
truth, and I. Also the very

126
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,820
human, the very humble way that
you present, and self revelatory

127
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,580
what's going on in your personal
life and how you did it and

128
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,440
everything is, is somebody with
an open mind, I think, is, is

129
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,760
just ends up trusting you, just,
I'm in the hands of somebody I

130
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,220
can listen to. And then from
there, it goes on to it's very

131
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,380
big. This may be a bringing
together of everything we've

132
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,880
been working on in our
generation, but in a new,

133
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:44,020
holistic, religious, scientific,
everything vision that that

134
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,920
transforms us from a reality
where a lot of us are killing

135
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,380
ourselves or live in deep
depression to an absolutely

136
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,420
1,000% changed view of reality.
And I'm not using that as

137
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,160
hyperbole, at least I'm not
trying to it's that big. It's

138
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,880
that radical. Is that that pay
attention to this.

139
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Chris Bache: Thank you. Your
description, John touches me

140
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,700
very deeply, and it really
touches me that something I've

141
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,340
written has influenced your
experience of Non-duality that

142
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,620
just really touches me. Thank
you,

143
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,940
Roger Walsh: beautiful, yeah,
Chris, of course. I think

144
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,940
everyone will want to know what
motivated you to begin this

145
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,840
extraordinary quest. And maybe
you can just say, say a little

146
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,180
bit about water, the nature of
what you actually did to induce

147
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,020
these remarkable experiences and
what motivated you to begin?

148
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,780
Chris Bache: Well, all my life,
I've had a just a deep passion

149
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,440
to understand our universe. I
mean, I was in the seminary,

150
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,940
starting in high school training
to be a Catholic priest. Left

151
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,960
that went on to get a degree in
theology from Notre Dame and

152
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,620
then Cambridge and brown, I
finished Brown in philosophy of

153
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,960
religion, but an absolute,
convinced agnostic with strong

154
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,620
atheistic inclinations, but the
passion to understand what's

155
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,520
real. Why is there so much
suffering in the world? Is there

156
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,680
an intelligence in existence was
still there, still pushing me in

157
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,580
all of my studies now, I had
finished my dissertation. I was

158
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,000
looking for where to go next,
and I encountered Stan Grof

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,660
book, realms of the human
unconscious, that extraordinary

160
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,060
book that just turned my life
around and one reading, he

161
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,840
convinced me that LSD, or
psychedelics, could be used

162
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,160
safely, if you use them in a pro
with proper precautions to

163
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,300
explore the deep structure of
one's consciousness. And some of

164
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,740
his anecdotes also indicated
more than one's own personal

165
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,440
unconscious that one could reach
out deeper to explore deeper

166
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,160
fabric of consciousness. And I
quickly realized the

167
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,540
philosophical significance, not
just psychological significance,

168
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,820
of his work. So I realized that
people in my profession,

169
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,560
philosophy of religion, my
discipline, would soon the ones

170
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,160
making the most important
contribution to the field would

171
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,700
be people writing out of an
experiential basis, not just an

172
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,080
intellectual basis. To do that,
you have to have not just a few

173
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,620
experiences, but you have to
undergo systematic training in

174
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,440
the discipline. So that's what I
did. It was 1979 when I began

175
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,660
what became a 20 year journey, I
worked for four years, I stopped

176
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,020
for six years for reasons that I
give in the book, and then I

177
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,360
resumed for 10 years. But
overall, over 20 years, I did 73

178
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,500
high dose LSD sessions following
Stan's protocol, and this is a

179
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,320
regimen that I wouldn't
recommend, I really don't

180
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,500
recommend. Today, with
hindsight, I realized that I

181
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:14,520
really pushed myself harder than
was sometimes wise, but I use a

182
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,200
lot of precautions. I took, did
all of the classic training for

183
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,740
and precautions for doing fully
internalized sessions with a

184
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,000
sitter. My sitter was a clinical
psychologist whom I was married

185
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,340
to at the time, Carol and using
very carefully selected

186
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,320
evocative music, basically, let
me mention, I worked with high

187
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,520
doses of LSD initially, because
I was still thinking in terms of

188
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,920
a model of individual awakening
or individual healing. And I was

189
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,700
thinking I knew that karma,
according to the eastern models,

190
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,620
it was finite karma, and
basically I wanted to accelerate

191
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,720
my own. Spiritual development,
and I thought that if I could

192
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,600
sustain the intensity of the
confrontation, I could basically

193
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,340
bite off bigger bites of karma
in each session if I worked with

194
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,940
high doses rather than melt it
more slowly with low doses. And

195
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,320
it was simply a matter of
efficiency. It was hard to hit

196
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,220
time for these sessions in a
dual career marriage, and I just

197
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,700
thought I would work a little
harder, more aggressively. And

198
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,300
that turned out that was based
on a completely false set of

199
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,940
assumptions. I found that in my
work, within a few years, I was

200
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,280
entering into domains that were
far, far beyond anything that

201
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,000
made sense in terms of an
individual model of

202
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,620
transformation. I began to
understand that my sessions had

203
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,180
been had catalyzed something
that was aimed at nothing less

204
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,020
than some type of healing or
transformation of the human

205
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,080
species as a whole. So working
with very, very high doses,

206
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,160
since, since existence is
unified from the very start,

207
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,720
working with high doses that
hyper amplifies consciousness,

208
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,600
activates it only it changes not
only how deep you go, but it

209
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,700
changes how wide you are when
you go there. So it activates a

210
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,320
larger field of consciousness,
which then triggers the the

211
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,400
cycles of death and rebirth that
workings with psychedelics

212
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,540
therapeutically does. So I did
this for 20 years, and I

213
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,780
finished in 1999 and then I
digested those experiences for

214
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,620
another 20 years this. This a
very challenging undertaking. It

215
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,780
took a long time to connect all
the dots and to absorb them, and

216
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:57,880
it took me five years to write
the book. Yeah, yeah, it's a

217
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,900
lot. Yeah. I was thinking I
would be much more comfortable

218
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,860
writing this book posthumously,
holding it and releasing it

219
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,320
posthumously, because it is so
exposing in the sense of your

220
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:19,320
most intimate relationship with
the divine. But the mother told

221
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:25,040
me no, there's no time for that
kind of indulgence. The word it

222
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,220
was needed, and it would mesh,
it would support other people in

223
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,180
their work and our times that
we're going into. Historically,

224
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,920
we all hands on deck. You know,
all hands on deck needed to come

225
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,640
forward now,

226
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,560
Roger Walsh: beautiful and and
it really does feel that this

227
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,260
work you did, and really was
work of exploration with these

228
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:56,740
psychedelics and the writing of
the book, really is was done out

229
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,940
of a very large motive And and
as you said, it was, it was

230
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,220
work. I was struck by just the,
you know, our culture has this

231
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,380
very naive media view of
psychedelics as being done for,

232
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,740
you know, getting high and
having a good time. And, yes,

233
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,860
that can happen. But, and you
had some extraordinary ecstatic

234
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,980
experiences. But you also went
through the hell realms, not

235
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,460
once, but multiple times. And as
you describe having to open to

236
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,820
levels of not only your own
suffering, but collective

237
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,440
suffering, the history of human
cruelty, et cetera, et cetera. I

238
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,620
mean, this was extraordinary. I
just found myself bowing to the

239
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,700
courage you had to bring to this
time after time after time, and

240
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:56,320
yet you always seem to find that
ultimately, there was a value in

241
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,840
the suffering. I wonder if you
could say what kept you going

242
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,240
and what kind of value found
there.

243
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,260
Chris Bache: Well, this was the
great gift that Stan gave me in

244
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,940
his work. He taught me to trust
the process, and that was

245
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,180
affirmed in my own experience.
And my experience was, if you

246
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,200
completely trust the process and
let your session take you where

247
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,200
it wants to take you, it may get
worse and worse. You may enter

248
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,920
experiences that are completely
inscrutable, that completely

249
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,280
horrifying. You don't understand
why you're going here or what

250
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,000
sense it makes. But if you
surrender to it completely, this

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,540
will come eventually to a
culmination, and you'll be taken

252
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,380
through a Death-Rebirth cycle.
You some part of you will die,

253
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,540
will slough off. You'll be taken
into a transition. And through

254
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,520
this transition, you will awaken
in a different reality, into a

255
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,420
different level of reality. And
for the remainder of that

256
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,940
session, you will. Experience,
teaching our experiences within

257
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,020
a completely ecstatic framework.
So there is the purification

258
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,160
side of a session and the
ecstatic side of a session. So

259
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,420
what you internalize at the end
of the day is not just the

260
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,920
suffering, but the entire cycle
that suffering reaches a peak.

261
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,360
There is a culmination, there is
a breakthrough, and then there's

262
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,340
joy and ecstasy and communion,
and then integration at the end,

263
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:35,000
it's the balance of the joy and
the ecstasy of insight with the

264
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,120
purification process that makes
it manageable. If I had to go

265
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,480
through all the suffering for
years. Without that ecstatic

266
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,640
teaching, I would not have been
able to do it as it was. It was

267
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,220
difficult when I was going
through the ocean of suffering,

268
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,120
which was in the third and
fourth years of the work, fifth,

269
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,080
fifth year of the work, the
morning of a session, was

270
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,100
difficult because I had a sense
of what I was getting into,

271
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,180
where it was going, but I don't
think it's any more difficult

272
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,120
than a soldier on the eve of a
battle or a mother on the eve of

273
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,480
labor. You know if it's
especially if it's your second

274
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,000
or third birth, you know what
you're getting into. You know

275
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,860
it's going to be a hard day. You
Gird your loins and you prepare

276
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,860
for it. And in for my case, I
don't think what I did was any

277
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,960
more exotic than someone who
wants to climb Mount Everest or

278
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,920
someone who wants to go to the
North Pole. Personally, I don't

279
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,860
know why anybody in their right
mind would want to climb Mount

280
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,920
Everest, you know, but you but I
do understand the explorers

281
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,720
mentality. I wanted to see, I
wanted to understand, I wanted

282
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,000
to know. And no matter how deep
I went, I found that there was

283
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,720
always more that I could be
shown, that would be shown me.

284
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,200
John Dupuy: Did you feel you
were being held or guided in

285
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,960
some in some sense, taken care
of in

286
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,080
Chris Bache: this journey and
every step along the way, when I

287
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,320
would go through this
consciousness was waiting for

288
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,060
me, and I might not understand
the logic of the sequence of the

289
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,840
pairing of things for years. In
fact, there are certain things

290
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,620
that I only began to understand
when I wrote the book, but as I

291
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,580
went through, I had a basic
structure enough to know that

292
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,540
there was a logic to this
process, and I always felt met.

293
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,480
I felt met and engaged,
sometimes very consciously,

294
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,360
where I would ask questions and
it would orchestrate my

295
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,940
experience. But always, there
was an intelligence, meeting me,

296
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,240
taking me, educating me,
breaking me down, beating me

297
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,100
down to dust, taking me further,
taking me back, over and over

298
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,240
again until I understood
something, and then it would

299
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,360
take me deeper. And there was a
systematic progression to this

300
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,260
process. I found that this
systematic progression was

301
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,040
really important, because
there's so many levels of

302
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,680
consciousness that it can take
you into but when you enter a

303
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,880
new level of consciousness, it's
very disorienting. It just

304
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,500
cognitively is confusing you,
and this manifests by not being

305
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,100
able to remember everything that
happened to you. You just don't

306
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,260
have a framework in your mind to
hold it. But if you go back to

307
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,360
it again and again and again,
and you're systematic and

308
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,140
rigorous, and you record
carefully, your system will

309
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,920
acclimate, and you will learn
how to stay conscious in

310
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,900
dimensions of reality that
previously had swallowed you and

311
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,440
I actually began in Time to
realize that this deeper

312
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,040
consciousness was titrating the
experiences of Transcendence,

313
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,140
giving me time to absorb and
acclimate, even though sometimes

314
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:16,740
I wanted to run on it kept me
and fed me in small steps so

315
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,040
that I could retain and hold
what it had been Giving me.

316
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,260
Because the purpose I found was
not simply to transcend and

317
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,460
experience some form of ecstasy.
The purpose was to bring that

318
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,380
ecstasy back into your time
space consciousness. And first,

319
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,480
hold on to it, remember it, and
then secondly, digest it and let

320
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,920
it seep into your bones as
deeply as possible.

321
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,500
John Dupuy: And you talked about
in the book is how you framed,

322
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,660
or you became to understand that
the hell realms, suffering

323
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:58,360
realms that you would have to
visit were for your benefit and

324
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,520
they were for purification. Mm.
Or that they were getting you

325
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,860
prepared for the revelation.

326
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,860
Chris Bache: Yeah, there. It's
complicated. I mean, it took me

327
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,580
about two and a half years to go
through what Stan Grof calls the

328
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,280
perinatal dimension of
consciousness, the perinatal

329
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,840
level where the purifications
are very intense, and the

330
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,260
physical purification and
emotional purifications, which

331
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,560
eventually end, and for me,
ended an ego death, you know,

332
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,940
like just being shattered, my
entire physical identity being

333
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,440
turned inside out. And then the
ocean of suffering began. And in

334
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,340
the beginning, I thought this
was a deeper form of personal

335
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,340
suffering. It was a deeper form
of ego death, but eventually,

336
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,300
and this is why I wrote Dark
Matter Lee dawn at core, to

337
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,140
answer this question, to solve
the riddle, why did the

338
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,520
suffering get as large as it
did? And the conclusion I came

339
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,420
to is that it really wasn't
aimed at my personal

340
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,400
transformation at all. It was
aimed at healing the human

341
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,380
species, that the human psyche
in an aggregate form, at the

342
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,780
collective unconscious, there
are wounds which humanity has

343
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,840
still not healed, the things
that we've done to each other in

344
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,580
war, the terrible disasters that
all the suffering that human

345
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:30,320
beings have accumulated, not all
of it, has been healed, and that

346
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,580
there are vast tracks of the
collective psyche where this

347
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,860
suffering still festers. And I
think every spiritual tradition

348
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:46,780
recognizes that in deep
spiritual practice, you have an

349
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:52,120
opportunity. You don't have to
do it, but an invitation is

350
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,500
sometimes extended, that if you
are willing to take on some of

351
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,540
that suffering, literally, just
to become aware of it, it can

352
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,720
move through you and resolve
itself, just like our personal

353
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,780
suffering enters into our
awareness, moves through us and

354
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:13,500
resolves itself. And so for two
years, I did the ocean of

355
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,900
suffering work, and it wasn't
really until about halfway

356
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,100
through that that I began to
understand that this wasn't for

357
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,560
me. It was for my family. It was
for the human family, and only

358
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,480
later did I begin to understand
the historical circumstances of

359
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,580
our times that made the healing
of the human family, the healing

360
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:42,820
of our past, so important in
order to clear the foundation,

361
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,920
so to speak, to allow an
imminent transformation to take

362
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,420
place in history.

363
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,920
John Dupuy: And I'm sure that
gave you, you mentioned girding

364
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,960
your lines up, that gave you
that warrior or soldierly

365
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,140
perspective, it's not just about
you, Chris, you know, to do this

366
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:14,940
thing that was way beyond, way
beyond any human capacity to

367
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,900
survive, I would believe, just,
just on its own, but To keep

368
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,200
coming back and not and it
shifts from being an individual

369
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,160
quest to

370
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,800
Chris Bache: everybody and
everything. And it may be the

371
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:36,320
case that this, it's largely a
function of my choice to work

372
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,540
with these very, very high doses
that blow you so deeply into the

373
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,380
deep structure of reality. But I
think one of the things I

374
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,520
learned it made this may not
open for everybody. Everybody

375
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,380
may not enter these domains. One
of the things I learned over the

376
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,260
course of my journey is that
this was a task which my soul

377
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,500
took on before I was born. So
this was part of my karmic

378
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,360
choice to do this work so it
wasn't forced upon me and it

379
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:16,620
wasn't a tragedy. It was simply
part of my life's work, and the

380
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,340
universe more than rewarded me
for this phase of the work,

381
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,780
because following the ocean of
suffering, it took me places in

382
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,180
the ocean of suffering, and
afterwards it more than amply

383
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:39,680
paid me, or repaid me for taking
this work on. As always happens,

384
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,300
whenever you do anything for
others, the universe has no

385
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,440
choice but to get give back to
you. That's because the universe

386
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,240
acts out of oneness. So if we do
something for others, it always

387
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,700
comes back to you in one form or
another,

388
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,760
Roger Walsh: beautiful and in a
sense. Sounds as though this

389
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,020
shift you went through from the
assumption with which you

390
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,340
entered this work, that you were
doing it for your own

391
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,380
understanding, Revelation,
transformation, and yet you were

392
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,640
forced, almost against your
inclinations, to see this in a

393
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,040
larger context, that you were in
some way, some mysterious way,

394
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,600
both opening to and allowing
yourself to be an instrument for

395
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,040
the transformation of collective
consciousness. And I can

396
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,680
certainly understand that was
challenging, because it's a very

397
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,500
different it's a different world
view. It's a very different set

398
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,280
of assumptions about the nature
of ourselves and reality that

399
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,300
even makes that recognition
possible. And I can certainly

400
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,540
understand what a shift that
was. Would you like to say more

401
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,140
about that?

402
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,960
Chris Bache: My first concern
was that, at first it sounded

403
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,700
like ego gone amok. I mean, it
sounded like ego inflation. And

404
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,760
so I really had to sit with that
for a long time, because my

405
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,740
experiences were telling me that
was not what was happening, but

406
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,460
the larger challenges, as you
said, Roger, this is a very

407
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,360
different worldview in the
classic individual patient

408
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,640
model, you the individual is
having experiences. So you the

409
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,100
individual has Transpersonal
experiences, and the individual

410
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,120
is always kind of at the center
of the circle. But in this

411
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:45,100
model, my individual existence
was completely secondary to this

412
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:51,340
dynamic, and so it becomes not a
matter of my being being central

413
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,660
to what's happening. I got the
system, I got something started,

414
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,080
but I dissolve completely into
pre existing fields of

415
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,980
consciousness. And these fields
of consciousness are, what are

416
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:11,100
the dynamic force having these
experiences? So it manifests not

417
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,280
only in the ocean of suffering,
but it manifests later, when I

418
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,700
was going into archetypal
reality and causal oneness.

419
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:26,540
Reality, it's hard to describe,
but in many ways, in many

420
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:33,440
experiences, I was like Chris
Bache was like a bit player, not

421
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,300
like there is something going
on. This is so challenging that

422
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,540
the in the book, I have an
appendix, which, in the appendix

423
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,160
is what dies and is reborn. When
you experience so many deaths

424
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,320
and rebirths, it becomes a
cognitive question, what is it

425
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,840
that's actually dying? It feels
personal and you experience it.

426
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,520
Is it just ego dying over and
over again? And the answers that

427
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,920
I offer at that in that part, I
know, push very, very far. I

428
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,160
mean, because on the one hand,
it's ego, and then it becomes

429
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,360
species ego, and then it becomes
something I call the shamanic

430
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,560
persona. But in the end, what is
dying, I think, is literally

431
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,880
some aspect of cosmic
consciousness, or some dimension

432
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,600
of cosmic reality, is softening
and surrendering and opening up

433
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,360
to a still deeper dimension of
cosmic consciousness. And this

434
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,540
deeper dimension of cosmic
consciousness pours its

435
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:48,760
blessings into me at the very
bottom. But it's not primarily

436
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,780
into me. It pours it into the
deeper dimension of cosmic

437
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,280
consciousness itself. And I know
those are very hard concepts to

438
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,880
entertain, and it's a it's a
very different way of thinking,

439
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,200
and it's tentative my
description, but something along

440
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,940
that order, I think, is required
to understand when you explode

441
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,860
consciousness this radically.
And again, I don't think it's

442
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:23,240
wise for people to explode
consciousness this radically, I

443
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,580
would work with lower doses. I'd
work with Psilocybin, gentler

444
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,300
substances, if I were doing it
over again. Here, we have to

445
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,820
appreciate that LSD in this
quantity, when it's contained,

446
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:43,600
when it's intensified in a
therapeutic modality, you

447
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,680
basically just shatter your
consciousness and dissolve it

448
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:54,820
far beyond physical limits, and
you spend hours dissolved into

449
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:02,880
some stratum of the universe
and. And then you congeal and

450
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,700
consolidate it. And then you
shatter, leaving your historical

451
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,100
existence radically behind and
dissolve into into some fabric,

452
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:19,860
some stratosphere, of
consciousness. And you live

453
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:26,540
there for a while. It lives. You
are it part of it as it lives.

454
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:36,680
And then you congeal and bring
it back and hold it beautiful.

455
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,860
Roger Walsh: I'd love, I'd love
to tease out several things you

456
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,760
said, but, but I do want to ask
a very specific question, that

457
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,820
is, you've referred on several
occasions to the very high doses

458
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,500
of LSD used. So might you just
tell us what doses you did use?

459
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,700
Chris Bache: Yeah, I aim to be
working at 600 micrograms, but

460
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,020
because I wasn't using a
pharmaceutical, identified dose,

461
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:09,540
I would say 500 to 600
micrograms to be safe, but it

462
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,400
was not less than five.

463
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,260
Roger Walsh: There's a lot of
LSD, yes, put mildly, and I want

464
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,680
to, I want to tea, tease out
your description of this very

465
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,220
remarkable phenomena, that of
the Death-Rebirth experiences,

466
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,300
which is found as a as a and
recognized as a very important

467
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,920
experience, and a literal birth
experience, Psych, spiritual

468
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,700
birth experience across the
world, spiritual traditions.

469
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,260
It's deliberately sought in
traditions such as Shamanism,

470
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,860
and yet you describe it in not
an entirely new way, but a

471
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:59,380
radically expanded way, as a
repetitive process of dying to

472
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,260
one identity and limitation
after another, after another,

473
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,980
after another, reconstituting a
new, new, more porous, expanded

474
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,780
identity, and then having to
offer that into into the whole

475
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,100
and let me just see check my
Understanding of Death-Rebirth

476
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,080
against yours. And have you?
Have you respond, from your

477
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,100
enlarged perspective, to me, it
seems that what actually dies,

478
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,320
what we confuse ourselves to be,
and what actually dies and

479
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,820
Death-Rebirth experience is our
self representation. We mistake

480
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:45,880
a self image or a self concept
or a self narrative for our true

481
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:52,060
self, and what needs to die is
that representation. So it dies,

482
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,560
we find ourselves opened to a
much larger perspective and

483
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,480
possibility, both of both of our
own identity and of the nature

484
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,140
of reality. But for some reason,
I tended to think, until hearing

485
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,700
you just now, I tended to think
of for psychological reasons,

486
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,560
psychodynamic, habitual patterns
re establish themselves, and

487
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,260
another self representation
forms. But you're putting this

488
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,700
in a larger, more cosmic or
ontological perspective,

489
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,960
suggesting that an even deeper
understanding of the of the

490
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,480
Death-Rebirth would be that one
that as part of the cosmic play,

491
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:42,220
the leela, the the the formation
of the universe by the two

492
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,560
cosmic beings that you describe
in one place in your book, that

493
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,440
that separation is built into
the game, the cosmic game, as

494
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,820
Stan Grof would call it. And
what I'm understanding you to

495
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,940
say is that identity is
reconstituted in a rebirth

496
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,100
process because of the very
nature of the of the universe

497
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,940
and consciousness that
consciousness separates so as to

498
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,660
play again. Am I understanding
you correctly?

499
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,620
Chris Bache: I think your
description of ego death is spot

500
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:27,200
on. What dies is what is
consumed. Is our self

501
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,280
representation, what we have,
our sense of identity that we've

502
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,640
amassed from our physical
experience and our time space

503
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,380
existence, our time space
experience. And I also want to

504
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,020
mention that every every
medicine has a certain range. It

505
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,380
has a certain, you know,
signature, and it has a sort of

506
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:53,680
power and of range. Psilocybin
has a certain depth of range

507
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,600
that even if you repeat it many
times, it will reach you, take

508
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,500
you into the upper register. But
still, there is a upper

509
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,900
register. Ayahuasca has a range,
and maybe I think of it as a

510
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:13,260
deeper upper register. Salvia
divinorum has a range, ketamine

511
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:19,260
and five Meo, DMT, all of these
substances have ranges. Now one

512
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,200
of the things, and LSD has a
range, and of course, then we

513
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:30,380
start looking at doses and how
doses affect the range. Now, I

514
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:36,680
tend to experience Psilocybin as
a very body grounded type of

515
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,440
psychedelic experience, very
much tuned to my emotional body,

516
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:47,500
it opens up a range, but it's
it's it's it stays, in a sense,

517
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,000
within the parameters. It
stretches, but does not shatter

518
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,620
as aggressively as LSD does the
parameters of individual

519
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,660
identity, but it can dissolve
them, soften them, and open this

520
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:09,360
up, in my experience in working
with high doses of LSD, is that

521
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,460
all of these things happen, but
because of the particular

522
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,520
intensity of this substance and
its lack of history,

523
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,680
anthropologically, it's
therefore it doesn't have the

524
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,400
fields associated with it that
Psilocybin and Mescaline or

525
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,900
Peyote have associated with it.
It tends to shatter our time

526
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,280
space identity, and throw us in
a level of experience that lies

527
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:46,780
beyond that reality in a
spiritual reality. But if we, if

528
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:53,260
we go back to that place again
and again, our experience there

529
00:41:53,260 --> 00:42:00,420
begins to congeal, and we
develop an alternative identity

530
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,540
persona. I call it the shamanic
persona. It is an identity which

531
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,760
is comprised of all of my
experiences at that level of

532
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,240
Transpersonal reality. And it's
kind of super ordinate to my

533
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,740
individual egoic identity. But
it's stable. If my experiences

534
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,920
have been well managed, it's
stable. So that when I go into a

535
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,220
psychedelic space, and I
transition away from time and

536
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:37,100
space and I I enter into a
familiar sense of self at a

537
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:45,640
certain level of spiritual
reality. But if and I acclimate

538
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,840
there, I learn how to stay
conscious there. I i learn the

539
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:56,800
ropes, and then I but if I keep
pushing the edge, if I if the if

540
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,980
the chemical is strong enough,
and if the intent is focused

541
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,960
enough, eventually, in my
experience, you come to the

542
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:11,820
ceiling, and at that ceiling,
there is a cost that's exacted.

543
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,740
Another round of death takes
place. But what's dying is not

544
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,680
the ego. What's dying is that
shamanic persona or that second

545
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,600
identity, because that second
identity is a holder of a

546
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,560
certain level of Transpersonal
experience. And if you want to

547
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,940
go deeper, you don't need to,
but if you want to go deeper,

548
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:40,660
you've got to die at that lower
shamanic level. And so the

549
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,160
shamanic identity dies, and you
transition into yet another

550
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,660
level of reality in which the
whole workings of the universe

551
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:55,000
is different, different rules,
different phenomena exist,

552
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,440
different bandwidth, so to
speak. And you must acclimate to

553
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,620
that level of reality. Every
step deeper into the universe is

554
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:10,680
a step into a higher level of
energy. I can over. And you to

555
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,600
acclimate at a particular level
of reality, you must acclimate

556
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,820
to the energy. And that's some
of the very, very intense

557
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:27,020
cleansing that continues to take
place, 3040, 50 sessions in is

558
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,200
because you're, you're you're
learning how to stabilize

559
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,840
consciousness is extremely high
levels of Energy. That just

560
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:44,860
takes a long time. So, so what
eventually came out of all of

561
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,460
this is appreciate is an
understanding that death and

562
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,200
rebirth is stage specific, that
there are many levels of the

563
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,740
universe, and if you
systematically push through

564
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:02,880
those levels, there are a. Gates
that you come to, so to speak,

565
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:10,080
and at each gate, there is a
sacrifice asked now at the end,

566
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,980
eventually, once you've died so
many times, death becomes a

567
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,120
meaningless concept, because you
always learn that you're always

568
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,160
going to be reborn. Some essence
of our identity will continue.

569
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:29,300
The Phoenix always rises.
Eventually, the concept, or the

570
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,200
concept of death, as an
interpretation of what's

571
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,660
happening, yielded to a concept
of purification. I learned that

572
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,060
all dying is, in fact,
purification. It's just that

573
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,720
when purification reaches so
deep, it's destructuring

574
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,360
whatever self representation or
whatever reality representation

575
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:58,600
you're operating within, it
becomes purification unto death.

576
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,620
It's actually dissolving the
structures within which you are

577
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:07,380
holding reality and death. So
it's it's death, but it's a

578
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,800
fluid death. It's a purification
process.

579
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,800
John Dupuy: So, so Chris
following up what Roger asked

580
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,720
about what dies? Well, what
doesn't die?

581
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,500
Unknown: Yeah. Ah.

582
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,280
John Dupuy: Because in your
book, you talk a lot about

583
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:30,440
reincarnation has been being a
given in in the universe as it

584
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,140
was revealed to you, this
universe, multiverse, whatever

585
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,840
this mysterium tremendum is that
you've brought back to us to

586
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,900
talk about, so what doesn't die?

587
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,100
Chris Bache: Well, I think when
we go deep, we realize that

588
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,600
everything is dying constantly.
Everything is dying and living

589
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,020
and dying and living constantly.
There. There are no stable

590
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:01,020
things which are not dying in
this universe. And to see that

591
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,620
clearly of is, of course, is is
considered a great

592
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,220
accomplishment to really
understand that everything is

593
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,920
temporary, everything is
transition, everything is

594
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:18,720
moving. Everything is fluid,
holding on. You know, people

595
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:25,100
have asked me, What is it dies.
And you know, there is, what I

596
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,780
will say is, there is, there is
always continuity of memory. If

597
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,380
you do your if you organize your
session, well, there is

598
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,460
continuity of recall. So
therefore there is continuity of

599
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,440
memory. You might say that
memory doesn't die, but I don't

600
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,980
really think that's the best way
to describe it. I think memory

601
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:53,920
is shattered and reconstitutes
into it. I don't know of I don't

602
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,620
know what doesn't die, but
here's, here's something

603
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,260
John Dupuy: is being purified,
right? What is that? What is

604
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,520
that that's being purified?

605
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,920
Chris Bache: Well, I'd go
farther and say, I think that in

606
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,380
this process that life gives
birth to individuality, not an

607
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,260
ego, not a self, but life is
giving birth to an

608
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,940
individuality, and the nature
that individuality matures and

609
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:24,260
deepens as the soul matures and
deepens, and as one's spiritual

610
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:29,780
experiences deepen, my
understanding, I mean the

611
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,260
Vedanta traditions and many
spiritual traditions basically

612
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,160
believe that the individual is
an illusion, and the goal is to

613
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,800
shatter the illusion and to
dissolve irretrievably into the

614
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,680
oneness of all existence. I
understand that cosmology, but I

615
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,160
think it's a mistake, and it
doesn't jive with my experience.

616
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:58,600
My experience the universe is is
very intensely interested in

617
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:03,720
birthing an individuality and in
aging that individuality and

618
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,400
refining that individuality and
maturing it so that in the end,

619
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,180
we die, but we die in order to
grow up, and we die again in

620
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:20,480
order to grow up. In the end,
this is what I call the birth of

621
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,000
the diamond soul, that
reincarnation basically is aging

622
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,720
us stage by stage, level by
level, helping us grow and to

623
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,900
become more than we were, more
than we were. But sooner or

624
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:38,780
later, we reach a point where
all of our former lives and all

625
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,040
of the history, all the
experiences and wisdom and

626
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,460
mistakes we've made, all of it
comes together into an

627
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,840
integrated singularity. And as
I've experienced that

628
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,320
singularity, when I experienced
that happen in my sessions,

629
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,280
there was an absolute. I was
catapulted into a state of

630
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,620
awareness beyond anything I.
Experienced up to that point in

631
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:07,920
time. I was an individual, but I
was an individual in pure

632
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,360
Shunyata emptiness, condition,
transparent, open to all

633
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:18,120
existence. I was individual, but
within a boundless existence,

634
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:25,100
but I had my full memory intact,
and I think that this is where

635
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,080
the universe or the Divine is
taking all human beings, that

636
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,520
individuality is not the
problem, separation is the

637
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:41,140
problem. Ego, boundedness is the
problem. Individuality is not

638
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,700
the problem. Individuality is
the great beauty. It's one of

639
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,240
the great gifts that the Creator
is giving us the opportunity to

640
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,740
be an individual.

641
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,780
Roger Walsh: Chris, can you draw
a distinction there between the

642
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,320
individual, individuality and
separation? Let me see if I'm

643
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,240
understanding individuality
gives a sense of the recognition

644
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,160
of of I can't come up with
another word that into being

645
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:14,520
individual, but separation
usually is but, but the

646
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,000
individual can be so there can
be a sense of individuality

647
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,520
within the recognition of one's
innate connection with

648
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,660
dependence on an ultimate unity
with the all, or the pure

649
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,960
consciousness. Is that? How you
would distinguish from

650
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,820
separation where there is a
forgetting of the connection to

651
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,660
the greater whole?

652
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:44,560
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think when
Buddhism teaches Shunyata and

653
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:50,080
when it teaches anata no self,
they are not they're basically

654
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,920
defining a type of self
experience where this we

655
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,240
experience ourselves cut off
from other selves, we experience

656
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:05,580
ourselves as cut off and away
from the universe itself. When

657
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:13,320
that self dies, one experiences
an individuality which is porous

658
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,700
to others, and that is we live
in compassion, and we experience

659
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:22,040
an individuality which is in
communion with surrounding

660
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,540
layers and layers of
consciousness, so that there is

661
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:32,900
a spiritual openness and an
openness of compassion to other

662
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,940
beings. We are still an
individual, but we are an

663
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,780
individual that's situated
within the boundaryless

664
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,560
condition

665
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:50,560
Roger Walsh: and so and it
sounds as though I may take me a

666
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,460
little moment to unravel this,
but it sounds as though you're

667
00:52:54,460 --> 00:53:00,780
saying there's a value In that
individuality. And I'm reminded

668
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:06,420
of Ramakrishna, a great Indian
mystic who was just

669
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,540
extraordinarily fluid in his
ability to roam through

670
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,860
different realizations and
states. And he described being

671
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:19,380
lost in unity, but but then
longing for separation so that

672
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,880
he could worship and relate to
the mother, so there were both

673
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,480
sides there, and I hear
something similar here. There

674
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,420
are some traditions you pointed
to, Advaita Vedanta, for

675
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,900
example, where the where the
self is regarded as an illusion,

676
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:37,520
the fundamental reality is our
inseparability, or is rather the

677
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,160
Non-duality of existence. And
yet it sounds like you're

678
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,360
pointing to out of your own and
here's the beauty of it, it came

679
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,320
out of your own experience. You
were aware of all these

680
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,400
traditions, these ontologies,
cosmology, metaphysics. And yet

681
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,860
out of your own experience, it
feels like you came to the sense

682
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,080
that there is a beauty and
perfection in the individuality

683
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,120
in and of itself. Is that
correct

684
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:12,900
Chris Bache: it is? It is, and
let me frame it this way, before

685
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,960
the before time and space
existed, before the physical

686
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,220
universe existed, when
everything was in the pure,

687
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,800
fertile void condition when
whatever you want to call the

688
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:32,960
absolute made a choice to
manifest physical existence. The

689
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,960
physical universe is the only
thing strong enough, I think, to

690
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:47,260
shatter the the oneness. Of the
absolute, into pieces that then

691
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:52,540
can become individually awakened
to what it is within the body of

692
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:58,360
the Divine. So the the great
gift of the physical universe,

693
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,980
or one of the great gifts. Of
the physical universe is

694
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:09,240
literally the density that
causes the oneness of the Divine

695
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,020
to shatter into pieces, so that
those pieces can become

696
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,880
operational as Divine within the
body of the Divine, and in that

697
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,240
context, individuality, I think,
is one of the great gifts of

698
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,860
creation. It's one of the great
gifts of of the universe. And I

699
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:32,960
don't think the creator wants to
destroy that individuality.

700
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,380
After billions and billions of
years of getting us to this

701
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,420
point, finally, when we wake up
and become conscious and we can

702
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,140
drop our conscious down to
source and understand and

703
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,520
identify that part of us which
is universal, which is oneness

704
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,420
with all the universal, with
what is alive. I don't think the

705
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,300
intention is then to simply say,
Okay, let's destroy that. I

706
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,560
think we're growing, and I think
we're going to be growing for

707
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,220
billions and billions and
billions of years more. We are

708
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:10,920
just getting started in this
process of waking up to the to

709
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:18,600
the vast expanse of existence.
And yet we're waking up in a way

710
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,340
in which we become lovers of it.
We become servants of it. We

711
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,260
become a fractal embodiment of
it. All these different

712
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,400
metaphors for describing this
mystery of the dance. Let me

713
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:38,540
John Dupuy: just say that I've
seen the same thing, and you

714
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:42,340
expressed it much more
eloquently. And I feel like I'm

715
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,980
a yellow belt, you know, I'm
talking to a 10th Don or

716
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:50,320
something like that. But yeah,
that somehow, in in the awe, the

717
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:56,620
preciousness of the individual
that is that infinitely more

718
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:01,020
precious, at the same time, it's
a yes, and it's this and that,

719
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:07,080
and it's working itself out, and
that's come through very clearly

720
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,760
for me at times. And I had to
rethink a lot of my ideas about

721
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,740
psychology, given that and feels
deeply human at a good at a deep

722
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,620
level. And also, let me say what
you were, what you were

723
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,600
describing, is your experience,
at some point, self awakens,

724
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:29,300
okay? Dink, that just opens.
That's just Jesus said a man

725
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,700
must be born again. Well, what
happens when you're born? You're

726
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,340
just little helpless infant.
You're not good for anything but

727
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:38,720
being precious. And that's the
beginning of the journey. And

728
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,580
then it seems that you're
talking about a Christ like or a

729
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:46,540
Bodhisattva. Responsibility. At
a certain point we have to take

730
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,840
on responsibility, not just for
own awaking, our own mistakes,

731
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:55,600
our own suffering, but for for
the all, for the collective. And

732
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:03,060
that adds, I guess, the word is,
a nobility to the task that

733
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:07,260
otherwise would just be very
narcissistic, if you will, and

734
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:13,140
just very, you know, chasing
your tail, but, but that, that

735
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,220
understanding, that quality that
you express at a deep, deep

736
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:21,920
level is, I Think, is essential,
and because we have the

737
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,780
archetype of Jesus, of a human
being whom an individual who was

738
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,440
crucified and murdered in this
most horrible way almost

739
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,560
imaginable, who then goes down
into the underworld and blah

740
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:39,740
blah, but comes back still, him
barely recognizable. Some of his

741
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,420
disciples didn't. But at some
level, a transformed level that

742
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,340
has kept the rest of us running
in his, you know, his path for a

743
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,540
couple of 1000 years. But that's
a story of the individual that's

744
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:58,900
contained within our western our
western treasure chest of wisdom

745
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,560
stories.

746
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:06,000
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah. It is a
story of divine incarnation come

747
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,200
to fruition. And I think that
story has archetypal

748
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,680
ramifications that are much
larger than the Christology that

749
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,760
was developed to under to
interpret it, which ended up

750
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,940
making Jesus into a unique being
when really he's a prototype,

751
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,300
Unknown: beautiful, nice,

752
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,060
Roger Walsh: and that that seems
to be a major division that

753
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:36,500
occurs in each of the great
religions, and probably other

754
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:41,680
many others as well, and perhaps
reflecting different different

755
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,100
developmental, psychological
developmental stages on the

756
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,280
people who make the
interpretation the the the

757
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,860
founder is either elevated to
unique status which the rest of

758
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:59,740
us can only approximate at best,
or is recognized as an exemplar

759
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:03,660
and. You called a prototype of
the capacities and potentials

760
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:07,680
latent within us. Seems a very
important distinction you point

761
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:15,480
Chris Bache: to the I want to
mention that, as you said, John,

762
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,540
when you begin to experientially
tap into that in us, which is

763
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:27,380
universal, then eventually all
aspects of your life heats to to

764
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:32,600
come in alignment with that. And
that's why love is is you know,

765
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:38,360
deep you know, not arrows, but
agape, love and compassion,

766
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:43,960
social justice, fairness,
naturally arises as one.

767
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:49,480
Spiritual practice deepens
because you have discovered this

768
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,400
hybrid nature within yourself.
You are individually awake and

769
01:00:54,580 --> 01:01:00,180
awake to a universal bond, a
universal level of reality that

770
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:06,960
becomes an expression simply of
your true nature. It's just

771
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:14,640
spontaneous. And I also want to
mention that I don't think you

772
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,040
have you certainly don't have to
go where I went in order to

773
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,540
spiritually awaken, even if you
wanted to use psychedelics or

774
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,320
spiritual awakening. To me,
there's three uses that I'd

775
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:32,840
separate, using of psychedelics
for healing, using of

776
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,040
psychedelics to spiritually
awakening. And then a third,

777
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:43,240
which is what my journey became,
a cosmological exploration. If I

778
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,860
wanted to use psychedelics for
simply spiritual awakening, I

779
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,880
would recommend a protocol
working with very low doses,

780
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,760
because it's about dissolving
the ego, and you got to get

781
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,520
after where the ego lives in the
world, and that's closer to

782
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,740
time, space realities. You do
not need to shatter time to

783
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:05,580
become spiritually awakened. You
don't need to enter archetype or

784
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,340
reality. You don't need to go
back to the beginning of the

785
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:13,380
universe to become genuinely
enthusiastically spiritually

786
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:19,380
awakened. What I started kind of
aiming at spiritual awakening,

787
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,960
but the method was so powerful
it shoved me in a way past that,

788
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:30,620
or through that into a deeper,
into a different agenda. And I'm

789
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:36,020
entirely sympathetic to
spiritual teachers who would

790
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:40,640
say, you know, your time would
be better spent cultivating on

791
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,820
abiding the abiding presence of
the transparent condition, then

792
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,020
learning these, going on this
quest to learn how the universe

793
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,720
is put together in these
different levels. And I

794
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,040
understand that critique, and I
I share it to a degree myself. I

795
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:01,020
wonder sometimes whether I would
have my time would have been

796
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,680
better spent focusing more on
the Enlightenment side of the

797
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,880
things than the cosmic
exploration side. But what

798
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,240
happened in my work is that it
pushed deeper into the

799
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:16,440
cosmological exploration side.

800
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,920
John Dupuy: Well, you said you
were a philosopher, and you went

801
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:26,000
with a philosopher's quest into
this journey, and exactly what

802
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,420
you said, and it's exactly what
you did, so there's no flip

803
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,140
flopping there,

804
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:36,740
Roger Walsh: and you did it with
a very specific aspiration and

805
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:42,760
intention. Chris, I recall that
you said before each session you

806
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,800
would affect you effectively
offer yourself as an instrument

807
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,120
for the highest good of all,
very similar to the Bodhisattva

808
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:56,560
aspiration, or even reminded me
of Jesus statement, not my will,

809
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:02,640
but thine. It really felt like a
an offer, an unrestricted

810
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:08,700
offering of yourself as an
instrument for for acquiring

811
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:14,280
whatever wisdom you could was
opened to you, or you were

812
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,420
gifted or graced with in order
to be an instrument of

813
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:23,300
transmission to others. And it
feels like your prayer was

814
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:27,560
answered very clearly. And you
talked about, well, you know,

815
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,520
could have been as valuable to
to just do spiritual practice.

816
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,540
And perhaps, perhaps that's
true, but, and it's kind of

817
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:39,020
like, let 1000 spiritual flowers
bloom. You can't. You gave us a

818
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:43,180
new kind of flower, and we are
benefiting from it. And who

819
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,600
knows how many people, other
other people will benefit from

820
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:50,200
it. So wonderful that you did
what you did, and beautiful that

821
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,280
you did it with that aspiration
and prayer. It feels like your

822
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,060
prayer was answered.

823
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:59,500
John Dupuy: Yeah. Chris, how do
you what do you do these days?

824
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:06,120
I. Mean to keep yourself, man,
you went on the journey like you

825
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:10,920
know, just remarkable, and you
came back and you mentioned that

826
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:18,600
you're teaching. Do you have a
way of staying awake to

827
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:22,040
everything that you were gifted,
everything that you were shown,

828
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,920
or do you find in the
transmission and the teaching

829
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:31,700
that that's what keeps you still
crisp base in this limited

830
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:36,380
reality, but at the same time,
in touch with and transmitting

831
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,440
what you learned on the other
side, if you will?

832
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:44,140
Chris Bache: You know, there's a
question I ask in the book, what

833
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:49,900
is the value of true but
temporary knowledge? And I don't

834
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,860
doubt that any of the experience
that I had on my journeys was

835
01:05:53,860 --> 01:06:02,040
true, and I also know it was
temporary, and it I cannot live

836
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:06,540
in those places that the places
where I've been, I can't the

837
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:10,380
idea of bringing them back and
integrating them as a stable

838
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:15,840
state is that it may be true for
certain levels of experience,

839
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,780
but some of the deeper
experiences not possible, at

840
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:24,140
least not in, not in my present
level of psycho spiritual

841
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:28,640
development. I know that there
are great beings who can, who

842
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,720
are masters of these domains,
and always they are the they are

843
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:37,760
my guiding light. But I know
that Chris's abilities are not

844
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,800
cannot stabilize these states of
consciousness in my present

845
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:52,960
life, I use those experiences in
order to I use them in my

846
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:59,560
meditation practice. I use them
in my vara practice. They are,

847
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:04,800
they are the Samaya sattva that
opens me to the Jnana sattva. So

848
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,120
they are the being of practice.
It opens me to the being of

849
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:18,780
reality of these things. But I
also have a certain a lot of my

850
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,700
time these days is spent
grounding, just being grounded,

851
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:27,020
staying grounded, living in
touch with the Earth, because I

852
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:32,420
spent so many years out in the
far reaches of the cosmos that

853
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:35,960
it's good to be in touch with
the earth and grounding on the

854
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:42,400
earth. But most of all, I'm a
teacher. I mean, I just, I love

855
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,960
to find things and to share
them. And during all the years

856
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,560
when I was doing this work, I
could not really share them. I

857
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:54,880
really could not share them
directly in my classes. Now, the

858
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,540
first time I shared them was in
dark night, early dawn, where I

859
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:02,880
addressed experiences that had
come up in the first half of my

860
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:09,060
journey up to about the halfway
point in LSD, in the mind of the

861
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:12,480
universe, or what I prefer to
call it, the name that it had

862
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,520
for me in all the years I wrote
it, diamonds from heaven. That's

863
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:23,120
I shared the whole extent of the
journey. But to me, the most

864
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,580
important part of it all is the
chapter on the birth of the

865
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:33,320
future human and the final
vision. What was because the

866
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:38,540
work was so little focused on me
and so much focused on the human

867
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:45,460
family, it seemed it just became
natural that, and I guess this

868
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:53,440
is by some larger cosmic design,
the story that kept being

869
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,520
pounded into me and I kept it
kept being shown over and over

870
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,920
again, was the human story,
where humanity is in its

871
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,580
evolution, what we are coming
to, the pivot point that we are

872
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:10,320
coming in into in history, the
absolute shift, which is taking

873
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:15,720
place at an archetypal level, at
really, at the plate tectonics

874
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:20,060
of the art of the collective
psyche, that we're coming to a

875
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:25,940
tipping point where a tipping
point that will change the

876
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:30,260
condition of the human psyche at
the collective level, not just

877
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:34,040
an aggregate number of
individuals, but there is a

878
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:38,180
shift taking place underneath
us, at the collective psychic

879
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:42,700
level that is going to market a
before and after in human

880
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,740
history. This was shown me again
and again, and then years later,

881
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,960
I was taken, I was dissolved
into the human species. I mean,

882
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,400
I just dissolved without
remainder, and then was taken

883
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:03,300
into the death and rebirth of.
Humanity, not in any details,

884
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:07,440
not given details of when,
exactly when, where or how, but

885
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,760
that humanity was going to go
through an epic, an era when it

886
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:17,220
would completely lose control.
All the assumed, all the

887
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:21,260
assumptions of life were going
to be stripped away. We were

888
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:26,540
going to go through a crushing
ordeal as a species, an ordeal

889
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:31,520
that would be so terrible for
time we would think that this is

890
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:37,580
the end. We're going extinct as
a species on this planet. But in

891
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:43,060
my visionary experience, we come
through this, we survive and we

892
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:50,200
are absolutely changed in the
process. When we come through

893
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:56,920
this crisis, this long crisis,
we have reached. We reached.

894
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,600
Have reached something inside
ourselves. We have cracked open

895
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,100
our heart, we have cracked open
our mind. The humanity that

896
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:09,960
emerges from the historical
period is a changed humanity. It

897
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,220
is a deeper humanity. It is a
more open and a more mature

898
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:18,360
humanity. One of the ways
putting together different

899
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:23,660
things from my sessions, I've
come to believe that this crisis

900
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:27,320
that we're coming through with,
a global systems crisis driven

901
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,980
by a series of ecological crisis
just tremendous converging

902
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:36,320
forces that we are increasingly
aware of these days. But this is

903
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:40,600
a crisis of consciousness. We
literally cannot afford to try

904
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,340
to run this planet any longer as
a at from the egoic level of

905
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:50,260
consciousness, the the ego is
separated, and it leads to a

906
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:54,760
divided world. And I think
what's happening is we're the

907
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,840
soul is coming forward in
history. I mentioned the diamond

908
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:04,860
soul. I think we are literally
growing up into our full soul

909
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:09,060
being, and that we are coming to
a point where, when we

910
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:13,140
incarnate, we will never be
tempted to identify just with

911
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:18,960
this body, but we will know
ourselves to be 100,000 year old

912
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,120
being, and we will know that the
planet that we are leaving is

913
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,080
the planet that we will return
to. We know we have these deep

914
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,800
karmic connections with everyone
around us, and we know that we

915
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,000
are all embedded in the oneness
of the divine consciousness.

916
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:39,380
This is the magnitude of the of
the transition that we're going

917
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:43,720
through. And I think that all of
us, in all of our spiritual

918
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:48,100
practices, are contributing to
this transition. And I think

919
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:51,700
it's why so many people are
having such very, very intense

920
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:56,800
yogic practices and meditational
practices and past life therapy

921
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:02,520
practices, because there's this
is tremendous unloading which is

922
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,180
taking place, which is part of a
collective healing, which is

923
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:12,180
making way for this awakening of
something new in history.

924
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,920
Roger Walsh: Chris, you gave a
beautiful description of one of

925
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,540
the more well, there's so many
profound openings and insights

926
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:24,920
you had, but you did have a
profound recognition of the

927
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,180
possible future ahead of us as a
human species, which you just

928
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:36,200
summarized briefly, and and your
insights are resonant with the

929
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,620
sense that seems to be growing
among many people that we Are

930
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:42,820
Coming to a time of
extraordinary crisis and

931
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:46,000
opportunity. I think of that
combination being very well

932
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,480
expressed, perhaps best
expressed by a mutual friend of

933
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:54,340
ours, Dewayne Elgin, whose many
books on on the transition we as

934
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:58,960
a as a species, are facing,
really point to current time as

935
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:05,220
a bottleneck in which there is
we really may face a, if not

936
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:09,840
civilizational collapse, at
worse than a loss of a lot of

937
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:17,280
current capacities as a species
and the death of many, many

938
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,320
people. Yet also, he points to
the possibility of this being

939
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:29,480
could be, if we bring enough
awareness, aspiration, pure

940
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:33,740
heartedness, to the process, it
could be a kind of collective

941
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:38,780
rebirth. I'd love to hear you
speak more about how the vision

942
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:42,520
that seems to be emerging among
a number of people with de this

943
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:46,300
deep concern about our future
meshes with your the insight you

944
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:46,720
were given.

945
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,880
Chris Bache: Yeah, new Wayne is
a is a real brother in all of

946
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:56,740
this, and I've been deeply and
shaped or informed as I've

947
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:01,980
digested my own experiences by
his math. Methodical, combing

948
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:05,760
through all the ecological data
and the social data, looking at

949
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,780
our the converging forces in
history, through several of his

950
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:18,540
books, i I can only speak, or I
should only speak, out of my

951
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:22,160
visionary experience, because I
have, I have a certain

952
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:27,500
familiarity second hand through
people, authors like Dwayne and

953
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:32,900
other writers of our time in
history. But my sense of this is

954
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:38,420
really informed primarily by my
visionary experience. And so let

955
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:46,840
me stay just there. And again I
had this took place for me,

956
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:56,500
these visions took place going
back to 1990 through, 1995 96 so

957
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,840
I was very ecologically
uninformed 25 years ago, when

958
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:05,340
these took place, I was not
aware of the what's what's

959
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:12,720
happening culturally and
historically, as I have when I

960
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:17,400
first had the experience of the
death and rebirth of humanity.

961
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:21,980
It took me about a year to
recover from that experience,

962
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:26,480
and I felt like I was, as I say
in the book, I felt like I was

963
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,960
walking around Hiroshima a week
before the bomb was to be

964
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:36,560
dropped, knowing what was coming
with profound compassion and

965
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:41,740
deep respect for all Human
beings on the planet, knowing

966
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:46,060
that they had all volunteered to
participate in this grand

967
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:51,100
exercise, and at a deep soul
level, that they knew what was

968
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:56,200
coming, even though, at an egoic
level they may be did not know

969
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:02,040
what was coming. It took me a
year and a lot of work to

970
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:06,300
stabilize. And ever since that
time, through the early 90s,

971
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:11,520
I've held this, this knowing in
my body. I mean, it literally

972
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:19,560
lives in my body, what's
happening. And then as as I

973
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:25,340
become more informed by the
historians and by the ecologist

974
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:29,900
and the environmentalist, and we
really begin to see get a better

975
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:36,140
hand a grip on global climate
change and whatnot. It meshes,

976
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:39,740
it seems to mesh very well with
what the inner experience is,

977
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,500
with the variance that there are
some people who are serious

978
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:50,080
students of the data who believe
that we're not going to make it,

979
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,520
the data is just so strong that
we've already had our shot, and

980
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,700
even though we're living on
borrowed time and we will not

981
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:00,480
make it through this transition,
we are essentially extinct

982
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:05,280
already, and all I can say is
that, in my experience, that's

983
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,540
not what happens and and it's
it's not because the crunch

984
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:13,080
that's coming is not as bad as
we think it's going to be. It's

985
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,900
going to bring us to our
collective needs. It's going to

986
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:22,580
be worse than we are now, even
envisioning. It's going to just

987
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,740
break us down completely.

988
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:31,460
Roger Walsh: That's a very
painful and probably very

989
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,880
realistic vision. It sounds
like, at least from what I

990
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:41,080
understand, the data and and we
come through, we come through,

991
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:46,300
Chris Bache: we don't come
through, but a new we is born. I

992
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:49,600
believe that these historical
pressures that are building are

993
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:55,120
literally a birth. They are
truly giving birth, and that to

994
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,900
the future human. But then the
question is, well, what will

995
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,100
this future human look like,
what is actually being born in

996
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:07,140
history? What do we mean? Is
this just more of an analogy or

997
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:12,240
some what do we mean when we say
it's a birth? And the way I

998
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,420
understand this, I go back and I
look at it through

999
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:19,380
reincarnational lens. I mean,
you know that I believe that

1000
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:24,020
reincarnation is a empirically
demonstrated fact of life. Ian

1001
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:27,080
Stevenson and other scholars
have just demonstrated that

1002
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:31,100
reincarnation is true. My first
book on life cycles was about

1003
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:36,200
reincarnation the when I look at
the universe, I see I see our

1004
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:41,800
planet pulsing in and out of
time and space, reincarnating

1005
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:47,620
beings. I see us century by
Century, millennia by millennia,

1006
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:55,240
beings reincarnating time and
time again in giving birth,

1007
01:19:55,480 --> 01:20:01,020
labor is very I mean gestation
is long. The. Labor and birth is

1008
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:06,120
short and intense. I think the
human family has been gestating

1009
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:10,080
the future human for hundreds of
1000s of years, we have been

1010
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:16,080
just dating the future in the
dynamics of reincarnation. The

1011
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:20,900
labor that is taking place, I
think, is a short, intense,

1012
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:26,240
convulsive period. But what we
are giving birth to is already

1013
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:31,760
foreshadowed on once we
understand the dynamics of

1014
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,860
reincarnation, what is coming
forward, I think, truly, is the

1015
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:42,460
consciousness which holds all of
our reincarnation experience as

1016
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:47,260
a simultaneous present. This is
a consciousness that we all

1017
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:51,160
contact. If everything goes
well, when we die, when we're

1018
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,720
born, we're contracted to small
ego. When we die, we return to

1019
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:00,720
the soul. When we're born, we
contract into another ego. When

1020
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,740
we die, we return to the soul
that holds all of our memories,

1021
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,860
not fragmented, but integrated
as a single being. If we keep

1022
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:18,360
this up over and over, sooner or
later, the soul awakens inside

1023
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,820
human incarnation. I think
that's the being that's being

1024
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:29,420
born in this historical crisis.
Souls will live on this planet

1025
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:35,180
differently than egos live on
this planet. I think all the

1026
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:39,200
great spiritual leaders of the
Axial Age were all

1027
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,760
foreshadowing, were giving us
teachings that were helping

1028
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,200
bring this about. They were all
teaching us to think deep, to

1029
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:54,280
look deep, to feel deep, and to
to allow the needs of others to

1030
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:58,240
become super ordinate to our own
individual needs, but not

1031
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:04,500
canceling out. They were
inviting us to live old, to live

1032
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:10,860
wide. And I think now, just as
we are trying to become one

1033
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:17,580
planet, ecologically,
politically, the world citizen

1034
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:21,320
is emerging that is being
matched by something is taking

1035
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:26,000
place inside us. So as the world
is trying to become one, we are

1036
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,940
trying to become one soul
integrated within ourselves. And

1037
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:34,700
I think we're going to make it
my experience, at least my

1038
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:38,480
visionary experience, is while
nothing is nothing is decided,

1039
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:42,520
nothing is determined,
predetermined. My experience is

1040
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:47,740
that we make it but this is not
the end of the story. Of course,

1041
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:53,500
this is simply the next stage of
human evolution. Human Evolution

1042
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,340
is going to continue as long as
the universe is alive. So

1043
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:02,100
whatever we're doing now, it
will be superseded eventually by

1044
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:06,780
yet another stage of in our
development, in our spiritual

1045
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:10,500
development, but this is a
particularly important stage

1046
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,160
right now.

1047
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:17,340
Roger Walsh: And Chris you in
one sentence, I think you you

1048
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:24,020
elucidated a very important
point, a kind of pivot point for

1049
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:29,360
this possible rebirth of the
human species. You said, Nothing

1050
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:34,760
is predestined. It's up to us.
So that's a big statement.

1051
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:42,280
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah, it, I
mean, if it's if everything were

1052
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,460
predestined, there would be no
point to incarnating, right?

1053
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,640
Because if everything had to be
the way it's got to be, then we

1054
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,940
wouldn't be learning. And if
we're not learning, there would

1055
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:57,460
be no adventure here. So it is
open ended. We could lose the

1056
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:01,680
planet. We could lose this
opportunity. It's going to

1057
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,880
require our very, very best and
our very deepest in order to

1058
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:10,500
come through this changed and
built better.

1059
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:18,480
Roger Walsh: So from that
perspective, then your vision

1060
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:23,840
may not be one of this is the
way it's going to be. But

1061
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,980
rather, here is the possibility
to which we can allow, we can

1062
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:28,940
open ourselves.

1063
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:33,500
Chris Bache: You know, yes, and
I have to acknowledge that. I

1064
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:37,460
think this has happened. I think
there are some times when people

1065
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:41,860
who nearly die part of their
life review, they have a life

1066
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:46,780
preview, and sometimes what they
and they see of the future which

1067
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:50,800
does come true, and sometimes
they see a future which they can

1068
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,400
change. And I talk about this in
the book Ken rings work heading

1069
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,120
toward omega. And so if they're
seeing a future that they can

1070
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,660
change, they're seeing a
conditional future. Future, not

1071
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:05,100
an absolute preset future. So I
think what you're saying is

1072
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:11,460
true, that what I'm seeing is a
possible future, maybe even a

1073
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:14,760
probable future, but a possible
future that we still have to

1074
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:21,980
enact. So I say yes to that, and
I have to add a post script.

1075
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:30,500
Some of my experiences have
taken me so far into the future,

1076
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:36,140
into what I call deep time, not
eternity, but into time, but a

1077
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:41,980
different modality of time, have
taken me into the into deep

1078
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:48,100
time, and have given me an
experience of this historical

1079
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:53,620
transition that humanity is
making, not as a future event,

1080
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:57,040
but as a past event, as
something that We have

1081
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:02,880
accomplished. So from that
perspective, from that deep,

1082
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:08,820
cosmological expect perspective,
if I were speaking from that

1083
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:17,760
voice, I would say, we will make
this transition. Nature knows

1084
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:23,480
what it's doing. Nature has not
brought us here unprepared. The

1085
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,440
genius of the universe that we
see in DNA and galaxies, the

1086
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,580
genius that saturates every
piece of the universe knows what

1087
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:36,200
it's doing when it brings us,
when it to this particular

1088
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:41,200
critical turning point, we will
make it. We will become more

1089
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,940
than we have ever been before.

1090
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:51,280
Roger Walsh: Beautiful, may it
be so and and from my own

1091
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:56,920
perspective, which is not having
had your visions, agnostic about

1092
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:01,260
the whether we'll make it or
not, it seems like whatever

1093
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:04,740
perspective we hold, the only
thing to do with our lives is to

1094
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:10,740
do what you did, to offer them
in the service of human well

1095
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:16,380
being and survival. Is that
congruent with your

1096
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:20,779
Chris Bache: absolutely well?
It's going to take all of our,

1097
01:27:20,779 --> 01:27:26,599
our very, very best efforts to
move forward and to move forward

1098
01:27:26,599 --> 01:27:33,619
deeply and with a deep heart,
with an open mind, absolutely

1099
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:36,319
all, all hands on deck.

1100
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:40,100
Roger Walsh: Beautiful

1101
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:44,620
John Dupuy: Chris, I get, I get
a feeling from you just, you

1102
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:52,240
know, my hit as a man who's
heated the calls in his life.

1103
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:56,380
You went and you became
educated, and you got all that

1104
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:59,800
part squared away in your life,
so that later on, you'd be in a

1105
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:05,340
position much better position to
share what you were called

1106
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:10,080
again, to learn, and you had the
courage to keep it up, my God,

1107
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:15,240
that is a miracle in itself,
over those 73 journeys and that

1108
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,680
that you're also at peace with
yourself, because now you're

1109
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,400
giving back This vision, you did
this work, and the work

1110
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:28,340
continues in the sharing of it,
and that's a pretty good place

1111
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:28,700
to be.

1112
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:36,200
Chris Bache: Yes, it is a good
place to be. It's always a good

1113
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:40,180
place to be when one comes to a
point in one's life where one

1114
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:46,120
feels that one has done what was
asked to be done, and then the

1115
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:52,420
rest is gravy. And now I'm in
the situation writing the book.

1116
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:56,920
When I finished writing the
book, I knew that I could, I

1117
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:04,140
could die at peace. That was the
closure of the project. Now I'm

1118
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:11,220
in a new phase where I'm trying
to figure out how to make what I

1119
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:16,260
did useful to other people. How
can I serve other people

1120
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:20,240
carrying the knowledge or the
memories that I have? How can I

1121
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:27,620
make it useful to people? And
I'm still figuring that out. I

1122
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:33,320
don't I'm still trying to figure
out how I can be useful to other

1123
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,800
people who are on their own
spiritual path, on their own

1124
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:42,280
intellectual path, who are doing
things I can't imagine doing

1125
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:47,800
wonderful things. How can I be
useful to them, to support them

1126
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:51,760
in their process, as we enter
this time in history?

1127
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:57,040
Roger Walsh: Beautiful and it
sounds like that's a question

1128
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,360
that's really been with you and
challenging you and I. Want to

1129
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,820
put it in a context, it seems
like there are two different

1130
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,820
kinds of questions. There are
knowledge questions, is it

1131
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:08,940
raining outside? Look outside?
No. In the question. There are

1132
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:12,480
wisdom questions, which will
seem more like cons are

1133
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,060
questions you can ask
repeatedly. Each time you do.

1134
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,120
They take you deeper into the
question, deeper into yourself,

1135
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:22,220
deeper into life. And sounds
like this is your your wisdom

1136
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:26,840
question, or your sometimes
called your sacred question, is

1137
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,540
now to the forefront in your
life.

1138
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:38,660
Chris Bache: It is, and I know
that when I have the opportunity

1139
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:45,280
to be with like minded spirits,
like minded beings. And we talk

1140
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:50,020
about these things. I know that
something happens inside me,

1141
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:54,940
that my shell is pretty thin
anyway, but something happens

1142
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:06,480
and I get porous. And when I get
porous, a larger knowing flows

1143
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:13,380
through me, works with me. I
become irrelevant, but the

1144
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:18,060
teaching teaches itself in that
way, and that's that's really

1145
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:21,800
why I wrote the living
classroom, because this was

1146
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:26,420
happening in my classroom, I
never, ever was able. I never

1147
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:30,140
talked about my psychedelic work
to my students. I didn't bring

1148
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:33,560
it into the classroom. I built a
firewall between my spiritual

1149
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:39,080
practice and my teaching work.
But I found that the deeper I

1150
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:44,380
went into the consciousness of
the universe. In my spiritual

1151
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:49,300
practice, the more it began to
activate students in my

1152
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,200
classroom, the more there was an
unconscious transmission, an

1153
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:57,820
activation taking place, which I
had to learn how to manage and

1154
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:02,400
how to control, not control, but
how to manage in order to keep

1155
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:09,480
everything safe for everybody in
the classroom. So I've learned

1156
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,680
how that works. And I've learned
that when you throw a stone into

1157
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:17,700
the lake, it naturally ripples
out entirely. And so everybody,

1158
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:22,700
when we do steep, deep practice,
naturally. People around us are

1159
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:26,360
going to be touched and are
going to be influenced. So I

1160
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:34,340
know that when I when people's
questions take me to reflect

1161
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:41,200
upon life in a way which is
informed by my experiences,

1162
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,920
there is a gathering and a
reinforcing that takes place

1163
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:50,320
between their psyches and my
psyche, and together we become

1164
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:59,140
more and there is a transmission
that sometimes happens, and a

1165
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:03,540
healing that sometimes happens
that no one is in control of,

1166
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:09,060
and yet it seems to be the work.
Now, what's happened since the

1167
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:15,480
book has come out, covetous has
shut down personal contact of

1168
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:19,680
that sort, so that I've been in
a period of incubation, and

1169
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:22,220
we're having lots of zoom
meetings, and basically I've

1170
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:29,420
been incubating and trying to
see where this is going, see

1171
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:33,440
where it wants to go. I'm about
to begin a seven week online

1172
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:38,600
course on the book, which will
give us another opportunity to

1173
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:43,360
push this a little bit farther.
How much can we actually give

1174
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:48,640
this transmission online? I
would rather be doing it in

1175
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,000
person, but right now, it's an
online world.

1176
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,720
John Dupuy: Well, from where I'm
sitting, it feels like it works

1177
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,720
Roger Walsh: pretty well. And
Chris, what's the name of the

1178
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,000
course, so listeners can find
it.

1179
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:05,939
Chris Bache: Well, it actually
hasn't been given a name yet.

1180
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:10,979
This is on the shift network.
The shift network is producing

1181
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:16,139
it. It's going to be on LSD in
the mind of the universe. But we

1182
01:34:16,139 --> 01:34:19,859
haven't settled on a name. It
might it may be called diamonds

1183
01:34:19,859 --> 01:34:25,039
from heaven. It may be called a
spiritual journey into the mind

1184
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:28,879
and heart of the universe, but
it'll be on shift network

1185
01:34:28,879 --> 01:34:33,319
starting the middle of November,
and it starts November 30.

1186
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:37,820
John Dupuy: Chris, do you find
that people are responding such

1187
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:41,920
as it is, given the times that
we live in are, how's it going?

1188
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,800
Are the books selling? Are your
people going, Oh my God. Have

1189
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:50,860
you met any fellow travelers who
maybe had similar, you know,

1190
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:56,200
experiences and note, I mean,
from my experiences, what you're

1191
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:00,300
saying really corresponds and
deepens and fills out the. What

1192
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:03,780
I've learned in my own journey,
in my own life. So how's it

1193
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,080
going?

1194
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:10,260
Chris Bache: It's going just as
you say, there's nothing unique

1195
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,220
about my experiences. It's just
it's in a it's in a group of all

1196
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:17,280
of our collective experiences
that pushes the boundaries in

1197
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:21,560
certain ways. But I've had many
people write me and say, I you

1198
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,920
know you've you've clarified
what my experience has been.

1199
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:28,520
Here's what I've experienced
around this topic. And I've had

1200
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:32,180
many people write and say, I've
never touched psychedelics in my

1201
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:35,840
life, but I've had many
experiences that are completely

1202
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,200
in alignment with your
experiences. Let me explain to

1203
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:43,540
you my experience, and it's so
it's clearly, this is, this is a

1204
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:50,140
large pattern that's coming up
within the collective psyche as

1205
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:55,420
a whole, and it's been a joy.
It's a joy to share and then to

1206
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:59,980
enter into conversation with
other journeyers. What's

1207
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:03,360
important is not any one
person's experience. Clearly,

1208
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,500
what's important is the in this
case, the psychedelic

1209
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:11,160
experiences are the psychedelic
and spiritual experiences of the

1210
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:15,600
entire human family. When we put
all of our experiences on the

1211
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,960
table, then we can sort out
which ones are not essential, or

1212
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,080
which ones are idiosyncratic,
and find the ones that are

1213
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:29,000
universal and are more
epistemologically valuable. And

1214
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,360
to do that, we have to put all
of our experiences on the table.

1215
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:38,300
So for me, I'm simply putting my
experiences on the table in

1216
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:41,920
dialog with other people as we
all put our experiences on the

1217
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:46,180
table, and then we begin a
conversation of those

1218
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:50,740
experiences. And I think we're
still in the early stages. I

1219
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:54,640
mean, I think the book you
edited Roger of the early

1220
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,560
psychedelic elders, you know
that work was putting a certain

1221
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:03,300
generations insights on the
table, and I think it's

1222
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:08,280
beginning again. The tricky part
right now for me, as people

1223
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:14,640
absorb my work is the focus of
the psychedelic Renaissance is

1224
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,660
psychedelic therapy, and that's
exactly where it should be,

1225
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:27,800
healing the human psyche,
careful control studies, lots of

1226
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:32,300
brain wave maps, you know, and
all that stuff. And very, very

1227
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:37,880
careful control studies. And to
a certain degree, my work rocks

1228
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:43,000
that boat, because it's, it's
doesn't follow that protocol. It

1229
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,680
uses extreme doses, high doses,
it's using a very, very powerful

1230
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:51,820
chemical which doesn't lend
itself to healing as much as

1231
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:58,000
well as MDMA or a Psilocybin.
And so there's a certain

1232
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,900
tension, I think, between the
therapeutic focus of the

1233
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:07,920
present, very important work
being done, and in my work, and

1234
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:13,860
yet, there is a huge underground
psychedelic community which is

1235
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:19,920
not waited for a scientific
validation. And this community,

1236
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:24,020
I think is been having a
conversation among itself for

1237
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:29,060
many, many years. And I think my
work is being received very

1238
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:31,340
well. Yeah, in that community,

1239
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:44,020
Roger Walsh: beautiful, yes, and
and you spoke of, you know,

1240
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:49,240
you're still exploring the next
question. You spoke of a period

1241
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,840
of some years, I think, 20 years
of assimilating these

1242
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:59,260
experiences. So, so it sounds
like the process, process of

1243
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:04,140
integration, has been very long
and has had its own challenges,

1244
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:08,580
and perhaps that's not a topic
that's given enough attention.

1245
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:12,480
In spiritual circles, there's a
lot of focus on doing the

1246
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,360
practices and opening the
particular states of

1247
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:19,020
consciousness and insights, but
but not so much, perhaps, on the

1248
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:22,340
very essential work of
integration, which is an

1249
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:26,720
assimilation of the experiences
or reflection on them, or

1250
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:30,440
recognizing their implications,
dialoguing about them in

1251
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:35,060
community, anything which allows
us to come to a broader

1252
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:37,940
understanding of their
implications and possibilities

1253
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,400
and to and and their
implications for how best, how

1254
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:43,480
Now should we live?

1255
01:39:44,019 --> 01:39:47,559
Chris Bache: Yes, yes. There is
a book that's just been

1256
01:39:47,559 --> 01:39:53,019
published called psychedelics
and psychotherapy that is a

1257
01:39:53,079 --> 01:39:56,619
collection really focuses on
this issue of integration. I

1258
01:39:56,619 --> 01:40:01,859
have an article in it, very
important. I think that we're

1259
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:06,539
getting past the stage where the
excitement over being able to

1260
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:08,939
break through to these
dimensions of consciousness is

1261
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:11,519
kind of calming down, and we're
beginning to realize that the

1262
01:40:11,519 --> 01:40:15,179
real issue is, what do we do
with these experiences? How can

1263
01:40:15,179 --> 01:40:19,859
we hold them? How do we
integrate them? How do we

1264
01:40:19,859 --> 01:40:25,519
integrate them individually in
small community. And how do we

1265
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:31,819
integrate them intellectually,
so that we shift the paradigm of

1266
01:40:31,819 --> 01:40:34,939
the reality that we're living
within that and of course,

1267
01:40:34,939 --> 01:40:40,039
psychedelic experiences support
the paradigm of a living

1268
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:43,899
universe, that the universe is
not dead matter, but the entire

1269
01:40:43,899 --> 01:40:48,819
universe is alive. It supports
the paradigm of an intelligence,

1270
01:40:48,819 --> 01:40:52,479
orders and orders and orders of
intelligence that lie behind and

1271
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:57,759
within physical existence. So
there's so many levels to it,

1272
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:03,719
and I would offer my own
experiences, some of what not to

1273
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:08,459
do. I mean, I'm deadly serious
when I say I think I pushed

1274
01:41:08,459 --> 01:41:13,379
myself harder than was wise at
the end, when I was this, the

1275
01:41:13,379 --> 01:41:17,939
chapter that was the hardest
chapter in the book to write was

1276
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:22,999
the last chapter coming off the
mountain where I reflect upon

1277
01:41:23,179 --> 01:41:28,519
the years after I stopped my
sessions, took me a year just to

1278
01:41:28,519 --> 01:41:34,759
write that chapter. I thought I
paid a lot of attention to

1279
01:41:34,759 --> 01:41:38,839
integration throughout my work.
I wrote all my sessions down. I

1280
01:41:38,839 --> 01:41:42,579
did a lot of spiritual practice
throughout and even though I

1281
01:41:42,579 --> 01:41:46,539
couldn't teach this stuff, I had
it in conversation with my

1282
01:41:46,539 --> 01:41:52,719
partner at the time, and I
really I paid a lot of attention

1283
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:58,239
to individual integration. I
wrote the living classroom to

1284
01:41:58,959 --> 01:42:02,399
reflect tell the story of how I
took care of my students who

1285
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:06,659
were being touched by the work
so social integration. So I

1286
01:42:06,659 --> 01:42:10,559
thought that when I stopped
these sessions, I would be able

1287
01:42:10,559 --> 01:42:17,099
to step away and I would live
with the bounty of the

1288
01:42:17,099 --> 01:42:20,719
extraordinary gifts that I had
been given, and the most

1289
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,959
important of which, which
emerged in the last five years

1290
01:42:23,959 --> 01:42:26,659
of the work we haven't talked
about yet, but the diamond

1291
01:42:26,659 --> 01:42:31,699
Luminosity sessions that those
particular immersions into

1292
01:42:32,539 --> 01:42:37,879
Dharmakaya the clear light of
absolute reality. But what I

1293
01:42:37,879 --> 01:42:44,319
found was that in the years
following. In five or six years

1294
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:49,239
following my sessions, when I
stopped, I had entered what I

1295
01:42:49,239 --> 01:42:54,339
call the deep sadness. It was a
period of withdrawal into a

1296
01:42:54,339 --> 01:43:00,279
loneliness from not being able
to return to such ecstatic

1297
01:43:00,279 --> 01:43:05,159
experiences of being dissolved
into light, literally just into

1298
01:43:05,159 --> 01:43:10,019
light. I knew that I needed to
stop. I had for reasons I

1299
01:43:10,019 --> 01:43:13,679
touched. I knew it was important
for me to stop. I had to spend

1300
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:18,479
years absorbing what I had. But
there was such an unfulfilled

1301
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:25,039
longing to return to those
dimensions of reality that I

1302
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:29,899
found I reached a point where I
realized I was just waiting to

1303
01:43:29,899 --> 01:43:33,799
die. I was taking care of my
children. I was taking care of

1304
01:43:33,799 --> 01:43:38,659
my students. I was not suicidal.
I was living a balanced life,

1305
01:43:39,139 --> 01:43:44,739
but in my heart, I was just
waiting to die, and I with more

1306
01:43:44,739 --> 01:43:49,299
time, I realized something's
wrong here. This is not the way

1307
01:43:49,299 --> 01:43:53,199
this work is supposed to end.
This is not I made a mistake.

1308
01:43:53,259 --> 01:43:58,059
Somewhere along the way, I made
a mistake, and I began to

1309
01:43:58,059 --> 01:44:02,159
wonder, is it possible to have
too much God? But I knew the

1310
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:06,299
entire physical universe was
God. I knew that the Divine is

1311
01:44:06,299 --> 01:44:09,299
everything that exists. So it's
not a matter of having too much

1312
01:44:09,299 --> 01:44:13,979
God, because I knew God was I
was living inside God. So what

1313
01:44:13,979 --> 01:44:18,779
was the mistake? And eventually
I came to see that the mistake

1314
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:22,579
was not too much divine of the
Divine, but it was too much

1315
01:44:22,579 --> 01:44:26,539
Transcendence. There is a
balancing act between

1316
01:44:26,539 --> 01:44:32,299
transcending time and space and
being embodied inside time and

1317
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:36,499
space, and there are truths in
each of these realities. And I

1318
01:44:36,499 --> 01:44:41,439
had plunged myself so deeply
beyond time and space, so many

1319
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:46,119
times into such intimacy with
that which supports time and

1320
01:44:46,119 --> 01:44:51,699
space that I lost my bearings, I
lost my foothold inside time and

1321
01:44:51,699 --> 01:44:59,199
space, and I had to, so I made
an absolute decision to ground

1322
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:06,419
myself. Inside time and space,
and to let what I had

1323
01:45:06,419 --> 01:45:10,199
experienced in these subtle
states of consciousness, to let

1324
01:45:10,199 --> 01:45:16,079
it work its way into me, I had
to literally not alter my

1325
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:20,239
consciousness so that these
states of awareness could enter

1326
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:25,879
into my physical being. Whereas
previously it had entered into

1327
01:45:25,879 --> 01:45:30,679
my altered being, now it had, if
it was ever going to enter into

1328
01:45:30,679 --> 01:45:36,079
my physical body, I had to sit
still and let it come to me.

1329
01:45:37,579 --> 01:45:41,979
Because, as you know, in these
states, nothing in reality

1330
01:45:41,979 --> 01:45:47,319
changes. We don't do anything.
We simply wake up to something

1331
01:45:47,319 --> 01:45:53,559
that's always been there. It's
always been there. And I reached

1332
01:45:53,559 --> 01:45:58,899
a point where I simply had to
sort of be patient and let this

1333
01:45:58,899 --> 01:46:03,179
transformation take place. And
so in a sense, on the one hand,

1334
01:46:03,179 --> 01:46:07,019
there's nothing more for me to
do, and on another hand, yeah,

1335
01:46:07,019 --> 01:46:09,299
there's something more to me for
me to do.

1336
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:15,780
Roger Walsh: Yeah. And you're
talking now about a very

1337
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:19,740
interesting topic. You're
talking about the traps that can

1338
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:24,260
go with this kind of deep work,
and usually we talk about traps

1339
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:29,480
on the spiritual path or with
psychedelics. Similarly, we

1340
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,360
usually talk about the earlier
paths, the traps of being

1341
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:37,640
overwhelmed, of fear, of terror,
of acting out certain

1342
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:43,660
psychodynamics of ego inflation,
taking these experiences to be

1343
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:48,820
proof of our unique
Transpersonal nature and

1344
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:52,540
specialness, and yet you're
pointing to some of the traps

1345
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:57,820
that can occur significantly
further along. It sounds like

1346
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:04,260
you're talking about about,
well, you one way of framing

1347
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:08,160
what you just said, this deep
sadness or losses would, of

1348
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:11,580
course, be, and you do this in
your book. I think the in terms

1349
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:15,180
of the dark night of the soul of
St John of the Cross, the the

1350
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:18,660
challenge that comes when we
taste something so

1351
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:23,600
Transcendence, so divine, so
inspiring, and then lose that

1352
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:29,600
contact in a way. And you're
talking about the some of the

1353
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:33,380
traps that can come with the
sheer amount of energy coursing

1354
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:38,360
through one's body and the and
the the possibility of

1355
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:42,460
transmission as a result and and
and of being seduced by those

1356
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:47,440
capacities. So, so this is a
very this is another kind of

1357
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:51,340
gift you're giving us pointing
out, giving us the beginnings of

1358
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:55,540
a map of the more advanced traps
that can come

1359
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:58,060
Chris Bache: the traps that
happen when everything goes

1360
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:03,720
right, deficiency, but when
everything goes right, you can

1361
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:07,080
have too much of a good thing. I
found I didn't know that at the

1362
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:07,740
beginning.

1363
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:12,120
Roger Walsh: Is it too much, or
is it our attitude towards it?

1364
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,460
Chris Bache: I think you can
have too much of a good thing in

1365
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:20,600
the sense that I think in every
one lifetime, most of us, we can

1366
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:26,360
only integrate so much and
productively, and I think it's

1367
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:30,500
possible to bite off more than
we can really thoroughly chew.

1368
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:35,900
And sometimes I think I bit off
more than I could, more than was

1369
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:39,920
wise for me to chew. And but
you're all absolutely right.

1370
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:45,220
There are so many pitfalls on
this path, ego inflation,

1371
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:50,140
thinking you're special because
you've had a special experience,

1372
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:54,160
and it's so important to stay
grounded, really grounded,

1373
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:57,580
grounded, grounded, so that all
of these things wash through

1374
01:48:57,580 --> 01:49:05,880
you. And my wife was, was very
good at helping me remember,

1375
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:09,540
always, always, what's important
is not what happens on the day

1376
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,900
of your session. What's
important is what you can do the

1377
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:20,180
day after your session. It's,
it's that you it is how you live

1378
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:25,880
your life in the world, carrying
the insights that you've had as

1379
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:32,540
best as you can into your
fallible life, and recommitting

1380
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:36,980
yourself to purifying your life
of all of its all of its you

1381
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:42,220
know, messy Garbage, and living
a clean and compassionate and

1382
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:47,260
proper life that that continues
just because you become one with

1383
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:51,700
God, what happens is, I don't
actually these days, I don't

1384
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:55,180
know why anyone would want to
become one with God, because

1385
01:49:55,180 --> 01:49:59,200
once you do that, it triggers
enormous purification processes

1386
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:04,200
that don't stop. Up. I mean,
it's just it goes on and on, you

1387
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:09,480
know, it just deepens. Yeah,
there are lots of ways for this

1388
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:10,740
path to go wrong,

1389
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,920
Roger Walsh: and yet, there was
something which, in the in the

1390
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:24,800
way you approach this, that
allowed you, I not there were

1391
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,860
ways you got caught, but they
weren't the gross ways they

1392
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:33,560
weren't you didn't harm others
you. But there were subtle ways

1393
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,380
in which you get you've got
caught, such as the dark night

1394
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:39,560
of the soul, but you always you
worked your way out of it. What

1395
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:41,440
do you what do you attribute
that to?

1396
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:53,620
Chris Bache: I contribute. I
attribute that to good company,

1397
01:50:53,980 --> 01:51:00,340
the people I was with my former
wife, Carol. We were married for

1398
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:06,360
24 years. She is the mother of
all my children. She was my

1399
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:11,460
sitter for all my sessions. She
never did a session herself. She

1400
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:15,960
is a very serious varana
practitioner. She has since gone

1401
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:22,160
on to complete her three year
retreat. So she's, she's a lama,

1402
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:28,820
acknowledged as such, and she
was a great help keeping me

1403
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:33,680
grounded during all these years
when I was, you know, going in

1404
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:37,640
and out of the universe. My
teaching, just my children, kept

1405
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:41,200
me grounded. Teaching kept me
grounded, but studying the great

1406
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:44,800
masters, because the more I
studied the great masters, the

1407
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:49,720
more it showed me my own
imperfections. It All. It showed

1408
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:55,420
me what I was not by looking at
their greatness. And so I never,

1409
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:03,780
I could never take myself. They
kept me honest with myself as I

1410
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:08,820
went my students kept me honest
because, you know, I I had to

1411
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:12,600
earn a living teaching at an
open enrollment University, and

1412
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,300
I'm walking into a classroom
filled with people, many of them

1413
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:19,680
who don't want to be there, and
I have to kind of trick them,

1414
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:22,340
persuade them to be interested
in some of the things that we're

1415
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:25,940
going to be studying here. It's
hard work. I was not teaching

1416
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:28,940
graduate students. I was
teaching an open enrollment

1417
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:33,320
University for people who are
going to college for the first

1418
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:39,440
time. So it was just good, hard,
honest work that kind of kept me

1419
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:46,780
focused and gave my body and my
mind time to absorb the enormity

1420
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:54,160
of what came forward. But
eventually, eventually, the

1421
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:57,220
second thing I deal with in that
chapter of coming off the

1422
01:52:57,220 --> 01:53:00,780
mountain is what I call the
sickness of silence, and that's

1423
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:05,460
the isolation of doing
psychedelics in a psychedelic

1424
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:09,960
phobic society where
psychedelics are illegal, where

1425
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:15,000
you cannot, even if you can
share them in small groups, you

1426
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,240
cannot share them
professionally. I'm a teacher,

1427
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:23,000
I'm a public person. I could not
share my experiences psychedelic

1428
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:27,740
I literally had to retire from
my work as a philosopher of

1429
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:32,720
religion before I could begin my
real my deepest work as a

1430
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:37,880
philosopher of religion. That's
the iron. Yeah, that, in fact, I

1431
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:41,260
retired a little early,
precisely to give me enough time

1432
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:46,840
to write this book, to do this
work, and as I began to to be

1433
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:50,800
honest publicly in the writing
of the book, this boy, it took

1434
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:54,040
me a long time. It took me
before I wrote the book. It

1435
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:58,180
literally took me about three
years just to get myself into

1436
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:02,700
the psychological position where
I was willing to let people this

1437
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:06,780
deep into this part of my life,
and the only way I was able to

1438
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:12,480
do that was to truly let go and
remind myself over and over

1439
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:17,400
again these experiences were not
given to me for me. They were

1440
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:20,480
never part of they were never
private. They were never given

1441
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:25,820
to me for me. They were always
given to me to share, to help

1442
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,500
the human community as a whole.
So by let taking myself out of

1443
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:36,980
the picture and just sharing
visions without owning them in a

1444
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:41,380
sense, or appropriating them,
they were never private visions

1445
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:46,900
that made it easier for me to
release them and let them, let

1446
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:53,740
them have their impact without
owning that impact myself,

1447
01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:59,740
Roger Walsh: and there was so
many experiences which brings up

1448
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:04,740
a. Of another topic, and that is
if we look across the great

1449
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:07,380
religious traditions and, of
course, other traditions as

1450
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:10,920
well, which haven't had such a
major impact, we almost always

1451
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:16,740
find a worldview and
understanding that there is some

1452
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:21,980
final experience towards which
we are working, and we get that

1453
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:26,660
final experience, and then it's,
you know, bliss and roses wasn't

1454
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:31,160
exactly what you found. And
there aren't, it seems like

1455
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:34,820
there was an endless opening
for, always, for the

1456
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:40,780
possibilities that that you open
to, and there aren't, to my

1457
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:44,740
limited knowledge, there aren't
a lot of examples of that. I

1458
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:49,720
think the best, the best in our
own time. Maybe the teacher amid

1459
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:53,680
or Almas is the pen name he
writes under, and his two most

1460
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:57,640
recent books, runaway
realization and the alchemy of

1461
01:55:57,640 --> 01:56:04,740
transformation, he he spent
decades with profound study and

1462
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:08,880
a kind of spiritual genius
opening to opening an enormous

1463
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,180
number of states. And then he
built up this extraordinary,

1464
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:16,860
sophisticated psycho spiritual
map of the progression of states

1465
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:22,760
and ways of working with them.
And then recently, he stepped

1466
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:27,980
off his own map and said, No,
there's nothing. Yeah, you can

1467
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:33,140
see a progression and there's no
final goal. Every opening is

1468
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:37,700
merely a port. Can be, can be,
merely a portal to another

1469
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:43,600
opening, and it, and he has a
statement in there which

1470
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:46,360
probably only a handful of
people on the planet could make.

1471
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:49,840
He said, Yeah, I've been
enlightened many times, and

1472
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:52,720
every time everyone someone
says, oh, that's the final

1473
01:56:52,720 --> 01:57:00,820
experience. But I always find
there's something more, and that

1474
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:03,120
seems your experience.

1475
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:08,340
Chris Bache: It is, I think, and
I think it's, it's particularly

1476
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:14,880
the experience when you use,
mean, this is a path of

1477
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:19,740
temporary immersion, the path of
temporary I mean, all of our

1478
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:23,480
practices are temporary, but
this psychedelic path,

1479
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:26,360
particularly is a temporary
path, and that's the

1480
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:30,560
temporariness is what makes it
tricky. But I like you, I

1481
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,760
thought I was doing this path in
order to get to an end state,

1482
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:40,040
that there would be a goal I
know when I would reach it, it

1483
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:45,220
would solve all my issues, or
because people describe as

1484
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:48,880
becoming one with God, or
becoming dissolving into the

1485
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:54,280
meta, cosmic void. And what I
found was that actually I became

1486
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:58,300
one with God or one with mind of
the universe many times. And

1487
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:01,680
there, there are many gradations
or many levels of oneness with

1488
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:07,320
God, and there are even levels
of the primal void. There are

1489
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:13,920
levels of void in the universe.
Eventually, there were many

1490
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:19,620
levels of Homecoming, of
homecoming and peace and reunion

1491
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:28,820
and just relaxing into the the
bliss of return. And when the

1492
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:34,220
diamond Luminosity opened, 15
years into the work, when, when

1493
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:40,220
the diamond Luminosity opened,
and I entered this hyper, hyper

1494
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:54,340
Clear, clear, just unbelievably
clear. Level of awareness. And

1495
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:59,140
in the next four years, I only
in 26 sessions. I only touched

1496
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:04,740
this reality four times, lots of
purification, lots of cleansing,

1497
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:11,640
lots of four times. The second
time I touched it was the 50th

1498
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:15,900
session, and I was as deep into
the universe as I would ever go.

1499
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:22,940
I was far beyond time and space.
I was dissolved completely into

1500
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:32,480
this ecstasy of the pure
Luminosity. And then my visual

1501
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:38,120
field pivoted 90 degrees, and I
saw reality far in the distance,

1502
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:43,120
filled with a light, an even
greater light than the diamond

1503
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:47,200
Luminosity, light, and a ray of
light hit me from that reality,

1504
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:51,280
and it absolutely shattered me,
and took me 10 minutes to

1505
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:56,740
recover from it. And that's when
I that's when it sunk in that

1506
01:59:56,740 --> 02:00:00,900
it's an infinite progression.
It. There isn't a matter of

1507
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:05,820
coming to an ending spot. You
stop. You come to an ending stop

1508
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:09,300
when you simply can take it no
longer. You can take the

1509
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:13,140
ecstasy, no longer you can take
the cycle of death and rebirth,

1510
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:17,640
no longer. It's an endless
progression. It's an endless

1511
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:21,140
progression, and that's one of
the reasons I would be gentler

1512
02:00:21,140 --> 02:00:25,220
with myself if I were to do it
again, I recommend others. It's

1513
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:30,200
not about reaching an end state.
It's about opening up, letting

1514
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:34,100
all this wisdom in, letting the
beauty in, letting the healing

1515
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:37,820
in, going through the
purification process and

1516
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:42,580
becoming a little more alive, a
little more conscious and in the

1517
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:46,960
dance of life, in the dance of
the universe, but it's not about

1518
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:48,640
reaching any end state.

1519
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:56,800
Roger Walsh: And you you had
that recognition there was

1520
02:00:56,920 --> 02:01:02,700
always more and and the always
more required something of you,

1521
02:01:02,700 --> 02:01:07,080
it required a another level of
purification, free for each

1522
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:13,260
taste of that, something more.
And you just alluded to what you

1523
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:17,520
called the diamond illumination,
which, in some ways, I mean, I

1524
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:21,560
hesitate to put any, any
differential value on these

1525
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:26,420
things, but in some ways, felt
like one of the most impactful

1526
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:32,180
of all experiences that you had,
and something which left you, as

1527
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:38,000
I recall, you said in the Book
that that for this you would

1528
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:46,000
gladly die so and you relate the
you, what you called the diamond

1529
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,800
illumination, to the experiences
described as the culmination

1530
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:55,240
point in in some other
traditions. I just be lovely to

1531
02:01:55,240 --> 02:02:00,600
have you expand on on give us a
feel for this realization,

1532
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:06,120
whatever extent you can, of
course, and for how it relates

1533
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:09,480
to the goals of other
traditions.

1534
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:16,980
Chris Bache: Well, as I
understand it, the reality that

1535
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:22,460
I was taken into in those four
sessions is a reality that's

1536
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:28,280
outside of the Bardo it is extra
Samsara reality. It's outside of

1537
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:32,660
time space, and what I call the
echoes of time space, Bardo

1538
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:42,280
reality, what happened in the
first two times I went into this

1539
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:47,140
condition, I was taken deeper
and deeper into it. I had the

1540
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:50,200
encounter with what I call the
absolute light, which showed me

1541
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:55,060
that it's an infinite
progression. Then the next two

1542
02:02:55,060 --> 02:02:59,560
times I went into it, this
diamond Luminosity began to

1543
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:04,320
crunch itself deeper and deeper
into my physical being. I wasn't

1544
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:08,280
going out. It was coming in. So
it literally was crunching

1545
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:12,420
itself into my psyche, into my
body. It felt like it was

1546
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:16,740
changing me at a cellular level,
and eventually, at the very end

1547
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:22,940
of my journey, it changed my my
perception had changed, my how I

1548
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:26,480
see things, literally,
physically, how I can see

1549
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:30,860
things, not permanently. It gave
me a temporary experience that I

1550
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:36,200
call diamond vision. I was
seeing 100 1000 times more

1551
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:41,740
sharply, more clearly than I
would have ever seen before. And

1552
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:46,600
at that point, I realized that I
was seeing through the eyes of

1553
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:50,740
the future human. I was seeing
in a way that all humanity will

1554
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:58,000
one day see, that all of our
senses, sight, touch, taste, all

1555
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,920
of our senses, are being
elevated and animated to higher

1556
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,820
and higher levels, the more
consciousness we can internalize

1557
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:12,660
in our body. So this crunching
into me is actually an

1558
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:16,740
acceleration of something which
is taking place more slowly for

1559
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:21,860
all of us in our reincarnation,
evolutionary reincarnation

1560
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:30,200
process, and that's the message
I got at the end of my sessions,

1561
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:36,020
was that one of the reasons I
had to stop my sessions was the

1562
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:40,420
whole movement now was no longer
going out and into the whole

1563
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:45,340
movement was the that which is
out, coming into me, coming in

1564
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:49,540
deeper, deeper into me. And I
literally had to stop my

1565
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:53,980
sessions in order to let this
process reach its end stage.

1566
02:04:54,280 --> 02:05:02,100
Reaches its natural conclusion
when I reflect on. On the

1567
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:05,880
diamond Luminosity condition,
the parallel and I draw

1568
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:10,200
parallels to the spiritual
traditions that I'm familiar

1569
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:14,280
with, the ones that stand out.
Of course, all the spiritual

1570
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:18,120
traditions speak about light.
All of the reincarnational

1571
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:22,580
traditions speak about extra
Samsara, reality, the clearest

1572
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:26,600
description I've I've come
across are in the Buddhist

1573
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:31,340
traditions whose text I know the
best, and their description of

1574
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:35,720
Dharmakaya, the clear light of
absolute reality, the clear

1575
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:36,920
light which is the I

1576
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:51,160
that which is the seed reality
out of which all existence

1577
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:55,960
emerges, that which is the love,
out of which all emotion, all

1578
02:05:55,960 --> 02:06:00,120
love emerges, that which is the
pure, distilled power out of

1579
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:06,960
which all energy of Creation
emerges in its absolute,

1580
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:11,280
transcendent, hyper, clear,
clear, clear form, containing

1581
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:19,320
everything within it and nucleus
and yet, something which is

1582
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:25,580
beyond creation itself truly, I
understand why touching that

1583
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:29,540
reality even once undoes
centuries of living in the

1584
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:34,460
shadows of karma. Karmic vision
is always shadowed, and it's

1585
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:38,600
always approximate. It's always
conditioned. But to touch

1586
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:45,340
something which is so profoundly
unconditioned, and then slowly

1587
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:52,780
the task, I think, is to slowly
shape one's life so that one can

1588
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:59,620
live the conditioned existence
in abiding communion with that

1589
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:09,960
which is unconditioned to live
the light in one's physical

1590
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:15,300
manifestation, something I have
just getting started. I have so

1591
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:20,420
much to learn in that process.
I'll never be able to, never be

1592
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:26,120
able to conclude this during
this one lifetime. But my belief

1593
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:32,240
is, what the universe seems to
have promised me, is that when I

1594
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:36,680
die, I will return to that
condition, that there is nothing

1595
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:40,300
I need to do between now and
when I die, to return to that

1596
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:45,400
condition, and if I meet any
obstacles along the way, if

1597
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:49,540
anything arises which would
prevent me from returning to

1598
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:53,920
that essential truth, I have
learned how to dissolve those

1599
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:58,480
obstacles by taking any
obstacles into me until

1600
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:03,480
eventually they dissolve of
their own of their own weight.

1601
02:08:07,740 --> 02:08:13,680
Roger Walsh: What a wonderful
vision and and something which

1602
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:17,760
clearly, even as you were
counted now, I could see you

1603
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,580
going into your own experience
and being deeply, deeply touched

1604
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:29,720
by it, even now, 2030, years
later. So it's an exquisite

1605
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:34,220
example of the way in which
these experiences touched and

1606
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:39,140
incarnated in and as you and
still have their resonance and

1607
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:46,360
and and impact and transmission,
I felt palpably touched by by

1608
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:53,200
the qualities of qualities that
that you were expressing out of

1609
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:57,220
your in your description, given
out of your direct experience,

1610
02:08:57,220 --> 02:09:00,720
which felt partly out of your
direct experience in this moment

1611
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:05,580
and a very exquisite
transmission. And you also spoke

1612
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:11,940
of, once more, of the idea that
these awakenings, the

1613
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:17,880
recognitions of these remarkable
realities, are not the end point

1614
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:22,640
that that there's a that's a
stage. But beyond that is the

1615
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:29,720
integration, the bringing it,
allowing it to incarnate in and

1616
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:34,760
through us. And you pointed to
what you called the diamond

1617
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:39,560
vision, and you mentioned that
the diamond illumination was

1618
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:43,780
most resonant view with the
Tibetan Buddhist tradition. And

1619
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:46,300
interestingly, the Tibetan
Buddhist tradition speaks

1620
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:50,440
further of of a stage beyond
that which it feels like you're

1621
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:55,120
illuminating of of pure
perception or recognition, in

1622
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:59,260
which one's perception is so
transformed by this realization

1623
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:06,000
that. One sees this world not as
some merely mundane material

1624
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:12,660
reality, but as an expression of
that diamond illumination. One

1625
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:16,680
sees sacred beings. One sees it
as what's called a pure a pure

1626
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:23,180
land optimized for awakening,
and expressive of awakening. So

1627
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:25,700
they call it the pure
perception. I'm not telling you

1628
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:28,640
anything you don't know, of
course, but might be not. Might

1629
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:32,720
be interesting for our listeners
to know that your description

1630
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:38,180
not only of the awakening to the
diamond illumination, but its

1631
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:43,540
very effects on you, something
that is recognized and highly

1632
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:47,260
valued in certain traditions.
Yeah, truly,

1633
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:53,080
Chris Bache: there is nothing
unique in any of my journey. In

1634
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:57,940
any it, I'm simply rediscovering
things which many, many people

1635
02:10:57,940 --> 02:11:01,980
in many traditions have already
discovered that the technology

1636
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:06,000
may be a little bit different,
but the core understanding of

1637
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:10,980
existence, the core truths, the
core insights, have been with us

1638
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:17,340
for a long, long time, embodied
by Great Beings, passed along

1639
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:21,020
generation by generation by
Great Beings. There's really

1640
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:26,540
nothing. There's nothing unique
in my work.

1641
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:36,320
Roger Walsh: And you you open to
a two experiences that others

1642
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:41,620
have opened to, and you had your
own unique constellation. And

1643
02:11:41,980 --> 02:11:47,920
you bring to it something which
is unique, your own gifts as a

1644
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:54,640
philosopher and theologian. So.
So once again, it's the yes and

1645
02:11:58,420 --> 02:12:01,620
Chris Bache: something that the
mother told me at the end and

1646
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:09,060
when I was really not sure what
to do with all of this and what

1647
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:15,600
the mother, which for me, you
know, my my naming of the

1648
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:21,200
Absolute, tends to run in the
feminine direction. I see myself

1649
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:24,140
as a servant of the Great
Mother, and I see all physical

1650
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:27,800
existence as the embodiment of
the Great Mother, and the

1651
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:33,080
transcendent divine as more
male, and the embodied Divine is

1652
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:40,660
more female. But what the mother
said was simply let them see me

1653
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:46,720
as you have seen me. That's all
just let me. Let them see me as

1654
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:52,000
you have seen me. They'll know
what to do with it. It will

1655
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,320
serve them in ways that you
cannot anticipate. Just let them

1656
02:12:56,320 --> 02:13:00,660
see me. And she was very clear.
She said, You know, you didn't

1657
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:03,900
give yourself these visions. You
didn't decide what visions you

1658
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:07,440
were given on any particular day
you were not you did. Had no

1659
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:10,860
control over when you were
broken and when you were

1660
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:16,320
nourished. We did that. None of
this is of your doing. It was

1661
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:21,500
all our doing, and you have no
right to hold on to any of it.

1662
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:27,260
And I think this feeling is a
feeling that spiritual beings,

1663
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:30,380
or people who have given
themselves over to intimacy with

1664
02:13:30,380 --> 02:13:35,600
the universe, have always felt
that their practice is not their

1665
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:40,220
own, and the fruition of their
practice is not their own, and

1666
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:44,500
they have no right to hold on to
their fruition of their

1667
02:13:44,500 --> 02:13:47,560
practice, because it's in the
very nature of the of the

1668
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:56,740
awareness that the divine serves
all. The Divine is all and in

1669
02:13:56,740 --> 02:14:00,540
the end, it's the mother
speaking to her children. It's

1670
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:04,320
the mother's love for all of her
children, and it's the mother's

1671
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:08,280
desire to wake up all of her
children, which is the driving

1672
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:09,480
force of it all.

1673
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:14,820
Roger Walsh: And I was, I was
struck by your description then,

1674
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:19,800
which echoed a theme in the
book, that when you when you

1675
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:24,740
were portraying the
communications you receive from

1676
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:31,340
very profound realms of
consciousness and being that you

1677
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:36,500
did it as did it in the plural,
first person plural, we have

1678
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:41,020
given you these gifts, and I
think it's reminded me very

1679
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:46,300
much, as you pointed out, the
Quran, where Allah speaks as in

1680
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:46,780
as we

1681
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:53,140
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah. And I
don't think, I don't think it's

1682
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:58,960
a plural, like a polytheism,
it's a plural, like, just vast.

1683
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:04,740
I mean, just. Just unable to
wrap our minds around it so

1684
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:13,080
enormous that that it swallows
our capacity to describe or to

1685
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:19,080
concretize, and somehow we
speaks to that more effectively

1686
02:15:19,080 --> 02:15:27,680
than I. I think sometimes, no
matter how profound this our if

1687
02:15:27,680 --> 02:15:31,100
we were to take the greatest
spiritual geniuses of our

1688
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:36,920
generation, and truly just the
great, great masters of our

1689
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:44,560
generation, and if we could go
forward 500,000 years, or

1690
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:48,880
however many 1000 years, we
would imagine, the great masters

1691
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:53,740
of that generation will be able
to see more, will have deeper

1692
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:57,040
experiences still, because there
is a certain sense in which the

1693
02:15:57,040 --> 02:16:01,560
experience of any individual is
kept within, in certain sense,

1694
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:06,060
the capacity of the herd, they
push the edge, but they're

1695
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:10,140
limited by the capacity the
collective psyche. But as the

1696
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:14,820
collective psyche evolves, it
extends the limit of the

1697
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:20,420
individual spiritual genius. So
it's it's an ongoing, ever

1698
02:16:20,420 --> 02:16:26,840
unfolding, ever progressive
deepening of this rapport

1699
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:31,340
between the creative
intelligence and we who are the

1700
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:33,500
result of that creative
intelligence.

1701
02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:43,840
Roger Walsh: Yes, and, and I'm
going to ask you to I'm going to

1702
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:46,360
ask a question which is going
to, of course, impossible. We

1703
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:50,260
need another few sessions, but,
but has to be asked. And that

1704
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:56,140
is, after all these experiences,
these openings, these gifts and

1705
02:16:56,140 --> 02:17:03,300
graces, and ones which had very
dramatic impacts on your

1706
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:07,620
understanding of yourself, why
you were doing this, the nature

1707
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:15,120
of reality, which exploded your
understanding not once, but many

1708
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:18,120
times. And that was one of the
things I found in the book and

1709
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:22,940
even in our dialog now,
recognizing my own limiting

1710
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:26,960
presuppositions such as, yeah,
you know, these chemicals are

1711
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:33,200
good for psychotherapy and
healing on an individual level,

1712
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:36,560
but no, you were forced to the
recognition, kicking and

1713
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:41,980
screaming all the way I would
say, to a larger recognition

1714
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:44,860
that this was potentially about
a healing of collective

1715
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:52,420
consciousness and more and
always more. So obviously, in a

1716
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:56,260
in a reality in which there's
always more, there can be no

1717
02:17:56,260 --> 02:18:01,680
definitive map. But how would
you describe to the extent you

1718
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:07,440
can your understanding of the of
the nature reality, how would

1719
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:10,860
would? How would you
characterize or point us towards

1720
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:14,400
your worldview at this time?
Yeah,

1721
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:32,060
Chris Bache: I'll do my best to
answer your question and to not

1722
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:33,860
weep as I do so,

1723
02:18:35,059 --> 02:18:36,619
John Dupuy: go ahead and weep if
you need to.

1724
02:18:48,459 --> 02:18:54,039
Chris Bache: I see the universe
as a magnificent as the as as

1725
02:18:54,039 --> 02:19:01,079
pure genius, as saturated with
genius and saturated with with

1726
02:19:01,079 --> 02:19:05,579
the geniuses ambition, the
creative impulse, I see the

1727
02:19:05,579 --> 02:19:08,999
birth of stars and the birth of
galaxies and the birth of

1728
02:19:08,999 --> 02:19:12,599
planets and the birth of species
and the birth of an intelligent

1729
02:19:12,839 --> 02:19:16,139
a self aware species within some
of the planets and a

1730
02:19:16,139 --> 02:19:20,479
reincarnating species within
this Planet, all as acts of

1731
02:19:20,479 --> 02:19:27,019
profound genius, of just
unspeakable genius and and love,

1732
02:19:27,019 --> 02:19:33,259
because it is the sharing of
existence. It is the the

1733
02:19:33,259 --> 02:19:38,119
gestating of the conditions that
make infinite progression

1734
02:19:38,179 --> 02:19:47,319
possible. I see death and
rebirth. I see reincarnation. I

1735
02:19:47,319 --> 02:19:51,699
see the Bardo. I see this vision
that when we die, we don't

1736
02:19:51,699 --> 02:19:56,499
simply wink into this we go into
a very specific great, great

1737
02:19:57,039 --> 02:20:01,739
gradated series of levels of.
Existence that reflect our

1738
02:20:01,739 --> 02:20:05,459
limits and our capacities. I
used to think of the Bardo as

1739
02:20:05,459 --> 02:20:12,359
kind of the the the the enemy or
the opposition. It was a cloud

1740
02:20:12,359 --> 02:20:15,239
getting in the way. But now I'm
beginning I see it as the

1741
02:20:15,239 --> 02:20:20,239
compassionate blanket. It keeps
us safe as we enter into deeper

1742
02:20:20,239 --> 02:20:26,719
and deeper communion with the
true power. I will call it the

1743
02:20:26,719 --> 02:20:31,219
divine. I don't like to call it
the divine, though I use this

1744
02:20:31,219 --> 02:20:35,059
language sometimes, but because
our concepts of the Divine and

1745
02:20:35,059 --> 02:20:40,279
of God are so childlike, are so
childish compared to the reality

1746
02:20:40,279 --> 02:20:49,479
itself. But to become to touch
that power until we are fully

1747
02:20:49,479 --> 02:20:53,559
formed and capable of
withstanding the intensity of

1748
02:20:53,559 --> 02:20:57,039
that reunion, it would shatter
us. It would just absolutely

1749
02:20:57,039 --> 02:21:02,939
shatter us. We have to be very,
very strong and very congealed

1750
02:21:02,939 --> 02:21:07,439
as an individual before we can
touch that reality and stay

1751
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:13,379
conscious and coherent within
the reality, that reality, and

1752
02:21:13,379 --> 02:21:18,239
that's just the level of reality
outside the Bardo of this

1753
02:21:18,239 --> 02:21:25,219
particular piece of time and
space. So I don't know what lies

1754
02:21:25,219 --> 02:21:31,699
beyond the Dharmakaya. I don't
know what lies in the absolute

1755
02:21:31,699 --> 02:21:36,019
dimension. But everywhere that I
have journeyed and everywhere I

1756
02:21:36,019 --> 02:21:42,339
have seen, there is genius
arising. There is purposeful

1757
02:21:42,339 --> 02:21:48,699
intent, not not an easy to
recognize purposeful intent,

1758
02:21:48,699 --> 02:21:53,319
sometimes a very, very hard,
complex, subtle, purposeful

1759
02:21:53,319 --> 02:21:59,019
intent. But it's there behind
everything. It's there. It's

1760
02:21:59,139 --> 02:22:02,039
always there. It's always
pressing for more and uplifting

1761
02:22:02,039 --> 02:22:09,059
us all. And in saying what I've
been saying, you know, I'm just

1762
02:22:09,059 --> 02:22:12,959
echoing, echoing the teachings
of the great spiritual lineages

1763
02:22:12,959 --> 02:22:15,599
of the great teachings. There's
nothing original in what I'm

1764
02:22:15,599 --> 02:22:20,839
saying. I'm simply echoing, not
what I've been taught, but I'm

1765
02:22:20,839 --> 02:22:25,579
echoing teachings that I have
seen elsewhere, that it's all

1766
02:22:25,579 --> 02:22:27,139
alive, It's all

1767
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:45,640
and the depth of love that holds
existence is proportionate to

1768
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:50,440
the depth of the genius that is
orchestrated existence that was

1769
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:54,760
one of the hard things for me to
take in, that the genius I could

1770
02:22:54,760 --> 02:23:01,200
see, but the love that's
proportionate to that genius.

1771
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:09,720
I've become much more bhakti in
this process than I had, than I

1772
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:12,180
had ever thought that I would
be. It's just, it's just

1773
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:26,600
impatient patient. Wake Up Now,
wake up in 100,000 years. Wake

1774
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:29,240
up in a million years. It
doesn't really make that much

1775
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:32,780
difference to the Creator,
because it doesn't think in the

1776
02:23:32,780 --> 02:23:38,000
short term. She thinks in the
long term. She thinks in the

1777
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:42,520
long term, and she doesn't think
about individuals. She thinks

1778
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:46,420
about all of us. She thinks
about the entire planet, the

1779
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:50,200
entire galaxy, the magnitude of

1780
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:01,980
as far as I've gotten in all of
this work, I've just touched the

1781
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:04,440
edges. Just touch the edges.

1782
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:13,380
Roger Walsh: Thank you so much,
Chris again, that was a true

1783
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:19,800
transmission of the not only the
magnitude and the genius, but of

1784
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:27,320
the heart. Like Words fail,
heart chattering, heart,

1785
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:34,580
boundlessness of love that you
saw. And what is, what is

1786
02:24:34,580 --> 02:24:41,800
inspiring Is that is that, yes,
you, you keep saying in true

1787
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:45,940
humility that there's nothing
new in what you saw, but the

1788
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:50,200
fact that you did see it, that
you are reporting your own

1789
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:54,700
experience, that this is direct
phenomenology, not some out of

1790
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:58,000
some text out, but this is what
you found in your direct

1791
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:01,980
experience. And it echoed.
Because the discoveries of the

1792
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:06,780
great saints and sages
throughout human history, and it

1793
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:10,980
also echoes the findings of
other deep explorers, which

1794
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:16,980
which Stan Grof put together in
his book The cosmic game, where

1795
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:21,680
he took the deepest insights of
the 1000 people he'd worked with

1796
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:26,660
and welded them into a
synthesis, a a cosmology, an

1797
02:25:26,660 --> 02:25:31,580
ontology, a metaphysics, which
was remarkably similar to some

1798
02:25:31,580 --> 02:25:34,460
of the findings, the great
traditions, and I think was most

1799
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:38,420
synchronous, most congruent of
all, with Kashmir Shaivism, the

1800
02:25:38,420 --> 02:25:46,060
very profound mysticism of
India. So yes, from one

1801
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:49,000
perspective, we can say, yeah,
you just saw what's been

1802
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:52,840
reported umpteen times. No big
deal. Why'd you waste your time

1803
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:58,060
writing a book? On the other
hand, Thank you, Chris. This is

1804
02:25:58,120 --> 02:26:06,480
a new way, the fact that we have
a we have a an integrated report

1805
02:26:06,480 --> 02:26:13,200
of these truly trans, egoic,
Transpersonal, trans everything

1806
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:20,900
openings from a different
modality is very affirming of

1807
02:26:20,900 --> 02:26:25,640
perennial wisdom and perennial
insights, so nothing is left

1808
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:26,060
out.

1809
02:26:27,140 --> 02:26:30,020
John Dupuy: You include the all
somehow. And I was thinking,

1810
02:26:30,020 --> 02:26:33,260
it's like this guy's telling me
about the burning bush, and I

1811
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:39,920
smell the smoke beautiful, and
holding on to your humility and

1812
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:43,240
your your your humanity and
coming back and being a human

1813
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:47,860
being, you know, is such a gift,
brother. Thank you so much.

1814
02:26:49,060 --> 02:26:53,380
Roger Walsh: Indeed, indeed,
there's, there's one more theme

1815
02:26:53,380 --> 02:27:00,300
I want to point bring back, or
actually just point out that's

1816
02:27:00,300 --> 02:27:05,400
been underlying so much of what
you've you've said, you've

1817
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:12,120
talked about being guided, being
taken into, being offered, being

1818
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:17,940
graced by an intelligence and
love far Beyond the passes all

1819
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:25,400
understanding and and and what I
take from that is something that

1820
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:29,540
resonates deeply from my own
much more mundane explorations

1821
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:34,700
and from reading great
psychologists and therapists and

1822
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:39,560
other psychedelic explorers. And
that is we live, usually, the

1823
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:45,280
vast majority of humankind lives
at war with their own their own

1824
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:49,720
minds, deeply distrusting of
their own psyches and

1825
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:55,180
themselves. And yet, the deeper
we go, the more we discover what

1826
02:27:55,180 --> 02:28:01,320
you discovered, that we can
trust ourselves, that given,

1827
02:28:01,980 --> 02:28:07,680
when we open open as fully as we
can, we find that our minds are

1828
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:13,800
not these malevolent cesspools
of pain and trauma and and

1829
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:17,580
malevolence. Yes, there are
those, some of those elements

1830
02:28:17,580 --> 02:28:21,980
and bits we have to have to be
willing to face, but there's so

1831
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:27,560
much more and that when treated
well, when treated well, our

1832
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:32,840
minds are self healing, self
actualizing, self correcting,

1833
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:39,140
self transcending, yeah, and
That's that leads to this

1834
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:45,400
profound trust, both in
ourselves and in the greater

1835
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:46,120
reality.

1836
02:28:46,660 --> 02:28:50,500
Chris Bache: Yes, absolutely,
you say it very well, self

1837
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:55,120
correcting, self healing. We all
have knots. We're all born with

1838
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:58,600
knots. We bring in garbage from
a previous lifetime, lots of

1839
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:04,800
previous lifetimes, but when we
bring our awareness, when we

1840
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:08,580
bring those knots into
awareness, they open, they untie

1841
02:29:08,580 --> 02:29:13,380
themselves. When we bring our
pain into awareness, it heals

1842
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:20,340
itself, itself. It clarifies and
then, as as those shadows

1843
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:24,620
lighter, as lightness, we get
clear and clear and relax them.

1844
02:29:25,340 --> 02:29:32,840
Then the genius of our being
shows itself more easily, more

1845
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:38,600
strongly. And then the wonderful
discovery is that there is no

1846
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:43,300
membrane, ultimately, no
absolute membrane between our

1847
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:47,320
individual existence and the
existence of the universe itself

1848
02:29:47,740 --> 02:29:54,100
that we just drop right through.
And so the awareness that

1849
02:29:54,100 --> 02:29:59,620
bubbles up inside our individual
life and the awareness which is

1850
02:29:59,620 --> 02:30:04,020
bubble. Growing up around life
around us in totality and in my

1851
02:30:04,020 --> 02:30:07,860
neighbors, and in each other and
in the planet, it's the same

1852
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:15,480
life. It's not a separate life.
So and that's when, you know, I

1853
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:19,380
think when we begin to really
understand existence, then we

1854
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:23,480
can relate to the beauty of the
universe and own it as a

1855
02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:27,620
reflection of our beauty,
because if we don't understand

1856
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:32,300
reincarnation and we don't
understand how life works, we're

1857
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:35,420
always going to be estranged
from the magnificence of a

1858
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:41,020
beautiful sunrise and sunset or
the stars at night. But as we

1859
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:47,020
get clearer, everything begins
to become simpler, more

1860
02:30:47,020 --> 02:30:52,840
transparent, and that's just as
you say, We're self healing,

1861
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:56,560
self clarifying, self arising.

1862
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:04,860
Roger Walsh: Wow, Chris, you've
given us such an incredible

1863
02:31:04,860 --> 02:31:12,780
gift, and I know that you are
very aware that this is not your

1864
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:18,300
gift, and that you're you are
the instrument through which

1865
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:21,560
this gift has come and that's
the aspiration with which you

1866
02:31:21,560 --> 02:31:29,300
entered this very intense,
decades long investigation, and

1867
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:35,000
yet, all because of that, this
is an extraordinary transmission

1868
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:40,900
you're offering unique, yes, re
esperannial discoveries, and yet

1869
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:46,420
unique in its own form and time
and the capacity for

1870
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:50,680
contextualizing within the best
of our contemporary knowledge

1871
02:31:50,680 --> 02:31:55,960
and understanding of the great
tradition. So it's a priceless,

1872
02:31:56,020 --> 02:31:59,980
just a priceless gift. And I
think John bowed to you before I

1873
02:31:59,980 --> 02:32:05,280
bow to you. We both, both bow
and and you, you'll let the bow

1874
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:06,180
go through you.

1875
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:10,740
Chris Bache: Gentlemen, I know
enough of each of your work to

1876
02:32:10,740 --> 02:32:15,600
know who I'm with here, and I
bow to you deeply because I know

1877
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:19,260
that all of all three of us have
been working these fields for a

1878
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:23,060
long time. All three of us have
been nurtured by the wisdom and

1879
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:27,260
had been contributing to the
wisdom. So I the vow is

1880
02:32:27,260 --> 02:32:29,720
returned, brothers, truly, truly
is

1881
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:33,260
Roger Walsh: thank you. And
that's the way it is in in the

1882
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:38,000
spiritual traditions, one vows,
we bow to each other,

1883
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:43,420
recognizing who, who we really
are. Chris, is there anything

1884
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:47,320
you'd like to say that by way of
completion,

1885
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:56,620
Chris Bache: first I'd like to
say thank you. I become more

1886
02:32:56,620 --> 02:33:00,780
whole. I become healed and more
whole when I get to speak about

1887
02:33:00,780 --> 02:33:05,880
these things, then I get to do
what I was designed to do. And

1888
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:10,740
there are still not that many
places where I get to have the

1889
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:14,940
conversation that you pulled for
me today, that we had together

1890
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:20,360
today. So I want to say thank
you, and I'd like to add as a

1891
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:26,000
footnote. If there were one gift
that I wish I could give people

1892
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:34,160
straight out of my experiences
here, it would be the gift of

1893
02:33:34,580 --> 02:33:40,040
letting go of the fear of death,
just letting go of the fear of

1894
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:42,940
death. If you're afraid of
death, you have life turned

1895
02:33:42,940 --> 02:33:47,740
upside down. This is where the
hard work is done. This is where

1896
02:33:47,740 --> 02:33:52,540
we do the really hard work.
Death is we have so many stupid

1897
02:33:52,540 --> 02:33:56,560
ideas about what happens to us
when we die. Death is the great

1898
02:33:56,560 --> 02:34:00,660
liberation. Death is even the
partial liberation. Is a great

1899
02:34:00,660 --> 02:34:06,540
liberation. Death is joy. Death
is return. Death is to return

1900
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:11,040
again to the arms of the
Beloved. To be born is the

1901
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:15,000
beginning of the hard cycle. To
die is the end of the hard

1902
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,580
cycle, the beginning of the easy
part of the cycle.

1903
02:34:19,860 --> 02:34:22,880
Roger Walsh: That's that's a
wonderful flip on our

1904
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:30,260
conventional understanding.
Chris, well, I'm just going to

1905
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:34,820
repeat myself. What a gift. But
I want to, I want to close by

1906
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:40,040
mentioning again your books, the
several dark, night, early dawn.

1907
02:34:40,460 --> 02:34:44,920
Subtitle steps to a deep ecology
of mind. You wrote about your

1908
02:34:44,920 --> 02:34:47,800
teaching experience and how to
how teaching can be a

1909
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:51,880
transmission in the book for
living classroom. And most

1910
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:57,520
recently, the and book we've
been primarily focusing on today

1911
02:34:57,940 --> 02:35:01,140
is the extraordinary book,
Ellen. LSD and the mind of the

1912
02:35:01,140 --> 02:35:06,180
universe. LSD and the mind of
the universe, and both John and

1913
02:35:06,180 --> 02:35:09,900
I, I don't think we can
recommend it highly enough.

1914
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:14,760
We've both been inspired by it.
Chris, it's been a sheer delight

1915
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:18,060
to be able to do this dialog and
these explorations with you.

1916
02:35:18,420 --> 02:35:22,880
Thank you so much for on our
behalf, and also on behalf of

1917
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:26,120
all our listeners and all the
people who who you're touching

1918
02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:30,800
in so many ways. Deep gratitude.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1919
02:35:31,700 --> 02:35:34,400
This has been deep
transformation, self, society,

1920
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:40,120
spirit, talking with Chris
Bache, you you.

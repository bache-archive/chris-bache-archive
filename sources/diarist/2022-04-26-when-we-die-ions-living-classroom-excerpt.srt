00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:08,332
Chris Bache: I think when we
die, everything we've learned

2
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:11,692
and all the good we've done and
all our mistakes, but basically

3
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:17,152
our learning goes with us when
we die, and at the same time,

4
00:00:17,212 --> 00:00:20,360
it's retained within the
collective psyche of our

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:26,540
species. So all of our
experiences are preserved by the

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,020
individual consciousness that
continues their learning once

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,800
they leave time and space. But
because they are a member of

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,120
this species, and because this
species has a mind which is

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,740
integrating all of the conscious
experiences of all of its

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,820
members. That means all of my
experiences and everything I've

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,040
written about and everything
we're talking about here,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,360
they're not lost to humanity
when I die, but they are

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,440
literally hard wired into the
collective psyche, the

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,080
collective unconscious, right
now. That means that I think we

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,040
have to think quantum, kind of
in a quantum fashion, rather

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,940
than an atomistic fashion. When
we think about what happens to

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,200
these fields as the physical
body comes and goes, physical

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,920
bodies come and go. Souls
endure. Species have a soul.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,940
There is a species soul. There's
an Akashic field Laszlo talks

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,660
about. You could even describe
it as an Akashic Soul of the

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,020
Universe. There's this
tremendous kind of network of

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,320
consciousness which is
constantly integrating the

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,980
experiences of all of its
members. Yeah. Yeah. So I can, I

24
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,240
could imagine any number of
variations of what happens to

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,420
these fields after we are no
longer on the scene. Yeah.

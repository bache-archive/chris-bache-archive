1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,480
Chris Bache: So some images, how
do we imagine soul? How do I

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,920
ever imagine this reincarnation?
Well, one of my favorites is

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,200
what happens in trees we are
eating time, and the more time

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,380
we eat, the more soul weight we
put on trees. Do that get bigger

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,260
and bigger and bigger and

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,680
we have other images nature does
all these

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,600
things. We have these suggestive
natural phenomenon where nature

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,780
just kind of builds and builds
and spirals on. But images are

9
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,400
imagining the soul for flowers.
And so when I'm with my

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,780
students, I ask them to imagine
that each one of those petals

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,340
and each one of those pistols
and stamens is an entire life.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,520
So this each one of those petals
is 100 years. Each one of those

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,120
little 1000s of Sagan in the
center is 100 years of life. And

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,360
the soul is the beautiful,
magnificent integration of all

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,380
of that experience into an
identity that is bigger than

16
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:32,120
anyone, but which honors
everyone. And just as there are

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,760
many, many different types of
followers, we're not all

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,060
becoming the same thing.
Actually, we're becoming more

19
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,840
and more different, more and
more individualized. We're

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,320
cutting ourselves. We're
developing ourselves in

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,160
different directions with
different aptitudes. We have to,

22
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,560
but we have to do something to
imagine the soul that we are

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,600
underneath something large,
something magnificent and

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,500
something beautiful. Many of you
have seen Carl Jung's mandalas

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,060
and these beautiful images that
he would draw. Those to me, in

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,700
some ways, are like images of
the soul. They're not just

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,560
images of the state of common of
mind, but they're images of this

28
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,120
deeper identity that's moving
through so you ready to go to

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,940
the next topic, yes, one very
basic question, where are all

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,780
this like as the population
increases? Where are they coming

31
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,920
from? Same question,

32
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,720
I answer all of these questions
in life cycles because I wrote

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,060
life cycles after I've been
teaching this stuff for 10

34
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,420
years, and the students pretty
much asked every question that

35
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,240
you could possibly imagine. I
try to, you know, get the

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,860
answer. Here's way of thinking
of it, the problem of the growth

37
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,860
of the human species, and where
those souls are coming from, is

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,640
only a problem if we make two
assumptions. One is that the

39
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,360
number of souls is limited, it's
finite, and that they're really

40
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,920
very small. So in the beginning,
there were maybe 60,000 human

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,860
beings on the planet. If we
assume that there were only

42
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,580
60,000 souls, and somehow we
must be dividing them or doing

43
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,200
something to get 7 billion
souls. But here's a different

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,880
way of thinking. My university
was at one time we had about

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,500
3000 students. 50 years later,
we have 13,000 students, if you

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,040
never left campus, you saw the
students coming and going

47
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,800
semester by semester, you would
see that they're more and more

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,140
students. You might be asking
yourself, where are they coming

49
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,500
from? But of course, they're
coming from the surrounding

50
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,400
area, because this is a much,
much bigger community than our

51
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,900
than our campus. Likewise, we
have no reason to think that

52
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,900
there are only a small number of
souls. There could be trillions

53
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,580
and trillions of souls. There
could be souls lined up waiting

54
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,840
to get into the classroom that
we're in right now. They cannot

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,960
get on this planet until there
is space available for them to

56
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,140
get in. So every semester, there
are some new freshmen and there

57
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,140
are some graduating seniors.
There's a matriculation, there's

58
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,440
some humans who are leaving and
some humans who are coming, but

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,940
they're always more souls
available and who are eager to

60
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,540
be part of this exercise. Robert
Monroe, who I talked about in

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,200
dark, that early dawn, my book,
second book, and we're not going

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,860
to talk too much about today,
but he's an interesting man.

63
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,100
Went out of his body when he was
40 years old, traveled over the

64
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,460
universe and wrote three books,
autobiographical books

65
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,800
describing what the book what
the world looks like from

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,720
someone who's been exploring it
in the out of body state. He

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,080
says, every one of us is here
because somewhere in our

68
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,520
travels, in the spiritual, non
physical world, we came across a

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,540
graduate of the earth school,
somebody who had gone through

70
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,560
this curriculum, and we were so
blown away by the beauty and the

71
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,620
quality of their energy that we
track down how they got that

72
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,100
quick, and we tracked them down
to here, and we began the

73
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,180
incarnational process so that We
could become like what we saw,

74
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,340
so massive, massive population.
He says the majority of

75
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,980
intelligent life in the universe
is non physical. The majority is

76
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,020
non physical. Do you have
questions or hand up here, yes,

77
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,880
yeah, I was born three times,
three answers.

78
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,640
Unknown: Born three pounds,
three ounces. And I was

79
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,460
wondering, would there be any
reason? Because I, you know, I

80
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,480
always said, well, smoking, you
know, my mother like that smoky

81
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,180
environment, like I feel like
I'm getting out of here, you

82
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,700
know, seven kind of thing. But
any reason why

83
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,120
somebody would be born?

84
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,840
So I would be born so premature
and low birth weight?

85
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,940
Chris Bache: I don't, I can't, I
don't know of any kind of

86
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,480
formula that kind of gives us
that, I think reincarnation. Of

87
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,360
course, this doesn't answer all
our questions. It just gives us

88
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,800
a new context within which we
can explore answers and once,

89
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,680
and we're going once we get into
the past lives therapy, where we

90
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,820
have a context in which people
have asked that question, why am

91
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,060
I this way? Why did I Why was I
born with this particular set of

92
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,260
circumstances? And what we find
is when you actually go into the

93
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,060
details of their memory when you
can help them remember the

94
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,660
choices that they made before
they were incarnated. There are

95
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,980
reasons. There are reasons for
everything. What that particular

96
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,060
reason is behind that particular
thing? I don't know, but we have

97
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,980
context in which we can explore.

98
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,120
Yeah, that would have come up.
Yeah, okay, all the all the

99
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,500
various conditions. Why am I
born this way? Why am I in this

100
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,800
family? Why am I in this
context? Why did I lose my legs

101
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,660
in this accident? Why there is a
deeper context? But we have to

102
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,400
get into the soul in order to
retrieve the memories that give

103
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,360
us the information

104
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,660
we need, first here and then
here.

105
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,260
Unknown: Okay, this is Carl. I
don't think this is well, it

106
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,060
could be about reincarnation,
but years ago, I heard concept

107
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,600
of the term called walk ins,
people that come and they're,

108
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,820
they're from there, coming to
watch us.

109
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,460
And I don't know if it's to do
back or what,

110
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,720
but that has never left my mind.
This isn't a book group that I

111
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,840
was in years ago, and I've never
forgotten that concept. Is it?

112
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,580
Is it a concept that's out
there? Do we know of this, of

113
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,860
these people, or these souls
called walking?

114
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,000
Chris Bache: The idea here is
that usually the way to get here

115
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,300
is to be born. You know, you got
to go through nine months of

116
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,680
gestation and become, you know,
go through diapers and go

117
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,360
through adolescence in order to
be an adult. In some instances,

118
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:02,100
we have some cases where it is,
it seems as if the personality

119
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,320
of a person, of a person, a
child or an adult, leads and a

120
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,840
different personality is
suddenly there. And this, these

121
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,100
are sometimes called walk ins,
that there's kind of a deal

122
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,780
where they switch, where someone
voluntarily leaves their

123
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,100
incarnation, and someone
voluntarily takes over the body

124
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,800
so that they can be here without
going through the whole

125
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,820
gestational process. That's a
complicated topic. Some people

126
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,860
are skeptical about that
interpretation of the walk in

127
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,340
phenomenon. Other people are
more supportive of this idea

128
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,200
that you can have a step in or
walk in, but the basic idea is

129
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,020
that there's kind of an exchange
taking place between spiritual

130
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,500
beings and physical beings, or
between embodied beings and

131
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,460
distance. Embodied beings.
Because if what I'm saying is

132
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,560
true, we already are spiritual
beings, right? You don't become

133
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,880
a spiritual being when you die.
We are spiritual being with our

134
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,840
body. We are an embodied
spiritual being. And then there

135
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,960
are disembodied spiritual
beings. So the normal cycle is

136
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,420
what we've been talking about,
but maybe there are some

137
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,060
variations on

138
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,320
Unknown: that interaction. So it
is a phenomenon. Then you said

139
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,060
the walking phenomena. So it's,
it's that out there,

140
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,820
Chris Bache: it is, it is out
there, and it is discussed, and

141
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,320
it does come up, and it's kind
of a minor thread that does come

142
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,160
up, I was just gonna

143
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Audience 2: ask reincarnation.
I've believed in it forever, and

144
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,120
it hasn't been popular in my
church. So I kept very quiet,

145
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,660
always to myself, but the
question I've always had in my

146
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,040
head was, when is

147
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,160
Unknown: it over. Are there
completed

148
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,400
Audience 2: souls, so that you
keep coming back, keep coming

149
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,120
back, and you learn more and
more and more. But are there

150
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
ever, once in a while, I know
what person you guys that I

151
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,260
think myself

152
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,060
Unknown: soul, but I'm not sure
that

153
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,220
Chris Bache: that's a large
question, the classic way to

154
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,140
think. See, we only began. We
became self conscious about

155
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,300
35,000 years ago as a species,
right? And until about 5000

156
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,280
years ago, when we began to
develop the psycho technology to

157
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,640
explore the deep unconscious, to
really explore the nature of

158
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,640
mind itself. We began
meditating. And we began

159
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,660
meditating for 4000 years ago.
And when we began meditating, we

160
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,600
first began to push deep into
the psyche. We discovered the

161
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,480
mother universe. We discovered
Brahman. We discovered the soul.

162
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,680
We discovered this beautiful,
beautiful spiritual reality

163
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,620
which is gestated the physical
world. You know, the source of

164
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,240
the Big Bang. And when we
discovered it, our first

165
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,020
reaction was, my God. This is
magnificent. This is beautiful.

166
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,520
This feels so good. This is
home. This is where I want to

167
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,400
be. I want to be in Myrtle
Beach. Even though I like

168
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,980
Boston, I want to be I want to
be there. And so the religions

169
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,820
that came into existence about
3000 years ago are all

170
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,740
variations on an up and out
cosmology. So we want to achieve

171
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,080
breakthrough. We want to go
home. So we want to be good, to

172
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,200
achieve salvation, so we can go
home. We want to become

173
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,860
enlightened, so we can achieve
moksha, so we can go home. So

174
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,220
it's all kind of up and out and
then, so if it's an up and out,

175
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,220
then you have to what are the
criteria? There must be some

176
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,860
threshold that we must pass in
order that we can get our ticket

177
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:09,120
punched so we can get out of
here. I understand all those

178
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,540
systems, and by the way,
Hinduism, Buddhism,

179
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,140
Christianity, Islam, Judaism,
all of them fundamentally with a

180
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,000
few variations among the most
spiritually sophisticated

181
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,140
elements, all of them are up and
up cosmology. The purpose is to

182
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:34,700
get up and away. That leaves a
fundamental riddle unsolved, why

183
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,460
the physical universe? Remember
these pictures we were showing,

184
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,380
why the physical universe? Why
did the divine, or whatever you

185
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,480
want to think of as this, what
was before the Big Bang, when

186
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,220
everything was in that reality.
Why did that reality create the

187
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,780
magnificent, physical universe
that we are part of? Up and out?

188
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,900
Cosmiclogies Leave that
unexplained. It becomes a veil

189
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,140
of tears. It becomes a
challenge. It becomes an

190
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,960
obstacle course, but it doesn't
really explain what the divine

191
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,800
was thinking when he created the
physical universe. I think the

192
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,000
eponopic cosmicologies are
simply the first stage of human

193
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,220
discovery. A more mature
discovery takes place when we

194
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,040
realize, when we wake up, when
we begin to realize we are we

195
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,580
can't we come from this reality.
We are part of this reality. The

196
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,140
physical world is an expression
of this reality. The goal is not

197
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:35,660
simply to return. The goal is to
integrate that reality and this

198
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,900
reality into conscious presence
wherever we are. So the goal is

199
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:46,060
to literally draw more of
spiritual the mother universe

200
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,860
into the daughter universe, that
reality into this reality, so

201
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,300
that these worlds become more
integrated, so that eventually

202
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,360
Heaven is a state of awareness.
It's not a place you. Can be in

203
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,440
heaven. On Earth, you can be in
heaven. In the spiritual world,

204
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:12,660
it's a state of awareness. It's
not a place. Once we have a

205
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,940
species which is able to have
more conscious and continuous

206
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,800
and unbroken rapport between
spiritual reality and physical

207
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,780
reality, then the evolutionary
game changes, and we move into a

208
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,400
new direction. But we're going
to be doing this for another

209
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,680
billion years. We're going to be
doing it for 10s of billions of

210
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,120
years, right? So it's as I
think, when we die, we we get to

211
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,840
go home, we get to be renewed.
We get to be rejuvenated. We

212
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,380
return to source. We all these
wonderful things that we're

213
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:57,340
about to look at happen. But the
goal is not simply to get away

214
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,460
from all. The goal is to become
more to become more completely,

215
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,280
a more magnificent manifestation
of the creative process itself.

216
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,560
So I'm distrustful of the
criteria which have been

217
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,120
established for up and up
cosmiclogies. To me, that's just

218
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,060
midway and the most
sophisticated spiritual

219
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,780
traditions recognize that. But
the Western thinker, he's

220
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,380
actually a Hindu thinker, who
really drove this point home,

221
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,320
and underscore this very
powerfully in his teaching, is

222
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,880
Sri Aurobindo. Sri Aurobindo was
very critical the up and out

223
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,220
cosmology. And he said not it's
an incarnational theology. What

224
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,280
we need is an incarnational
presence, a greater

225
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:53,320
incarnational presence, near
death episode research, I bet if

226
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,740
there's if any of you have
looked at the literature for any

227
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,300
of the four areas we're talking
about today, most of you have

228
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,300
probably looked at some of the
near death episode literature.

229
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,660
Isn't that a magnificent
literature, because the stories

230
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,420
are just phenomenal. Here are my
four, my three favorite books

231
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,320
for going into this literature.
And I've taught this for years,

232
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,440
and we all know Raymond Moody
was the one who started it, you

233
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,920
know, and got things going. One
of my great heroes here is a man

234
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,440
named Ken ring. He wrote his
dissertation. He was at

235
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,960
University of Connecticut,
professor in the Psychology

236
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,100
Department. He wrote his
dissertation. His first book is

237
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,700
called Life of death. This is
his second book, Ted internal

238
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,160
omega, and his third book on it
is lessons from the light.

239
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,940
Heading from heading toward
omega is a little hard to find.

240
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,220
It's out of print. Now you have
to do a little digging in the

241
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,600
libraries, and lessons from the
light is still available, still

242
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,560
in print. Ken is a size being,
just a deliciously sweet human

243
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,880
being. He is a very he's one of
the founders of near death

244
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,380
episode, the German near death
episode, study of what was

245
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,020
originally bad oncology. He's a
good clinical clinician. He

246
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,740
probably knows more about near
death episode, research than any

247
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,500
other single person alive today.
His he's got file cabinets and

248
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,000
file cabinets of cases, and he
lets the people speak for

249
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,400
themselves. So chapter three and
heading toward omega, to me, is

250
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,240
one of the most if there's a
person who's really suffering

251
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,640
from death in their life, and
they are. They've lost someone.

252
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,660
I'll zero box. CHAPTER THREE OF
heading toward omega and give it

253
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,940
to them is just, it's 13
accounts of people who have

254
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,280
unusually deep near death
episodes, and also in lessons

255
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,240
from the light. You're going to
get all sorts of research there.

256
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,940
This is the last book he wrote.
There's a chapter towards the

257
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,340
end of it called returning to
the source, and once again, he's

258
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,560
distilled people's case
histories, and he shares their

259
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,220
case histories. There's also a
chapter on near death episodes

260
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,540
of the blind, because we find
that some people who have been

261
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:29,300
blind from birth or blinded
shortly after they were born,

262
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,640
when they have a near death
episode, they can see. And that

263
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,960
was kind of an anecdote that we
couldn't document, but Ken, he

264
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,040
documented it, and so he
presents the evidence for this,

265
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,660
and he also documents the long
term changes in personality

266
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,260
structure that happens to people
who have unusually deep near the

267
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,160
episodes. So he's been part of
the second generation of

268
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,660
scholars. We're not interested
simply that whether this

269
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,740
happens, we now know it.
Happens. We've got millions of

270
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,120
people. About 35% of the people
who nearly die have conscious

271
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,780
recall of their experience. What
is an in depth Near-Death

272
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,740
Experience? He differentiates
five stages of Near-Death

273
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,460
Experience, and not everybody
has the same depth of experience

274
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,900
some people may experience the
first stage is the feeling of

275
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,580
peace. Then there may be a stage
of separation from the physical

276
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,980
body, the tunnel, kind of
phenomenon we go on to the

277
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,340
confrontation, meeting of being
of light.

278
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,820
So people for a variety of
reasons, not everybody has the

279
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,520
same deep experience. What Ken
does in heading toward omega is

280
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,020
he hypothesizes This is asking
the question, not whether near

281
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,100
death episodes occur. He's
already written a book on that.

282
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,240
He knows that they occur. He's
asking the question, what does

283
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,100
it mean? What is the meaning of
the near death episode? And he

284
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,120
hypothesizes that the most
likely way to understand the

285
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,480
meaning of this event is to
study the people who have the

286
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,580
deepest form of the experience.
And he calls these core and the

287
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,360
ears, they go right to the core.
So it's not simply people who

288
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,280
have separation from their body
going into another reality,

289
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,420
meeting the light. The fifth
stage is to go into the light,

290
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,500
to actually merge with that
light, and to go deep into it.

291
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,560
This is what he calls a core nd
even, and that's where, I think,

292
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,900
where people have the deepest
homecoming experience, the

293
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,020
deepest experience, and then
they come back out of that

294
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,500
experience. And those are the
people who are often the most

295
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,960
profoundly changed by that
experience. And for the changes,

296
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,800
you know, he runs the list of
changes. They're not only

297
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,780
changed by their their values
change. They lose all fear.

298
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,080
That's one of the most
widespread phenomenon. They lose

299
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,160
all fear of death. They become
disinterested in material

300
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,480
possessions. You know, that
whole consumer culture just kind

301
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,800
of falls away. It's just silly.
They become more compassionate,

302
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,360
they become more spiritually
attuned, but their physiology

303
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,680
actually has changed. Sometimes
they can't be around electrical

304
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,280
appliances and computers. They
can't wear digital watches

305
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,220
lights blow out around them. So
there's something about going,

306
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,240
in fact, to source, which seems
to involve an immersion into a

307
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,200
higher form of energy, which
changes people physiologically

308
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,340
as well as psychologically.
Okay, so that he just very

309
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,560
carefully lays them out layer by
layer, and he documents all the

310
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,960
phenomena that we're finding, he
documents them piece by piece.

311
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,880
Can I can I share the beauty of
this is in the people's own

312
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,860
experiences. So how about if I
just read for you one of the

313
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,480
cases that's in in Ken's book.
You Yes,

314
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,960
this one is a case that comes
from chapter 13 of lessons from

315
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,100
the light. And do we have that?
Yes, we do have

316
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,680
Unknown: that book. They have
such a great book

317
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,280
Chris Bache: store. There's a
woman named Virginia rivers,

318
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,580
right? And I'm going to jump to
the juicy part, and she has the

319
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,580
usual she separates from her
body, and he explains why she's

320
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,240
having this episode, and she's
traveling through the tunnel,

321
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,600
and she's bowling through the
universe, and then she comes to

322
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,240
the end of this journey, and she
says, galaxies are flying by her

323
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,280
sensation, and she begins to
receive knowledge. She says,

324
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,460
quote, the farther forward I was
propelled, the more knowledge I

325
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,760
received. My mind felt like a
sponge, growing and expanding in

326
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,740
size with each addition, the
knowledge came in single words

327
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:33,140
and in whole idea blocks. I just
seemed to be able to understand

328
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,360
everything as if it were being
soaked up or absorbed. I could

329
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,920
feel my mind expanding and
absorbing, and each new piece of

330
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,260
information somehow seemed to
belong. It was as if I had known

331
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:53,020
already but forgotten or mislead
it, as if it were waiting here

332
00:24:53,020 --> 00:25:03,180
for me to pick it up on my way
back. She goes on a melody man

333
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,300
could not possibly have
composed, yet so totally

334
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:11,040
familiar and in complete harmony
with the very core of my being,

335
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,300
as if it were the rhythm of my
existence, the reason for my

336
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,480
being. And then she encounters
she goes into the ecstatic state

337
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,400
of great peace, great love. She
says, love poured into me from

338
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,440
all the corners of the universe.
And she eventually arrives at

339
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,900
her end destination. And she
What stands out for her again,

340
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,300
is the experience of knowledge.
She says, all at once, there was

341
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,700
total and absolute awareness.
There was not a question I could

342
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,760
ask for which I did not already
have the answer. Can you

343
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,020
imagine, as I tell myself, the
purpose of life is to get

344
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,120
questions, because when you're
with God, you want to be and you

345
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,240
could have any answer to
anything you wanted to know.

346
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,060
What if you have just cheap, two
bit questions? You want to have

347
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,360
some good questions. Stir it up.
Imagine anything you wanted to

348
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,700
know you could know. I looked
over to the presence. She's with

349
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,400
this light presence I knew would
be there. And thought, God, it

350
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,280
was so simple. Why didn't I know
that? Then she goes on, I'm

351
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,980
skipping pieces. It was God, His
love, His light, his very

352
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,540
essence, the force of creation,
emanating to the ends of all

353
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:44,020
eternity, reaching out as a
pulsing beacon of love to bring

354
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:50,140
me home. She puts home in
quotation marks. He told me many

355
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,040
things of which I have little or
no recollection. Now I remember

356
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,980
only two things from all of that
exchange. First, God told me

357
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,300
that there were only two things
we could bring back to it with

358
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:10,860
us when we died, love and
knowledge. So I was to learn as

359
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,960
much about both as possible.
Secondly, God told me I had to

360
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,120
return. I could not stay. There
was something I had yet to

361
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,400
accomplish. I remember knowing
at that moment what it was, but

362
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:31,880
I have no recollection. Now,
here's a little bit of a

363
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,980
paradox, two things we can bring
back, love and knowledge.

364
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,520
However, she just made it very
clear when she died, she went

365
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,480
into a state of absolute
knowledge. So we return to

366
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,040
absolute knowledge. But one of
the things that God wants us to

367
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,200
do is bring back knowledge. What
could we possibly bringing back

368
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,500
that would be that would equal
the knowledge that's waiting for

369
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:06,180
us when we die? You see that
paradox. That's a paradox really

370
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,120
only if we think that the
purpose of life is to go home,

371
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,440
is to return. That's not the
purpose. What if the purpose is

372
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,940
to bring more and more knowledge
into time and space. So the

373
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,280
knowledge that we discover here
we bring back, not to add to the

374
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,540
knowledge that's there, but
because we are integrating here

375
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,440
the knowledge which is freely
available there, the purpose is

376
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,740
to bring more loving more
knowledge here, which we bring

377
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,640
back, because we're sowing there
and here into one being.

378
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,979
Margaret Hiller: Well, it's hard
to talk about this stuff and not

379
00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:45,099
feel like it's an up and out
cosmology, because even the way

380
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,399
you're talking right now talks
about we're going out there to

381
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:54,519
bring it back here, when, in
fact, like a mandala, isn't it

382
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:01,139
flowing from and through us? I
mean, we look into ourselves,

383
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,619
and it's like looking into an
atom. We expand back up. It's

384
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:09,479
all happening here, right? Yes,
okay,

385
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,800
Chris Bache: yes. It's very hard
to talk about it without lapsing

386
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,780
into those old rabbits.

387
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,020
Margaret Hiller: So we don't
really bring something back,

388
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,640
except in our memory, right?
It's all where we have access to

389
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,720
it right now, yes, so when we
talk about bringing it back,

390
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,620
we're bringing it back into
memory or into consciousness,

391
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,160
right?

392
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,180
Chris Bache: I think it's a
both, and I think it's a both,

393
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,220
and I think that plainness, i

394
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,060
Yes, we don't really go anywhere
when we die, but if we were to

395
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,540
die right here, in some sense,
we don't leave the room, but in

396
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:07,380
another sense, we leave the
room. Them. So it was a monk,

397
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,220
Abraham Asante Club, an
Augustinian monk in the 17th

398
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,940
century, who said, He who dies
before he dies does not die when

399
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,060
he dies. Those who die before
they die before they die do not

400
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,180
die when they die. What does he
mean by that? If there's a sense

401
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,360
in which there's physical death,
and then there's spiritual

402
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,660
death, if we go through the
spiritual death, which is to

403
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:40,840
say, we drop away the ego, wake
up to our deeper spiritual

404
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,380
knowing, if we go through the
Death-Rebirth process, it

405
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,000
actually changes what happens to
us when we die. And there is a

406
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,500
it's more and more clear that
we're really not going anywhere.

407
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,100
We're just shifting our
register, shifting registration.

408
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,920
So I think the key is we're
bringing more and more of it

409
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,840
here. We're we're changing the
conditions where we're changing

410
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,140
the conditions within which life
takes place, but we're not

411
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,740
really going anywhere. So in
that sense, we're not going

412
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,700
anywhere. Robert Monroe says
he's going out of his body in

413
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,520
the early stages. You kind of
have a sensation that you're

414
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,520
traveling. You're going out. But
then later that disappears. He

415
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,220
says, You just kind of think and
you're there. So it's not that

416
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,820
you're going somewhere where
there is a physical distance to

417
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,720
travel. You're really just
you're opening up to a depth of

418
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,500
consciousness where that reality
is here, right here, right now.

419
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,280
And I think that speaks to what
you're saying. It is all here,

420
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,940
it's all right now, but we just
keep ourselves shielded from it

421
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,520
in some way, so we're just
taking down barriers of our

422
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:54,940
mind.

423
00:31:57,339 --> 00:32:02,699
Unknown: It sounds like that.
That shape the Taurus, the

424
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:09,359
Taurus and you expand out, but
where you actually are back in

425
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:09,839
the center.

426
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,160
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah. We keep
bringing it all back into the

427
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,260
into the center. Yes, here, and
then here,

428
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,700
Unknown: I lost my father. And
the way that I understand that,

429
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,240
or I think about that, and I
think about him being with me

430
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,720
still is, whenever a person
walks out of a room, they leave

431
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,860
behind there's something that
essence or whatever that they've

432
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,040
left behind, that print, that
imprint that they were there.

433
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,780
And that's the way that I stay
in touch with my dad. Yeah, that

434
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,680
makes sense,

435
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,720
Chris Bache: it does. And this
maybe allows us to address

436
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,200
something else. My father died
about 45 years ago. Now,

437
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,500
according to Stevenson's data,
he or his soul was probably

438
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,520
incarnated again. And so one of
the questions my students ask me

439
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,140
is, I really want to see my dad
again. I want to see the bones I

440
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,640
love. What if I died and get up
to heaven and they're already

441
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:25,100
incarnated? They're not there
anymore. They just left.

442
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,540
But actually, a couple of things
help us understand this from a

443
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:41,200
larger context. First of all, we
don't incarnate all of our

444
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,780
energy in every incarnation, the
large majority of our souls,

445
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,880
energy stays outside of time and
space, even while part of it

446
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,360
incarnates into time and space.
So the way I would put it for

447
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,200
your father and my father, that
their soul, your father has now

448
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,420
returned to his soul. So your
father is now very much living a

449
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,560
deeper life, a larger life, the
life of the soul, even if that

450
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,480
soul has sent out a distillation
of threads into and started a

451
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:22,940
new incarnation. When you die,
you you meet your father's soul,

452
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,800
and the face that your father's
soul wears is the face that you

453
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,300
are most familiar with. So
where's the face of your father?

454
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,160
But you are not just you, right?
You are beginning to be your

455
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,080
soul. So it may, in the first
stage, it may be like you

456
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,380
meeting your father or me
meeting my father, but very

457
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,880
quickly, it's your soul
connecting, reconnecting with

458
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,820
his soul. And that's a different
that's a bigger enterprise, a

459
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,560
larger enterprise, so that your
father leaves a trace. All of

460
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,800
our loved ones leave a trace in
us and on the earth. It. But

461
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,280
they are living presence. They
continue to be a living presence

462
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,220
in this larger world that we
encounter when we die so and

463
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,820
we're going to see Michael
Newton is very clear, we only

464
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,780
incarnate a fraction of our at
this present time, a fraction of

465
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,040
our souls energy. And we choose
how much of our energy of the

466
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,300
soul we incarnate into our
present body. He says, If we

467
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,800
incarnated our entire soul in
our present body, we'd shortly

468
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,260
blow all the circuits of our
brain. We couldn't handle the

469
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,400
energy. And that's why I think
we picture great saints and

470
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,840
sages like with this light
coming off of them, because,

471
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,260
literally, they are carrying
more energy than an ordinary

472
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,740
person.

473
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,480
Unknown: Talking about a process
where there is a God who,

474
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,300
through this process of
expansion, expansion

475
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,260
and compassion, is actually

476
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:07,259
making the souls all more like
God. It's like this expansion, a

477
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:11,339
bigger expansion and
contraction. That's kind of so

478
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:16,319
that we do bring heaven on earth
in a new realm, or a new place,

479
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:17,699
or whatever, and then would

480
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,480
go from there. Yeah. Yeah,

481
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,240
Chris Bache: we're going to see
when we get a little bit further

482
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,780
along. Michael Newton, if you
ask, where does the soul come

483
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:38,960
from? Where do souls come from?
And the answer seems to be, the

484
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,620
soul is actually kind of teased
out of God. The soul is like the

485
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,480
sun's throwing out silver
flares, and the soul is kind of

486
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,280
the essence of the Divine is
teased out, and it's actually

487
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,240
incubated very carefully. There
are beings whose sole job it is

488
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,620
to catch and nourish that energy
and to and to birth it help it

489
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:09,780
birth into self awareness that
it starts with the divine, but

490
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,520
it's birth as an individual self
awareness. But it's pure

491
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,900
potential, it's unnaturalized
potential. And then the system

492
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,300
seems to be set up so that that
self awareness begins this

493
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,520
journey of self actualization.
So it has all the potential of

494
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,020
the Divine, but it's kind of
like in potency, not in

495
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:38,360
actualization, and it's
actualized more and more, and

496
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,600
it's almost as if this isn't
quite the right image, but it's

497
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,060
kind of like God is cloning
herself, and God is just

498
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:57,340
throwing out stars, and each one
of us is is that the ancient

499
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,740
Greek theologians called It
logos for Monica, you know, the

500
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,600
seeds of the Logos, the seeds of
the Divine, and we're incubating

501
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,800
that seed potential into deeper
and deeper actualizations.

502
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,700
Sooner or later, we develop
enough that we remember who we

503
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,240
are. We remember that our
essence is the divine, and the

504
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,500
essence of everything and every
person we see around us is also

505
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,040
the divine. Holy smokes, we're
all part of the Divine. We're

506
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,820
all differentiating and becoming
more and more, and it's all

507
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:36,320
taking place inside the divine.
So the classic phrase is from

508
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:43,120
God to God, always in God. So we
come from God, we go back to

509
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,160
God. Where are we now? We're in
God. We never leave. We never

510
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,440
left, except in our lack of
understanding. So we are

511
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,980
becoming more and more, in some
sense, what we were in the

512
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,200
beginning, but not exactly
because we haven't actualized

513
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,540
it. We haven't brought it into
full conscious expression. And

514
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,840
there's another one other last
thing I want to mention is that

515
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,240
we're going to, I'm going to get
to Newton soon. We'll probably

516
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:21,860
Newton's people very clearly
suggest that the God of this

517
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:27,680
universe is not necessarily the
ultimate god. They talk about

518
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,000
God's grandfather, this system,
this entire physical universe,

519
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,200
which we measure in light years,
which is 6 million million

520
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,380
miles, is one light year. You
measure the universe in a

521
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,020
yardstick of 6 million, million
miles and 1000s, millions of

522
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,620
light years across, billions of
light years across. This entire

523
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,420
universe is not the only
universe. There are other

524
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,440
universes. There are many
universes, and there is kind of

525
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:04,380
a. A being who is the generator
and responsible for each

526
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,280
universe, and none of those
beings are the ultimate,

527
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,280
ultimate being, okay? That kind
of,

528
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:29,420
yeah. I'm getting ahead of
myself. But when people do, when

529
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,120
people remember what they were
doing before they were born,

530
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,980
they they experience divine
presence, like people who have

531
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:42,340
near death episodes, but they
don't, they don't draw the

532
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,880
conclusion. They don't use the
concept, the concept of God, to

533
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,820
describe it. Their vision is
that the concept of God that we

534
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,180
are born with and we kind of
work with in our churches, is so

535
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,200
inadequate to describe the
reality that they don't want to

536
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,680
use that language to describe
the reality that they're

537
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,120
confronting, and that this
reality which is magnificent

538
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,380
beyond measures, we saw from
Virginia's experience that

539
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:16,320
reality is not necessarily the
end reality. It's just the

540
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,740
magnificent reality. This is the
generative intelligence of this

541
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:26,960
system. So all of a sudden, we
kind of, whoo, we're in a bigger

542
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,320
universe than we even imagine.
Question is, are we safe? What's

543
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,440
going on? Are we are we part of
an intelligent, meaningful

544
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,260
exercise, or are we lost on this
chaos? And I think we're getting

545
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,700
more clearly this awareness that
we are safe. First of all,

546
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,060
there's nothing that can ever
happen to us that will truly end

547
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,540
our life, extinguish life. We're
not hell, by the way. This

548
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,180
disappears out of the system.
The concept of Hell is is

549
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:01,740
primitive beyond measure, and
we're doing something that's

550
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,180
creative and immensely
satisfying in the long term. It

551
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,380
may hurt the pinch in the short
term, but taking us, if we're

552
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,520
going someplace, we're going
into a developmental process,

553
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,200
it's just profound and
satisfying that it's hard, and

554
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,040
that's, I think that's more
important for us, and to know

555
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,180
the ultimate, ultimate, ultimate
is to believe that this is

556
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:34,820
meaningful, worthwhile exercise
that we are part of here, and

557
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,020
then back here, could

558
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:41,259
Unknown: that be why We come
back with knowledge so that we

559
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:47,559
start at a higher level than we
left, or at not starting all the

560
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:50,019
way at the beginning again, so
we come back with this

561
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:53,199
knowledge, so that we can go
further, or perhaps bring back

562
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:53,859
our knowledge others.

563
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,800
Chris Bache: I think so. And as
long as we keep a flexible

564
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,460
vision, like in college, we may
have a student who decides to

565
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,540
major in math and takes
mathematics courses for several

566
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,900
semesters and gets really
develops a good ability in math,

567
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,020
and then says, Well, I think I
dropped that. I'm going to start

568
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,980
being an artist. I'm going to
try art for a while. Now, they

569
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,760
may be a beginner artist, but
that doesn't mean they're a

570
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,120
beginner student. They're just
beginning a new set of skills.

571
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,560
So you really can never it's
always a mistake to think that

572
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,420
any level of proficiency in one
set of skills is a reliable

573
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,260
barometer of the measure of the
soul that you're dealing with.

574
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,340
Somebody can look like a
beginner when they're not a

575
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,400
beginner at soul level, they're
just a beginner in a particular

576
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:52,480
discipline. This is your first
time to learn whatever you look

577
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,580
like a beginner, but you may not
be a beginner. Sooner or later,

578
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,260
all of those skills, I think,
will be integrated into one

579
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,340
conscious presence. But the
whole system is we work in

580
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:12,120
stages. We're working in stages,
one minute at a time. Last

581
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,400
question before I'm going to
read you one more near death

582
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,920
episode, there was a question
here. Somebody had their hand

583
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,160
up. Yeah.

584
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,620
Unknown: It's part of our
development. I've noticed that

585
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,840
if you read books, I like to
read old books, like in the 40s

586
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,080
and 50s, and even before, about
what you're talking about. Now,

587
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,680
there's a book called The
unobstructed universe, and I

588
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,760
think it was done in the 40s or
50s, and it was so hard to

589
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,040
understand. I mean, I knew there
were like little glimmers,

590
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,020
really good stuff in there, but
it was so the person expressing

591
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,500
it, it was so hard. They had
such trouble expressing,

592
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,640
expressing it and writing and so
hard to understand. But now,

593
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,780
like the way you express things,
it's just like in those few

594
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,560
years. The ability to even
express it has gone by leaps and

595
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:04,860
bounds.

596
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:09,480
Chris Bache: Yeah, and I think
the more people understand a

597
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,580
particular idea, it actually the
collective psyche is also

598
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,760
understanding that idea. And
when enough people understand

599
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,380
the idea, then it makes it
easier for the next human being

600
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,760
to understand that idea. So it
gets easier and easier, and

601
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,820
people who do past lives
therapy, like when it removes

602
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,000
told me when they were first
doing hypnotic regression in

603
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,540
past life therapy, you had to
take people into very, very deep

604
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,660
stages of trance before you can
get to the level where they

605
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,860
could remember their previous
lives. But over the following

606
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,220
years and decades, they found
that they they didn't have to go

607
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,820
so deep. It was like it was
getting easier and easier to

608
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,020
access those memories. Now, from
Morphic field theory, you know,

609
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,700
from Rupert Sheldrake vision,
the more people acquire a

610
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,500
particular capacity, they not
only acquire it as an

611
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,040
individual, but the species is
acquiring it. So if remembering

612
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,000
our former lives is a capacity,
the first people who remember

613
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,120
their previous lives, they may
have to go very, very hard, but

614
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,960
very, very deep, but it gets
easier. The more people do it,

615
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,360
the easier it gets. So always,
we are always standing on the

616
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,680
shoulders of the men and women
who went before and we are then

617
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,920
becoming the shoulders that our
children and grandchildren will

618
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,800
stand on. Isn't it exciting
unity 200 years from now?

619
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,140
Unknown: But when you think
about it, they will be us.

620
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,040
Chris Bache: Yeah, let me read
you one more dear episode here,

621
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,760
these things are just so
beautiful.

622
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:07,080
This comes from heading toward
omega, and it's the experience

623
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:15,660
of a woman named Carl Parrish,
Hanna. Carl, and she, usual, I

624
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,360
skip the early part. She's
traveling to the university

625
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,740
Tolle of light. And then she
gets to, she gets to the

626
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:26,900
combination part. She says, by
my side, there was a being with

627
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,180
a magnificent presence. I could
not see an exact form, but

628
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:36,680
instead a radiation of light
that lit up everything about me

629
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,840
and spoke with the voice that
held the deepest tenderness one

630
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:46,000
can ever imagine as this loving
yet powerful being spoke to me.

631
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:53,200
I understood vast beings, much
beyond my ability to explain. I

632
00:47:53,200 --> 00:48:00,660
understood life and death, and
instantly any fear I had ended

633
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,720
there was a totality, a
completeness in the realization

634
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,020
that I could continue to
experience and that there was

635
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:15,060
absolutely no reason to continue
my frantic struggle to exist.

636
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,840
For what seemed to be endless
time, I experienced this

637
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,820
presence, this light, being
pure, powerful, all expansive,

638
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,720
was without a form. And it could
be said that great waves of

639
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:35,120
awareness flowed into me and
into my mind as I responded to

640
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,980
these revelations, I knew them
to be so. Of course, it didn't

641
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:45,280
matter if one lived or died, it
was all so clear. There was a

642
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,600
complete trust and greater
understanding of what these

643
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:55,720
words meant. It seemed whole
truths reveal themselves to me,

644
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,780
ways of thought, ideas greater
and purer than I have ever tried

645
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,560
to figure out came to me
thoughts clear and without

646
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,580
effort revealed themselves in
total wholeness, although not in

647
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:13,200
logical sequence. I of course,
being in that magnificent

648
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,900
presence, understood it all. I
realized that consciousness is

649
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,020
life we will live in and through
much, but this consciousness we

650
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,700
know that is behind our
personality will continue. I

651
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,780
knew that the purpose of life
does not depend on me. It has

652
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,340
its own purpose. I realized that
the flow of it will continue,

653
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:44,500
even as I will continue. New
serenity entered my being as

654
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,640
this occurred, an intensity of
feeling rushed through me, as if

655
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,360
that light that's as if the
light that surrounded that being

656
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:57,580
was bathing me, penetrating
every part of me as I absorb the

657
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:03,360
energy I sense what I can only
do. Scribe as bliss, that is

658
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,280
such a little word, but the
feeling was dynamic, rolling,

659
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:17,100
magnificent, expanding, ecstatic
bliss. It whirled through me,

660
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
around me, and entering my chest
flowed through me, and I was

661
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,080
immersed in love and awareness
for ineffable time.

662
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,740
Margaret Hiller: That's the kind
of thing we can read our

663
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,880
beloveds when they're in their
passing time. So what a gift

664
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,120
Chris Bache: to be afraid of
dying is to have everything

665
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,160
turned upside down. Dying, I
tell my kids all the time, it's

666
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:55,600
a great life, and at the end you
get to die. There are some

667
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,860
cultures that warm Earth because
birth is when the work begins.

668
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,900
Birth is when you begin the
class, the session. Dying is

669
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,880
returning home. Dying is
graduation. Dying is recess is

670
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,960
coming in joy. I usually don't
share

671
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,540
Unknown: this, and certainly
didn't 30 years ago, if

672
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,440
Audience 2: you would understand
them, but 30 years ago, I must

673
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,920
die, and I had the

674
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,640
Unknown: Near-Death Experience,
and

675
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,340
Audience 2: I went through those
stages of calm and everything,

676
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:40,840
and I went up to the to the
ceiling, looking down at my

677
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,680
body, which was in so much pain,
everybody working on me down

678
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,060
there, you know, and the calm
and the everything that was

679
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:54,100
there and the light was behind
me. I didn't get to go through

680
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,580
the light, and I remember, and I
felt bad about it ever since I

681
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:03,000
was so and I had two small
children, there's certainly a

682
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,040
reason for me to stay on this
earth. But what I was feeling at

683
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,540
that time was so wonderful, and
the light was behind me. I

684
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,260
wasn't going toward the light,
but it was pulling me, and all

685
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:21,140
of a sudden, bam, I was right
back in my body with all of that

686
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:28,640
pain and everything, I was so
angry ever since, because I

687
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:35,420
certainly came back with a whole
new concept and even energy

688
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,920
spiritual, you know. But still,
I remember being I was ready to

689
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,120
go.

690
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,280
Chris Bache: It was even with
children. There never

691
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,920
Audience 2: entered my mind when
I was there. Though it wasn't

692
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,220
like, oh, I have responsibility.
I need to go back. There was

693
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:57,580
nothing of that. It was like
complete serenity,

694
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,200
Unknown: complete bliss. And I
was going home, yeah, and then

695
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,040
all of a sudden,

696
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,020
Audience 2: body, I just, that's
first thing. I remember just

697
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,380
being because I had been in
shock, and I just remember being

698
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,460
Chris Bache: angry that I was
and that's and other people

699
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,200
would have shared that
experience, because people, when

700
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,440
they come back, sometimes
they're angry. They get angry

701
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,100
the doctors, why did you bring
me back? And it takes them a

702
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,600
long time, some time, to adjust
to life back on Earth, because

703
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,220
once you touch infinity. I mean,
really, he wants to be a young

704
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,060
stone. Yeah. Ah,

705
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,880
before you were born, you were
in that ecstatic space. You were

706
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,900
in ecstasy. You were in the
light. You were with the divine.

707
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:01,680
You were in your soul, all the
joy that pulls you so

708
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:08,280
instinctively, there you were
there, and then you made a

709
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,480
series of choices where you
voluntarily left it in order to

710
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,020
come here. And

711
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,880
Unknown: that's what made you
scrub.

712
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,860
Chris Bache: There must have
been some great purpose for you

713
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,780
to come here, to leave that to
leave that joy, there must be

714
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:32,180
great purpose that draws us to
here. And some, some mystics,

715
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,500
Juliana of Norwich. You know,
she's a 16th century, I think,

716
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,680
Catholic saint, wonderful woman.
She had a vision on her

717
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,260
deathbed, she had a Near-Death
Experience, and she spent the

718
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:49,180
rest of her life meditating on
this vision and and she unpacked

719
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,180
it in this book that eventually
called revelations of love,

720
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:59,020
divine love. And she says, she
says she rejected the concept of

721
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:02,400
original sin. She said, that's
just not true. God is not angry

722
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,520
of us, and we're not sinful,
we're not bad. She says, God

723
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:14,100
asks us to come, and God knew we
were going to it's like you send

724
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,700
out your beloved son on a
journey, or your daughter, and

725
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,300
they're going to they fall into
a ditch and they get stuck in

726
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,600
the bottom of the ditch and they
can't get out. And God knew we

727
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,540
were going to get stuck. We knew
we were going to forget. We knew

728
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:30,860
we were going to get stupid. The
malls were going to be our

729
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,880
favorite places to go.

730
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:43,840
But we love God so much. We went
where she asked us to go, and

731
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,160
when we when we die, we remember
why. When we die, we touch back

732
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:55,600
into the foundation, and we are
restored. We debrief, but then

733
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,900
sooner or later, it's time to
come into it again. It's time to

734
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,940
grow, because we're constantly
learning and expanding and

735
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,880
becoming more. And the reason
we're learning and expanding and

736
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,240
becoming more is because our
nature is God, and this is what

737
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,080
God is doing. This is part of
the fabric of existence.

738
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,680
Unknown: Yes, it's amazing to me
that we can have these I hadn't

739
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,000
Near-Death Experience years ago.
It did change my life. What's so

740
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,900
amazing to me is that we can
have these miraculous

741
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,340
experiences, and I've also had
experiences in meditation that

742
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,760
are very similar to some of
these. So you have these

743
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,340
miracles, and then two days
later you're pissed off in the

744
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:46,600
traffic jam. No wonder we forget
whole lifetime, then you can

745
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,380
have this miraculous
understanding and know that

746
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,860
there's nothing to be afraid of,
and then run up and lock your

747
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,360
doors. That's that stupid thing.

748
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,060
Chris Bache: Time and space it's
tricky, isn't it? I mean, it's

749
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:08,580
really, it's so dense here, it's
incredibly dense. And it kind of

750
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,300
the bail comes down, and we feel
like we're, you know, we're

751
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:18,240
trapped again. We're involved in
things. And a weight lifter

752
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,740
becomes strong by putting more
weight on the bar. The weight

753
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,140
lifter doesn't complain about
the weight in the bar because

754
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,680
the weight allows them develop
the muscles. Time and space is

755
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,000
the weight on the bar. It's
allowing us to develop muscles

756
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,900
faster than we would develop if
we stayed in heaven. So, but

757
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,920
it's hard. It's hard being here.
It's tricky being here. There's

758
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:43,000
more ways, kind of we feel like
there's more ways to go wrong

759
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,600
than the article right? It's
challenging to go here. Thank

760
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,740
God for unity. Thank God there's
a place where people can go and

761
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:55,060
put these pieces together and
and find their way back to this

762
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,800
deep sanity, which allows them
to live not only with a measure

763
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:05,280
of dignity but your enthusiasm
to actually consciously embrace

764
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,340
the challenge of being human,
instead of feeling like you're

765
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,560
being punished, or you're
exiled, or this all this

766
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,160
nonsense, we're exiled from
paradise. No, I mean, you can

767
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,300
understand where that came from,
but no, that's just not right. I

768
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,860
mean, you know, God is right
here. God wouldn't send us here.

769
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,920
The Goddess wouldn't send us
here without giving us all means

770
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:30,920
available to make it work. Now
it's time to take a break for

771
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,160
lunch before we go

772
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,200
Margaret Hiller: down, before we
go downstairs for this

773
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,620
incredible lunch that Miss
Charlene has put together for

774
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:49,900
us. Some of you are clamoring
for us to receive the donation,

775
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,580
and if you're making.

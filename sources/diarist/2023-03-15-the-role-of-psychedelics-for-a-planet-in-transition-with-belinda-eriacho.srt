00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,100
episode of spirit plant medicine
presents. My name is Mark Karan.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,880
I'm happy to share that today
we're having a great

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,020
conversation with a great group
of guests in regards to Steven

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,900
Gray's new book, how
psychedelics can help save the

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,740
world, and today, we're going to
answer the question, you know,

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,780
what is the role of psychedelics
for a planet in transition? So

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,720
our first guest I'll introduce
is my friend and cohort in the

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,340
spirit plant medicine space, Mr.
Steven gray. Steven has been

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,240
traveling a spiritual and
medicine path for over 50 years

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,260
now he's a writer, educator,
conference organizer, speaker,

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:00,840
and he's also a facilitator for
cannabis ceremonies. Now, Steven

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,980
is the author of three books,
including the popular cannabis

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,100
and spirituality, an Explorer's
guide to the ancient plant

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,180
spirit allies. And just
recently, as I just already

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,840
mentioned, how psychedelics can
help save the world, visionary

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,560
and indigenous voices speak out.
Steven always a pleasure to see

41
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,940
read. If you haven't read it, go

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,060
fantastic. Welcome Chris. How
are you?

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,760
Unknown: I'm great. Welcome
everybody. It's a real honor to

44
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,140
be here with you today.

45
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,460
Marc Caron: Yeah, likewise, it's
always a pleasure to connect and

46
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,940
learn from you folks, because
for me, you know, this work is

47
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,920
really been a passion of
learning, and the things that

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,400
I've gleaned from all the talks
over the conferences of the

49
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,280
years has really made a
difference in my life, and it's

50
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,560
really exciting to be able to
share that with people around

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,560
the world. So thank you for
taking the time out of your day

52
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,220
to join us here, and we're going
to get started, and I'm going to

53
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,800
start with Steve, and basically
what we're going to do today is

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,940
we're I'm going to ask a
question of our panel, and

55
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,660
they're all each going to answer
for about five minutes or so,

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,620
the answer to this one specific
question. And because we're

57
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,900
focusing on the book How
psychedelics can help save the

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,380
world, I'm going to start with
Steven Gray, because he was the

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,260
guy who put this work together.
And we're going to start there.

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,020
So if we're ready, gang, let's
roll the question is, in your

61
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,360
view, Mr. Steven Gray, what is
the role of psychedelics for a

62
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,980
planet in transition?

63
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,439
Stephen Gray: Oh, thanks, Mark.
Thanks for the intro and the

64
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,439
lead in. And just a quick
clarification, by the way,

65
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:25,939
although you implied it in your
latest little statement there, I

66
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:29,599
am merely the editor and one of
the contributors to both the

67
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:33,619
previous cannabis book and this
one. And in this case, there are

68
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:38,959
25 contributors. So I'll, I just
wrote the intro and the outro,

69
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,639
as it were, and a couple of
other short things. So that's my

70
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,439
role. Just wanted to clarify
that, and the rest of it was cat

71
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:55,419
herding for the other 25 people
involved. But I'm delighted with

72
00:04:55,659 --> 00:05:00,299
with the results. They're all
remarkable people. And. Are all

73
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:05,219
speaking in different ways, but
I would say in accord. I don't

74
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:09,119
think there would be anything in
the book that would provoke any

75
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:12,899
one of those contributors to
disagree with any of the other

76
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,359
contributors. So obviously
that's a big question. And I

77
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,639
actually think that I'm actually
more interested in what Chris

78
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,159
and Belinda have to say about it
than what I have to say about

79
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:29,779
it, to be honest. But so what
could I say about that issue?

80
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:33,799
Well, okay, I know I have an
answer for you, but go ahead,

81
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,039
Mark,

82
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,319
Marc Caron: yeah, what I was
going to say is maybe you can

83
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:43,299
let us know what inspired you to
put this particular book

84
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:47,859
together, and what that
inspiration was for you based

85
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,539
on, right?

86
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,580
Stephen Gray: Okay, well, I'm
going to take that question and

87
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,220
run down the field, maybe the
opposite direction, but we'll

88
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,720
see. Excuse me, so yeah. Well,
the inspiration is the potential

89
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,260
of psychedelics, which is
answering your question anyway,

90
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:07,740
I hope. And so here's one way of
talking about it, the role of

91
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,880
psychedelics for a planet in
transition. They are not silver

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,680
bullets or magic bullets. They
are fraught with the potential

93
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,180
for misuse, misappropriation,
misunderstanding, and in some

94
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,000
cases harm. They're not for
everybody. And in fact, Jamie

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,280
wheel, who's spoken at our
conference twice, had an

96
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,000
interesting kind of template
that he suggested. He said,

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,560
don't take it too literally. But
perhaps it might be like this.

98
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,840
Out of the if you take a graph
of 100% of the demographic of

99
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,980
the people, perhaps there's 10%
people, 10% of those people at

100
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,700
one end of the continuum should
never take psychedelics for a

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,000
variety of reasons, you know,
mental health, fragility, etc.

102
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,040
And then there are 10% of the
other end who are the dedicated,

103
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,100
serious Psychonauts and
explorers who are constantly

104
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,140
learning from the medicines. And
so those people might be taking

105
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,500
the medicines frequently over,
you know, accumulated number of

106
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,240
years. And then there are 80% in
the middle who, in Jamie's view,

107
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,120
perhaps should only be taking
the psychedelics for very

108
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
special occasions, perhaps three
or four times in their lives,

109
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,640
you know, for like a graduation,
a wedding, the birth of a first

110
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,940
child, something like that. So
that's just one way of looking

111
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,720
at, you know, who might benefit
or not from the psychedelic.

112
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,900
Having said that, my other sort
of favorite way to talk about

113
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,960
these, or put them into the
context of our current

114
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,160
situation, is that, you know,
there's an there's an obvious

115
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,120
notion that, using the more sort
of a medical metaphor, that when

116
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,500
the patient is in an advanced
state of illness, strong

117
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,960
medicines are required. So as
obviously all through, all four

118
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,840
of us here understand quite
clearly we are in a dire

119
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,060
condition on the planet, and as
Chris Bache has made so clear in

120
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,540
his books and talks and
different things like that, we

121
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,780
are heading into sorry to steal
your thunder here, Chris, but a

122
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,220
Death-Rebirth cycle, which is
most likely to become

123
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,800
increasingly more difficult on
the material level over the next

124
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,440
decades. We don't know how long
so things are. We're in a

125
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,940
crucial moment. We're in a
crucial Nexus moment. And so

126
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,060
what we need, as I understand
it, is we need tools that can

127
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,660
almost, in a sense, shock the
monkey or wake us up, do a lot

128
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,400
of healing work, and, you know,
awakening work. So in that

129
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,520
regard, the way that I like to
think of the psychedelics is as

130
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,240
reality medicines. They're not
about escaping into some

131
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,700
alternative reality,
particularly, although that's a

132
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,540
fraught thing to say, I suppose.
But ultimately, what they're

133
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,920
capable of when they're done in
the most skillful, intentional

134
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,180
circumstances, I think, is they
can open us up into

135
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,240
understandings which are real,
you know, about our who we are,

136
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,640
the nature of things. And that
includes, well, another way that

137
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,600
I like to talk about them as
well is I think of psychedelics

138
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,960
as having sort of two interwoven
capabilities. One is that they

139
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,560
are truth serums potentially so
they can show us things about

140
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,680
our ourselves, so that we can
see where we are blocked, where

141
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,060
the obstacles are, we can see
sometimes into our past and the

142
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,840
places we've got stuck or turned
away from ourselves, as gambor

143
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,940
mate might say. And then the
other side of that. It's part of

144
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,840
the same function, of course,
and as I say, interwoven is that

145
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,080
they can and. Am ideally open us
up to what my old Buddhist

146
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,580
teacher, chug GM Trungpa would
call unconditioned reality, the

147
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,400
awakened state to some degree or
another. And as people that take

148
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,260
psychedelics often say it these
states often feel more real than

149
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,600
the ones that most people live
through most of the time, so I

150
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
think I'll stop there.

151
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,440
Marc Caron: Well, thank you,
Steven. So before we get into

152
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,100
any kind of conversation, I'm
going to pass it to Belinda to

153
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,820
from her perspective and her
worldview, to answer really the

154
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,680
same question, you know, what
is, do you feel is the role of

155
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,260
psychedelics for our planet in
transition?

156
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,560
Belinda Eriacho: Thank you,
Mark. Before I get started, I do

157
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,520
want to do a land
acknowledgement to the people of

158
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,120
the Phoenix area, which are the
out on the P posh before

159
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,600
McDowell, you have a pie nation
and the auction people who live

160
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,980
in this place that they refer to
as Earth Doctor, I'm here as an

161
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,340
invited guest in these unceded
territories, and I share a

162
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,120
common history with them, and I
wanted to acknowledge them in

163
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,780
that way before I answer that
question. That's a That's a

164
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,420
loaded question mark. I you
know, in my chapter, chapter

165
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,160
five, that talks about turning
of the soil, I use that as a as

166
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,540
a metaphor for what is unfolding
in this time that we are in

167
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,460
right now. And to me, the way
that I look at psychedelics, I

168
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,240
view them more as sacred
medicines, not necessarily

169
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,500
psychedelics or ethnogens or
drugs, as as many people refer

170
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,560
to them. And I think that really
puts in perspective itself the

171
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,340
language that we use when we
refer to these sacred medicines.

172
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,120
You know, everything that we do,
we create energy, or we

173
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,320
transform energy, and it's
really important that we clearly

174
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,440
understand them and respect
them, as my friend Steven had

175
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,280
indicated. But I think also,
psychedelics is really an

176
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,300
opportunity to awaken to
ourselves. I was reading some

177
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,780
literature the other day about
the intellect, the intellectual

178
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,380
quotient and the spiritual
quotient, just, you know, on a

179
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,720
global level for humanity and
kind of where we are, and it

180
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,540
seems that we've outgrown our
intellectual selves, and now the

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,380
spiritual peace, the spiritual
aspect of ourselves, is starting

182
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,300
to unfold. And when my metaphor
that I talk about the turning of

183
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,800
the soil, what I believe is
happening with the psychedelics,

184
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,960
it's essentially turning
ourselves inside out. You know,

185
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,040
we're so used to being out in a
material world from a Western

186
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,640
perspective that we've forgotten
how to even be with ourselves.

187
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,100
And so by unfolding and taking
these different medicines, it

188
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,160
allows us to to go into these
places that we can eventually

189
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,000
heal ourselves and then resonate
that out into our families and

190
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,740
our communities. I also believe
that psychedelic medicines or

191
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,180
sacred medicines meet different
aspects in our lives. You know,

192
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,900
my culture, we talk about the
cycles of life. When we are born

193
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,480
into this physicalness, we come
in, in a spirit, physical form,

194
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,380
and it is not until we make our
first laugh that we embody the

195
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,860
physicalness as human beings.
And then we go through

196
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,760
adolescence, adulthood, elderly,
hood, and then we return back to

197
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,740
source. And I think through
those experiences, we go through

198
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,780
a path that I refer to as
horizon, which means the balance

199
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,340
of harmony in our lives. Now,
that doesn't necessarily mean

200
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,300
that everything is nice and
rosy, you know. Life is life,

201
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,720
you know, and sometimes those
difficult experiences that we go

202
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,320
through allow us to unfold and
to see things in a different

203
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,300
perspective, but also give us
some life lessons that we need

204
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,520
to learn. And so with that, I
think one of the things is that

205
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,120
in my book, I also make
reference to the prophecies of

206
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,740
the eagle on Condor, and I give
two examples. One is from the

207
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,680
Hopi people, which are located
here in Arizona, as well as the

208
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,940
Andean traditions, and that the
North, people of the north are

209
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,820
the people of the mind, and the
people of the South are the

210
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,640
people of the heart. And when we
can come together as one unified

211
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,600
community, then we can start to
heal the history that we all

212
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,940
share. And so I think
psychedelics allows us to to get

213
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,600
to that point, but also come to
a lot of other realizations

214
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,640
about our interconnectedness
with one another. You know the

215
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,500
importance of ceremony and
intention that come along with

216
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,920
with these sacred plant
medicines. But also there.

217
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,920
Realization of going to a much
deeper level in our healing

218
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,400
evolution, if you will. You
know, I think a lot of times

219
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,300
when we have an illness, we rely
on Western medicine for that

220
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,900
healing aspect, rather than
going to that next level deeper

221
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,040
within and so those are just
some of my thoughts in the way

222
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,480
that I view psychedelics and how
it can save the world.

223
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,520
Beautiful.

224
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,100
Marc Caron: Well, thank you so
much for sharing that. And I

225
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,400
just wanted to let people know
that if you want to catch

226
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,160
Belinda's talk from our spirit
plant medicine conference in

227
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,960
2022 which is titled turning of
the soil, that's available on

228
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,340
our YouTube channel, and it's
also available for free in our

229
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,000
membership portal as well at
Spirit plant medicine com. I

230
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,820
highly recommend going and
taking that in, because it was

231
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,220
just a fantastic presentation.
And as we move forward, we're

232
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,900
going to go to Mr. Chris Bache.
Chris again, the question is, in

233
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,940
your view, what do you feel is
the role of psychedelics for our

234
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,560
planet in transition?

235
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,780
Unknown: Well, first mark, I
want to affirm everything that

236
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,740
Steven and Belinda have said.
One of the advantages of going

237
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,660
last in the batting order is I
get to play off of what has

238
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,740
already been said. And I
certainly, absolutely agree with

239
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,960
it. It seems that we are living
in a different time in history,

240
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,920
as particularly Belinda has
pointed to. We are living in a

241
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,620
time when the underlying
structure of the collective

242
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,760
psyche is shifting. We are
shifting culturally. There are

243
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,640
so many cultural migrations and
integrations taking place, but

244
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,260
kind of at a deeper at a deep
level, the very nature of the

245
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,960
collective psyche seems to be
simmering, turning to the point

246
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,040
of boiling. One of the ways I
understand this is that we have

247
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,400
entered a time when the karma of
our many, many former lives, all

248
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,720
of us collectively, is coming
forward and pressing up inside

249
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,040
us, seeking resolution. I think
there's a tremendous collective

250
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,480
purification taking place in the
outer world and also in the

251
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,180
inner world. So one of the uses
of psychedelics that can be very

252
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,440
helpful is to helping, is to
help accelerate and deepen and

253
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,960
clarify this internal
purification process. I think

254
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,080
that's why so many people are
involved in other spiritual

255
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,280
practices besides psychedelic
practice of yoga and meditation,

256
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,200
so many different activities,
because we need to keep the

257
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,880
psyche open and clear, to let
this, this negative conditioning

258
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,020
come through us without, without
re traumatizing ourselves, to

259
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,520
help our system clear itself and
cleanse itself. And psychedelics

260
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,380
when used conscientiously in
ritual context and in

261
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,360
therapeutic context can deepen
and accelerate this healing

262
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:13,080
process. And I think one of the
fundamental problems that we

263
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,060
have been living with is our
separation from nature and our

264
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,500
separation from our spiritual
nature, so that the surface of

265
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,360
our nature is not as naturally
in tune with our deeper nature

266
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,160
as maybe it had been in earlier
times, simpler times. So one of

267
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,160
part of healing the psyche is
also sort of healing the soul at

268
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,140
a deeper level than just kind of
personal, therapeutic healing,

269
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,760
helping the soul enter into
deeper communion with its own

270
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,380
deep history, and with the deep
history of the planet, and with

271
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,760
the deep history of the
intelligence that has been

272
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,500
orchestrating reality in
manifesting reality For 13 point

273
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,260
7 billion years. So that in
addition are taking the healing

274
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,700
process deeper than just
personal healing, even deeper

275
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,460
than collective healing, it's
can be a process of reconnecting

276
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,260
with that core intelligence that
is manifesting life, manifesting

277
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:25,820
nature, and manifesting history
and learning from it, developing

278
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,260
a deeper understanding from life
itself, what is happening, what

279
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,340
is taking place. Why is this
century different from earlier

280
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,720
centuries? What is the
trajectory of our evolutionary

281
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,340
project? Excuse me, in this
century, so healing,

282
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:51,700
facilitating a kind of cultural
renaissance, but then also

283
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,440
facilitating a deeper psycho
spiritual Renaissance, so that

284
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,860
we can reconnect with this core
sense. Deeper understanding of

285
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,420
what's actually taking place in
history. So those are the those

286
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,480
are the points that I would just
add to what's already been said.

287
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,940
Marc Caron: That's fantastic,
and as we go through what

288
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,240
transition we're facing. But I
wanted to just take this moment

289
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,140
as we go into, you know, the
next question, so we can unpack

290
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,320
this a little bit more. Belinda,
you said something really, I

291
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,400
think, important and profound
that we all need to, you know,

292
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,820
take a look at and understand.
And this is mostly, you know,

293
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,340
kind of my perception, and
something that I've been picking

294
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,860
up because you talked about the
language and how we talk about

295
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,880
psychedelics, Entheogen drugs,
plant medicines and things. And,

296
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,040
you know, I've had the
opportunity to speak to a lot of

297
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,580
people in terms of interviews,
and, you know, media and things,

298
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,720
and everybody talks about them
as drugs. And I just want to

299
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,620
share my thought on this,
because when we take a look at a

300
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,840
natural plant and a plant
medicine, whether it's cannabis,

301
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,520
the mushroom, Ayahuasca, and
things of that nature. You know,

302
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,480
in my opinion, they're not
drugs. They're they're plants,

303
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,100
and plants as medicine. And when
we take a look at, you know,

304
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,360
other plants that we consume on
a regular basis, we don't call

305
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,560
them drugs. Broccoli, we don't
call a drug celery, we don't

306
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,500
call a drug, you know, all those
power foods and power greens, we

307
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,060
don't call a drug, yet, they
have different plant properties.

308
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,700
And when we look at, you know,
the psychedelic nature of

309
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,000
plants, you know, they have
different plant properties. And

310
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,240
that's why I think it's really
important that we don't classify

311
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,720
them in that stigma of being a
drug, and that we use all plants

312
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,320
as medicine. And it's just my
two cents on that, because it

313
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,040
comes up a lot where people will
call them drugs, and in my

314
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,380
opinion, they're really plants,
right? And many of them have

315
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,320
their own medicine, whether it's
a vegetable or something with

316
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,860
psychedelic psyche collective
properties. So

317
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,440
Belinda Eriacho: I think there's
one thing that's missing from

318
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,920
that mark. And, you know, I,
too, have been talking with many

319
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,860
people, and I think one of the
things that seems to be missing

320
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,480
is the relationship between us
and the plants and the plant

321
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,380
kingdom. You know, from my
culture, I refer to Ayahuasca as

322
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,680
grandmother, translates to
grandmother Ayahuasca. These

323
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,920
are, these are ancient teachers
that really have something to

324
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,940
pass on to us if we're willing
to listen and to open up to

325
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,280
those, you know, gems of wisdom.
The same thing goes with the

326
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,680
Mushroom Kingdom. You know,
they're not called Santa nio for

327
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,940
no reason at all. You know, the
holy children, you know. And so

328
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,600
I think it really is important
that for those of us that use

329
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,320
psychedelics, whether it's in
our healing or as therapeutic

330
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,060
modalities, is you really need
to come to that inner standing,

331
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,860
not understanding we're not
putting ourselves over these

332
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,860
plants. We're really
internalizing that and really

333
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,680
making that, building that
relationship with them. And I

334
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,000
think it's really important as
this, you know, this whole field

335
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,600
starts to develop. So thank you,
Mark,

336
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Marc Caron: yeah, absolutely.
And I love that word inner

337
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,160
standing. I hope to use that in
the future, if you

338
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,000
Stephen Gray: don't mind,
awesome, not copyrighted. Yeah,

339
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,240
Marc Caron: fantastic, but it's
just it makes sense, and inner

340
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,780
standing is very different than
an intellectual understanding,

341
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,700
right? So, yeah, beautifully
said. So now the question is,

342
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,880
what is the transition you think
that we're facing? You know,

343
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,940
there's a lot of change in the
world right now. We're seeing it

344
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,660
every day. Steven, what do you
think is, you know, the biggest

345
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,120
part of this transition that
we're facing, what is it?

346
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,360
Stephen Gray: Well, hmm, yeah.
Well, again, not to belittle my

347
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,440
own intelligence, but I think
Chris Bache has been tapping

348
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,540
into what I think, if I may say
so Chris, I think it's more or

349
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,500
less the correct terminology
that vast intelligences of the

350
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,900
universe that have been saying
that, as Chris has said before,

351
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,080
numerous times, you know, we've
reached this kind of nexus

352
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,580
point. And so I think it's just
really important now, okay, so

353
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,520
yeah, here's, here's a good way
to talk about that, I think, as

354
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,260
if we think it will and is seems
to be, apparently underway

355
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:41,920
already, the stability of the
past or the status quo, such as

356
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,640
it is or was, is becoming less
viable, less comfortable on the

357
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
material level, and just in
general, you know, change is

358
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,740
happening very, very quickly on
multiple levels, as that

359
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,220
happens, and especially if.
Things become, well, either

360
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,440
rapidly or not quite so rapidly,
more difficult for many people

361
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,280
on the material level, like if
there become shortages of food

362
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,100
or clean water, if international
agreements break down, if the

363
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,700
climate makes makes us put like
a much greater percentage of our

364
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:29,120
financial resources into climate
change mitigation and on and on.

365
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,800
If those things all make our
lives more difficult and less

366
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:39,380
stable and less certain, I guess
you could say what I think is

367
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,180
likely to happen, and, I mean, I
don't. I'm not an authority any

368
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,060
more than anyone else, but it
seems to me that it's a lot of

369
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,540
it's already happening in terms
of its effect on the psychology

370
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,660
or the mentality of people. You
know, you keep hearing in the

371
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,560
news about how there's more
depression these days, there's

372
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,980
more anxiety. So I think what's
likely to happen if this

373
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,640
trajectory unfolds the way we
envision it, way we think it

374
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,680
will, or perhaps the way the
spirits are telling some people

375
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,420
that it is likely to there will
be more of those, you know,

376
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:22,460
problematic mind states and more
discouragement. So I think it's

377
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,700
really important. And this is
saying this partly because

378
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,180
that's the mission of the book,
is to hopefully give people, as

379
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,520
Dwayne Elgin, one of the
contributors to the book, says,

380
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:40,540
a believable story, a story
that's if I had it in front of

381
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,360
me. Actually, I could find it in
a minute, but none. I don't want

382
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,780
to make you wait. In his chapter
in the book, he lays out, sort

383
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,020
of, if the story is going to be
functional for people, it has to

384
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,600
have four elements, and I don't
remember what they all are now,

385
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,020
but one is that it has to be
simple, easy to understand,

386
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,320
functional, able to be, you
know, put into place,

387
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:06,120
manifested, plausible, etc. And
so Dwayne, Dwayne has a really

388
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,480
interesting view of this. From
my point of view. He he talks

389
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,440
about how, in his book choosing
earth, he actually, he actually

390
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,760
goes through a possible, or even
probable scenario for the next

391
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,160
six, seven decades. And this is
super loose, and I haven't even

392
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,240
read it for a while, so it's
something vaguely like this. It

393
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,540
looks like material conditions
are likely to continue to

394
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,680
deteriorate over the next
several decades. But this is

395
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,540
really key, if enough people get
smart or however you want to say

396
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,720
that, you know, wake up, do the
healing work that they need to

397
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,120
do we need to do so that we can
participate in intelligent,

398
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,220
creative solutions at multiple
levels, you know, whatever level

399
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,320
that is, through the arts,
through government, through

400
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,800
economics, whatever
environmental work, etc, etc.

401
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,360
But starting with that inner
understanding, or that inner

402
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,140
standing that Belinda and now
you are talking about Mark, then

403
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,920
there is the hope of, as Dwayne
calls it, the birth, or the

404
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,660
arising, of a mature planetary
civilization. So and Chris

405
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,420
again, if I you don't mind my
stealing your thunder. Chris has

406
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,740
said that he wasn't given any
timeline on this. Dwayne lays it

407
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,620
out over the next six or seven
decades as a possibility. But so

408
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,160
what I'm really trying to say,
in a somewhat rambly way here,

409
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:43,300
is that I feel strongly that
people need to hear messages

410
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:51,040
that things, if things look bad,
it doesn't just mean we're

411
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,540
heading toward doom and
destruction. It means, and this

412
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,060
is really a gross
oversimplification, no doubt,

413
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,820
but for the short term, for this
situation here it, it's, it's

414
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,480
connected to the things like the
prophecy of the eagle and the

415
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Condor that Belinda was talking
about, or, or, you know, the the

416
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,000
hundreds of 1000s of years
accumulated karma that Chris is

417
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,740
talking about coming to a head.
Now, it's related to that. It's

418
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,060
all about that notion that we've
come to this point, and if we,

419
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,040
if we don't have something that
shows us a potential for the

420
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,000
light to come through, it's
going to be much, much harder on

421
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,760
people's psyches, you know? So I
think that is, I mean, maybe I'm

422
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,800
an idealist, you know? I'm a
dreamer, I'm a visioner in that

423
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,080
sense, I think we've been given
this I don't just think it. I

424
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,940
sense that we've been given this
absolutely incredible gift of

425
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:58,840
life on this planet to wake up
to our true, interwoven,

426
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,756
embedded. Interrelationship and
connection to everything and to

427
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:07,776
appreciate it and to love it and
to create within it. You know,

428
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:11,076
in this short time that each of
us has on the planet, you know,

429
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,376
my old Buddhist teacher,
Trungpa, you know, talked about

430
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:17,796
learning to appreciate the
redness of red and the blueness

431
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:22,340
of blue. You know, just that
really simple, like, in a sense,

432
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,660
surrendering or open, opening
oneself into things as they are,

433
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:33,380
and relaxing into that, right?
So we just need, I think, more

434
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,760
and more clear, plausible,
actionable information and

435
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,840
messages that there is this
potential for the birth of

436
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,180
individual and collective
awakening. So I guess that's one

437
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,380
way of talking about, you know,
whatever this transition is that

438
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,620
is no longer sustainable to keep
being in the state of spiritual

439
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,520
disconnection.

440
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,600
Marc Caron: I completely
understand and agree with what

441
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,940
you're saying there, because
there's, you know, so much going

442
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,060
on in the world right now that
you know we need these tools

443
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,380
more than ever. So Belinda, I'm
really curious about your take

444
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,180
of what you see from your role
in the world as an indigenous

445
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:21,440
woman, and what you see as being
the biggest transition that we

446
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,440
are facing as you know, global
humanity,

447
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,100
Belinda Eriacho: right? Thank
you so much for that question. I

448
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,200
was looking at rereading Chris's
chapter and then some of the

449
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,580
things that Steven had talked
about, but I look at things in a

450
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,320
different way, because I think
what's happening to us and many

451
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,700
indigenous cultures around the
globe. Our elders have told us

452
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,640
that these are just cycles that
we're going through. Everything

453
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,560
is evolving to that, and that's
the way that I look at things.

454
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,820
And so these things that may
appear as challenges to us can

455
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,500
really turn out to be gifts in
the end, and it's really up to

456
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,140
us, as, you know, as a human
species, to really think, not so

457
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,100
much be in our mind, but think
with our hearts. And I think

458
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,300
there's been already too much
thinking up here. That's why

459
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,660
we're in a situation that we are
in right now, and where we

460
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,920
really need to start moving into
is into the the mind of the

461
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,180
heart. And, you know, in my
book, I share a little story

462
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,420
about an elder that told us the
longest journey that we will

463
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,840
ever travel is between our mind
and our heart. And that's only

464
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,120
18 inches away, you know. And so
I think that that's kind of some

465
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,280
of the things that are coming up
for me, you know, I'm reminded

466
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,240
of many stories that even my my
grandparents and great

467
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,420
grandparents shared, and that
were passed down through our

468
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,980
oral traditions about how things
evolve and the way that we look

469
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,740
at and perceive things is really
what we create. And so, you

470
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,180
know, I think one of the things
that I see for myself is that

471
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,260
the children that are being born
in this time, they're very I

472
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,100
think, you know, I think Chris
calls them. Tolle calls it the

473
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,420
diamond. In his book makes
reference to a diamond. And I, I

474
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,980
think of these children as very
wise souls that are coming in

475
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,040
right now, they already have
this knowing that is within them

476
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,760
to carry on a lot of these
teachings and cultures and

477
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,480
traditions that we all have
forgotten about because we've

478
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,040
kind of been too focused on the
materialistic aspects of our

479
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,480
lives, and we've forgotten
everything else. And so I think,

480
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,300
you know, I'm a little bit more
optimistic that it's just an

481
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,840
evolution and a change and a
shift that we are going through

482
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,820
as a as humanity, there will
definitely be those that will, I

483
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,980
think, falter off on another
path. I think one of the things

484
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,020
I'm also reminded of in part of
the chapter that Chris writes

485
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,560
that reminds me of, is that
there are these different things

486
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,040
that are evolving, and
psychedelics, the sacred plant

487
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,660
medicines, allows us to go into
these places that are different

488
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:18,480
timelines than this physical
timeline that we are in. And we

489
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,100
all have our own interpretation
of what that is? You know, I

490
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,600
mean, I've seen the future. I've
seen the the instruments for

491
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,040
healing that have been shared by
our star relatives. You know, in

492
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,780
our my cultures, they said that
we are the star beings. We are

493
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,140
from the stars. Our ancestors
are from the stars. And we were

494
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,840
remembering those things. But
I've also seen the ancient ruins

495
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,680
and the dwellings crafted on
side of the walls. And many of

496
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,660
my my journeys, you know, and
being able to travel into time,

497
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,040
time frames, it's very hard to
describe these timelines that

498
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,740
you're able to to tap into to
have those. Connections with,

499
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,460
you know, deceased relatives,
and really, you know, heal those

500
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,820
relationships that we have with
one another so that we can

501
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,780
continue to evolve. I think some
of that is related to some of

502
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,020
the things that Chris talks
about, is about this evolution

503
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,980
of karma. And so one of the
things that I think that, and I

504
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,500
My prayer is that as each one of
us sees what's happening and

505
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,760
unfolding around us in the
world, whether it's geopolitical

506
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,480
or climate related, really start
to begin to ask ourselves, you

507
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,660
know, what part of that do I
own? I think there's always this

508
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,800
tendency to say that somebody
else's issue, but we all have,

509
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,660
if we really, truly believe that
we are interrelated with one

510
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,560
another, then we need to take
ownership of that. That's really

511
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,980
where the real action happens.
So thank you for that question.

512
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,700
Marc Caron: Absolutely my
pleasure. And you know, I think

513
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,420
it's I love what you said, and
I've heard it before, that the

514
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,340
longest journey we'll ever take
is the one from our head to our

515
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,960
heart. And I repeat that back,
because I think it's really

516
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,440
important, and I want everyone
to, you know, really think about

517
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,400
that for a moment and really
recognize, like, are you living

518
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,640
from up here? It's another quote
that I have in my world. It's

519
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,920
like, when you're in your head,
you're dead, when you're in your

520
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,600
heart, you're smart, you know.
And it's just one of those

521
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,800
things that when you drop into
your heart all of a sudden,

522
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,920
answers come, you know, undammed
and flow really well. So thank

523
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,040
you

524
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,440
Belinda Eriacho: for I might
borrow that mark, by the way,

525
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,940
hey, by all means,

526
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,920
Stephen Gray: yeah, absolutely.
Lots of trading going on. Here.

527
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,060
There you go. There you go.
Well,

528
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,640
Marc Caron: this, this is one of
the ways that psychedelics are

529
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,640
helping change the world, right?
We learn, we support, we get

530
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,220
inspired by each other, and then
we can go share what we're

531
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,060
doing, and all based on the
topic of psychedelics. Anyways,

532
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,680
Chris, again, that would be our
question for you. You know, what

533
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,640
is the transition you see that
we are facing as a society

534
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,060
today?

535
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,860
Unknown: Well, I only have
limited visionary, shamanic kind

536
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,940
of experience of the future.
When I want to turn to

537
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,860
specifics, I have to go to the
same sources that we all do, I

538
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,520
have to go to the scientist. I
have to go to the ecologist. I

539
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,460
was very glad, Steven that you
mentioned the work of Dwayne

540
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,040
Elgin, because he's been
crunching the numbers for

541
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,880
decades. He's been really
tracking the scientific

542
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,020
literature, and it seems clear,
if we do that, we are entering a

543
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:47,260
period of enormous suffering. It
is hard to overestimate how much

544
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,100
suffering is coming in the
decades ahead, between now and

545
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:56,860
say, just say, 50 years from
now, 2070 2075 when we look at

546
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,600
the melting of the ice caps,
when we look at the expanding

547
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,440
population when we look at
climate destabilization,

548
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:10,500
destabilization of agriculture,
likelihood of more pandemics, I

549
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,680
mean, realistically, we could be
looking at the death of 1/3 to

550
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,780
one half of the human population
of this Planet, if our carrying

551
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,560
capacity is somewhere around 2
billion and we're pushing 8

552
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:32,360
billion now, then the suffering
of so many of our children and

553
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,260
grandchildren around the world
dying is just going to be an

554
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:42,400
unspeakable agony that's going
to bring us to our knees and

555
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,460
give us a kind of intense
incentive, a motivation to do

556
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,080
things, to insist on changes
that right now we do not have

557
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:59,140
the political and social will to
do. Some do a few do, a growing

558
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,640
number of some do, but not
enough to make these shifts

559
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,540
happen. So I think we're coming
into a pain of terrible,

560
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,560
terrible suffering. I wish it
weren't. So I wish we could, we

561
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,040
could avoid it by having enough
people come to their senses

562
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,580
quickly enough. But I think
we're past the point in history

563
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,860
where we could avert this crisis
that it's coming, we might be

564
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,160
able to soften a touch, but it's
coming, and it's going to hit

565
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,800
us. It's going to hit our
children and our grandchildren,

566
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,440
our great grandchildren, very,
very hard. Now my visionary

567
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,420
experience is that this global
crisis that we are entering is a

568
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,700
birth process, that it is going
to be horrendously painful, but

569
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,480
it is not an apocalypse, in the
sense of a destruction of

570
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,380
everything that has come up to
this point in time. It is, it

571
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,180
is, in a sense, like a
Near-Death Experience, where we

572
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,980
come very close to death and in.
That process of coming close to

573
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,100
death, we break through into
different orders of

574
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,940
consciousness, I think Nate. And
this is not something human

575
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,300
beings are doing, or human
beings are in control of nature

576
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,720
is in control of this process.
Nature is driving this

577
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,260
evolutionary crisis. The this
intelligence behind nature is

578
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,940
driving this process. The best
we can do is be responsive in

579
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,580
communion with this
intelligence. Responsive with

580
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,900
this intelligence, and cooperate
with it in order to facilitate a

581
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,760
transition that it is not ours
to have designed, but nature has

582
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,400
designed this transition. Now,
the way I understand the long

583
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,020
scale of this is from within a
reincarnational perspective, and

584
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,520
from that perspective, the human
beings who are entering this

585
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,300
crisis are not human beings the
way we ordinarily think of them.

586
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,160
They're not 100 year old beings.
They're 10s of 1000s, hundreds

587
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,240
of 1000s of year old beings.
They have layers and layers and

588
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,560
layers of the history inside of
each one of us, and this history

589
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,560
comes from different cultures
and different places around the

590
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,220
world and different places in
society, different colors,

591
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,080
different religious traditions,
all these aspects of our global

592
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,780
complex picture are all woven
into the fiber of our being. We

593
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,700
have been growing for hundreds
of 1000s of years as souls

594
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,300
making some progress here, maybe
making some step backwards

595
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:38,180
there, but overall, we've been
growing, but collectively the

596
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:43,720
psychological level of our
collective maturation is still

597
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,620
basically egoic. It's still
rooted in our individual

598
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,700
consciousness. And the world
that is falling apart around our

599
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,860
ears is a world that was built
by ego and as and I don't just

600
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,992
disparage ego. Ego is beautiful.
I mean it, it's just, it's an

601
00:42:00,992 --> 00:42:05,192
extra, ordinarily beautiful
phenomenon, but it is still

602
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:09,452
fundamentally cut off from the
deeper fabric of life, from the

603
00:42:09,452 --> 00:42:12,272
deeper fabric of our
interconnectedness, from the

604
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:16,952
deeper fabric of our spiritual
connectedness. And basically

605
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:22,460
it's it because of its limited
awareness, it designs a world

606
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,200
which works for some and doesn't
work for others. It elevates the

607
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,680
condition of life for some at
the cost of disparaging the

608
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,720
quality of life of other beings.
And we can just we know how this

609
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,900
happens. We know how this works.
We know what's been happening.

610
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,120
And basically this is a world
that works for some and doesn't

611
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,960
work for others, and it's a
world the limitations of this

612
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,220
view are basically leading to a
global destruction, a global

613
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:56,200
catastrophe of unmitigated
suffering. I don't think we can

614
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,040
survive as a species living out
of the level of consciousness

615
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,780
that we have been living out of
up to this point in time. For

616
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,680
all its beauty, the ego is still
too small a consciousness to

617
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,820
basically solve the global
problems, to solve the social

618
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,200
problems that that are becoming
paramount right now. We either

619
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,380
need to, we will either grow up
or we're going to die, and that

620
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,940
makes this death process a
tremendously powerful

621
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,440
evolutionary accelerator. Now,
what growing up means, I think,

622
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,820
is shifting from an egoic
perspective to a soul

623
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,020
perspective. Basically, I think
we are in a time when all of our

624
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,520
former lives and all of this
history and all of this work

625
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,400
that each one of us has been
doing, and collectively we've

626
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,880
been doing. I think what's
happening is, just as the world

627
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,380
is coming together as one, our
psyches are coming together as

628
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,400
one, the prophecies that Belinda
refers to as East West culture,

629
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,620
north south culture, but the
psyche is coming together as

630
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,880
one. And when this, when we
reach critical mass, not only

631
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,460
will the world give birth to a
new culture, but the core of

632
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,460
this culture, I think, is that
it will be operating out of a

633
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,100
different level of
consciousness, out of a higher

634
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,920
level of consciousness. And I
think the most immediate way of

635
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,720
understanding this is out of
soul consciousness, and this is

636
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,740
what, in my visions, comes
through as the birth of the

637
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,720
diamond soul, which is simply
all of our history integrated

638
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,220
into a single consciousness,
which is transparent to each

639
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,920
other at a very deep level and
transparent to the Divine at a

640
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,760
very deep level. And once we
collectively make this

641
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,640
transition, it's not going to
work if only a few people here

642
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,180
or there make this transition.
Nature doesn't think small.

643
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,140
Nature only thinks in large,
large movements. The entire

644
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:00,720
species is being taken through
this transition. And. I don't

645
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,820
know how we're going to make
this transition. I don't know

646
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,060
whether it's going to come
slowly or fast, or how we're

647
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,840
going to do it, but the visions
which have been poured into me

648
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,580
in my years of psychedelic work
is that we do make this

649
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,740
transition. We do come out of
this crisis a different kind of

650
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,660
species, not only improved a
little bit around the edges, but

651
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:29,120
with a fundamental change taking
place at the very core of the

652
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,620
collective unconscious, so that
every human being born after

653
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,760
this transition takes place is
operating out of a different

654
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,260
foundation of consciousness, a
different more spiritually

655
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:45,640
informed form of consciousness.
And just as any mother, when she

656
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,100
goes into labor is in a day
filled with pain, but at the end

657
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,000
of the day, when she gives birth
to her child, that pain is worth

658
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,780
it, because of the beauty of the
child is being born. I think it

659
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,180
will be that way for us too. We
are giving birth to a new form

660
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,680
of humanity, a more enlightened
form, a more compassionate form,

661
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,060
a more spiritually awakened form
of humanity, historically

662
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,980
unprecedented. And as this
transition takes place, we will

663
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,380
look back at this century of
crisis, and we will say it was

664
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,820
worth it to give birth to
something so beautiful. It was

665
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,480
worth it.

666
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,820
Stephen Gray: Mark, can I add a
little icing on that cake?

667
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,600
Marc Caron: Absolutely you can.
Steven, thanks. Well,

668
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,640
Stephen Gray: that was
incredible, Chris, by the way,

669
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,320
mind blowing, really. And and I
just like to throw in one of my

670
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,920
favorite sayings, necessity is
the mother of invention. And I

671
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,460
think that the intelligence, I
don't think I'm sure the

672
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:58,420
intelligence capabilities of
humanity, often, as you've just

673
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:04,020
implied, I think Chris in
concert with each other are all

674
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:09,300
but limitless. And so from my
point of view, the optimistic

675
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,900
side of this, what you're
talking about, Chris, is a

676
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:18,780
potentially extremely difficult,
painful period of dissolution

677
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,840
before there's enough of a gap
for the new vision to come in is

678
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:30,800
going to be in some way tempered
by increasing intelligence. You

679
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,980
know that it's like life is
getting real on the planet, you

680
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:39,320
know. And as things get real,
our deeper capabilities start to

681
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,820
come out more and more. So I
think that's really important to

682
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,260
understand, frankly, and and
goes along with what I was

683
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:52,120
saying earlier about the need
for sort of plausible,

684
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,620
understandable, actionable
visions and and messages for

685
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,420
people so that people don't so
that as many people as possible

686
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,460
don't just fall into despair and
hopelessness as material

687
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,120
conditions deteriorate, if
that's what's going to happen.

688
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,560
So, yeah, I just wanted to add
that, you know, let us not

689
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,380
underestimate, and this is, I'm
not saying this in contradiction

690
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,660
to anything you've said, Chris,
but let us not underestimate the

691
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,520
almost unlimited potential for
creativity that is going to

692
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,860
become increasingly needed as
time goes on and will come out,

693
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,840
you know, as we move out of the
sort of the you know, Herman,

694
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,580
Hess last book, The Glass Bead
game, Magister Ludy takes place

695
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,960
About 500 years in the future,
and he refers back to, or those

696
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,520
people refer back to this time
as the age of feyoton. And I'm

697
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,580
not sure if I'm pronouncing it
correctly, but it means paper,

698
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,540
like it's like plastic or
insubstantial or something. So

699
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,720
there's a kind of a
frivolousness that dominates

700
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,340
those parts of the world that
can afford to be frivolous at

701
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,420
this time, which I think is
likely to crumble, and more and

702
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,120
more people are going to get
real. You know, I don't want to

703
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,660
ramble too long, but I just want
to say, as a music person

704
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:19,020
myself, music has been treated
in such shabby ways in recent

705
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,880
history, and I think it's going
to play an important role in the

706
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,620
future, as it as this reality
process deep, or this reality

707
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,780
kind of, you know, trajectory
deepens, and people will start

708
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,800
to increasingly discover that,
that there's incredible

709
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,680
potential in music that a lot of
people already know, but a lot

710
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,880
of people have no idea, because
of the fact that it's, you know,

711
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,820
oftentimes people put it on they
don't even barely listen to it,

712
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,120
or it's piped into elevators and
grocery stores and all that. And

713
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,540
just treat it as a kind of a
cheapo commodity to influence

714
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,560
the mood of a situation, buy
more or whatever. You know, we

715
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,420
certainly know that with songs
like the Peyote prayer. Songs

716
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,360
and their capability, and the
Icaros of the Ayahuasca world

717
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,420
and their capability and such.
Enough from me.

718
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,200
Marc Caron: Thanks for adding
that in, Steven and and Chris,

719
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,160
you said something that I
thought was so beautifully, said

720
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,000
the and it was really the
metaphor of a mother giving

721
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,080
birth and that pain that turns
into, you know, great pleasure,

722
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,640
right? And it just reminded me
of something that, you know,

723
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,240
it's one thing I always live by.
And you know, we see great

724
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,220
change coming, and one of our,
you know, care ways of dealing

725
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,740
with change is a lot of people
resist change, you know, and I

726
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,520
want to encourage everybody to
embrace the change, because

727
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,680
change is automatic growth, not
necessarily, but when change can

728
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,760
happen and we can grow and help
others grow and transform

729
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:01,260
through the pain air, quoting
the Pain of change versus, you

730
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,440
know, the the ability to embrace
it as an opportunity, because,

731
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,400
you know, it's going to suck,
it's going to hurt. It happens

732
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,360
when change is happening. Meta
Morphic is, I gotta believe, you

733
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,940
know, isn't always, you know,
isn't painless to the

734
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:19,080
caterpillar in that sense. And
that, you know, we do anything

735
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,400
when the change comes. You know,
let's embrace the change and

736
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,700
grow with it, based on some of
the things that we've been

737
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,180
talking about here. And Belinda,
I just want to reach, you know,

738
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,440
touch in with you. Is there
something you wanted to add to

739
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,900
what Chris and Steven may have
said there?

740
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,420
Belinda Eriacho: Yes, I think
one of the things that's really

741
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,860
important to me, and one of the
things that I continue to see in

742
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,760
this space is that we forget
about the importance of

743
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,680
spirituality in this space, you
know, either because we don't

744
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,760
understand it, and especially in
circles of science, it's very

745
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,640
difficult for them to talk about
that when we're talking about

746
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,500
healing. For many indigenous
cultures, spirituality is

747
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,740
actually the number one
component that actually helps to

748
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,120
bring healing and wholeness to
an individual. So I think that's

749
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,200
one of the things I also wanted
to add. And as we start to move

750
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,900
forward in this movement that we
be mindful of that,

751
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,100
Marc Caron: yeah, it's really
goes hand in hand with our

752
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,040
disconnection to nature, right?

753
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,420
Unknown: If I could add a
footnote to what Steven had

754
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:33,740
said, I think in my visionary
experience, one of the messages

755
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,920
has come through over and over
and over again is the pace of

756
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,300
the future is the pace of the
past is irrelevant to the pace

757
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,480
of the future, these things are
going to happen much faster than

758
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,200
we could possibly imagine, much
faster, faster, faster. And one

759
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:55,240
of the ways it was unfolded, for
me is a vision of the entire

760
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,260
collective psyche, the species
mind that underlies all of our

761
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:04,800
individual minds is a field, is
a unified field, and then under

762
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,040
the pressure of this time in
history, this field is going to

763
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,340
become hyper stimulated, through
all the angst and all the

764
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,260
suffering and all the
uncertainty, it's going to

765
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,580
become hyper simulated. And when
it becomes hyper stimulated,

766
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:22,160
it'll begin to function in what
chaos thinkers would call a non

767
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,580
linear system, it'll become a
non linear system, or a far from

768
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,600
equilibrium system. Non linear
systems are capable of doing

769
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,080
things that linear systems
cannot do, and one of the things

770
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,520
they can do is change rapidly.
Change quickly. Small

771
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:42,160
fluctuations of input can
produce dramatic outputs. The

772
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,520
butterfly flaps its wings and
China can produce a hurricane

773
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,120
across the world. So that means
that under the pressure of the

774
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,740
future, the contribution of
individuals, the influence of

775
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,560
individuals, will not be
diminishing, it'll be

776
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:01,980
increasing, so that individuals
can affect the outcome of this

777
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,540
evolutionary transition more in
the future than they were in the

778
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:11,100
past, and it's just through this
and through many other ways, the

779
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,060
speed with which things can
change the creativity and when

780
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:20,720
non linear systems evoke from
deeper within its Nature, latent

781
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,740
forms of creativity that are
part of the natural fabric, but

782
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,220
had not been actualized up to
that point in time. So I think

783
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,880
Steven's absolutely right. The
creativity of the universe is

784
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,880
going to be manifesting the
collectivity, the

785
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,740
interconnectivity of our beings,
of our hearts and of our minds.

786
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,100
I think we're entering into the
time. One of the ways of

787
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,160
thinking about where we're
coming we're coming into is

788
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,420
we're entering into the period
of the one heart, where humanity

789
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,680
will have will experience the
one heart. And once we know the

790
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,460
one heart in our essence, then
we won't hurt each other, we

791
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:03,180
won't satisfy we won't. Let
anybody be diminished in their

792
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,900
opportunities of life. And I
think we are awakening into the

793
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,160
one heart. And I think that
you're talking about making the

794
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:17,280
journey from mind to heart is a
very powerful mentioning this.

795
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,780
Marc Caron: May I mark you. May
Steven,

796
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,060
Stephen Gray: thank you. Oh,
Chris, another beautiful

797
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:28,280
statement. Thanks so much. Yeah,
I want to add in another thing

798
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:35,000
on the sort of optimism side you
might say, excuse me. And this

799
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,720
is another one of those little
aphorisms which has come to me

800
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,180
in a variety of ways, but this
particular aphorism is there? I

801
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:49,660
think it's Victor Hugo said that
there, there is nothing as

802
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:55,300
powerful as an idea whose time
has come and canucault little

803
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,560
fish, a road man from the Native
American church that I sat up in

804
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,700
meetings with perhaps two dozen
times or more over a 12 year

805
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,560
period. Others have said this
too, probably many actually. But

806
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,400
what Ken said to me one time, or
canuca said to me one time, was

807
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:17,160
that he and some others had been
having a vision that as the

808
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,280
stability, or, you know,
believable believability,

809
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,600
plausibility of the current,
spiritually disconnected, as

810
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,760
Chris says, egoic, dominated
system becomes less and less

811
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:37,160
plausible, less and less viable,
then that will create a gap that

812
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,020
is creating a gap, but the gap
will widen or become big enough

813
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,760
for this new vision to come in,
and that new vision will make

814
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,640
sense. You know, as Terence
McKenna, who, I think, borrowed

815
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,220
this from William Blake, or
somebody ultimately, and

816
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:56,980
reworded it for modern times,
was, if the truth can be told so

817
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,900
as to be understood, it will be
believed, which is essentially

818
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,140
what Dwayne is saying Elgin is
saying in his chapter as well.

819
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,480
So I think it's, again, from the
sort of like giving people hope

820
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,680
perspective, it's important to
realize, again, that we're not

821
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,180
just looking at destruction.
It's the birth, it's the

822
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,460
Death-Rebirth part of it, right?
That's so important.

823
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,180
Marc Caron: Yeah, great. Well,
thank you for adding on to that,

824
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,720
Steven. Now we are getting near
a time we want to be mindful,

825
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,720
because sometimes people don't
like the the long episodes of

826
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,220
things. So if there's one thing
I like to do is I always like to

827
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:42,280
give people something tangible
or a call to action. And I know

828
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,620
we've talked about a lot of
great ideas and things that

829
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:50,620
people can do, but I'd like to
ask each of you specifically

830
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:56,140
that if there was one thing
someone can do to help this

831
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,300
transition along for humanity as
a call to action as an

832
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:06,540
individual, what would you
suggest or think that might be

833
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:12,540
the most you know bear the most
fruit? What do you think the

834
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,380
most important action for all of
us to do is moving forward.

835
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,440
Whoever wants to go first? Go

836
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,160
Stephen Gray: ahead. Go first. I
gotta quote canucas Little Fish

837
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:30,200
again, who said to us in the
teepee a couple of times,

838
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:35,960
relatives, stay behind the
medicine. So it's a metaphor,

839
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:40,600
essentially Steven Howard Bunner
in his book plant intelligence

840
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,900
and the imaginal realm, used as
the phrase following the golden

841
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,600
thread, which you and I have
been having fun with the last

842
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,160
couple of years mark. So that's
the getting in front of the

843
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,540
medicine as a as in a reality,
in reality, but also as a

844
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:00,160
metaphor, is the ego getting in
the way and enforcing its agenda

845
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,940
and its needs onto the
situation, staying behind the

846
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,800
medicine, as I understand it is,
has to do with quieting the

847
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,900
mind, calming the mind, being
humbling oneself, dropping down

848
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,200
into the heart. As people have
said so beautifully, Belinda and

849
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,780
Chris today, dropping down into
the heart and experiencing

850
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:25,220
through that way and just
following the golden thread, I

851
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,120
think it's a very optimistic, in
a sense, way of looking at our

852
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:35,540
potential so or to put it into
more sort of a fun way, excuse

853
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:40,360
me, the wonderful novelist Tom
Robbins In his book fierce

854
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:44,800
invalids home from hot climates.
Told a story about a friend of

855
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:49,600
his who had a like a parakeet or
some large, you know, bird. That

856
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:54,340
was the first thing any visitor
to the place always saw when the

857
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,920
person walked in the door.
Here's this thing sitting on a

858
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,240
stand, and it said to everybody,
the parrot's name was sailor. By

859
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,120
the way, Sailor the parrot, and
everyone who came in through the

860
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,600
store, it said, People of Sea
World relax. So if there's one

861
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,140
sort of simple message, it's
like, relax, pay attention and

862
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:19,260
trust and stay behind the
medicine. And then I think, you

863
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,520
know, at least I'd like to
believe that things unfold in

864
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:26,120
and of themselves, and we then
know the next intelligent,

865
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,560
skillful step to take, Mark
before we go, are you going to

866
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,620
is one of us going to say
something about the book launch?

867
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,080
Oh, not there yet. Okay, okay.
Didn't mean to jump

868
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,240
Marc Caron: the gun. Always jump
in the gun. Oh, well, I

869
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,720
Stephen Gray: didn't know if
this was my last time to say

870
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,580
anything for the day or not.
It's

871
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,580
Marc Caron: never your last
time. Oh yes, always just one

872
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:53,260
more thing. Okay. Anyway,
Steven, that's that's fantastic.

873
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:58,120
I completely can relate to what
you're saying. And Belinda, what

874
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:02,580
do you think you know for people
to do one thing leave here from

875
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,780
this conversation and do one
thing that can make a difference

876
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,720
in this world. What Yeah, that
to be.

877
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,900
Belinda Eriacho: Thank you for
that question mark. You know,

878
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,900
one of the things at the very
end of my chapter, I end with a

879
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,860
prayer for healing of humanity.
And I think one of the best

880
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:23,360
things that we each can do is
look internal to ourselves and

881
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,360
do the work that we are being
called to. Because with that,

882
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,660
then it resonates out into our
families, our communities, and

883
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,560
then globally, just like, you
know, Chris had talked a little

884
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,100
bit about, it's just like that
pebble in the pond to really get

885
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:41,380
out there and do something, you
know, get involved, look for

886
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,500
practice sacred activism. You
know, look for those

887
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,020
opportunities where you can help
your neighbors, you can help

888
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:50,800
your community. I think with all
of that said and done, you know,

889
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,340
it helps to for us to evolve
into a better place.

890
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,900
Marc Caron: Very well said. And
I like that you talked about,

891
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:02,460
you know that the contribution
and volunteerism, because I

892
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,220
think that that's just a
powerful way that people can get

893
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,300
outside of themselves, and, you
know, serve the greater good. So

894
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,240
thank you for bringing that to
the surface, Belinda. I think

895
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,200
it's really important. And
Chris, you're

896
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,180
Unknown: up. Alright. Well, in
addition to doing our inner work

897
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:23,540
that Belinda referred to in
addressing the shadow and taking

898
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:28,160
responsibility for our own
shadow, I'd like to sort of

899
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,060
broaden the perspective. Now. I
think Steven's right that music

900
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,460
is going to play a very
important role in the time that

901
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:38,360
we're coming into and not just
musicians, but artists,

902
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:43,180
politicians, scientists, every
it's going to take all of us

903
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,640
working in concert to bring
about this social

904
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:50,320
transformation, and it's to help
us make this shift. So I would

905
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:56,980
just invite us to remember that
before we were born and before

906
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,240
our children were born, every
one of us knew what we were

907
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,020
getting into before we were
born. We all made a conscious

908
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:08,040
choice to be born in this time
and to this place in this

909
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,220
particular form, in this
particular sex, in this

910
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,140
particular culture we were born,
and we chose to become an active

911
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:21,440
participant in this historical
process. And no matter what I

912
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,000
might recommend in terms of the
good thing for someone to do or

913
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,420
a core thing for someone to do,
inevitably, I would reflect my

914
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:34,220
own limitations, of my own spot
in the world. And I think what's

915
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:38,960
important is for each one of us
to remember that we have already

916
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,180
buried around us, all the help
that we need, all the

917
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:47,740
information we need, all the
resources that we need to do our

918
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:52,060
particular piece in contributing
to this transformation that we

919
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:56,320
are a part of. The question is
not, what do we need to do? The

920
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:02,820
question is, I think, will we
have the courage to do what is

921
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,980
ours to do. You will know what
is ours to do. Will we have the

922
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,460
courage to do it? If everybody
has the courage to do their

923
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,460
particular part, then we're
going to make it through this

924
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:14,820
thing.

925
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,660
Marc Caron: I really like that
that that courage to to push

926
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:24,140
through that, Chris, I think
it's, you know, so spot on as so

927
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,660
many people kind of stand on the
sidelines, never playing the

928
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:30,560
game. They're just watching it
right? And I think it's really

929
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,160
important. And if there's one
thing I wanted to add in terms

930
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,720
of just a call to action from
from my perspective, and I think

931
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,700
about a conversation I had with
Donnie Blakey, who I know Steven

932
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,160
knows quite well. I don't know
Belinda, if you knew Donnie

933
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:48,280
before he passed, but he was
just a brilliant guy. And he

934
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,300
said something to me, and
without the huge story of where

935
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:57,640
he you know what it was, but the
most important thing he says was

936
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:03,540
it was about having. Or others,
you know, having your best

937
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,600
interest at heart, not our
interest, kind of like what

938
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,780
Steven was saying about being
behind the medicine and put

939
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:13,440
other people's best interest in
your heart as well, not what you

940
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,120
can get out of them or do and
really, respect, appreciate,

941
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,560
understand the other person's
world, because so many people

942
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,320
are going through, you know,
trials and tribulations of life

943
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,100
right now, and what we need is
more understanding, you know,

944
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:32,240
compassion, non judgment, where
we can actually put other

945
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,960
people's best interest at heart
and not our own. And I think

946
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:39,860
that, you know, that has a huge
potential to change the way

947
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:43,540
people interact in this world
and where they're at. So, you

948
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,940
know, that's really, you know,
you don't know where other

949
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,760
people are at. So who are we to?
You know, Judge, complain,

950
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,900
criticize, condemn, any of those
things. And when we step back in

951
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,860
a position of love, acceptance,
appreciation of where we are all

952
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:00,180
at on our journey, it can really
make a difference. Because I

953
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:03,000
know there's people out there
that don't hear kind words very

954
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,360
often, and we have the ability
to impact people with our words

955
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,260
and our actions

956
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,440
Belinda Eriacho: so and I think
Mark, you meant understanding,

957
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,280
not understanding.

958
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:18,000
Marc Caron: Yes, yes. Thank you.
Belinda, that's a good one. I'm

959
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,420
going to have to get used to
using that one, because it's

960
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:24,860
super powerful. Well, I want to
thank you, all three of you, for

961
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:28,940
being part of our conversation
today. It's always an honor. I

962
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:32,240
learned so much, and I get
inspired as well. And I know

963
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,320
that you know, Steven's book is
out, it's available, and we're

964
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,040
actually having a book launch
here at St James Hall in

965
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,060
Vancouver, so maybe Steven, you
can talk a little bit about

966
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:45,940
that. We're pretty excited.
We're getting close,

967
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,880
Stephen Gray: sure. So anyone
who can walk, drive, bicycle,

968
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:58,120
train, boat or fly to Vancouver,
we'd love to have you with us on

969
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,140
the evening of April 7, which
is, by the way, we didn't know

970
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:04,560
this when we set this date with
St James Hall, but it happens to

971
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:08,700
be good Friday, which is an
interesting coincidence, you

972
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,000
might say, or perhaps
synchronicity. So at the very

973
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,080
least it's going to be a small
g, Good Friday. Good Friday.

974
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,900
Excuse me, and we've been mark
you and I have been talking

975
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,620
about it, not book launch,
almost sounds a little bit, I

976
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,740
don't know, academic or library
like or dry or something like

977
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,940
that. But really, we're painting
it as a as an empowering

978
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:38,300
celebration that Ian, you know,
in my highest ideal, idealized

979
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,800
vision of what this could be, we
bring people together. We talk.

980
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,340
We don't talk a lot. Dennis
McKenna has volunteered to come

981
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,820
in and say a few words. I've
been trying to talk Belinda into

982
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,340
coming up, but it's a long way,
and she's got other things to

983
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:55,540
do. And, you know, I'd love to
have some more of the

984
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,900
contributors around, but they're
all far flung, so Dennis is our

985
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,280
is our more local person who has
consented. But we're not going

986
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,520
to talk long, and then we're
going to go directly into one of

987
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,600
our frequently done in the past,
cannabis friendly Well, call it

988
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,420
a cannabis ceremony, but we like
to call it a cannabis friendly

989
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:15,240
ceremony, because you're
certainly not required to, you

990
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,940
know, imbibe any cannabis, and
the ceremony itself will be

991
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:21,320
equally, maybe not equally, but,
you know, quite decently

992
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,800
powerful and effective as a
meditation ceremony, whether

993
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,160
you, you know, imbibe any
cannabis or not. And then we

994
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,920
will follow that. Well, I'll
hang out in a corner and sign

995
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,520
some books if people want me to.
But other than that, our

996
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:40,660
wonderful world musician Chene
Edgar in his and his incredibly

997
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:44,620
talented multi instrumental
percussionist Curtis Andrews,

998
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:49,180
are going to do an hour or so of
dance music, which, you know,

999
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:53,500
it's almost impossible not to
dance to the shines music. You

1000
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,380
really have to be stuck in your
chair to get to not want to

1001
01:08:56,380 --> 01:09:00,220
dance to shine. So what I'm
hoping to do cannabis in that

1002
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:03,060
way, you know, and we haven't
talked about cannabis as part of

1003
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,820
this discussion, particularly,
but you know, if we had more

1004
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:10,020
time in an or in another
context, I would want to talk

1005
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,080
about how cannabis has an
important role to play in all

1006
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,740
this because of its sort of
gentle ubiquity. And when

1007
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:21,620
understood properly, it can be
considered the sacrament of

1008
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:25,040
peace, but it allows people to
have visions and deepening of

1009
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,280
experience in a way that's quite
functional in a situation like

1010
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,580
150 people at St James Hall. You
know, you don't want to be

1011
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:35,480
handing out two dried grams of
mushrooms to 150 people in that

1012
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,720
kind of circumstance, right? But
cannabis, you can do quite

1013
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,380
safely, especially with the kind
of guidance that we give them in

1014
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:45,760
the container that we hold for
them. So my vision, my hope, is

1015
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:50,260
that that is an empowering thing
as well as a celebratory thing.

1016
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,880
So we highly and strongly
encourage people to come and

1017
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,660
join us for that. And so there's
some Mark. You want to talk

1018
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,080
about how they can get info and
details Absolutely.

1019
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,580
Marc Caron: But I just want to
add to that is like, shine and

1020
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,360
Curtis are incredible. And I
know Chris Bache, you know that.

1021
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,300
And Belinda, if you were there
on Saturday night at the

1022
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:19,800
conference, Oh, you missed out
on a special treat. I'll get you

1023
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,900
some music for it there, but Oh,
my God, incredible, incredible

1024
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,560
experience. So just grateful for
that. And yeah, you can get, if

1025
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,020
you go to spirit, plant,
medicine, com, slash events,

1026
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:34,880
you'll see a link there where
you can get register your

1027
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,460
tickets, because all sorts of
information. There's a couple of

1028
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:42,160
little videos and music you can
sample on and right now until

1029
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,740
April, what is its 14 March 17.
Till March 17. March 17, we're

1030
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:50,860

anybody who wants to join us in

1031
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,860
early bird ticket, and that's
going for another few days. So

1032
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:57,580
if you're watching live or after
the fact, now is the time to

1033
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:01,680
save on that. And we look
forward to really having a great

1034
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:07,320
evening of, you know, community
connection ceremony, some

1035
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,980
medicine for those who are
interested, and, of course, some

1036
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,040
epic music and dance with curves
and shine. It's just really

1037
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:20,280
incredible. So if there's any
last words anybody would like to

1038
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,320
share before we wrap it up,
because I'm going to play a

1039
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,000
little video. Little video of
the event that's a minute as we

1040
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,120
close off. But Belinda and
Chris, if there's anything you'd

1041
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:34,220
like to add, we'd love to to
just have you send us off. No.

1042
01:11:34,219 --> 01:11:36,679
Belinda Eriacho: Thank you.
Thank you for this conversation.

1043
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:39,319
It's been really beautiful.
Thank you.

1044
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:45,400
Unknown: And likewise. Thank you
and Steven, thank you for your

1045
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,300
vision to bring together all the
voices that you brought together

1046
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:53,080
in the book, and for everything
that you do, and you and Mark do

1047
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,400
to facilitate community around
the awakening of our time in

1048
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,900
history. Thank you very much.

1049
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,240
Stephen Gray: Okay, well, and I
would like to thank, well, mark

1050
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,140
for, you know, Mark for you
being so supportive of all this,

1051
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,620
you know, for one thing, and
Belinda and Chris for being so

1052
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,580
generous and giving your time
for this as well. And really,

1053
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm not exaggerating both of
both of you, the things that

1054
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,200
you've said today have just
really touched me. They're been

1055
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,420
really brilliant. So thanks a
lot for that, and

1056
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,180
Marc Caron: thank you for your
kind words, everyone. And

1057
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,940
Steven, you know, it's just one
way of me just sharing the

1058
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:32,420
message I'm all about. How do we
transform our lives? What are

1059
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:37,040
the tools? What Works and the
medicine brought me to this, and

1060
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:41,500
so I'm just here to help you
know, these great, visionary and

1061
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,160
indigenous voices speak out.
It's what I want to be part of

1062
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:47,920
supporting for a change in the
world, and this is one of the

1063
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,220
vehicles that I believe is very
powerful to do that. So I'm just

1064
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:54,160
honored to be able to share
space, share time, and help

1065
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,000
everybody share their message.
So thank you so much. And with

1066
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,780
that being said, I'm going to
play a little video here as we

1067
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,220
sign off, just a little bit
about the event and what's going

1068
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:10,260
on, and you'll get to sample a
little bit of music. So here we

1069
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,520
go. Thanks again, everyone.

1070
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:23,900
Stephen Gray: Please do not
underestimate how deep we can go

1071
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,380
individually and collectively
with this. And I say that from

1072
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:42,980
experience. You

1073
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:20,220
Marc Caron: this all awesome.
Well, thank you all for joining

1074
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,940
us. That's just a little teaser
and a taste, but if you go to

1075
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:25,880
the website and take a look,
there's a 10 minute version of

1076
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:29,600
that whole soundtrack that shine
and Curtis were playing that you

1077
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,600
can go enjoy, because it's
really quite epic. So thanks

1078
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,520
again, everyone until next.

1079
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,240
Belinda Eriacho: Great day.
Everyone bye. Thank you again.

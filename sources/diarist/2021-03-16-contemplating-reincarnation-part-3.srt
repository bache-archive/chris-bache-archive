1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,080
Chris Bache: CH, well, here we
are again for our third

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,220
discussion, and we tend to
typically gave the topic for

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,720
this discussion limitless time,
because we now want to bridge

4
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,500
into the deeper questions
surrounding reincarnation, the

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,640
deeper perspective, where is
reincarnation taking Humanity?

6
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,740
Where is this constantly
learning and recycling and

7
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,480
recycling creating new and new
platforms in our incarnation

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,380
experience. Where is it going?
Where is it taking us? What

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,920
might the deep future look like,
and most importantly, how might

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,600
that understanding shift how we
engage our life, right here,

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,560
right now? Yeah.

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,540
Richard Rudd: Yeah, very deep
questions to follow. Where

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,320
should we begin?

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,120
Chris Bache: Well, we should, I
think we should acknowledge that

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,260
each of us have a deep
experiential basis that we're

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,920
kind of bringing to this
discussion. You know, we're not

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,880
simply thinking about it,
philosophizing about it, and

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,960
speculating about it, we have
deep convictions born out of

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,000
unusual experiences.

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,920
Richard Rudd: First, it's true,
it's why it's in way, what's

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,220
brought us together around these
to do these dialogs, I think.

22
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,740
And I was just explaining to you
know, that to discriminate the

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,420
difference between knowledge and
wisdom, you know so although we

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,160
are we've explored strains of
knowledge in this wisdom is is

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,180
different from knowledge. It's
the opposite, in a way, because

26
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,000
for me, the way I understand
wisdom is it's is it? Wisdom

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,320
comes through Revelation. It
comes through listening. It's a

28
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,920
it comes through being passive
and then receiving, whereas

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,980
knowledge is something that you
do opposite. Do you go after it,

30
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,860
you chase it, you hunt it. You
know you're, you're, you're

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,280
going towards it, instead of
allowing it to come towards you.

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,860
And so you get different
information through revelation.

33
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,860
And it's not information in the
same way, it's cellular, so

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,880
that, you know, so my
experience, you know, that's led

35
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,780
to me being me and doing what I
do is because I have always had

36
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,540
this, you know, cellular
understanding, cellular knowing

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,340
of what's coming for humanity,
and, and, and it's always, it's

38
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,580
quite hard to hold that. I'm
sure you relate to that, Chris,

39
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,880
it's quite hard to hold it,
because it's not everyone else

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:05,160
has it. And so it puts you, it
puts me in a I'm more relaxed

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,500
than most people I know at a
fundamental level, because I

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,560
have this knowing that
everything's going to be fine,

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,080
and I can't explain that knowing
or even why it was given to me

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,700
to have it. And I know that many
people listening to this will,

45
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,700
will not, will have a resonance,
you know, and have had

46
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,540
breakthroughs and visions where
that has come to them. So, you

47
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,760
know, I want to, I think it's
really good for us to

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,260
acknowledge it, that we carry
this, this other dimension. And

49
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,440
you obviously through your work.
I mean, tell us a little bit

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,560
about, yeah, it would be lovely
to hear

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,780
Chris Bache: I completely share
what you're saying, because I do

52
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,680
carry an unusual knowledge, as
you do now. At the beginning of

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,920
our series, we talked about the
evidence for reincarnation. So I

54
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,120
was in my professorial mode
there the intellectual digesting

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,860
of this evidence, and the middle
the second conversation was kind

56
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,880
of a blending of that type of
knowledge and the type of wisdom

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,200
that arises in my psychedelic
work and in today's discussion,

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,920
I feel like I'm standing
squarely within that other side

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,000
of my life. I'm a visionary
Shaman. I'm a psychedelic

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,280
visionary. My understanding
comes out of the careful

61
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:29,000
distilling of conscientiously
engaged Non-ordinary states of

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,360
consciousness again and again
and again, purifying and

63
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,240
purifying and allowing the
universe to take me deeper and

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:43,780
deeper into what I experience as
into itself and into its

65
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:50,560
intention, into time, literally
into deep time, and giving me

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,640
experiences which were never
intended to be just for me, they

67
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,860
are planted in me to hold and
then. To pass on, as so many of

68
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,680
you know, anyone who has these
deep experiences, you know

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,520
they're never just for us. We
hold them for for the larger

70
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,740
collective so I do like you. I
have a feeling for what's

71
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,040
happening in history, where
we're going, and it does tend to

72
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,960
i to it gives me a calm and a
relaxation, even as we enter

73
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,660
into very difficult and trying
times ahead.

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,400
Richard Rudd: Yeah, I think so.
And I think both you and I have

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:43,420
that same kind of you know,
knowing, I suppose that birth is

76
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,620
an intense event and and we're
coming to a birth point, you

77
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,880
know, we're even in the canal
and contractions are occurring,

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,900
and in the same way that, you
know, I understand individual

79
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,620
awakening. When awakening comes
into a body, you know, and it

80
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,760
comes spontaneously, it kind of
comes through contractions, in a

81
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,920
sense, so often, before you have
an experience and a

82
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,240
transcendental experience, there
are kind of shudders, and then

83
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,020
there's openings and closings,
there's there's condensing and

84
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,920
and intensification of shadow
material. And then there's a

85
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,700
kind of opening up, and then
there's another birth

86
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,400
contraction. And the
contractions come closer and

87
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,080
closer together, and eventually
there's a kind of a deep opening

88
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,280
to, you know, an epiphany of
some form, like something that

89
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,560
shakes the core of your being
and and maybe fires within your

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,560
DNA, so that it's something that
just sets you alight and changes

91
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,900
you forever. You know when, when
those revelations come? And so,

92
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,820
you know, I think that that's,
that's what's happening on a

93
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,080
planetary level as well. It's
beginning to happen as a

94
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,200
collective and your writings,
Chris, particularly, through

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,260
your your you know, your mind of
the universe. Diamonds, book, it

96
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:22,160
describes so beautifully, this
process of like coming into

97
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,340
coming down the birth canal,
what it doesn't do, obviously,

98
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,880
and what neither of us can do is
fill in the details, you know,

99
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,160
and only time can do that. But
we'd like to give a bit of

100
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,400
backdrop and and both empathize
with the intensity of the

101
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,700
suffering that is already here
and is most likely going to be

102
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,900
ramped up to want to empathize
with that, but at the same time,

103
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,840
we want to present this, this
knowing that we have that gives

104
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,320
people hope more than hope,
actually, but it also provides

105
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,980
some hope, doesn't it like there
is a purpose to the events that

106
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,460
are taking place on our planet
right now and right now is

107
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,900
whenever you're watching this,
you know, because one can, you

108
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,080
know, one can only imagine more
events occurring as This canal

109
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,740
opens up.

110
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,200
Chris Bache: So, yeah, yeah, you
describe that process of the in

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,320
breaking of the vision and the
being drawn into the the deep

112
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,720
experience of Revelation.
Because, you know, deep visions,

113
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,260
deep insights, cannot fit
themselves into small

114
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,820
containers. And so when nature
or the divine or the universe

115
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,660
invites us into a deeper
experience, a more conscious

116
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,680
understanding of life, it has to
purify ourselves. And you

117
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,160
describe that contracting
process, and it is our past.

118
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,840
It's everything about us which
keeps us small, being burned up

119
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,600
inside us in order to allow
ourselves to be taken shattered.

120
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,220
It's in my context, it's the
Death-Rebirth cycle to die to

121
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,920
everything within us which holds
us where we are, and to be

122
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,660
reborn into a larger world and
and that can happen again and

123
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,820
again, taking us deeper and
deeper into that, knowing it's

124
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,140
like any spiritual path, there
are no shortcuts and there's no

125
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,520
easy way into this. It's always
a very exacting and a very

126
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,780
demanding, demanding road. But
the fruit of that road is, well,

127
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,480
it's it's personal and it's
collective. It expands around us

128
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,800
in all sorts of subtle and
mysterious ways. And we are part

129
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,440
of a lineage, each of us in our
own ways, a lineage of people

130
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,000
who have asked for more and who
have been given more and have

131
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,340
paid the price for being given
more. Uh, and you're right. This

132
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:08,760
is my work started as thinking
of my psychedelic work as kind

133
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,180
of a personal healing or
personal transformation or

134
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,200
personal awakening, and that
just got shattered in the light

135
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,260
in the first few years. And
everything about my work kept

136
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,780
opening up into collective
VISTAs, collective spaces, being

137
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,280
drawn into the collective
psyche, going through collective

138
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,300
purifications and opening up
into insights about our

139
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,740
collective developmental
process, experiencing

140
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,920
reincarnation, not simply as an
individual soul journey, but as

141
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,460
a species journey, that's a
journey that our entire species

142
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,780
is on, evolving itself through
the systematic reincarnation,

143
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,680
generation after generation,
moving forward and then being

144
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,100
Given a certain understanding
about that, this reincarnation

145
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,060
process for us, individually and
collectively, is coming into a

146
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,100
crescendo. It's coming into some
type of profound breakthrough,

147
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,300
and you've languished it as a
birth, and I think that's

148
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,840
absolutely correct. And birth
involves labor, and it involves

149
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,940
a change from one state to
another state for a child, it's

150
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,940
a change from a water being to a
land being. And we are, I think,

151
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,380
are growing from a state of
individual egoic awareness,

152
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,020
where our identity is
fundamentally our body, mind,

153
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,900
ego, into a soul awareness,
where all of our former lives

154
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,000
are coming together in a in a
tremendous fusion point there,

155
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,960
as our knowledge of our past
deepens and as we heal the

156
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,860
traumas of our past that we're
all carrying and our past lives

157
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,000
become more integrated, and we
integrate not only their pains,

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,820
But their virtues, their great
assets, their capacities, and

159
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,580
all of this begins to take
place. And it's like our lives

160
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,720
come together, and eventually
they hit a fusion point, and at

161
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,080
that point, the soul becomes
one, totally, as I've

162
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,440
experienced this, there's an
explosion of light and an

163
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,420
explosion into a higher order of
individuality with a different

164
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,200
threshold, a different sense of
communion with the surrounding

165
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,220
intelligence of the universe and
the intelligence of the Divine.

166
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,100
But and it's a different to me,
if humanity is going through

167
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,600
this process, which I deeply
believe it is, that's what my

168
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,920
visions have shown me again and
again. It represents a new

169
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,860
foundation for the human story,
a new phase of the human story,

170
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,600
just as profound as when we made
this jump about 200,000 years

171
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,860
ago to a brain that's 50% bigger
than the brain that we were

172
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,400
carrying before, allowing us to
think and do things that we

173
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,060
could never do before. This is
something which is going to

174
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,380
change the fundamental
archetypal architecture of the

175
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,760
collective unconscious.

176
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,680
Richard Rudd: Yeah, beautifully
said. It kind of brings two

177
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,340
things I'd like to say in
response, which are really

178
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:29,060
reiterations of what you've
said. And the first is that many

179
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,460
people watching this, you know,
if you're drawn to this kind of

180
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,380
material, there's a very good
chance that you have said, Yes,

181
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,300
you know, to receiving, to
transmuting more shadow

182
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,860
material, you know, more than
more than one lifetimes worth,

183
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:55,600
and and I remember those dark
days of my kind of past in which

184
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,140
the shadow, the level of shadow
inside my body, seemed

185
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,420
insurmountable, you know, and
seemed endless. You know,

186
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,200
whenever I would meditate, I
would just find endless weight

187
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,260
and heaviness and oppression.
And, you know, like so much of

188
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,540
it, that it was just, it was
just this big, thick clot. And

189
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,280
how would I ever, ever burn
through that? And gradually over

190
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,260
the years, happily, you know,
for me, and it's lightened and

191
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,480
and so I, I've, I've seen the
light at the end of the tunnel.

192
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,320
And, and I say this because I
know that many watching this

193
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,200
will also have that experience
of grappling with a weight

194
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,320
inside the physical, emotional
reality, mental reality that far

195
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,420
outweighs us. You know, the kind
of individual wounding patterns

196
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,780
of one life. You know, whatever
they are, you know, and that's

197
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:05,160
not to kind of. Of, you know,
put them lesser, but it so, you

198
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,080
know, we've taken on more and,
and, and the reason we've taken

199
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,740
on more is because we are, we
are capable of taking on more.

200
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,640
So if you feel that heaviness
and weight in you, it's because

201
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:23,540
you have the capacity, the deep,
overwhelming, you know, the love

202
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,980
that's great enough to burn
through that. So I say that to

203
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,020
encourage people continue on in
your transformational path and

204
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:39,860
not to lose hope. And the other
thing I wanted to say is, you

205
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:47,500
know, when you look at times
like this, like birth, and as

206
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,360
you said, there's something that
emerges that is completely new

207
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,880
when you when we're looking at
life as it is today through the

208
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,980
lens of history, we See a
continuity. You know, we see

209
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,040
this continuity, this fairly
unbroken continuity with blips

210
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,180
and ups and downs and cycles
repeating and and we see that

211
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:14,460
through the patterns of our
recorded history. And the one

212
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,540
thing we never you never see in
birth, is you can't see beyond

213
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,600
the break, because at some point
there's a break in the

214
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,340
continuity, and then something
completely new is born. As you

215
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,300
said, it's an it's assembled out
of all the elements of the old.

216
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,680
It's condensed. It's revealed
from all those elements coming

217
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,600
into a symphony. And so it's
completely different. It stands

218
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,200
on the shoulders of all that, of
all that's great, and all that's

219
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,000
been suffering, and all of that
is suddenly kind of compressed,

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,120
like the beginning of the
universe was compressed into

221
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,240
this tiny space and then set and
that's what happens, is this

222
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,020
incredible compression. And then
there's this opening, as you

223
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,420
said, an expansion of vast
light. So what I'm pointing

224
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,700
towards Is that what's coming
has no similarity to what we

225
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,920
have now. You we cannot. You
know, with our wildest

226
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,720
imagination, we can begin to
approach it, but it you have to.

227
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,560
You have to really, you know you
never see a break in the

228
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,160
continuity coming. You always
assume, all of you humans, it's

229
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,620
our way we see things. Have
always been this way. They'll

230
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,140
always continue. Maybe, you
know, we're going to continue

231
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,720
along this path, and then we'll
get robotics, and we'll get

232
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,300
technology, and we'll get this,
and then we'll go to the stars.

233
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,720
And, you know, we think in the
way that we've been trained to

234
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,780
think until the one of these
Crux points comes, and then it

235
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,780
just smashes everything. And in
a way, a whole new epoch begins,

236
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,500
something completely new with
different technology, you know,

237
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,200
and we're the technology, you
know, we are the technology.

238
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,300
I've been saying this to be all
like it's inside us, you know,

239
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,400
our DNA has capacities, and
dreamed of capacities and and so

240
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,820
I think it's really important
that people grasp that that

241
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,560
what's coming bears no
resemblance to what has been.

242
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,160
You know,

243
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,640
Chris Bache: yes, I completely
agree with you. I mean, this,

244
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,540
this is what happens in a
psychedelic session as well. I

245
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,080
mean, I first, I completely
affirm what you're saying about

246
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,740
the weight and the burden that
so many serious practitioners

247
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,460
are experiencing. And I think
it's because there, there's a

248
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,880
lot of their past, which is past
lives, karma which they're

249
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,660
working and clearing now. But
it's also collective karma that

250
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,880
great beings. And I think there
are many more hidden saints than

251
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,320
we might think there. They have
taken on responsibility for

252
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,120
working on behalf of humanity as
a whole, so that they are they

253
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,600
are engaging darkness that comes
not just from their personal

254
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,440
history or soul history, but
from our collective history. And

255
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,180
we have to get through this
period quickly, we have to bring

256
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,300
about this transformation, or
cooperate with this process.

257
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,340
Because, as every mother knows,
you don't want the fetus to get

258
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,760
stuck in the birth canal. That's
not a good place to be. We want

259
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,020
to move, keep everything moving
through. And I think that many,

260
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,020
many, many souls incarnating in
this period of history, saw what

261
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,300
they were getting into, knew
what they were getting into, and

262
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,960
chose to do this work, because
this is the work of birthing a

263
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,780
new humanity. Is great work. And
you're right. It's a

264
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,860
discontinuity in a session. When
you go deep, deep, deep into the

265
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,680
pain, it just looks like it's
never, ever, ever going to end.

266
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,240
You can't imagine how this will
ever reconcile itself. And then

267
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,780
there is a breaking point.
There's a point of absolute

268
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:53,200
surrender, of absolute cost
paid. And then there is a waking

269
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,580
up, waking up in a new reality,
which is not an extension of the

270
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,500
old reality in any way you
can't. Get to this new reality

271
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,880
by refining, purifying, even
healing the old reality it is.

272
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,180
It is being catapulted in
something which is a

273
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,620
fundamentally new genre of
experience, a new set of

274
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,780
capacities. My experience, in my
sessions, when I've been taken

275
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,240
deep into the experience of deep
time into the deep future.

276
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,560
That's how I had experienced the
course of Humanity as well, that

277
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,240
we seem to be first many, many
visions, over and over and of

278
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,960
course, my visions, these are
old. I mean, I started having

279
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,960
these visions in 1991 so these
are pushing 30 years old now,

280
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,040
but a series of visions that we
are coming to a turning point.

281
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,500
The pace of the past is not,
could not be used as to measure

282
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,720
the pace of the future, of
turning a before and after point

283
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,980
that after this historical
transition, we would be

284
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,540
operating at a completely
different psycho spiritual

285
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,300
structure. We would be
generating a different

286
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,580
civilization, because we would
be different beings. We would

287
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,200
not be confined and fragmented
the way we are now. I mean,

288
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,720
basically our relationship with
nature that we are experiencing

289
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,200
now that the damage that we've
done to nature was done by a

290
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,680
species operating out of the
egoic level of consciousness,

291
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,040
which is a fundamentally, which
is a brilliant level of

292
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,580
consciousness, but it's
fragmented. It's fragmented from

293
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,900
each other. It's fragmented from
foundational from the foundation

294
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,440
of life itself, a species which
is operating with a healed heart

295
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,020
and a healed mind, an open heart
that embraces the great breath

296
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,280
of its own experience and human
experience, and an open mind

297
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,240
which is open to a deeper
communion, a deeper taking in

298
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,300
from higher orders of
intelligence, higher orders of

299
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:09,600
knowing such a being lives in
the world differently than a

300
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,560
human being does today. The soul
lives in the world differently

301
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,880
than the ego. The soul knows
that the world that it leaves is

302
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,440
the world that is coming back to
so it takes better care of the

303
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,820
world. The soul knows that its
relationships have a depth of

304
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,640
texture and history, and you
don't walk away from any

305
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,380
relationships. And so you take
more care of all of your

306
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,560
relationships and of all the
people in that you're related.

307
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,540
Because this is an ongoing
developmental process, and I

308
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:46,600
think we are coming into a point
where the irony is, life is not

309
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,200
giving us any option except to
go through this transition.

310
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,920
There's no going back. The Earth
is not going to allow us. We've

311
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,660
done so much damage to it. This
damage is coming up to us now we

312
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,640
cannot continue living even in a
simplified version of how we

313
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,020
have gotten here, we have to
reach into something entirely

314
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,980
new, something radically new.
And I think you're right that

315
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,700
this is happening on the
outside, and we are being called

316
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,840
to a new relationship to the
earth on the outside, but we are

317
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,580
carrying within our hearts all
the problems that have gotten

318
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,380
here, gotten us here, and we are
carrying all the values and the

319
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,960
potentials and the insights
which are which are taking us

320
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,360
beyond this into a different
order. It's all inside. And you

321
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,520
and I focus our work on the
inside dance. There are other

322
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,940
people whose work is to focus on
the outside dance, to bring out

323
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,420
the changes in the outer world,
to get us through all are

324
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:49,900
needed.

325
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,520
Richard Rudd: So true. And you
know, beautifully put, and you

326
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,740
know the inner transformation
that you've just described. I

327
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,380
mean, one thing that I am
reminded of, like those, if you

328
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,620
if you know anyone's saying is
familiar with any of

329
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,200
Shakespeare's plays,
particularly the comedies and

330
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,560
the tragic comedies, you know,
like in some of those plays,

331
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,200
everything that can go wrong
goes wrong, and the wrong people

332
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,560
fall in love with the wrong with
the wrong people, that

333
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,320
everything gets twisted round.
It's like one of those

334
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,800
nightmares where it's just like,
and you've got to act four, and

335
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,520
usually there's five acts, and
it's still a complete mess. And

336
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,040
you're and, as in the audience,
you're going, Oh my God, how is

337
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,200
this ever going to be resolved,
and then he does this magical

338
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,920
thing where suddenly there's a
kind of strange attractor that

339
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,460
comes in some force or some
event that just suddenly

340
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,160
triggers all these like sub
events that makes everyone end

341
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,720
up with the right person, and
everything just gets. Yield, and

342
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,880
is happily ever after story, but
it happens very quickly, you

343
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,700
know, always right, compressed
in the last moment. And in a

344
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,860
way, it's a bit similar time,
because we've had this long,

345
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:20,220
slow, you know, build up to
create this, this mess, yeah,

346
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,700
and then there's this sudden
kind of, you know, cataclysmic

347
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,320
energy at the end that then just
in which you could never quite

348
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,840
see how these are, all these
things are all going to be

349
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,260
resolved. But they get resolved
and in a completely different

350
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:42,280
way from what we were expecting.
So, you know, and one of the

351
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,320
things that you spoken of a lot,
Chris, is the speed at which

352
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,360
things happen. And we can see
that in natural systems that or

353
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,480
we you can just see it in water
boiling, you know, it's the most

354
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,880
obvious one. Perhaps, you know,
you look at the water and

355
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,920
nothing seems to be happening,
and nothing seems to be

356
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,300
happening, and you put more and
more heat into it, and then some

357
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,080
bubbles start to appear. And
just the first little bricks of

358
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,200
bubbles on the surface. And
then, of course, suddenly, when

359
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,120
it hits that one boiling point,
everything just erupts. And you

360
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,900
have steam, you know, and this
water starts to just change its

361
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,380
state. And it's such a simple
metaphor, but it's so true

362
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,380
throughout the whole of nature.
And if you look at the whole of

363
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,880
humanity and history, you know,
in a way, that's what those

364
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,080
that's a period, that's that
we're reaching, and we'll begin

365
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,120
to see that more and more. And
the scientists are pointing to

366
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,320
those things like the like the
ocean, for example, is capturing

367
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,760
a huge amount of CO two and, and
it's, it's called the sink, you

368
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,600
know, it's just, it's sinking
down deep into the deep ocean

369
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,320
where, where the where that CO
two is being stored. And it's

370
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,560
slowly building up and building
up and building up until the

371
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,620
ocean will be able to no longer
capture any more CO two. And

372
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,420
from that point onwards, and
it's it's allegedly already

373
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:15,060
occurred, it weakens its ability
to store CO two weakens, and

374
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:20,340
therefore all the CO two that
we're creating suddenly explodes

375
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,260
into the atmosphere and and it
looks like we've been in this

376
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,600
hiatus, you know, and we have,
because there's this illusion

377
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,960
that we've been okay, and then
suddenly everything speeds up

378
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,640
much more quickly than anyone
could possibly have conceived,

379
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,780
you know. And except, you know,
some of the scientists who

380
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,740
really know that, who've really
analyzed the data deeply and and

381
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:50,740
also, you know, cross, people
who work across multiple fields,

382
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,740
you know, systems theorists and
people who really see the

383
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,940
interconnectivity of different
systems, can see the whole and

384
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,460
sit and have an edge. And, of
course, mystics like us. So

385
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,840
there are, you know, many who
are kind of predicting very,

386
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,360
very quick change that can be
very destabilizing for this

387
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,140
planet. And, you know, I know
you, you I'd love to hear what

388
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,260
you saying, what I want to say
about this and but, and we don't

389
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,580
say to alarm, but to prepare,
because it goes alongside the

390
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,560
the Inner Awakening on the as as
the as the inner birth takes

391
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,480
place something on the outside.
The structure has to decline. It

392
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,140
has to fall away in order for
this new to come through. It's a

393
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,520
universal law and and it's
essential. You know, as you

394
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,080
said, we we can't repair the old
system. That doesn't mean we

395
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,880
shouldn't try and repair the old
system, because there can be

396
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,460
one. You know, hearing all this,
you can think, Well, I'm not

397
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,920
going to do anything. Then I'm
just going to sit here. And

398
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,900
that's an understandable
response, and yet it's not a

399
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,580
truly compassionate response,
you know, because compassion

400
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,800
also involves passion, and we
need to stand up for what's

401
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,700
right and for justice, and and,
and what else. What is the

402
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,160
purpose of being here, you know?
So we need to continue forwards

403
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,600
and use our passion wherever we
are called to do so that's part

404
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,600
of our responsibility, and
that's part of what it means to

405
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,160
be an awakening being, and yet,
at the same time, we can have

406
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,360
this other part of us that
knows, well, I'm going to do

407
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,340
whatever I can while this is
collapsing, you know, I'm going

408
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,260
to give, I'm going to serve in
the best way I possibly can and

409
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,100
and that's how you know that you
will always be in the right

410
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,580
place. You'll always be in a
safe place. And when I say safe,

411
00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:00,720
I mean safe in the sense that
you're aligned with the. Core of

412
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,980
your soul and its destiny. You
know, that's a safe place to be,

413
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,240
yeah,

414
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,940
Chris Bache: yeah, that place of
alignment, yeah. You know the

415
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,180
way that speeding up process
worked itself out in my in my

416
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:24,320
sessions, and it had to do with
understanding the field dynamics

417
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,240
of consciousness. I have just
enough understanding of chaos

418
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,840
theory and non equilibrium
systems to have a rudimentary

419
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,840
understanding of what physicists
or chaoticians but understand

420
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,040
when that when a system gets
more and more energy poured into

421
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,580
it. It reaches a state of non
equilibrium, or far from

422
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,940
equilibrium. And when it's in
that condition, like that water,

423
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,580
which is getting more and more
energy poured into it, our

424
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,400
bathtub, when you keep
increasing the quantity of water

425
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,120
that's going into the tub, and
the ripples get CH, they start

426
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,200
to change. We come to a tripping
point, a tipping point to

427
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,580
bifurcation point where the
system has too much energy to

428
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,680
maintain its current structures,
and it does a flip into a

429
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,980
different organizational
pattern. It goes through this

430
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,760
bifurcation point. It chooses a
different future. It flips into

431
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,440
a higher organization pattern.
And when physical systems reach

432
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,760
non equilibrium points. They can
do extraordinary things. They

433
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,720
can produce new particles. They
can produce orders of coherence

434
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,260
within themselves that would
have been impossible at a lower

435
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,360
energy state in my in my
visionary experiences, I was

436
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,240
given to see that all of
humanity. We are all fractal

437
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,680
nodes within Unified Fields, a
field of consciousness. There

438
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,860
the human unconscious, the
Collective Unconscious is a

439
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:57,580
field, and it is an energetic
field which reflects all of our

440
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,880
individual experiences, and when
enough individual experiences

441
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,260
become untenable, when they
become so painful, we just reach

442
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,800
out in desperation for a
different solution to the

443
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,120
situation. It's not just we
individually who are going

444
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,900
through this type of ordeal of
transformation, but all of us

445
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,880
collectively, we've never had
anything happen in history,

446
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,000
which is comparable to what's
coming at us now. Because when

447
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
we've had hurricanes or great
natural disasters, they've

448
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,760
always affected one part of the
world, but not the other part of

449
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,780
the world. But the global
systems crisis that seems to be

450
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,680
imminent, being driven by a
global ecological crisis, is

451
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,560
going to affect all continents,
all people, all places, that's

452
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,900
going to push humanity into a
different experiential field.

453
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,860
And the point here is that the
collective psyche is going to be

454
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,760
energized by all of this
disruption. It literally is

455
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,260
going to begin to boil
underneath us, underneath our

456
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,800
individual minds. And my
understanding of what's

457
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:11,220
happening is, is that in
evolution, there are kind of

458
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,520
multiple levels of evolution, at
least, say two levels of

459
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,780
evolution. We and I are being
born over and over again. We're

460
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,340
born or 100 years at a time. We
live 100 years, 100 years. But

461
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,980
underneath those 100 year
cycles, there is a learning

462
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,800
taking place. There is a
developmental process taking

463
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,640
place. We usually refer to this
as the soul. So the the

464
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,020
individual ego incarnates, but
the soul is growing, becoming

465
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,920
more becoming more, suffusing
our lives. But the same thing

466
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,020
happens collectively, every
generation, every generation,

467
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,380
billions and billions of people
are being born, but there is a

468
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,360
learning gathering underneath
them that is collecting all of

469
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,840
their learning in these deep,
deep, collective archetypal

470
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,600
structures. That's what's coming
to boil, not just our individual

471
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,080
incarnation, but that underlying
structure is coming into a high

472
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,700
energy state. And I think it's
it's coming to a state where the

473
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,600
the sheer energy of our
suffering, the energy of our

474
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:18,600
despair, or the energy of our
anxiety, is driving us through a

475
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,420
breaking point where suddenly
we're going to be flooded with a

476
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,960
different kind of common sense,
a different common sense, a

477
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,680
different set of priorities, a
different set of values, a

478
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,880
different experience of each
other. The only way I think that

479
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,260
we can go as far as we need to
go in order to save ourselves

480
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:45,520
and the planet in little time as
we have, is to understand the

481
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,660
dynamics of the collective
unconscious, the field dynamics

482
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:54,760
of consciousness and the how
fields operate in non

483
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,620
equilibrium systems. At least
this is what has come through my

484
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,760
Vishnu. Your experience over and
over that that we are coming to

485
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,460
a point where there is a crisis,
which builds an intensity until

486
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:15,720
it looks like all is lost. It so
much disruption, so much loss of

487
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:23,000
control, so much death challenge
at a very deep level. But when

488
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,900
it's at its worst, it begins to
pass. We pick ourselves up. We

489
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:35,060
somehow rise to the challenge of
this crisis. And in rising to

490
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,260
the challenge, we are changed.
We are profoundly changed, such

491
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,180
that, as we become start to come
out of this period of history,

492
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,680
we find that what our nature,
the nature that we are carrying,

493
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,040
is not just a different set of
attitudes, not just a different

494
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,380
set of beliefs, but a
fundamental, a fundamentally new

495
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,720
way of Being conscious, a new
organization of our

496
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,700
consciousness emerges. Something
has shifted in place, and we

497
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:11,160
find that things which were not
easy are suddenly easy. Things

498
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,160
which are out of reach are
suddenly within reach.

499
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,000
Possibilities are emerging much
faster than we would have ever

500
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,200
predicted. That's the type of
transformation I think we're

501
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,880
looking at a truly a rebirth of
humanity. So that's in my work.

502
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,940
I call it the birth of the
future human. You know, it is

503
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,280
truly a demarcation of a
different kind of human being

504
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,640
emerging now. I think our
history is creating this. It's

505
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,960
reincarnation which is coming to
a phase of fruition. And I think

506
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,760
we can get insights in or
glimmers of what the future will

507
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,420
look like by looking at the
Great Beings of our past, the

508
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,820
great saints, the great
prophets, the great

509
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:03,900
incarnations, the Christ the
Buddhas, the prophets, those

510
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,280
great beings who have always
called us into a higher order of

511
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,380
existence. Those are prototypes,
I think the prototypes which

512
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,320
give us an inclination, an
understanding of what we are in

513
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,660
the process of becoming as a
species collectively. I think we

514
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,820
are truly becoming a species of
Christ, a species of Buddhas, a

515
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:31,400
species of of Prophets. You
know, with that magnitude, that

516
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,020
tremendous scale of heart, I
don't know how long it's going

517
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:40,540
to take us to make this
transition. Clearly, the

518
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,020
ecological crisis, which is
fermenting, is a crisis that's

519
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,920
going to be deepening for
generations. It'll be at least

520
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,060
three generations, four
generations, before we hit the

521
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,800
peak of these of this crisis.
But I think we will come through

522
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,560
it. And I think we're not
talking 1000s and 1000s of

523
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,380
years. We're talking we have to
make this within a few 100 years

524
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,000
to make this transition. And I
think the 21st Century is the

525
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,260
key century of the of the
unraveling. It is the where we

526
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,180
make key choices that shape our
future. And one of the other

527
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,460
things that happens in non
equilibrium systems is that

528
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,200
individual changes, small
changes, can catapult into

529
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,760
massive outcomes. So the
butterfly wing in China sets off

530
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,800
a hurricane across the planet.
That metaphor that individuals

531
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,200
who have achieved within
themselves something of which

532
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:47,500
humanity is aspiring to change
for solving these large

533
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,240
problems, the impact of
individuals increases

534
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,820
exponentially in non equilibrium
systems. So just in contrast, if

535
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,420
we look just to the past, we
say, well, the individual can't

536
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,940
do anything. We're being
overwhelmed by just these

537
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,300
overwhelming historical forces
are coming at us. It's just the

538
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,420
opposite. As things intensify,
the individual becomes more

539
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:18,060
significant, a more significant
player. So beings who achieve a

540
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:25,400
wholeness within their person,
they achieve a robust soul

541
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,540
consciousness in their person
have a tremendous catalyzing

542
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,400
effect on people around them
coming to their own version of

543
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,680
that deep experience as well.

544
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,060
Richard Rudd: Thank you. I love
listening to you when you go off

545
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:49,900
on a transmission. I was
thinking, you know, if you were

546
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:56,140
to ask yourself, what one what
one thing? If there was one

547
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,540
thing that happened on this
planet that could change

548
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,460
everything in. Quickly,
overnight, what might that one

549
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:10,020
thing be? And inside me, the
answer was, is that for us to

550
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:15,360
see through the veil of death?
You know, because the moment one

551
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,100
person sees through the veil of
death, fear is no more. It just

552
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,920
isn't. There is no fear, because
that's where fear resides. So

553
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:30,320
the the intensification of the
energy you're talking about, the

554
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,040
suffering that you know, the the
love, all of it pouring towards

555
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:40,240
this one kind of point, this,
you know, it's, it's the only

556
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,280
thing that has the power to
pierce that veil, that veil of

557
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:52,000
death. And so what I would
expect, and what I have sort of

558
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,600
seen in through the gene keys
and through my teachings and

559
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:01,920
transmissions, is that more and
more people will gradually, as

560
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,440
this boiling takes place,
experience their consciousness

561
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,400
you know, having the ability to
transcend life, birth and death,

562
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,740
that cycle of life you know, and
be able to that consciousness

563
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,260
and the will retain the memory
between life, birth and death,

564
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,480
and carry it across. And what
that, you know, because that's

565
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,900
that's the that's pure
awakening. And when a being has

566
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,380
that layer, that level of
awakening, and they're sitting

567
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,020
there manifesting, or standing
there just moving around, being

568
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,800
who they are, and that is being
emanated. It is electrifying.

569
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,820
It's electrifying to anyone
else. It's it's catching. It's

570
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:53,140
contagious. You know, the the
transmission of wisdom and love

571
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,280
and awakening is contagious. You
know, most people will know

572
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,460
this. You go near one of these
beings and you can feel it, it

573
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,760
crackles in the air. And so the
more and more that is occurring,

574
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:14,160
the more and more this veil of
it will be breaking down, and

575
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,180
then fear will start to leave
this planet, gradually, person

576
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,700
by person, person by person,
generation by generation. And I

577
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:28,700
even believe deep inside myself
that that will enable children

578
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,740
to come through, to be born
without the wound of humanity,

579
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,940
you know, just be born awake,
you know, and therefore not have

580
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,920
those not have to go through
this journey. And, of course,

581
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,540
those children are us. Those are
our future vehicles, yeah, and

582
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,780
they will be born through those
awakened ones, you know, because

583
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,080
it if you have two awakened ones
coming together to bring a

584
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,940
child, then you have a clear
conduit, you know, and, and, and

585
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,280
that's a vessel that you might
want to jump into, yeah, to

586
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,980
experience, and then more and
more of that and that. So in a

587
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,000
way, you could almost perceive
that that's how the awakened

588
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,560
consciousness will colonize the
gene pool in humanity,

589
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,160
literally, like a, like a, like
a virus of love. You know, it

590
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,320
would just begin to spread, and
it's, and it's non

591
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,260
denominational, it doesn't, you
know, it's everywhere. It's in

592
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,440
the weirdest places. It's in
the, you know, tiny little

593
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,040
communities, because it's, it's
everywhere. It can't, it can't.

594
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,240
It's not, it's not fixed on any
chosen people, you know, as in

595
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,780
the past. It's, it's it so it's
going to wake up, you know, I

596
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:46,420
always liked that one liner that
Jesus left behind him where he

597
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,420
said, You know, when I return, I
will return like a thief in the

598
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,140
night, you know? And I
contemplated that for many, many

599
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,800
years, and one day I just saw
that, I was like, Oh, wow, yeah,

600
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,280
it's coming. It you can't stop
it. It's secret. It's hidden.

601
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,360
It's everywhere. It's a thief in
the night. It's just going to

602
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:09,240
arrive. And it's this, you know,
new human that we're talking

603
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,620
about. You know, this is the new
human that we've both seen, and

604
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:19,920
I think many people are sensing
here already among us in its

605
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,720
potential. Like you mentioned,
the Buddhas and things. And one

606
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,740
thing probably that I loved more
than anything else in your book,

607
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:33,680
Chris, is when you describe the
future human. And I was left

608
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,360
with this image of all these
Buddhas sitting down, meditating

609
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,040
and stuff, and then this one
human standing in the middle of

610
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,860
them, standing on its own two
feet, and that was the future

611
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,580
human. And I thought, you know,
I feel like that's such an

612
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:53,200
enduring, iconic symbol of
what's coming, because we're no

613
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,920
longer, it's it's no longer the
journey of meditation and

614
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,440
spiritual awakening and the
spiritual journey and this

615
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,620
awakening. Through
transformation of the shadow.

616
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,240
Suddenly that's come to an end,
you know. And suddenly that

617
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,960
being is standing, you know.
There's no practice anymore

618
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:17,340
other than living. And then then
that human really begins a new

619
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,100
humanity, because there's no
more awakening process. There's

620
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,540
the layers and layers of
creative expansion, always

621
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,100
infinite creative expansion. And
there's and there's playfulness,

622
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,620
and there's, you know, new
layers of engagement within the

623
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,320
you know, within the construct
of reality. You know, you know,

624
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:47,020
all these levels and dimensions
and fields that we can explore,

625
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,740
you know, through a new way. And
I and what I really see clearly

626
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:59,500
is as that's as the age of
suffering comes to an end. You

627
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:04,620
know, we have a new field, and
it's bliss. You know, we have

628
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,760
learned enough from suffering.
Now is our chance and

629
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,140
opportunity to learn from Bliss,
because bliss is the other side

630
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,520
of suffering. It's the same it's
almost the same thing. It's all

631
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,280
that suffering leads to Bliss,
and yet bliss is just the other.

632
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,940
It's like the white hole to the
black hole. You know, it's like,

633
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,340
you go through a black hole, you
come out the other side, there's

634
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:34,220
this white hole, and it's and
and it has as much depth and

635
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,480
juice as suffering does, you
know? So that there's, you know,

636
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,200
there's a similarity to them,
but it's a new it's a new Muse

637
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:50,080
that humanity has, you know, so
when we sit in that bliss and we

638
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,580
move through that bliss, we're
moving through the highest

639
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,060
aspects of our consciousness,
and that then has to all be

640
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,500
explored, all of it, because
bliss, Like suffering has layer

641
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,260
upon layer upon layer upon layer
upon layer and dimension and

642
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,160
dimension and dimension and and
it, you know, there's a whole

643
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,200
epoch needed again just to
explore bliss. So that's why, in

644
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,780
a way, if you can hold that in
your heart and your mind as we

645
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,900
move through these very
difficult you know, decades

646
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,120
ahead and century centuries,
perhaps few centuries agree. By

647
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:34,460
the way, 21st Century is seems,
it seems to be the one. The next

648
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:39,560
century, you know, seems to be
the one. And you know, remember,

649
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,720
that's us, you know, like, we'll
be there. I mean, I say to

650
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,260
people, you don't miss this, you
know, like people saying, like,

651
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,960
Oh, this is my last incarnation.
Okay, well, make sure you come

652
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,640
back for that one. You don't do
all this. And then the reward,

653
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:01,500
yeah, so all things are possible
at that stage, and I think it's

654
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,460
really good to bear these things
in mind as we're moving through,

655
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,620
you know, intense periods.

656
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:15,420
Chris Bache: Let's, let's allow
ourselves to look deep into the

657
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:20,900
future of this future human.
Because whatever, whatever

658
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,420
transformation we're going
through, and we are going to,

659
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,760
you know, we agree we're going
through this acute

660
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,780
transformation. We're giving
birth to a new order of human

661
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:35,060
capacity, however long it takes
us to do it, you know, a few 100

662
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:41,680
years, whatever the human story
is, not stopping. The

663
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,820
evolutionary drama is not
ending. This is simply going to

664
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:51,580
be a new platform within which
the human story will continue to

665
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:57,220
develop. I think you're right
that we have been evolving out

666
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,360
of through learning from
suffering. That's been the great

667
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,500
teacher in much of our learning
of the past. But I think, and I

668
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,620
think you're right, we are
getting past that. We're growing

669
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,740
out of that, just as we're
growing out of our fear of

670
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,340
death. You know, if there were
one thing that I wish I could

671
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,240
give people from my sessions, it
would be to lose the fear of

672
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,380
death. Because if you're afraid
of death. You just have your

673
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,860
whole cosmology upside down. You
just don't understand what's

674
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:29,180
going on. You know, death is the
great death is graduation. Death

675
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:34,400
is the great respite. Death is
the great reward. So we're

676
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,540
coming into this, this period of
deep transformation, of living

677
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:43,120
out of bliss, living out of joy,
exploring out of bliss and joy.

678
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:47,200
And I think you're right, it's
going to take us a long time to

679
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,760
experience the levels and levels
of creativity that can come out

680
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,220
of that. So the divine project
has brought us to this crisis,

681
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,980
the evolutionary, natural.
Right, however you want to

682
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,340
envision, the Dow project has
brought us to this crisis. Is

683
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,000
taking us through it. We're not
doing it. I mean, this is much

684
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,360
larger than you or I, or any
individual collection of people.

685
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,740
Nature is driving us through
this metamorphosis. Nature has

686
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,500
just decided we're ready, we're
time. We're going through this

687
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:27,440
thing, new platform, new
beginning, but it's not going to

688
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,040
stop. We're here for another
million years. We're here for

689
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,400
another billion years. So I
think we should really look

690
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,800
deeply at understanding that
we're not only talking about a

691
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,840
kind of new humanity as we can
imagine it. Now, from our

692
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,700
limited position, we're talking
about a new humanity beyond our

693
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:54,040
capacity to imagine, because it
is so different. One of the

694
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,720
things that happened at the very
the last vision I was given the

695
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,980
last session, is the session
that I call diamond vision,

696
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:12,180
because in the session, I was
given a 10 minute experience of

697
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,780
being able to see 1000 times
more clearly, more precisely,

698
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,620
more exactly, with More
discrimination that I'd ever

699
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,160
been able to see before wasn't a
hallucination, it was just

700
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:31,760
absolutely I could not imagine
that I had accepted the dull

701
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,100
experience of ordinary vision as
real vision, and when it

702
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,620
disappeared, I realized I had
been given an experience of

703
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:46,000
seeing the way the future human,
that all future humans will see

704
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,660
it. This isn't just a
transformation of our heart and

705
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,900
a transformation of our mind.
It's a transformation of our

706
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:59,080
senses, that that our touch and
taste and vision and hearing is

707
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,420
is going to be more and more
refined, more subtle, more

708
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:08,520
exquisite. The capacity of
consciousness to heal the body,

709
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,080
to keep it on an even keel, to
transform it, the capacity of

710
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:19,500
consciousness to infuse and lift
the body into ecstatic states of

711
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:27,740
creativity. I mean, we're just
getting started into actualizing

712
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,980
some of the higher potentials
that are already built into the

713
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,880
human form, but are being
activated by this evolutionary

714
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,260
process setting us on fire. And
then the question becomes, well,

715
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,920
what might lie down the road,
and we can loath ourselves and

716
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,640
maybe projections and fantasies
about that. But the the only

717
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,300
thing that's really important is
to understand, I think, the high

718
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,920
stakes of what's involved here.
We're not trying to simply fix

719
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,620
or heal humanity. We are on the
threshold of birthing a

720
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:06,180
different order of human
existence, which is going to

721
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,620
become the new platform for yet
still more higher orders of

722
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:15,900
human existence. This is a
hugely significant undertaking

723
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,780
that we are about. It's not
simply trying to rectify a short

724
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:26,780
term pass. It's a cascading
effect into a very, very

725
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:30,980
different future. It's a very
high stakes game with very, very

726
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:36,740
great rewards that are coming in
this time. If our nature is

727
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:40,960
truly infinite, as I think we
agree it is, if Brahman and

728
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,820
Brahman is Atman, the essence of
the individual is the essence of

729
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:50,920
the Divine, our nature is
infinite, then reincarnation

730
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:56,560
gives us an infinite amount of
time in order to unfold and To

731
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:03,240
activate our infinite nature. I
think if we qualify it

732
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,220
carefully, we are learning to be
Gods. We are learning how to

733
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,920
create on a scale that we've
never envisioned, except in in

734
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,160
our mythologies or in our
science fiction mythologies.

735
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,460
Richard Rudd: Yeah, so true, so
true. And one of the things that

736
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,660
I have seen, and my way of
describing that mythology is,

737
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,760
you know, we are, you know, and
I'm not the first person to

738
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,580
explore this, you know, it's
these different species or

739
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:38,600
races, or, you know, that are
kind of evolving on our planet.

740
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,340
And we've been through these
before, actually, you know, so,

741
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:49,240
so, and we're part of a much
deeper epoch story than we

742
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,040
realize. And we may have even
forgotten previous epochs, and

743
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,720
because of the break in
continuity between epochs is so

744
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,640
massive, you know, so. Yeah, but
each time we go through one of

745
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,980
these portals, we include and
transcend more of we remember

746
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,960
more of what came before. So I
feel that's also potential that

747
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,460
we remember more of what came
before as we move into what

748
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:23,180
we're becoming. And in a way,
from my understanding, is that

749
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:27,800
this is almost like the, the
final stage, or cresting of

750
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:33,500
humanity's epoch, you know, and
I because it's, it's It then

751
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,760
moves into, you know, the the
culmination of this next since

752
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,140
we're looking far, far, far, far
ahead, the culmination of this

753
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:47,440
next species, you know, is our
collective harmony with the

754
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,100
whole of Gaia. You know, it's
coming into absolute harmony

755
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:56,980
with the entirety of Gaia. So,
so taking our highest seat as

756
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,860
the consciousness of Gaia, and
as the the gardeners of Gaia, as

757
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,940
the stewards of Gaia, you know,
as as inseparable from the

758
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,720
tiniest ant. And, you know, like
everything being part of our

759
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,980
highest, you know, capacity here
and the beauty of Gaia. So we

760
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,820
haven't yet seen, you know,
maybe at the very beginning, you

761
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:23,120
know, we haven't yet seen Gaia,
you know, as a in her flowered

762
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,260
flowering state, fully
flowering, you know, with all

763
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,640
her essences, just released in
perfect harmony, and us being

764
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,000
able to move through the garden
and sup the nectars of

765
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:39,140
everything here, all of that,
and each animal and each

766
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,520
creature and each having their
place, and you know within us,

767
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,760
you know, because they have a
place within us. We are, you

768
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,140
know, there's no separate
separation anymore. And so

769
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,920
there's this incredible
crystallization of the harmony

770
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,840
of all the architecture of life
on Gaia. And my feeling is that

771
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,540
this next phase of our evolution
is about the weaving together of

772
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,660
Gaia, you know, of all those
creatures and things and

773
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:11,280
understand. So every one of us
has a specific weaving role in

774
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,600
that to weave back together
certain neurological pathways

775
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,400
that are unique to us that only
we could weave because only our

776
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,440
creativity wants to go there. So
we follow our creativity, and it

777
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,280
weaves together some aspect of
Gaia, and then all of us

778
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,820
together, doing that creates
this beautiful tapestry of

779
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:36,980
wholeness. And the other aspect
to this that I've seen is, as

780
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,100
the process continues, there's a
timeline. It's straight strange,

781
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:46,540
you know? It's almost like a
spiral, the arc of time. And as

782
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:51,880
we get closer and closer towards
perfection, the timeline closes

783
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,180
in on itself more and more and
more so, in a way, time itself

784
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,780
is being condensed. And when you
get to that final, this is a

785
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,640
lovely joke, when you get to
that final crystallization point

786
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:08,820
of perfection, time itself
dissolves. It's it's so in a

787
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:13,860
way, my joke is that when you
finally get to heaven, it stops.

788
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:18,360
Everything stops. It's like it's
finished. It's like there's no

789
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,080
it would look like, from our
vantage like, well, there's no

790
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:26,120
time to enjoy it, but actually
there's infinite time. So that's

791
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:32,540
when humanity finally
Transcendence, humanity, you

792
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,960
know, and and then there's
another one of those epoch

793
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,400
shifts in which you know and
it's beyond our comprehension.

794
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:46,420
You might even say, we then
leave this sphere, you know, our

795
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,440
consciousness then moves to
another sphere we're, you know,

796
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:56,920
and Gaia is left with, you know,
she's not left alone, because

797
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,720
it's a chain, right? So now the
animals start to kind of

798
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,500
crystallize, and their their
evolution starts to continue and

799
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,040
flow. So, so everything ratchets
up, and that even the rocks and

800
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,460
the minerals are kind of moving
up a layer. Everything is

801
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:15,420
interconnected. So consciousness
is is is embedded in everything,

802
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,740
but it, it awakens in these
layers, in these contractions,

803
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,420
and then we move somewhere else,
somewhere, you know, somewhere

804
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,600
else. We're beyond the time,
space continuum that we've

805
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,500
graduated from, this chain of
evolution, this epoch, you know,

806
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,480
and then we suddenly were in
this, ah, we realize we're,

807
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,500
we're nested as part of
something far wider, because

808
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,540
we've remembered, oh, we're
galactic, you know, guy was just

809
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:48,040
like our playground, our it was
just that was another birth, you

810
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,900
know, and then we're in a
galactic world. And so it goes

811
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:58,480
on, and so it goes on, and so it
goes on. But that's, you know,

812
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,980
when you go far, far, far ahead.
And like, I know you've been

813
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:10,080
Chris, you know, you it's so the
the tapestries are so vast that,

814
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,680
you know, but they're fractal,
right? So they're repeated right

815
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,680
down. So when you look at, you
know, it's like Blake saying,

816
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,580
you know, eternity in the in a
grain of sand, in a wildflower,

817
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,380
you know, it's like it's in
everything, the same fractal

818
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:30,620
patterning is embedded in all at
all levels. So it's just these

819
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:35,660
waves of wider and wider
awakening and creativity. And

820
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:40,040
that's, you know, that's where
we're that's where we're going,

821
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:44,440
and that's where we are, and we
never leave the present moment.

822
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,560
That's the beauty. We never
leave the freedom of the present

823
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:52,420
moment, even when we're in
crisis, you know? And that's

824
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,360
what's going to become, in a
way, for me, the most important

825
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,560
thing is, as the crisis comes,
we never leave the present

826
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,460
moment, and we never forget
where we're going. You know that

827
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,260
this is all for, for a purpose.
So that is the, you know, when

828
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,080
we have to swallow the pill of
suffering, of intense suffering,

829
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,280
that's the other pill we take.
That kind of the medicine that

830
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:20,100
reminds us that the suffering
is, is, is it has Grace embedded

831
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,260
in it, yeah,

832
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:28,160
Chris Bache: I love hearing you
go. When you go, you really go.

833
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,320
And I love because I feel so
deeply resonant with what you're

834
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:39,560
describing. This earth, this
solar system, is part of a

835
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,840
galaxy which is part of a
Supercluster of galaxies, time

836
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,660
space is part of a universe
which is part of a larger meta

837
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,860
universe, which is part of
another larger universe. We are

838
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,640
going through this very, very
exciting, very important

839
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,960
transformation. Humanity is
going through this tremendous

840
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,320
transformation, and yet there
are other species around the

841
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:08,340
galaxy going through their own
transformations, and so we don't

842
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,880
have to deny any of that. We can
affirm all of that while also

843
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,820
paying tremendous attention to
what's taking place. How do we

844
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,020
take full advantage of the
growth opportunity that this

845
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:23,840
time in history is giving us
right here, because my

846
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,500
understanding is we choose our
incarnations, so that everyone

847
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:34,100
who listens to this video chose
to be in in history, right here,

848
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:39,200
right now. They chose to be part
of this traumatic moment, this

849
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:44,320
birth moment, this ecstatic,
exploding moment in history,

850
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:50,200
they chose to be part of it, and
they are exactly where they

851
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:55,660
chose to be in order to have the
greatest impact on positive

852
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:00,060
outcome. That it's not a matter
of searching for what should I

853
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:05,100
do, or how do I respond? Look
under our feet. We are already

854
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:09,420
planted. We have the talents, we
have the relationships around

855
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,440
us. We are already where we can
do the most good if we're

856
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,420
willing to take responsibility
and act really do it, and that's

857
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,240
what you're talking about, being
centered in your your we know

858
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,300
when we're centered in our role
in life. We know when we're

859
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,300
centered in our work, even if
we're suffering at that moment.

860
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:33,080
We have a deep confidence that
this is what we're to do.

861
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:39,320
There'll be so many distractions
being offered to us to not pay

862
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,360
attention. Distract ourselves
with movies, distract ourselves

863
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,500
with this, that and the other.
It's when things get hard. It's

864
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:52,180
going to be very inviting to be
elsewhere. But if we are really

865
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:56,380
here, right here, right now,
putting all of our endeavor into

866
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:02,160
this moment, that is the fastest
way to move through the harder

867
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:07,020
part and into the joy, into the
bliss, into the cooperation,

868
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:11,280
into the collaborations, into
the opportunities for our

869
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,080
individual work to be to meet
with fellows on the journey and

870
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,840
compound into larger and larger
projects We won't get there by

871
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,320
allowing ourselves to be
distracted. We get there by

872
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:28,820
complete commitment to our
circumstances, where we are as

873
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:33,380
we are, and I think you're
right, in that deep penetration

874
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:39,620
of the present, we get glimpses
and touches and tingles of the

875
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:44,920
whole structure of the meta
universe, which is also pouring

876
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:51,400
its all of its energy into the
present. We we meet Heaven only

877
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,200
in the present. We meet the
galactic super structure in the

878
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,920
present, in this moment, in this
grand kind of collaboration.

879
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,220
Connection with destiny. So
we've wandered a long way from

880
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,860
our early talking about, well,
what's the evidence for

881
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:16,200
reincarnation? But it the
communion with the universe is

882
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,560
what drives both of us. I think
you know, the deep communion,

883
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:23,480
the opportunities for deepening
the communion, for letting go of

884
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:28,460
all the things that get in our
way, and going into a deep a

885
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:33,020
deep sharing of the Divine
breath, a deep communion of the

886
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:39,320
divine joy, to really let it in
as deeply as we can possibly let

887
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,660
it in in the years that we have
remaining, and then our next

888
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:48,340
incarnation and our next
incarnation. Beautiful.

889
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,980
Richard Rudd: Chris, thank you.
I don't think I could add

890
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:55,420
anything to that. I think we've
I don't think there's anything

891
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,580
else needs to be said. Is there?

892
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,900
Chris Bache: Well, maybe not
here and now, but certainly in

893
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:04,500
another time and another place.
Wind it up again, and we'll

894
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,820
launch. I love our discussions.
I love this guys with you. I

895
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:10,620
love what happens when we get
together.

896
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:13,800
Richard Rudd: Yeah, me too. And
I think, you know, our various

897
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,060
different communities will
hopefully come together and

898
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:21,740
explore these things in new and
creative ways. That's certainly,

899
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:27,020
I think, my intention to
continue this, this dialog in

900
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:30,260
all kinds of different ways, and
to invite others also into this

901
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:35,120
dialog, to explore, to create,
to come up with, you know,

902
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:40,720
proactive creative roots
forwards in the world,

903
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,460
depending, you know, what is
coming to us. And you know,

904
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:50,620
there's a lot of, the lot of
great genius that's being drawn

905
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,000
to these kinds of discussions
and these communities. And when

906
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,980
the genius comes together, is
capable of so much and and I

907
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:03,780
know that you know many, many,
many hearts are wanting to come

908
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,620
together and be of service as,
as you said, you know to be be

909
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,580
of the greatest service. So I
think there will be

910
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:16,140
opportunities for lots of, lots
of things in the times ahead. So

911
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,900
I want to really personally
thank you for being a great

912
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:23,720
inspiration to me. And why it's
really Yeah, confirming many of

913
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:29,300
my deep, held knowings and and
kind of matching me along the

914
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:33,860
journey and, you know, and
sometimes just really pushing me

915
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:36,560
a little bit further as well. So
I really appreciate that.

916
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:40,780
Chris Bache: And likewise, it
works both ways. Yeah, much love

917
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:45,100
and blessings in your work and
just the joy to spend time with

918
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:50,320
you. It truly is it opens me up.
It invites me forward. I receive

919
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,240
much from our conversations.

920
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,459
Richard Rudd: Likewise,
absolutely you

921
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,120
Unknown: you.

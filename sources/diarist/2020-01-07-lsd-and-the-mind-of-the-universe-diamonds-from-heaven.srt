1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Joe Moore: Joe Moore, hello
everybody. Welcome back to

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,300
psychedelics today. This is Joe
Moore coming at you from

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,920
Breckenridge, Colorado. On this
episode, Kyle and I talked to Dr

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,700
Chris Bache, who is a very
interesting character, he went

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,600
through over the course of a
number of years, 73 high dose

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,240
LSD sessions, and had some very
interesting things to report

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,200
back and personal growth and
much more. We get into it in the

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,800
episode in quite a bit of
detail, and the name of the book

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,760
is LSD and the mind of the
universe. We are giving away

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,440
three copies. And you can find
that in the show notes, we'll

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,140
have a link to the contest
there. And also in our social

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,200
media, you can find a link to
our contests and giveaways.

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,340
Typically, you can also find it
just at psychedelics

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,480
today.com/welcome, and it was a
really mind blowing episode for

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,220
me. We don't really need to
spoil anything, but Dr Chris

16
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,760
Bache has some extra ordinary
things to share, and as a

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,140
recently retired University
professor, comes with quite a

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,320
bit of perspective and education
on topics that I think we should

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,420
all be aware of if we're if
we're going to get into the

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,500
Transpersonal so I think that's
it for right now. So enjoy this

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,760
episode. This show is brought to
you by on it, o, n, n, i t.com,

everything but fitness
equipment. I've, I've tried a

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,200
bunch of their products. I
really do like their Alpha Brain

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,760
product, which is kind of like a
nootropic, like a cognitive

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,720
enhancer, and it's, it's gotten
me out of some really tough

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,080
situations that I've been in in
the past, you know, business

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,940
meetings and whatnot. It's just
really helpful. And if you're

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,500
working on a problem,
cognitively difficult problem,

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,960
alpha brain might be there to
help you, along with some

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,980
coffee. Also got some good
stuff, like new mood helps

32
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,360
balance your neurotransmitters a
bit, supplements where you might

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,540
be missing some things in your
nutrition, and a lot of people

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,140
just love it. I've used it a
bunch. I've actually used it as

35
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:33,140
a supplement to help me come
back from a long party weekend,

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,260
and it's been great. I've also
got some melatonin spray on

37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,800
there, so if you're having
trouble sleeping, melatonin can

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,840
really help. They've also got
all sorts of like fish oil and

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,660
supplements that you can check
out nutrition as well, like

40
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,200
coffee and various drinks,
shirts and other merch. So

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,040
again, on it, on
it.com/actually, that's just it,

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,640
using our link, and it helps us
quite a bit. There's some great

48
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,160
books up there, from Tim Leary
books to Terence McKenna and

49
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,660
more, even the recent Mike J
book on Mescaline is up there,

50
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,040
and it is extraordinary. So
check that out and let us know

51
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,520
what you think. I I think if
you're into podcasts, you will

52
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,240
also like audio books. So check
it out. You owe it to your brain

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,000
to give it some books. Once in a
while, books are where people

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,020
can really flesh out an idea in
full, and it's, uh, it's good

55
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,540
for your cognitive diet. Also,
we have a course coming up

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,920
called navigating psychedelics
for clinicians and therapists.

57
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,160
This course is designed to help
you understand this coming

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,920
landscape of psychedelic drugs
to clinical practice. There is a

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,700
huge variety of interventions
coming up for different, you

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,560
know, indications, and it's
going to be a really big deal in

61
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,820
medicine. I would say it's
already a big deal in medicine.

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,260
So if you want to understand
micro dosing, macro dosing,

63
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,740
psychedelic, psychedelic therapy
at you know, the basic level,

64
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,600
this is only an eight week
course. We can't teach you

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,740
everything. More than you know,
it'd probably take five years to

66
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,540
really, really get you to a
black belt grade. But this is

67
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,180
where you should start. If
you're a clinician or therapist.

68
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,720
We've moved it from a five week
to an eight week course, because

69
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,600
five weeks just really wasn't
enough. We've got some really

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,200
great master classes there from
different experts in the field,

71
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,760
names like Dr Catherine McLean,
Ashley booth from the AWARE

72
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,440
project, Mitch Gomez from Dance
safe. Is Shannon Claire Carlin,

73
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,320
who helps run the MDMA therapy
training program at maps. Ingmar

74
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,680
Gorman, Jessica Katzman, Sai T
who does ketamine assisted

75
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,560
psychotherapy. We've got all
sorts of great stuff up here.

76
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,100
Raquel Bennett, who runs the
crea Institute and the crea

77
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,660
conference, really big into
ketamine as well, and more. So

78
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,160
check it out, psychedelics
today.com or psychedelic

79
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,940
education center.com you can
learn more about our navigating

80
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,540
psychedelics for clinicians and
therapists. Classes start in

81
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,860
February. We have course times
that are friendly for a European

82
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,740
audience and a American, North
American audience too. So right

83
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,080
around 7pm Eastern and 7pm
London time, I believe, but the

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,840
time specifics are on the
website. So I hope you join us,

85
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,080
or at least, you know, come to
our website to learn more, or

86
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,140
tell your friends. We would
really like some referrals. And

87
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,760
there's some great testimonials
up on the page too, if you want

88
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,360
to check it out. And of course,
also comes with a, I think, a 30

89
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,580
day money back guarantee. I'll
probably put that up on the

90
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,940
website soon, but yeah, so you
know, no real risk. If you jump

91
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,540
in, it's okay if it, if you find
out it's not for you. But if

92
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,000
you're a clinician with an
interest in this field, we think

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,820
this is for you. Also, if you
like our show and you have

94
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,000
friends that might be interested
in this topic, probably the most

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,780
flattering thing you can do to
to us. If you want to see me

96
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,100
blush, tell your friends about
psychedelics today. Maybe send

97
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,980
them a link to a couple
episodes, or invite them to the

98
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,000
Facebook group. We're up to
about 3000 people on there now,

99
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,960
and that would be amazing. And
if you want to support us with a

100
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,700
small monthly donation, you can
do that to

psychedelics today. I hope you

104
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,840
Chris Bache, and we'll see you
on the other side. Hello

105
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,140
everybody. Welcome back to
psychedelics today. Today on the

106
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,920
show, we have Chris Bache,
retired professor and Professor

107
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,360
Emeritus at Youngstown State
University and author of the

108
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,480
recent book LSD and the mind of
the universe. We're also going

109
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,500
to be doing a giveaway. So stay
tuned on that. Chris, thanks for

110
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,040
joining us.

111
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,640
Unknown: Glad to be here, guys.
So

112
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,960
Joe Moore: I, I had been talking
about you, I think even a couple

113
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,540
years ago, when I found out
about your, your kind of long

114
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,220
term project before probably the
book was even with a publisher,

115
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,440
and I, and I was really excited
by the idea, and then I just

116
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,640
totally forgot, and then all of
a sudden, we got connected, I

117
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,940
think, through the publisher.
And now I'm very excited to

118
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,480
record with you, because this is
quite the project you've

119
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,700
undertaken, and you've got some
very unique insights to share.

120
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,660
How do you how do you like to
start this story, like, how did

121
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,840
maybe, maybe we can start with
psychedelics? How did

122
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,060
psychedelics come on your radar
initially?

123
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,020
Chris Bache: Well, I just
finished graduate school. I was

124
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,320
publishing a few articles out of
my dissertation. I was looking

125
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,480
for where to take my research. I
was a brand spanking new

126
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:29,060
university professor, and I met
the work of Stani Grof, and

127
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,000
that's what really snapped my
head to attention. I did not

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,300
have a psychedelic history. I
was I finished graduate school

129
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,100
in religious studies as a pretty
deeply convinced atheistically

130
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,740
inclined agnostic, but I read
Stan's work, and the light bulb

131
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,260
went off inside of me, and I
said, this is important, not

132
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,960
just to psychology, but it's
important to philosophy of

133
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,920
religion, which was my training.
And I wanted to get involved. I

134
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,640
wanted to do it, but, of course,
it had been made illegal, so I

135
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,880
split my life in my ordinary day
job. I continued to function as

136
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,580
the professor of Religious
Studies in the Department,

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
taught conventional kind of
courses, or semi conventional

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,800
courses. And I began a 20 year
what became eventually a 20 year

139
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,060
journey, working with LSD,
following Stanislaus paradigm,

140
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,480
and then pushing the limits of
that paradigm pretty far, much

141
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,520
farther than I appreciated at
the time. And I was trained in

142
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,000
philosophy of religion, so I
kept careful records, careful

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,300
notes, tried to make the
engagement as clean and as

144
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,900
productive as possible. And I
knew there would come a time,

145
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,720
sooner or later, when I would
share the experiences or share

146
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,880
the insights from the
experiences with a broader

147
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,020
audience. And after I retired
from the university, that time

148
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,500
finally came, perfect.

149
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,300
Joe Moore: And what was the
first Did you have any kind of

150
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,040
previous spontaneous. Mystical
experiences or anything before

151
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,060
that, that kind of clue you into
how important these things might

152
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,120
be.

153
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,140
Chris Bache: I've always been
envious of people who have had,

154
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,900
you know, I was 12 years old
when I had my first spontaneous

155
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,140
mystical experience. That's not
the way it's been for me. I've

156
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,860
always been kind of deeply
locked into my body and my

157
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,940
physical experience. You know, I
I was reasonably well educated

158
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,480
in Western religious thought. I
became educated in Eastern

159
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,020
religious thought, in a broad
spectrum of contemporary

160
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,800
thought. But no, I had no
background. In many ways, I'm

161
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,080
the last person you would have
expected to write a book on deep

162
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,360
psychedelic states of
consciousness. Just, I mean, I

163
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,420
grew up in Mississippi. I got a
degree in theology from the

164
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,480
University of Notre Dame before
going on to graduate school, so

165
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,700
it wasn't part of my background
at all.

166
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,900
Unknown: I'm curious, how did
you stumble across Stan's work?

167
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,080
By not having any exposure to
psychedelics beforehand.

168
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,660
Chris Bache: Well, I was reading
widely in different areas. I was

169
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,080
reading in kind of emerging
Transpersonal psychology. It

170
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,360
interested me two people whose
work I met my first year out.

171
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,840
One was Ian Stevenson, whose
work at the University of

172
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,020
Virginia convinced me that
reincarnation is a simple fact

173
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,460
of life. And that was a jolt,
because it hadn't been part of

174
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,120
my education anywhere. And then
I met Stan's work, and he had

175
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,180
just published two years before,
realms of the human unconscious,

176
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,080
and that was a book that really
did it for me. And so Ian gave

177
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,560
me kind of empirical evidence
that there had to be another

178
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,380
dimension of reality, other than
the physical world. Because

179
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,480
there, if there is any time
interval between the death of

180
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,720
one personality and the birth of
the second personality, there

181
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,560
has to be a place for them to
exist during that time. And Stan

182
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,220
gave me the methodology that
allowed me to the prospect of

183
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,540
exploring that reality. So I
just decided to go for it.

184
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,920
Joe Moore: It's awesome. So
maybe next like what? What did

185
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,780
the protocol look like to you?
Like it to me, it looks like a

186
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:14,160
very clearly looks like the work
being done at Hopkins and by

187
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,140
maps now. But was, was it any
different in your perspective at

188
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,680
this point?

189
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,840
Chris Bache: No, I think it's
pretty much conventional in that

190
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,920
respect, you're always working
in complete isolation. You're

191
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,580
always working with the sitter,
you're always working with a

192
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,260
very carefully curated playlist
of music. The difference is,

193
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,380
after I did three medium dose
LSD sessions and then shifted to

194
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,220
working with very high levels of
LSD. So I worked at 500 to 600

195
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,960
micrograms. At first, I did it
simply for efficiency, because

196
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,160
it was hard to get time in a
dual career marriage for, you

197
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,860
know, arranging a session day,
and I wanted to make the most

198
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,200
out of every day. I also thought
it would get me to my early goal

199
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
of enlightenment faster, if I
could kind of do my karma in

200
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,640
bigger bites that eventually is
a project that just dissolved

201
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,960
along the way, and the whole
concept of a personal spiritual

202
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,640
journey, or strictly personal
evolutionary project that fell

203
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,160
out along The way. So the
difference, I think, is the

204
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,140
quantity. The first the
psychedelic used very different

205
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,520
than Psilocybin or MDMA, working
with very high doses, which

206
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,500
changed the whole trajectory of
the experience. And then I

207
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,860
basically began to curate a much
more aggressive playlist with

208
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,460
the music. I used a lot more
indigenous music. I didn't use

209
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,780
classical western music. I used
a much more aggressive approach

210
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,820
in music itself, but otherwise,
very much like contemporary

211
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,280
therapeutic approaches to
psychedelics.

212
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,960
Kyle Buller: Yeah, huh, that's
interesting. I guess back track

213
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,620
a little bit too. So your book
really kind of covers these,

214
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,840
what was it? 73 high dose
sessions. So like, your book is

215
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,020
covering all these insights of
your experiences and some of

216
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,600
your philosophical work, and
really understanding

217
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,840
consciousness from these
experiences. So I don't know if

218
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,080
I forget if we gave a little
show there, so that's just to

219
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,140
give some context of what we're
talking about, and what Joe

220
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,220
meant about protocol, of how
you're setting that up. And I'm

221
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,500
curious why did the music change
over time?

222
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
Chris Bache: I happened upon
some indigenous chanting music,

223
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,180
and I threw it into my session
on the next day or the next

224
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,280
week, and it had such a profound
impact on the intensity of the

225
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,560
session, it basically rattled my
cage much more aggressively than

226
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,780
some of the more even aggressive
classical music I like, the

227
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:04,500
effect I recognize. I said it's
more disorienting, more giving

228
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,040
me stronger support for going
deeper into consciousness, so I

229
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,760
just began to cultivate and
collect that type of music.

230
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,180
Kyle Buller: Yeah, that's really
interesting. And from your

231
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,780
perspective, how important is
music when you're doing high

232
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,340
dose psychedelics or just
psychedelic kind of therapy and

233
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,500
that self discovery format,

234
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,380
Chris Bache: I think it's very
important. Now, I've done

235
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,940
sessions without music,
eventually, after long down the

236
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,420
road, and I've done Psilocybin
sessions with and without music,

237
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,800
but in working with a very
strong psychedelic like LSD, and

238
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,700
working at these very high
doses, which, by the way, I

239
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,420
don't recommend, I truly do not
recommend that people do what I

240
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,580
did. I wouldn't do it the same
way if I did it today. But

241
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,600
basically, when you're working
with opening consciousness that

242
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,540
radically music has a
tremendously powerful effect, I

243
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,340
would maybe estimate it has
concentrating, amplifying effect

244
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,860
by five or 10 times, doing it
without psychedelic but without

245
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:17,100
music. So I remember I started
using music only in the fourth

246
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,900
session, and the jump that
happened in that fourth session

247
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,440
was just enormous. So I think
it's very important.

248
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,740
Kyle Buller: Yeah, it's a topic
that keeps coming up, I guess,

249
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,080
within the psychedelic
community, especially when

250
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,920
talking about putting playlists
together for therapy. And I just

251
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,420
recently recorded an episode
with a fellow who composes music

252
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,040
and ended up taking his
experiences and making music out

253
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,440
of it. So, yeah, I think the
music piece is just really

254
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,140
interesting. It's a huge part of
Breathwork as well.

255
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,560
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah, and
Helen Bonnie, of course, are

256
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,060
early work plotting the various
stages of an LSD journey and the

257
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,360
characteristics of music that
support each of those stages as

258
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,040
we go important work. Yeah. So
where

259
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,760
Kyle Buller: did this idea come
from of wanting to engage in

260
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,580
this, these high dose sessions?
Like, did you start off saying,

261
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,120
I'm going to do, you know, X
amount of sessions and really

262
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,780
dive in? Or did you go in
saying, I'll have a few and then

263
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,600
see where it goes? Or did you
have this idea kind of mapped

264
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,820
out of doing X amount of
sessions, or had a goal with it

265
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,180
at all?

266
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,960
No, I did not have any
trajectory or any goal. I saw

267
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,080
the range of experiences that
Stan described in realms of the

268
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,360
human unconscious. I saw since I
had a pretty good grounding in

269
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,700
western philosophical thought
and theological thought, I had a

270
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,540
good sense of the significance
of these states of consciousness

271
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,320
that he was describing. And I
believe that the people who

272
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,960
would be making the most
important contributions in my

273
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,320
discipline would be speaking out
of an experiential basis in a

274
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,320
matter of years, not out of a
theory, simply a theoretical

275
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,840
basis. This was common in my
time. So I just, I knew that to

276
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,600
do that, you just had to get in
and do your work. And I had no

277
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,200
idea how long the work would be.
I was still thinking in the

278
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,440
early years that, you know, you
basically go through ego death,

279
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,100
and then you get unrestricted
access, you know, to the deep

280
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,100
consciousness of existence. What
I found, of course, is that it's

281
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,100
not a matter of simply, of
shattering the ego and going

282
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,780
through ego death. The universe
has many, many layers. And while

283
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,980
it's all holographically
integrated, in a sense, if you

284
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,160
engage the universe
systematically with a carefully

285
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,100
defined kind of methodology, the
universe takes you in by

286
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,840
degrees. It takes you in by
layers. And as you move into a

287
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,580
new layer of consciousness, and
your consciousness stabilizes at

288
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,180
that new layer sooner or later,
if you keep pushing it, the

289
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,880
method you're using has
sufficient power to take you to

290
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,560
the very edge of that new layer,
you're going to go through yet

291
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,380
another death and rebirth
process that's different than

292
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,400
ego death that builds upon that
process. And you go through a

293
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,380
series of death and rebirth
processes as you explore

294
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,100
progressively deeper levels of
consciousness, at least. That's

295
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,660
how it happened for me. It may
be different for other people

296
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,020
and different substances, but
how it happened to me that there

297
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,940
was a systematic progression,
entry into communion with the

298
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,640
universe, and that's where I
laid out the book. I just

299
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,780
basically took it in, start at
the beginning, try to I tried to

300
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,160
distract, recognize the levels
of consciousness that I went

301
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,040
into, consolidating the story to
make it as efficiently conveyed

302
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,640
as possible, and then each
chapter basically goes into

303
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,300
another level of consciousness,
or another level of engagement

304
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,260
with the universe.

305
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,000
Unknown: How would you, I guess,
define that layer of

306
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,780
consciousness, like, like, What
do you mean? Mean by that of

307
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,480
getting to these next layers.
You know, sometimes you hear in

308
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,740
like, the New Age, like, oh, you
ascend to 3d to 5d and maybe

309
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,220
that's how, you know, some
people are making sense of that.

310
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,980
But how would you describe that
moving through layers?

311
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,720
Kyle Buller: Well, I adopted the
working vocabulary that Stan has

312
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,360
developed in his books between
psychic level, subtle level and

313
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,560
causal level consciousness, it
differentiates low and high,

314
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,760
psychic low and high, subtle and
low and high, causal. And that's

315
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,260
a vocabulary that works for me.
Of course, the universe is so

316
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,040
deep and has so many hundreds of
levels, those are just

317
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,380
approximations, and I don't have
any vested interest in a

318
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,380
particular model of the
universe, or model of how many

319
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,240
levels of consciousness there
are when I was going through and

320
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,020
writing a book and looking back
retrospectively at where this

321
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,680
journey went and how many core
Death and Rebirth cycles. There

322
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,160
were, there many sub cycles of
death and rebirth, but four

323
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,480
fundamental death and rebirth
cycles, and therefore different

324
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,080
levels of consciousness. One
moves into, I found I

325
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,940
differentiated five levels. The
first takes place at the

326
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,840
personal mind, the level of
personal mind, and that

327
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,160
culminates in ego death, where
you lose your egoic or time

328
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,500
space identity. The second takes
place, or took place, for me, at

329
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,740
the collective mind. It's
dynamics fundamentally at the

330
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,500
early, subtle levels of
consciousness. It has to do with

331
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,920
the species mind, dimensions of
species existence. The third

332
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:48,400
level is archetypal mind, where
one is moving into the highest

333
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,100
subtle level, moving beyond
simply the collective

334
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,480
consciousness of the species,
moving into different levels of

335
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,900
archetypal reality. The fourth
for me, is causal mind, causal

336
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,940
oneness, where you're moving
into profound states of non dual

337
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,160
reality, causal reality. And
then the fifth is, I call

338
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,420
diamond Luminosity, a
particularly deep, clear

339
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,840
experience of ultra clear,
particularly clear dimension of

340
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,960
life. And there are many, many
different, you know, degrees of

341
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,160
light that one encounters. The
closest I could find in the

342
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,100
conventional spiritual
literature to this was in the

343
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,260
Buddhist concept of Dharmakaya,
the clear light of absolute

344
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:42,220
reality, the light that pre that
exists prior to the Big Bang,

345
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,600
right?

346
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,780
Unknown: Stan even kind of talks
about that with his first LSD

347
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,740
experience, right? Yeah. He's
talking about, you know, the

348
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,300
proceeding and

349
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,540
Kyle Buller: way out, yeah,
yeah,

350
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,620
Unknown: thinking about these
levels of consciousness and

351
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,220
thinking about this, like kind
of new psychedelic Renaissance

352
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,420
with psychedelic therapy. How
important do you think it is for

353
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,380
therapists to kind of understand
these, these levels of

354
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,720
consciousness when working with
clients,

355
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Kyle Buller: if you're going to
be a psychedelic therapist? Of

356
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,120
course, because there are many
different levels of

357
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,100
consciousness. As a therapist,
one works at different levels of

358
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,200
consciousness. So I don't think
a therapist has to have deep

359
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,880
familiarity with all the levels
to work at the early levels, but

360
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,880
I think conventional wisdom,
it's a good wisdom that if

361
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,340
you're going to be working with
clients going into deep,

362
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,100
Non-ordinary states of
consciousness. You must be

363
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,360
personally familiar with those
states. Otherwise. How can you

364
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,700
be the stabilizing factor in the
room when someone is losing

365
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,480
their mind and is terrified of
losing everything they know to

366
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,700
be real, if you haven't been
there yourself, if you haven't

367
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,660
learned to let go, how can you
help someone else let go at

368
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,780
those deep levels? So I think
it's very important, and that

369
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,900
poses a challenge, of course, in
training psychedelic therapists,

370
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,620
because we're in this great
period now, but that's going to

371
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,260
be changing. We're going to be
moving into a different legal

372
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,520
environment soon. I hope the
work that you guys are doing,

373
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,620
and other people are doing is
really creating new

374
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,160
possibilities. But I think, you
know, personal experience is

375
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,600
really important in this area.

376
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,460
Unknown: Yeah, thanks for that.
It's been a hot kind of topic. I

377
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,640
guess that people have been
exploring, should therapists

378
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,660
really understand this, this
these layers of consciousness

379
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,700
and these experiences to be a
guide,

380
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,960
Joe Moore: which is interesting,
this whole idea of, yes, you can

381
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,500
get this training, but you don't
necessarily need a session. But

382
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,980
then there's this whole vast
realm of religious and

383
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,000
philosophy like this material
that discusses all of these

384
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,100
states in kind of a literature
form. Or we can go experiential

385
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,320
with it, too. And I, my problem
lately is I really want a very

386
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,760
strong argument for this, and I
haven't really personally been

387
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,960
able to come up with one,

388
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,260
Kyle Buller: a strong argument
for the importance of personal

389
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,860
experience

390
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,440
Joe Moore: here, at least
personally, at least personal

391
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,660
experience. But the point I
think, that you made, which is

392
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:29,480
unique, is there's these very
complex spiritual experiences

393
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,660
you can have, Transpersonal
experiences you have, and that's

394
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,260
not really discussed in the
literature, as far as I can

395
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,040
tell, in terms of the, at least
the recent literature, like, how

396
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,420
do you talk to somebody about
this? You know, yes, you became

397
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,100
Buddha for a millennia, and now
you're trying to, you know, work

398
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,840
at your day job again. What?
What do you do? But, yeah, any

399
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,520
comments on that kind of thing?

400
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,600
Kyle Buller: Well, I think it's
important for people to have a

401
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,800
good, solid theoretical
grounding. I mean, I think it's

402
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,280
important to read deeply in
Transpersonal psychology, and

403
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,000
works like Stan Grof and the
various people who have been

404
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,480
guiding people or taking people
into these domains, and have

405
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,400
compiled a large database,
experiential database. But if

406
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,380
you don't have personal
experience of these realities,

407
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,960
you're always working at a
disadvantage, and you can have a

408
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,980
verbal understanding of what it
means to go through into certain

409
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,320
territories. But if you haven't
some personal exposure of this

410
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
territory, you're going to make
mistakes. You're going to draw

411
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,220
inferences where an experienced
journeyer would not draw those

412
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,860
inferences. You're going to find
correlations where there aren't

413
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,920
correlations. You'll miss
correlations where there are

414
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,940
correlations. These are very,
very complex experiences. I

415
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,960
mean, my journey lasted from 79
to 99 right, covering a 20 year

416
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,240
spread. I didn't publish this
book for another 20 years, and

417
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,300
partly that was because of the
legal complications I had to

418
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,840
retire from the university
before I did this. But partly it

419
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,040
took me years during the
sessions and years after the

420
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,760
sessions to work out the
complex, overlapping

421
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,520
phenomenology of these states of
consciousness. And you know, if

422
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,420
I were, I mean, I think the word
guide is maybe not the best

423
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,880
word. I mean that implies a role
of active guidance, of active

424
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,740
direction, which is not really
the case for I think, working

425
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:43,000
with much of this work, doing
much of this work, but to be a

426
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,480
sitter, to be able to hold the
ground, to be able to help

427
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,360
somebody go to the edge of
everything they know to be real

428
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,900
and true about themselves and
about the world, and help them

429
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
jump over the edge, to give them
the support that they need to

430
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,800
lose their mind, to really let
go of everything they know To be

431
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,140
real and true, I don't know how
one could really do that without

432
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,800
having first hand experience of
those domains. And so to that

433
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,460
extent, the I think the
effectiveness of therapists are

434
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,800
sitters will be limited to their
own depth of experience. They

435
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,240
can be very, very good and
skillful at levels one, two,

436
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,020
perhaps, but maybe not so much
at levels three, four or five,

437
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,940
or whatever you get the sense of

438
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,260
Unknown: it, right? That's
that's kind of interesting to

439
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,800
think about, even like practical
stuff, like going to different

440
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,800
people for different like
sessions, maybe, I mean,

441
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,040
obviously you have no idea what
the hell is going to come up,

442
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,000
right? But somebody focusing
more on personal dynamics,

443
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,420
right?

444
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,660
Kyle Buller: Yeah, and I think
it's good right now, we're

445
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,440
proceeding very slowly, very
methodically. We're using

446
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,180
gentler psychedelics. There's no
federal protocol that's

447
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,220
suggesting using LSD and the
quantum, the high levels that I

448
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,220
used it, and I think that's
that's good, that's important.

449
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,840
It's important that we proceed
methodologically carefully. We

450
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,680
have a window. You know, we lost
our window 40 years ago. Yeah,

451
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,120
the window is back. And it's
important that we move very

452
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,820
judiciously as we expand that
window, but sooner or later,

453
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,920
we're going to find what we
found in the early years of

454
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,140
psychedelic work, and that is
healing the personal unconscious

455
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,780
is only the first step of a long
journey into the universe, into

456
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,220
the deeper dimensions of
consciousness which take us into

457
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,640
the I don't know what do you
call it? I think of it as the

458
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,840
mind of the universe, the mind
of the cosmos. I hesitate to

459
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,740
call it the divine mind, or the
mind of God, because that

460
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,100
language has very strong
cultural overtones that I don't

461
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,780
really want to import. But when
one dissolves. Evolves when one

462
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,520
completely dissolves time space
level and just dissolves into

463
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,980
increasingly comprehensive
fields of experience that open

464
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,960
realities to you that you've
never even dreamed possible. And

465
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,740
if you go back again and again
in a methodical way, levels of

466
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,820
consciousness that at first
swallow you up whole, and it's

467
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,580
very, very hard to stay
consciously aware at these new

468
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,340
levels. And that's why I think
we often call them ineffable,

469
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,060
but right if you go back
consistently over and over

470
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,960
again, what happens is, you
acclimate, you learn how to stay

471
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,160
conscious at levels of
consciousness that previously

472
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,400
were not able to stay conscious
in and that's a pattern that

473
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,640
repeats itself as you go deeper
and deeper.

474
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,900
Joe Moore: Yeah, I find that to
be really true. Are you familiar

475
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:59,080
with this gentleman, Kalin de ai
from Detroit, I'm not. He is a

476
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,480
very strong proponent of these
high level doses. And I, I

477
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,280
struggle with his arguments
around it, but, but yours, you

478
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,220
know, seems quite sensible.
It's, you know, how do we

479
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,760
approach it?

480
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,200
Kyle Buller: I'm not a proponent
of high doses myself. I mean, I

481
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,540
did this work. I came through
it. See, in the early years, the

482
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,260
early high dose work done at
Spring Grove Hospital with

483
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,520
terminally ill patients. Well,
it's limited to three sessions.

484
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,980
Low dose psychedelic work, open
ended, high dose work was

485
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,740
limited to three sessions. And I
thought, going into it, I

486
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,240
thought, well, if you could do
it safely three times, you could

487
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,300
do it safely more time. But what
I found was that by doing it as

488
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,320
systematically as I did, and
pushing that edge as hard as I

489
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:57,640
did, it required that issues
arose, challenges arose which

490
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,660
had not been discussed in the
early levels of the work,

491
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,220
opportunities for insights and
understanding emerge, but also

492
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,020
challenges navigating these
increasingly intense levels and

493
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,280
large levels of consciousness
and what it does to your body

494
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,180
and mind and as you go into
these realities and how It

495
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,960
affects people around you, I
found that my students never

496
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,500
knew about my work. I mean, I
kept my work completely isolated

497
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,120
from anyone on campus, but I
found at a certain point, my

498
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,620
students began to be activated
by my psychedelic work. There

499
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:42,220
was a natural contagion that was
happening because consciousness

500
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,820
at these deeper levels is open
ended. It's like a lake. You

501
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,700
throw a rock in the lake and
ripple spread out. So when one

502
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,720
person goes very, very deep,
people around them are naturally

503
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,280
going to be impacted. And I had
to learn how to take care of the

504
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:03,060
activations that my my students
were experiencing. That's I

505
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,440
wrote the book living classroom,
Sri, that came out of years and

506
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,120
years of trying to understand
this dynamic between my mind and

507
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,260
their mind and our minds
together in the context of, you

508
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,100
know, consciousness at large. So
it's not just a matter of taking

509
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,020
care of your own body and your
own emotions and your intimate

510
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,620
relationships, and taking care
of everyone who's touched by

511
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,640
your work at a larger collective
level. I wouldn't push it as

512
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,240
hard if I were doing it again. I
would. It's not that I would

513
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,420
avoid working with high doses,
but I would balance it working

514
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,640
with lower doses, and I would
balance working with LSD, which

515
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,080
pushes a high cosmological
ceiling with Psilocybin work and

516
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:53,140
Ayahuasca work is much more kind
of embodied psychedelic states.

517
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,740
Unknown: Yeah, man, there's a
couple questions I want to ask.

518
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,740
Much direction I want to go
into, but I want to come back to

519
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,700
the this idea, the ripples,
right? Because I've thought

520
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,880
about this a lot, and I'm kind
of curious what your take is on

521
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,940
this, of having some of these
experiences. And I've even had

522
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,080
it in Breathwork sessions, where
it's like tapping into, I guess,

523
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,540
how you describe it, like this,
this lake, you know, you kind of

524
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,940
toss it in and there's like,
ripples and time wave or

525
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,500
something like that, where all
these kind of synchronistic

526
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,320
things might start happening.
And I'm wondering, from your

527
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,600
perspective, you know, you're
talking about your students

528
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,500
changing, do you think that was
more in the sense of your

529
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,560
presence and the way that you
were showing up, or do you think

530
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,980
it was kind of more in that
subtle realm, world where you're

531
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,200
going into these states and it
is having more of a ripple on

532
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,880
some other sort of level.

533
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,280
Kyle Buller: I think it's a
both, and I think it does as my

534
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,240
work changed me, certainly my
presence in the classroom

535
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,020
changed. But the more
interesting aspect, I think, is

536
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,740
working at the subtle level. I
mean, I began, for example.

537
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,580
Example. I found that when I was
lecturing and just just looking

538
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,340
for a random example, looking
for an example to illustrate

539
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,000
some concept that I wanted to,
you know, was bringing forward,

540
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,440
and I would pause, I would just
stop, and my mind would go

541
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,080
blank, and I this idea would
come to me to give this example,

542
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,620
I would use that example. And
students began to come up to me

543
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,060
after class and began to say,
very quietly when they were sure

544
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,060
no one was listening. You know,
it's funny, you use that example

545
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,820
today, because that's exactly
what happened to me this week.

546
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,180
And this first, I thought this
was just, you know, an

547
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,860
interesting accident, but it
kept happening. It happened

548
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,640
repeatedly. And not only was it
happening frequently enough that

549
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,560
I knew it was it had to have
some significance, but the

550
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,300
deeper I went in my own work,
the more the students were being

551
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:00,100
touched in very, very deep,
private, personal areas of their

552
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,780
life, lies places where they
needed healing, places where

553
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,200
they were blocked, places where
they needed some help getting

554
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,520
through to the next stage of
their own development. So as I

555
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,420
was kind of facing my blocks and
entering into deep communion

556
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,160
with the intelligence of life,
it was as if the very fabric the

557
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,940
intelligent fabric around me was
being activated and triggering

558
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,560
these kind of aha moments with
my students and their own

559
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,160
confrontations with their
blocks. And the students knew

560
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,280
that something unusual was
happening. I couldn't exactly

561
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,660
explain what it was, but I had
to, you know, we all knew

562
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,720
something was happening, so I
would have students taking my

563
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,140
courses, partly for the
intellectual content, partly

564
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,400
because they wanted to be in the
energy of the room. But I found

565
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,760
it wasn't just that there was a
resonance spontaneously

566
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,320
occurring between my energy and
their energy. There was a second

567
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,000
phenomenon that I discuss in the
living classroom, and that is

568
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,620
the effect of group fields. That
is that just like morphogenetic

569
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,380
fields, Rupert sheldrakes,
concept of Morphic fields,

570
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,040
except these are smaller. These
are not species wide field.

571
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,460
These are more specific fields,
I found that there was, there

572
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,380
were psychic fields growing
around my courses that were

573
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,100
getting stronger year by year,
the more students studied with

574
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,060
me in these courses, and it was
a field that was being generated

575
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,660
by their learning. So hundreds
and hundreds of students

576
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,980
learning over many years creates
a field that was impacting and

577
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,480
accelerating and deepening the
learning of subsequent students

578
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,220
in subsequent semesters. So
there were multiple factors

579
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,780
going into this phenomenon.

580
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,800
Unknown: Yeah, it's super
fascinating, and I don't know

581
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,000
how to make sense of it at
times. So yeah, thanks for

582
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,540
sharing that.

583
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,780
Kyle Buller: But you know, it
turns out that once you let go

584
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,420
of an atomistic psychology, once
you and it's not that atomistic

585
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,600
psychology is really true. That
is the psychology which treats

586
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,140
our individual consciousness as
the individual, standalone

587
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,460
phenomenon. We know that that's
true, but underneath that is a

588
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,140
quantum reality. It's a quantum
psychology, and once you let go

589
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,360
of this idea that everything
that happens around us can be

590
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,440
explained in terms of the of the
aggregate of simply individual

591
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,640
awareness and open to this
larger participatory Cosmos

592
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,620
where there is a deeper context.
It's like a deeper tide that's

593
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,080
always moving in and out. It's
always flowing. It actually

594
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:46,300
becomes very coherent. It's very
easy to understand. It says that

595
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,540
you have to shift your
metaphysical basis, right?

596
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,080
Unknown: Yeah, that makes sense.
That makes sense.

597
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,179
Kyle Buller: It's like plate
tectonics. You know, in the

598
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:58,419
early years, it was very, very
hard to see that just looked

599
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:02,999
ridiculous. But once we began to
see it, then a whole lot of data

600
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:05,639
began to make sense, and it was
elegant and simple and

601
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:06,359
transparent.

602
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,280
Unknown: Yeah, I'm curious also
to kind of go back to that idea

603
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,780
of kind of incorporating
mushrooms in Ayahuasca. You kind

604
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,660
of said that it seems to be a
little bit more body medicine.

605
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,380
Could you talk about the
difference between your

606
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,940
experiences with LSD and the
more plant based psychedelics.

607
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,080
This is a question that we've
been asked a lot, and I think we

608
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,860
even chatted about in our course
last two nights ago, of like,

609
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,380
you know, what is the difference
between like, LSD? Is that a

610
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,140
little bit different that like?
I've always like somebody said,

611
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,480
I always heard it's like, more
psychological than say, you

612
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,120
know, more kind of like
biographical and doesn't have

613
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,720
this, like spirit, right? Where
you Albert Hoffman said, right?

614
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,860
He said, Psilocybin seems to be
something in there, right? So,

615
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,360
yeah, I wonder what your take
is.

616
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,920
Kyle Buller: Well, inevitably,
my take is based on my own.

617
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,360
Personal experience, and so it's
always dangerous to generalize

618
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,960
on an end of one. So I just
don't want to over generalize

619
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,120
psychedelics, which have been
used historically, have fields

620
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,200
associated with them. So we've
been using mushrooms for 1000s

621
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,740
and 1000s of years, and I think
there's a certain sense in which

622
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,380
around the biochemistry of this
substance, there are fields of

623
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,300
human experience of human beings
engaging the deeper dimensions

624
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,960
of their own consciousness and
consciousness at large using

625
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,780
this substance. And when one
takes this substance, you don't

626
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,220
just introduce a chemical into
your body, which then you have a

627
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,640
private experience of this
substance. But there is a sense

628
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,140
in which how this substance
affects you is mediated, in

629
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,940
part, by the history of your
species with this substance. And

630
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,720
I think that's also true with
Ayahuasca. There's a multi 1000

631
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,080
year history surrounding
Ayahuasca with LSD, we don't

632
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,980
have those fields. I mean, LSD
is a new substance, and I don't

633
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:11,100
think the difference is
fundamentally organic versus

634
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,460
synthetic. I don't find that
discussion terribly

635
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,300
illuminating. I mean, our
experience in the 60s and 70s,

636
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,440
that's a few decades, that's not
a whole lot of experience when

637
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,680
it comes to these types of
fields that I'm talking about.

638
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,460
So in my experience, that living
quality, that kind of living

639
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:36,440
intelligence quality, I'm sure
that there are spiritual

640
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,680
agencies on the other side which
may account for part of that and

641
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,980
but part of it, I think, has to
do with humanity's living

642
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,160
experience with these substances
and all the experiences I've had

643
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,840
with them. LSD strikes me as
kind of cleaner in that respect.

644
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:58,240
It doesn't have that same kind
of programmed quality. Now I

645
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,960
don't know what it would have
been like if I had been working

646
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,200
with low doses of LSD. If I'd
been working with low doses, I'm

647
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,200
sure it would have activated my
experiences would have been much

648
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,980
more personal and
psychodynamically oriented. But

649
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,240
working with the very high doses
that I worked with, after the

650
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,300
first 15 sessions or so, when
the sessions were at their peak

651
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,320
hours, I was not working in
relationship to my personal

652
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:31,160
psyche at all. In fact, pretty
much in the book, I drop out the

653
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,900
personal story as much as
possible, because the personal

654
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,140
story kind of showed up at the
beginning of a session and at

655
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,940
the end of a session. And these
were very meaningful experiences

656
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,760
to me. They were very healing.
They were very, you know,

657
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,900
helpful and giving me insights
to relevant things in my life.

658
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,340
But during the peak hours, I was
usually operating far beyond the

659
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:00,060
range of personal psyche. When
I'm working with Psilocybin, I

660
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,720
don't have that experience of
being so far removed from my

661
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,820
personal reality. I don't have I
only have limited experience

662
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,700
with Ayahuasca. I like the
medicine very much. It's a very

663
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,700
powerful medicine. It's been
given me some extra ordinary

664
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,260
help and extraordinary clarity
here and there, but I don't have

665
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,360
enough experience with it
comparable to my 70 some high

666
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:29,000
dose LSD sessions to do a
careful AB my basic sense is

667
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:39,020
that Psilocybin tends to be less
evocative, less disruptive, less

668
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,960
opening up to the deep, deep
levels. Ayahuasca is more

669
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,900
disruptive, opening up to deeper
levels still. And at least for

670
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:56,920
me, LSD, working with it as I
did, opens up to very, very deep

671
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,000
cosmological levels. Eventually,
I don't know of people I have

672
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,020
not seen, though I haven't tried
to do an exhaustive search in

673
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,160
the literature, but I have not
seen people having experiences

674
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,260
with Psilocybin and, for the
most part, even Ayahuasca, that

675
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:21,680
correlate to the experiences I
was having in the last 10 years

676
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,760
of my work with LSD. But again,
that's just my personal

677
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,900
experience. It's, you know, it's
not a scholarly person, right?

678
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,100
Unknown: Yeah. And what were
some of your experiences like

679
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,840
towards the last 10 years? Like,
I guess, yeah. Could you give us

680
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,080
some examples of, like, those
big themes that you're working

681
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,540
through, if it wasn't so
personal or psychodynamic?

682
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,480
Kyle Buller: Well, you know,
that's that's a hard question,

683
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,460
because there's so many levels,
and there's so many of some it's

684
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,040
always tricky to kind of jump
in. To the later stages, because

685
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,840
every state builds upon earlier
stages. But right one of the one

686
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,680
of the barometers I would
mention, for example, would be

687
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:19,260
time when I went into subtle
level reality. I for a year, I

688
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,160
had a consistent set of
experiences where I experienced

689
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,760
the totality of my life from
beginning to end as

690
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:35,120
simultaneously present in
immediate now. So I not only had

691
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,140
insights into my old age, and I
didn't experience my age in a

692
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,900
sort of abstract, theoretical
way I experienced, the distilled

693
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,180
essence of my entire life boiled
down to right now, and all of

694
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,220
the data of my life was present
at this particular moment in

695
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:59,440
time. This was such a mind
shattering possibility that when

696
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,280
I first came back out of this
experience. I couldn't remember

697
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,120
it. It took me entering into it
multiple times to be able to

698
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,200
really be able to hold on to all
of those experiences, which I

699
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,320
write about in the chapter
called deep time in the soul.

700
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,720
Going beyond that, I began to
enter into archetypal dimensions

701
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,380
of archetypal reality. I began
to have experiences of something

702
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,060
like the Platonic domain of the
reality behind time, space

703
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,200
reality, except it wasn't
archetypes like Plato conceives

704
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,180
of them. Plato conceives of
archetypes as unchanging ideas

705
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,860
in the mind of a transcendent
intelligence. My experience,

706
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:48,940
these were vast, huge beings
that were so huge I couldn't

707
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,680
wrap my mind around them. The
best my mind could do in imaging

708
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,640
them was to sort of see them as
galaxies. I think was simply my

709
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,380
mind's attempt to image
something that one would measure

710
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,060
in hundreds of 1000s of light
years of scope. But these were

711
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,080
beings that were responsible for
creating time and space and

712
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:17,520
orchestrating the unfolding of
reality in time and space I went

713
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,240
into, into what I call deep
time, which is not eternity, it

714
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,620
isn't timelessness, but it's
different magnitudes of time

715
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,920
experienced within a
simultaneous or broader frame of

716
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,060
reference. So I had many
experiences, and became one of

717
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,140
the overarching themes of my
book of my sessions, and

718
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:44,380
therefore the book of humanity's
future, where humanity was

719
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,000
going, what our moment in
history was, what the archetypal

720
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,220
trajectory of humanity was, what
was happening behind the scenes

721
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,540
in this global sustainability
crisis that we're entering into.

722
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,600
What I have a chapter in the
book called The Birth of the

723
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,600
future human lots and lots of
going into deep time, going deep

724
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,820
into humanity's future,
experiencing what is attempting

725
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:20,540
to be born in this period of
History. What how evolution

726
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:26,660
works on this larger, broader
scale, and then eventually going

727
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:31,880
deep into various episodes of
causal oneness, Shunyata,

728
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,740
emptiness, the experience of
primal void, you know, the void

729
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:43,540
that's behind physical manifest
existence, experience of cosmic

730
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,800
love, cause of just being
overwhelmed with and I think

731
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,160
love is basically a kind of
characteristic of the inherent

732
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,100
oneness of life. When you
experience the deep, deep

733
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:59,740
oneness that existence is, then
you know the emotional

734
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,540
counterpart of that is love.
It's compassion, the emotion of

735
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:08,280
oneness, and then eventually
going beyond oneness, beyond the

736
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,360
void, into this diamond
Luminosity state which, once I

737
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,420
touched the diamond Luminosity,
this occupied the last five

738
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:22,760
years of my work. Once I touched
it, it was a state of state of

739
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,980
being, state of consciousness so
incredibly clear, so exquisitely

740
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,340
clear that once I touched it, I
wasn't interested in exploring

741
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,980
any of the other dimensions of
consciousness that I had been

742
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,480
exploring for years. Returning
to that condition became my sole

743
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,360
objective in the next in the 26
chapter, 26 sessions, covering

744
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,900
four years of work, I only
touched that condition four

745
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:54,040
times, and in between those four
sessions were tremendous

746
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,620
cleaning, tremendous
purification, tremendous

747
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,920
detoxification, so that I could
return to that condition.

748
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,660
Conversation and experience it
more clearly, more completely.

749
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,120
So this, there's a lot of
levels, and yeah, that's what

750
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,160
makes the story a complex story
to tell.

751
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,620
Unknown: Yeah, well, and people
should check out the book and

752
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,720
read through all this. So, yeah,
yeah.

753
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,660
Kyle Buller: Well, it's nice now
that the book is out, you know,

754
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,700
they don't have to get it from
me speaking. You know, I've done

755
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:27,080
my best to tell the story as
cleanly and simply as I can with

756
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,860
without a lot of the
philosophical baggage that may

757
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,720
have been in some of my earlier
works.

758
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,160
Joe Moore: Right? Is there a
story that you'd like to tell

759
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,440
the most about your project,
that that maybe you could share

760
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,580
here, or any, any kind of
specific gem you like to share

761
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,240
the most.

762
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:54,580
Kyle Buller: You know, it's a
story of a journey, and every

763
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:58,840
phase of the journey was an
exciting adventure in its own

764
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,220
right. At the time when I was
entering into that territory.

765
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,500
And each one was absolutely
fascinating and captivating to

766
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,060
me when I was going through this
material. And so I don't have a

767
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,660
favorite, per se. I mean, I
think, of course, the diamond

768
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,260
Luminosity is from my own
personal heart. That is the

769
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:28,760
deepest dimensions of the story,
the deepest aspect, I think the

770
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,140
story of the birth of the future
human, where reincarnation is

771
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:37,820
taking humanity, is an important
component of the story, because

772
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,700
I what happened to me in one
particular session, in the 38th

773
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,580
session, without this cutting
down to the important piece here

774
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,500
is that I began to experience
all my lives coming into me, all

775
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,860
my former lives were kind of
being integrated. And I've done

776
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,660
a lot of other work, hypnotic
regression work, to familiarize

777
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,620
myself with some of my deep life
history, but I experienced all

778
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,380
my former lives coming in very
quickly. It was like wrapping

779
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,960
string on around a kite spool.
And there came a moment when all

780
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,920
of that energy with all those
living experiences, they fused.

781
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,420
And when they fuse, they
ignited. And there was a

782
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:25,040
tremendous explosion of diamond
light from my chest, and it

783
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,220
threw me into a completely
different state of consciousness

784
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:32,300
and and I think what I was being
shown in this experience, what I

785
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,420
was being given was an
understanding of where

786
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,960
reincarnation is taking us,
because, classically,

787
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,880
reincarnation, you know, leads
to a gradual, hopefully a

788
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,080
sustained, development of more
compassion, more understanding,

789
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,880
developing our qualities of our
deep essential nature, more and

790
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,140
more richer and richer levels.
We make mistakes, we go back, we

791
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,680
learn, we go forward in this
process. But I don't think the

792
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,900
process is really about taking
us incrementally to eventually

793
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:09,180
producing a better life, which
is incrementally plus one from

794
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,920
where we were previously. I
think eventually, if we die and

795
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,520
we expand in the after death
condition, we're born and we

796
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,280
contract into an immediate one
life focus, we die and we

797
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,580
expand, and we're born. We go
back and forth. And if we keep

798
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,600
this up, just for hundreds and
1000s and 10s of 1000s and

799
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,080
hundreds of 1000s of years, if
we keep this up, sooner or

800
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:38,540
later, the totality of our
consciousness, which most people

801
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:42,760
would experience only after they
die, the deep soul, sooner or

802
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,720
later, that soul consciousness,
I think the evolutionary

803
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,740
trajectory is for this
consciousness to wake up inside

804
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,100
our physical incarnation, and
that's what I call the birth of

805
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,900
the diamond soul, when you wake
up and we are not tempted to

806
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,600
identify with simply egoic this
body, mind, kind of structure

807
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,880
that we know ourselves to be, an
internal being. We know

808
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,040
ourselves to be in relationship
with other eternal beings. We

809
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,000
have a felt sense of history
with many, many of these beings,

810
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,500
and the compassion that comes
with that history and a sense of

811
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,900
open transparency to the cosmic
intelligence at large. I think

812
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,500
that's basically where we're
going. And I don't know, I think

813
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,960
this is not a private
experience. It's a collective

814
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,800
experience. The universe doesn't
work in small numbers. The

815
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,180
universe works with whole
species. And what's happening is

816
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,140
really an evolving of our entire
species in the direction. If

817
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,680
there are one thing, I guess, to
keep, I would come back to one

818
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,640
thing which I wish I could tell
of reach into my heart and

819
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,960
communicate to people it would
be to let go of this terribly

820
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,560
constricting fear of death.
Because if we're afraid of

821
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,240
dying. We've got it all
backwards. You know, here's

822
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,720
where the hard work is done.
When we die, we have all this

823
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,780
Hollywood bullshit about what
happens to us when we die, and

824
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,820
most of it, most of it's just
trash. When we die, we enter,

825
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,920
you know, we go back home, we
enter. The vast majority of us

826
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,340
enter, pretty, very easily,
straight into the depth of where

827
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:29,540
we come from. And there are many
layers of that reality. So

828
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:35,120
there's a lot of work to do, but
there's absolutely nothing to

829
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,060
fear of death. And one of the
things that's come out of my

830
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:42,280
work is I just, I don't have a
fear of death. I mean, dying is

831
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,860
pain in the ass, but being dead
has absolutely no fear for me.

832
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,800
In fact, it's something I look
forward to very much.

833
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,140
Joe Moore: Kyle, how do you
respond to that

834
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,460
Unknown: that resonates a lot
with me, of what you're saying,

835
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,960
like, kind of gave me a little
bit of chills. So I don't know

836
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,940
if you know my my story.
Listeners probably know this, if

837
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,060
you've been following us for a
while, but when I was 16, I had

838
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:15,420
a Near-Death Experience, and so
rupture my spleen when I was in

839
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:20,900
the MRI or the CAT scan machine,
I was overwhelmed with this,

840
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:25,580
this blissful feeling of love
and beauty that I was going back

841
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:28,520
home, and there is a sense
something came over me and said,

842
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,620
You're going back home, you're
going to you're going back to

843
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,740
the stars, where we all come
from, and this, you know,

844
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,260
physical life is going to cease
to exist, but you're going to

845
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:41,980
continue on. And that was really
beautiful, and it wasn't scary

846
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,420
when I when I first heard I was
dying in like they said, you

847
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,600
know, you have internal
injuries. You're losing massive

848
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,980
blood. I thought, you know, I
was pretty terrified. But in

849
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:59,200
that moment, as I was drifting
away, total acceptance, and so I

850
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,400
actually had a really hard time
coming back here, right? Because

851
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,220
it was, and I could probably
resonate with that idea, the

852
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,700
diamond Luminosity of wanting to
return there, because I

853
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,580
definitely resonate with that
feeling of wanting to return to

854
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:15,240
that oneness that I felt on that
night. And that's what got me

855
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,820
into like exploring
psychedelics, is having very

856
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,900
similar experiences with
psychedelics and correlating

857
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,140
that to my Near-Death
Experience, and wanting to get

858
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:28,280
back there and over time. And
maybe you'll resonate with this

859
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,260
is like the period in between of
stopping and actually focusing

860
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,800
on the integration. And I keep
coming back to this idea that

861
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,560
the work is here. This is where
all the magic happens. And how

862
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,860
do we really embody that and
show up.

863
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,940
Kyle Buller: Yeah, yeah. To
complain about the restrictions

864
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,700
of time and space is kind of
like a weight lifter complaining

865
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,900
about the weights. This is
where, this is where the work is

866
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,620
done. Time space is an extremely
demanding environment, but

867
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,640
progress made here has
exponential import for what

868
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,500
we're what's available to us
when we die. Of all the various

869
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,160
populations, people I feel the
closest affinity from my own

870
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,640
psychedelic work are the near
death episode people. I've

871
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,100
taught near death episode
research for years at my

872
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:18,540
university in one of my courses,
and so I've really read deeply

873
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,340
in the near death literature,
and that's the closest

874
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:25,940
correlation I find with the
deepest of the psychedelic

875
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,300
experiences, very strong
correlations. And Ken ring was

876
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,900
one of the near dev episode, you
know, one of the founders of

877
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,020
that movement, and I have, we've
written together and dialog

878
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,700
together. He's a good friend
around that.

879
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,660
Unknown: Yeah, yeah. It's, it's
a powerful topic, something I

880
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:49,120
think about often, right? And I
guess my early experiences got

881
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,720
me really on this path. Was just
like I entered into this space

882
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,100
where just felt so similar with
like this. I had an experience

883
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,920
with Psilocybin, or just so on
par with dying, and just

884
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,700
captivated my attention of how
could a substance like this? I

885
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,980
mean, I guess in a sense, you
know, if you take it from the

886
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,000
psychotherapeutic like lens,
it's like reliving trauma,

887
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,180
right? I'm kind of, my psyche is
processing that experience, and

888
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,240
I'm going back there to kind of
reprocess it, but that plenty of

889
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,860
other experiences where it still
felt pretty similar and on par

890
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,840
with that original Near-Death
Experience.

891
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:29,540
Kyle Buller: Yeah, I've died
many times, and I feel like and

892
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,440
that was the whole impetus in
the early work at Spring Grove,

893
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,560
was to give people a foretaste
of where they're going and they

894
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,720
die. And, you know, I've gone
through that in shamans. This is

895
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,380
very familiar territory, so
there's nothing unique to me

896
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,560
there, but I've gone through
that death process so many times

897
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:53,740
it feels very comfortable and
very natural, and coming back is

898
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,820
sometimes challenging. I mean,
the hardest chapter for me to

899
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:02,460
write in this book. Was the last
chapter coming off the mountain.

900
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,820
It basically tells a story of
what happened after I stopped my

901
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:14,760
sessions and I basically entered
into a period, eventually, of

902
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:20,300
deep, deep existential
loneliness. I found that I had

903
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,420
really worked very hard in
integrating my sessions. I did

904
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:27,020
all of Albert very carefully. I
wrote them down, I studied them,

905
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,680
I tried to incorporate their
teaching into my life. I really

906
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,880
thought I had it, you know,
locked down pretty well, and I

907
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,700
thought therefore that I could
stop my sessions and I would

908
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:42,460
just be able to kind of collect
and ponder the many gifts that I

909
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,580
had been given through the
years, but what I learned was

910
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,820
that integrating an entire
journey is different than

911
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:53,200
integrating individual sessions,
and that by repeatedly going

912
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,440
deeper and deeper and deeper
into the universe and experience

913
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:01,440
The exquisite ecstasy of
dissolving into sheer light

914
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:06,000
repeatedly and entering into
dissolving into the crystalline

915
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,200
body of the Divine. When, for
various reasons, I made the

916
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,160
decision that it was time for
this work to stop, I found that

917
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:20,180
I had a I was suffering from a
loss of communion, a deep, deep

918
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,960
existential sadness, and
eventually, years down the road,

919
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,620
I found that I was really just
waiting to die, that I could

920
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:33,020
return to the light. And I
realized, you know, that wasn't

921
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:35,540
right. That's not the way this
work is supposed to end. You

922
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:38,900
know, my entire body was
screaming, failure to integrate.

923
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,060
But because I had been so
careful trying to integrate. It

924
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:48,040
wasn't clear what the where the
imbalance had come in. What I

925
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,380
found eventually is that there
was an imbalance that had I had

926
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:57,280
cultivated, inadvertently,
between Transcendence and

927
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,780
immanence. It's all the divine.
The physical universe is the

928
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,380
divine. I knew that it was the
divine. I knew that we're never

929
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,380
absent from the Divine for any
moment. It's only our own

930
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:12,240
illusions to keep us in that
sense. But I had pushed so

931
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,560
deeply into Transcendence that
in this to a certain degree, I

932
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,720
had lost my footing in the
imminent divine, and I had to

933
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:25,460
make a conscious choice and
undertake specific practices to

934
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:30,620
really kind of ground myself
back in the imminent divine for

935
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:34,100
the remainder of my years on
this earth. It took about 10

936
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:39,920
years for me to really get
solidly, comfortably back inside

937
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,320
my time space suit.

938
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,860
Unknown: Wow, I can imagine,
after 20 years of deep

939
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:49,480
exploration. I mean, that's a,
I'd say that's probably a pretty

940
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,440
long integration process, yeah,
yeah.

941
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,960
Kyle Buller: And that's, I
think, you know, in this

942
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,100
respect, my story is sometimes
described as a hero's journey,

943
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:03,120
but it's not the hero's journey
the way it's usually thought of.

944
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,060
It's not simply going and
experiencing something and

945
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,640
bringing back, you know,
something valuable for your

946
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:16,140
culture, for yourself. It's all
it's tempered by, it's tempered

947
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:21,920
by a kind of lesson that comes
from dealing with not the

948
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,800
failure of some aspect of the
journey, but actually of the

949
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:29,420
success of the journey, of being
wounded by the sheer beauty of

950
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:32,360
what one experiences. You
literally are wounded by the

951
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:37,460
beauty of the universe, by the
experiencing the extraordinary

952
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,540
intelligence of the universe,
extraordinary love of the

953
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:45,880
universe. And if you're not able
to create a container inside

954
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:51,160
your historical existence where
you can breathe this

955
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:56,800
intelligence in and breathe the
compassion in, then you know

956
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:04,560
it's like it literally can kind
of become painful. So it my, my

957
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,880
story is in part of it's a
cautionary tale. It cautions

958
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,660
against and even though I tried
to be as methodical as possible

959
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,420
and do it as carefully as
possible and integrated as

960
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:21,920
deeply as I could, it cautions
against going too deep, too

961
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,360
fast. If you can call 20 years
too fast, going too deep or

962
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:33,620
deeper than you can actually
productively use, I think my

963
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:38,840
memories have changed not only
the rest of the years of my

964
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,300
life, but my memories have
changed the trajectory of my

965
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:48,340
soul's entire evolution. So I
don't think of the results of my

966
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:54,700
journey as necessarily coming to
fruition in just, you know, the

967
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:59,920
next few decades, I think they
come to fruition over life.

968
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,140
Times it's changed the entire
trajectory of my deep

969
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,460
evolutionary project. And I
think that's true for anyone who

970
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,820
enters into this. You know, when
you enter into deep intimacy

971
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,080
with life in this way, you
purify, and you're purifying,

972
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,380
you offload a lot of, you know,
painful trauma, whatever,

973
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:25,400
whatever, but you also open up
to a different a different

974
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:31,640
relationship with the universe.
So right now, my primary way of

975
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:35,600
being with the universe in this
intimate way is not working with

976
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,440
psychedelics. That time of my
life is largely over. I'm 70

977
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,920
years old, and this is, you
know, somewhat of a young man's

978
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,780
game, young person's game, but I
do a lot of contemporary of

979
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,420
classical contemplative
practice. I do a lot of

980
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:55,300
Vajrayana practice, which I find
to be very complementary to deep

981
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:01,380
psychedelic work. I don't feel
any cross purposes between the

982
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:06,960
two different work methods of
working. I should mention in

983
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:12,420
this context, though, I think it
would be a mistake to hold to

984
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:19,260
sort of evaluate the the the
value of psychedelic feed

985
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:23,900
psychedelic work by holding it
accountable just to the

986
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:29,900
Enlightenment project. I started
this work with an agenda of an

987
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:35,540
enlightenment project. What
happened was my personal

988
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:41,440
Awakening was completely
eclipsed eventually by a project

989
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:46,960
of a collective awakening. All
my work began to be focused on a

990
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,260
type of healing of the
collective psyche that went

991
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:54,160
beyond my personal healing, and
an awakening of the collective

992
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,760
psyche that went beyond my
personal awakening. And then it

993
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,800
became just a radical adventure,
a cosmological adventure going

994
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,580
so deep that it would be
impossible to bring those

995
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:12,780
experiences back and stabilize
them in some kind of spiritually

996
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:16,440
awakened state. It's just a
different project, the

997
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,980
Enlightenment project and
cosmological exploration

998
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,640
project. These are two different
projects that have to be

999
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:28,280
evaluated on their own terms. My
two cents,

1000
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,460
Unknown: no, yeah, I would agree
it sounds

1001
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:36,680
Joe Moore: Yeah, Hmm, yes, this
is quite the interview.

1002
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:45,460
Certainly like a much, I knew it
was going to be a big topic, but

1003
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:49,000
I'm always impressed by how big
some of these things become. And

1004
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,760
yeah, I I do think some people
are doing similar projects

1005
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,600
nowadays, though. Yeah, I want,
I wonder if LSD is still in

1006
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,800
vogue in this context. I don't
know.

1007
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:07,320
Kyle Buller: I don't know. I
worked with LSD primarily

1008
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,380
because that was the work that
Stan had done most of his early

1009
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:14,820
work with, and I trusted what I
saw in Stan's research, and I

1010
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:19,560
trusted the history there and
the methodology he developed. I

1011
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:23,420
only began to work with other
psychedelic substances pretty

1012
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:29,120
much after my LSD work was done.
And so the mind that I brought

1013
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,380
to my Psilocybin experiences and
my Ayahuasca experiences and

1014
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:38,060
solvia Dip and arm so on so
forth, the mind was that the

1015
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:42,940
mind that had been transformed
by all my previous psychedelic

1016
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,480
work, which is the other thing
to you know, important to take

1017
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:50,680
account of that the mind, the
experiences that we have,

1018
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:55,360
reflect the entire history of
our working in Non-ordinary

1019
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,900
states of consciousness. So if
we've done this work only a few,

1020
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:05,100
a few, two or three times, well,
then we have that kind of depth

1021
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,980
of experience to bring to it.
But if we've been doing this

1022
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:11,340
work for years and years and
years, naturally, these

1023
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:14,640
substances are going to have a
different kind of effect,

1024
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,320
because we've been transformed.
The way I think of this is that

1025
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:24,440
list, in my experience, the
universe is an infinite ocean of

1026
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:28,160
possibilities, just an infinite
ocean of we'll never, ever get

1027
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,460
to the end of it. I used to
think, and we'll get to an end

1028
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:35,600
state. That was the project to
get, to get to the end condition

1029
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,140
that was taken away from me
along the journey, I began to

1030
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:45,100
understand it's an infinite,
infinite progression. I get

1031
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,820
distracted from my original
point by that particular,

1032
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,820
particular image. Yeah, I'll
just stick with that. I lost my

1033
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,480
train of thought.

1034
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:59,740
Joe Moore: But that works for
us, because it's our orientation

1035
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:04,860
is. This Grof Ian meets
Whitehead and John Cobb kind of

1036
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:10,080
synthesis. And, yeah, you know,
largely this, that's at least

1037
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,100
the project of the company here.
But yeah, it's, it's good to

1038
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:20,780
hear that, you know, in it, it
rhymes, in a sense, with that

1039
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:24,800
Bodhisattva vow of, let's keep
going like there's not this end

1040
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,460
point of Nirvana until
everybody's there, and it's

1041
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:32,840
going to be a long, long, long,
long time, if time even enters

1042
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,280
into that discussion,

1043
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:37,220
Kyle Buller: it's a long time,
except, of course, it's speeding

1044
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:41,740
up. You know, it's kind of like
our collective karma as a

1045
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:46,240
species is coming at us hard.
You know, the whole history, you

1046
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,940
know our culture is basically a
culture that's been built by

1047
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:53,140
ego, and for all the many
virtues and values of the ego,

1048
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:56,080
it's basically, it's
fundamentally a fragmented

1049
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,020
condition, and therefore it
creates a world which is deeply

1050
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:02,100
imbalanced with between
ourselves and between other life

1051
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:06,120
forms. And you know that world
is coming to a radical and

1052
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,680
accelerated breakdown. And I
think this is actually part of

1053
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,360
the evolutionary pivot that we
are coming into a time where we

1054
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:19,740
literally will not be able to
continue operating out the same

1055
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,060
not just an economic or
industrial or technological

1056
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:27,380
basis, but we will not be able
to continue functioning out of

1057
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:30,980
the same psychological basis
that we go at consciousness. So

1058
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:36,200
how fast we might make this
transition? If we use historical

1059
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,560
projections from the past, we
probably deeply underestimate

1060
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,000
how fast this could happen. In
fact, in that chapter on the

1061
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,060
birth of the future human, where
I talk about particularly one

1062
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:50,380
session, session 55 it took me
deep into the death and rebirth

1063
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,160
of humanity. The message that
kept coming through over and

1064
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:57,700
over and over again was, this is
going to happen much faster than

1065
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,540
anyone could have is imagining
it's going to happen much

1066
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:04,740
faster, you know. So I think
we're the game is getting very,

1067
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:08,280
very intense. We're being driven
into non linear dynamics. Feels

1068
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,540
that way, conscious that yeah,
dynamics, the collective psyche

1069
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,100
is being hyper stimulated by the
trauma that we're going into.

1070
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,140
And when systems, we know from
physical systems, when physical

1071
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:24,620
systems enter into non linear
conditions, they can do things

1072
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:28,100
that they could not do when they
were in lower energy linear

1073
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:32,300
conditions. And I think that
something similar happens with

1074
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:36,860
psychic fields, the integrated
psychic field that holds all of

1075
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:40,480
our individual minds, and that
psychic field is hyper

1076
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,620
stimulated by the suffering that
we're going into. But it's hyper

1077
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:47,440
stimulated, it moves, will
eventually move into a non

1078
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,760
linear condition. And the rules
of non linear conditions of

1079
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,140
dynamics apply to psychic fields
as well as physical fields.

1080
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:03,180
Small changes can elicit huge
outcomes, latent connectivity,

1081
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:07,920
which was kind of invisible at
the linear level, becomes

1082
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,000
suddenly active and visible at
the non linear level. Things can

1083
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,300
happen much faster at the non
linear level than at the linear

1084
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:22,160
level. So, you know, we're going
into a trial by fire, and I

1085
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:26,720
think this trial is actually
part of the conscious intention

1086
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,660
of the creative intelligence
itself. I don't think it's

1087
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,960
accidental, and I don't think
there are any victims here. You

1088
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,720
know, personally, my own
personal belief is we all chose

1089
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,920
to be here. We chose to be part
of this time in history. It's an

1090
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,380
extraordinarily important time
to be fully conscious and fully

1091
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:44,980
active.

1092
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:52,660
Unknown: Makes give me chills
thinking about that. It's

1093
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,940
interesting. It does feel like
things are really kind of

1094
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:58,420
speeding up. And you know,
sometimes I'm like, oh, you

1095
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,960
know, you always kind of hear
that as you get older, time

1096
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:05,160
seems to be speeding up. But
even, you know, talk to people

1097
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,440
that are older, like, things
just seem to be happening

1098
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:11,220
quicker and quicker. It is
really interesting. Feel like I

1099
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,260
can't, like, hold on to
anything, you know? It's like,

1100
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,780
once you kind of grasp onto it,
something else has already

1101
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,160
changed form, you know,

1102
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:21,800
Kyle Buller: yeah, yeah. So many
of our, not only our technology

1103
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,040
is driving this way, but our
social customs, you know, just

1104
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,800
They're dissolving right out
from underneath us. The

1105
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,580
standards of truth are changing.
And it's a confusing time, and

1106
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:35,600
it's a it's a dangerous time and
it's a hard time. Wow, it's an

1107
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,120
extraordinarily exciting time.
It is.

1108
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:43,000
Unknown: Do you see psychedelics
aiding in this

1109
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:48,160
Kyle Buller: in any way? Yeah,
absolutely. I think that the

1110
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:52,000
ways in which psychedelics have
come back into our culture, both

1111
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,500
from the Central American and
South American cultures, which

1112
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:02,220
have kept this tradition alive
the. The new psychedelics, you

1113
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:07,200
know, LSD is often compared to
the atom bomb, right? They were

1114
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:11,640
discovered at the same time this
exponential, this opportunity to

1115
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,660
explore dimensions of
consciousness that previously,

1116
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:19,140
previous generations, for the
most part, and classically, have

1117
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,880
had to spend lifetimes
meditating in order just to get

1118
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:28,040
access to some of them, and now
people of even modest spiritual

1119
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:32,780
capacities can have temporary
experiences of these realities,

1120
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:38,420
which have a profound they
require a profound redrafting of

1121
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:42,460
our existential assumptions
about how life works, and that

1122
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:45,880
we can do this. We can engage
these, these dimensions of

1123
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,640
consciousness, not for
recreational purposes and not

1124
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,820
even for healing purposes, but
we can engage them

1125
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:55,780
systematically for educational
and deep, transformational

1126
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:59,560
purposes, not only for our own
personal transformation, but we

1127
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,300
can. We can work on behalf of
the collective in these states

1128
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,680
of consciousness. I mean, I
think psychedelics are just they

1129
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,440
have that's, that's what I saw
when I first read Stan

1130
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,020
Grossberg. I thought, wow, this
is going to change everything.

1131
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:16,800
It's going to be a true before
and after development. We're

1132
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,800
going to it's like the invention
of the as he said, the

1133
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,500
microscope for biology and the
Telescope for Astronomy, it just

1134
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:29,180
increases the quantity of data
we have access to, so that it

1135
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:32,420
changes, it forces a radical
revision of our theoretical

1136
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:36,440
understanding. I think
psychedelics are part of it, and

1137
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,860
just in time, because we have
very little time. Yeah, it feels

1138
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:48,100
that way. Yeah, it's coming at
us very fast, very fast. Cool.

1139
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:52,479
Joe Moore: So I hate to end the
podcast, but we're at over an

1140
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:56,439
hour, and I don't I want to be
respectful of your time, and I

1141
01:16:56,439 --> 01:17:02,579
really appreciate this. This is
a very enlightening episode. Can

1142
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:05,339
you tell us a little bit about
where people can find your book

1143
01:17:05,339 --> 01:17:08,099
and perhaps the upcoming audio
book,

1144
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,860
Kyle Buller: they can find the
book on Amazon. I'm just putting

1145
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:17,760
the final edits on the audio
book. I'm not sure that will be

1146
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,360
released through inner
traditions. I'm not quite sure

1147
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,540
what the vehicle will be for
that, but it should be out,

1148
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:30,740
hopefully by the beginning,
beginning of the year, I will

1149
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:33,860
have a website up. Hopefully by
the first of the year, I'm way

1150
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:37,760
overdue in revising this website
and getting it posted, but

1151
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:42,100
eventually, within a month or
so, people will be able to find

1152
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:48,100
me@chrisbache.com that's going
to be the easiest way right now,

1153
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:53,740
most of my written work and some
tapes are collected@academia.edu

1154
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:02,400
under my name, You can find them
listed there. But right now, I'm

1155
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,640
not as good on social media as I
should be.

1156
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:09,059
Unknown: It's hard to keep up
with Yeah,

1157
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,740
Joe Moore: only do one. It's not
worth being everywhere,

1158
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,020
Kyle Buller: yeah, but the most
what's really exciting is the

1159
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:24,320
book is finally out, and it's as
clear a presentation of this

1160
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,920
material as I've been able to
take me five years to put it

1161
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,240
together and bring it forward,
and it's as it's as good as I

1162
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,320
can tell the story.

1163
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,440
Joe Moore: Well, thank you for
all your work, and really

1164

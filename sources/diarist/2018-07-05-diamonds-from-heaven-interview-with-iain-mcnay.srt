1
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:16,344
Iain McNay: So hello and welcome
again to conscious TV. I'm Ian

2
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:20,780
Mcnay, and my guest today is
Chris Bache, Hi, Chris. Hi, Ian,

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,640
and we found Chris quite
recently. He was doing a lecture

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,260
in London, and I read his short
bio that came along with the

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,140
details for the lecture, and I
thought, What a fascinating

6
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,560
chap. So I invited him, and he
very kindly agreed to come along

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,780
and talk with us today. Chris
has written three books. I only

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,400
have two here, but one is
lifestyles, a study of

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,240
reincarnation in light of
contemporary consciousness

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,980
research. And then this one
here, dark night, early dawn,

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:05,100
Steps to a deep ecology of mind.
And then the living classroom

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,720
teaching and collective
consciousness. And then he has a

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,340
new book, which isn't published
yet, which is going to be called

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,320
diamonds from heaven, a 20 year
journey into the mind of the

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,880
universe. So Chris, let's start
with you had these questions,

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,460
didn't you? You worked for many
years lecturing in comparative

17
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,620
religions, psychology, I think,
to some degree and then. But

18
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,780
there's the how you had these
questions that were burning

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,620
inside you.

20
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,339
Chris Bache: Well, I was trained
as a philosopher of religion.

21
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,459
And philosophers of religion are
concerned with, you know,

22
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:48,519
exploring the deeper questions
of existence, the meaning of

23
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:52,359
life and the structure of the
universe and the limits of human

24
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,099
consciousness. And I had been,
these are the questions I had

25
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:00,899
been trained as pursue in
graduate school. And then I came

26
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,639
to my university, Youngstown
State University, and just as I

27
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:10,679
came there, I encountered the
work of Stanislav Grof in

28
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,319
psychedelic research in his
book, realms of the human

29
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:19,979
unconscious. This was 7819 78
and as soon as I read that book,

30
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,739
I was so deeply impressed with
the caliber of the of the

31
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,459
research that he had done, and
the caliber of his mind that I

32
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,379
knew that I wanted to do this

33
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,679
Iain McNay: work. And the
questions you had were, were

34
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:40,719
questions with a variation about
consciousness, what are is? What

35
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:44,799
are its potentials and patterns?
What are its are its boundaries?

36
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:48,159
These are slightly different
from the not the usual. Who am

37
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,039
I? What am I type questions?
Yeah. So these have been

38
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,919
obviously working in you for a
time,

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
Chris Bache: for a time, yeah,
yeah. When I, when I there were

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,440
two people that I met my first
year of teaching. One was Ian

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,980
Stevenson and his work on
reincarnation research, which

42
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,400
opened up a whole world for me
because I had never I finished

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,520
graduate school as an
atheistically inclined agnostic.

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,380
You know, Ian Steven opened up
reincarnation. Stan opened up

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,220
the opportunity to actually
experience deeper dimensions of

46
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,660
consciousness, and by entering
those dimensions, experiencing

47
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,320
deeper dimensions of existence
itself, and that felt like the

48
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,620
opportunity of a lifetime. What
philosopher would want to do

49
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,520
that? Yes, the problem, of
course, is this was 78 and they

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,620
had been made illegal in the
United States. The first

51
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,020
generation of work was over, and
we were 40 years away from the

52
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,080
renaissance of psychedelics
that's taking place now. So I

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,140
made a difficult choice. I
decided to split my life, on my

54
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,680
public life. In my public life,
I became, I was a university

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,580
professor. I did all the things
professors do. I taught and

56
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,900
published and served on
committees, but in my private

57
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:14,520
life, I began a private 20 year
journey in using Grof methods of

58
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:21,320
for me, high dose LSD therapy,
73 sessions over 20 years. I

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,340
worked for four years. I stopped
for six years, and then I worked

60
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,640
very intensely for 10 years. So
overall, from 77 to 79 to 99 I

61
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,400
did this work, but because it
was illegal, and because, if I

62
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,440
had, because, if I had talked
about this work, I would have

63
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,360
lost my job. I had to keep quiet
about it, and it wasn't until

64
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,020
after I retired and after I was
passed the statute of

65
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,220
limitations, because I don't do
this work now, that I was able

66
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,360
to begin to talk openly about
what one can learn. About

67
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,720
consciousness and about the
universe by following this

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
particular method of
exploration.

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,720
Iain McNay: I think the
interesting thing is, you went

70
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,680
into it as an adventure, but you
went into it in a quite a

71
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,260
disciplined way, an organized
way, and the sessions were all

72
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,000
laid out. I think your first
wife was supporting you in the

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,640
sessions. And from what, again,
I've learned by talking to you

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,240
and reading is that also the
sessions, in themselves, were

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,560
organized, but not by you
insofar as they were sequential.

76
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,900
And it's like I didn't know so
much about psychedelics. I know

77
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,100
lots of people that have been on
LSD trips, but it tended to be a

78
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,840
trip and another trip, and it
was for an adventure, and it

79
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,740
wasn't a serious study, and you
approached it as a serious

80
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,400
study, yeah? And I think you
talk about a big difference

81
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,800
between doing that and doing it
for a recreational purpose,

82
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,040
yeah,

83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,040
Chris Bache: I've never taken
LSD and gone to a concert. I've

84
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,880
never stayed up and talking with
friends. This is a very specific

85
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,540
methodology. It's completely
internalized. It's Stan Grof

86
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,780
psychedelic therapy, as he
describes in his book

87
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,040
psychedelic LSD therapy, you're
totally isolated, you're cut off

88
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,420
from the world. You're in a
private space, you're lying

89
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,120
down, you're wearing eye shades,
you're listening to very

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,920
carefully selected music. My
first wife was, was and is a

91
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:38,180
clinical psychologist, and she
was my sitter. And you take the

92
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,020
medicine, and then you
completely surrender and let it

93
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,280
take you where it will take you.
And I did this work in contrast

94
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,180
to current research, with the
renaissance of psychedelic

95
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,040
research, which is very focused
on healing, which is important

96
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,980
work, very important. Much
smaller doses as well as much

97
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,340
lower doses, yeah, very low and
gentler substances. I did this

98
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,080
work as a philosopher. I wanted
to explore the deep structure of

99
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,300
consciousness that Stan had
shown in his early work, and the

100
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,200
structure of the universe
itself. And I found that if you,

101
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:23,240
if you are willing to submit to
this intense destructuring of

102
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,440
consciousness, you go through
not just one death and rebirth,

103
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,640
but over time, you go through a
series of deaths and rebirths

104
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,080
and deaths and rebirth that take
you deeper and deeper and deeper

105
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,500
into what do we call it? The
mind of the universe, the mind

106
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:49,960
of the cosmos, the mind of God.
And in my experience, I never

107
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,660
controlled what was happening in
the sessions. I would try to set

108
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,380
intentions. But working at
levels this high, which I don't

109
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,040
recommend,

110
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,520
Iain McNay: I really because it
was 500 600 I

111
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,279
Chris Bache: was working at five
to 600 micrograms, which, now

112
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,299
that I'm through it and looking
back, I really don't recommend

113
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:12,599
working in a sustained manner
with levels that high. I would

114
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,439
be much gentler on myself if I
were doing it again. But at the

115
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,379
time, I didn't, you know, I was
young, and I took good care of

116
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:25,099
myself. I really very good care.
And everything was very

117
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,939
methodical. I kept detailed
records within 24 hours of every

118
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:33,499
session, making a complete
phenomenological record, keeping

119
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:37,399
track of all the variables, of
all the dates. And then, and I

120
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,959
studied the sessions over years,
because these are complex

121
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,519
experiences. What I found was
that if you open yourself

122
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,159
deeply, you enter into a
conversation with the universe,

123
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,799
and the universe is interested
in deepening your experience of

124
00:08:56,859 --> 00:09:02,159
it, and so the universe takes
you in and teaches you and and

125
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,139
trains you and and softens what
needs to be softened, breaks

126
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,179
what needs to be broken in order
to allow you to enter more and

127
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,859
more intimately into the deep
structure of reality.

128
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,300
Iain McNay: But you see, doesn't
it take a certain courage from

129
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,080
you as a human being, to allow
that to happen because you've

130
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,940
got no idea where it really
leads.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,380
Chris Bache: Yeah, it does. And
this is one of the great gifts

132
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,780
that Stan Grof gave me in
reading his work. One of the

133
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,660
deep gifts he gave me was to
trust the process. If you submit

134
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,060
to it, if you let it take you
where it will take you, no

135
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,900
matter how terrible it becomes,
no matter how inscrutable the

136
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,520
process, if you surrender to it,
it will always culminate. It

137
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,880
will take you through a breaking
point, and then it will catch

138
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,480
you. You will die, and then you
will awaken into. A different

139
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,420
condition, a different reality,
as a different being in a

140
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,980
different dimension of
existence.

141
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,440
Iain McNay: So what do you mean
that you will die? What would it

142
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
actually mean in a tangible way,

143
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,000
Chris Bache: in order to
experience intimately the deep

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,840
nature of reality, you can't
take your ego into that reality

145
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,440
and have a Transpersonal
experience. The only way to have

146
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,040
these to enter into these
realities, is to become a

147
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,920
citizen of those realities. And
our time space identity, just by

148
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,260
the conditioning of time and
space is keeps us small, and in

149
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,240
order to enter into vast
expanses of reality, we have to

150
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,660
let go of that which keeps us
small. So literally, you go

151
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,520
through a psychological death,
the ego death is very common.

152
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:59,619
Iain McNay: So ego death, so
it's a death of a construction

153
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,219
of who we think we are, yeah,
who we've become through our

154
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:03,059
conditioning. Yeah.

155
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,739
Chris Bache: So I, I was a white
male, highly educated

156
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:11,219
philosopher concerned with the
meaning of existence. The

157
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:14,699
Universe broke me by turning
into the exact opposite of all

158
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:19,799
of those. It for hours and hours
I experienced being female,

159
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:24,079
being poor, being women of
color, and being women who had

160
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,019
no interest in philosophy
whatsoever, which is perfectly

161
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,619
fine, except it completely
negated my sense of who I was

162
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,179
and when I finally yielded and
let it, let that happen and

163
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:38,719
allowed myself to become a woman
it took me, in the most

164
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:42,999
marvelous Experience of hundreds
and hundreds of women's lives,

165
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:46,899
showing me just giving me the
experience of being feminine

166
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:51,999
that I wish every man had the
opportunity to experience women

167
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,799
as deeply as it gave it to me.

168
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,140
Iain McNay: And when you say you
during these adventures, let's

169
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,540
call them, what is the you?
Because if the ego is dissolved,

170
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,780
what is the you that's having
this experience?

171
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:12,300
Chris Bache: Yeah, that's that's
one of the linguistic puzzles

172
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,740
that kind of every mystic also
always has to address, that I is

173
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,980
not this I, but it is continuous
with this eye, but it's not this

174
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:29,180
eye. And so the first death is
the death of ego. There is

175
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,480
continuity of awareness, there's
Kant, there's continuity of

176
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,180
memory, but discontinuity of
capacity. So when you die and

177
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,000
wake up in a different reality,
you remember who you are, but

178
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,660
you are not who you were when
you were a human, a time, space

179
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,460
human being. You literally have
become a different kind of being

180
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:57,100
for six to eight hours at a time
I wasn't. I mean, Chris Bache

181
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,480
gets shattered, and you
literally learn how to be a

182
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,280
different kind of being. And
then once you stabilize

183
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:11,280
consciousness at this post egoic
level, and you go through

184
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,880
various purification and
transformative processes,

185
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,040
eventually, if you keep pushing,
keep going deeper, it will ask

186
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,340
you to surrender even more
deeply, and it will you have to

187
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,340
give up something more
fundamental than your personal

188
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,660
identity. And when you do, and
you wake up in that next

189
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,220
reality, you're not Chris Bache,
you're not even who you died,

190
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,700
who Chris Bache died into you
are a different entity. When you

191
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,440
come back, there is a thread of
a memory, but you are literally

192
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,820
remembering having been
different beings or different

193
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,380
dimensions of being,

194
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
Iain McNay: you see, so is the
transformation happening within

195
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,340
the trip, or is it happening
after you come back, or is it

196
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:02,640
both?

197
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:10,140
Chris Bache: It's both. It's
certainly both. And I want to

198
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,480
say this, you know, there's a
lot of discussion of

199
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,600
psychedelics and enlightenment,
and does psychedelics lead to

200
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,240
enlightenment? And what's the
relationship? And is it counter

201
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,360
productive, or is it productive
and and these adventures were

202
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,300
not aimed at enlightenment. I
mean, they started that way. The

203
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,360
I started because I was
interested in enlightenment, and

204
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,000
I thought I could do these
sessions, and ego would die, and

205
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,880
I would get to enlightenment
faster. But that turned out, it

206
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,500
changed very quickly, because
after I went through my first

207
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,800
ego death. Instead of personal
transformation, the story opened

208
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,440
up into a story of deep
collective transformation. I

209
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,700
began to enter into what I call
the ocean of suffering, where I

210
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,840
began to enter into what the
Buddhists would call the hell

211
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,340
realms, just the. A deep, deep
suffering that still lives

212
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,660
within the collective psyche.
And this went on for two years

213
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,860
and so many sessions and so many
years it involved so many people

214
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,300
that it eventually shattered my
perception of what was going on.

215
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,180
It wasn't aimed at my personal
transformation. It was aimed at

216
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,080
the some transformation of some
aspect of the collective

217
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,400
unconscious of humanity. And
then after that, after I went

218
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,400
through that. And after that
culminated, I entered into

219
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,620
archetypal reality. And when I
entered into archetypal reality,

220
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,020
I went through a phase where I
had to cease to be a human

221
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:50,020
being, and I discovered that
there, there is a human identity

222
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,100
which is deeper than your
individual human identity. And

223
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,880
just as I had had to die as
Chris Bache in order to become

224
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,920
something larger, I had to die
as a human being, per se, I had

225
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,460
to go completely outside any
frame of reference of humanity

226
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,760
to move into best as I could
determine was archetypal

227
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,940
reality, different dimensions of
archetypal reality, and each of

228
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,700
those, every step deeper is a
step into a much more intense

229
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,740
modality of energy. So every
step deeper is a step into a

230
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,000
very, very intense energy field,
so intense that in the beginning

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,420
it can be shattering and very
hard to maintain coherent

232
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,480
awareness. But I found that if,
if I went back again, and I went

233
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,200
back again over a year, I went
back again systematically about

234
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:50,020
five times a year that you go
through a purification process

235
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,560
and a clarification process that
you're you learn how to stay

236
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,800
conscious in levels of reality
that at the beginning you could

237
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,500
not stay conscious in that you
have to practice.

238
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,360
Iain McNay: Yeah, I think, to
give it some context, you did 73

239
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,460
trips, yeah, over 20 years. I
would never say trips good. So

240
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,360
what you would use the word
sessions, 73 sessions over 20

241
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:18,480
years, and then each session, no
matter how long the gap was

242
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,740
sequential, yeah? So what would
happen is, at the end of one

243
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,240
session, the next session, you
would start where you left off

244
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,200
the previous one,

245
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,420
Chris Bache: proximally,
there's, you know, sometimes you

246
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,120
have to sort of see the whole
sequence before you understand

247
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,420
the logic of the flow. Yeah, it
wasn't. It was kind of like a

248
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,360
keeping a dream journal. It it's
there is a logical flow that you

249
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,220
can identify, but sometimes you
have to kind of go several

250
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,940
layers down before you can see
the overarching story.

251
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,060
Iain McNay: Yeah, yes, no, I
understand. And you took the

252
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,620
time in between to kind of to
integrate, absorb what had

253
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,060
happened. And also, you were
saying last night when we had

254
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,220
dinner that the also, your body
had to not as if it was

255
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,840
recovering as such, but the body
was adapting, because the energy

256
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,440
you're in, yeah, when you're in
the session, it's such a

257
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,340
powerful energy. And you've got
this, you've got the absolute

258
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,280
coming into some finite vessel
which has to be able to

259
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,060
accommodate that energy and
that, that was, that was quite a

260
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,800
big thing, wasn't it huge?

261
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,540
Chris Bache: Yeah, because every
step deeper is more intense, and

262
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:40,960
you, when you go into these
states, you open up into vast

263
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,800
fields of consciousness, and the
energy is just huge, and it's

264
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,120
running through your system, and
you have to prepare your body to

265
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,900
go into those states, and then
after your system shrinks down,

266
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,160
after the session, you have to
then continue to work with your

267
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,640
body to help it absorb the
experiences health in a healthy

268
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,560
manner, you really have to stay
clean in your in your heart

269
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,980
habits and in your meditation
and your in your yoga practice

270
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,540
and in all the structural
aspects of your body. And I, I

271
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,540
found out my system had kind of
a natural capacity to let go,

272
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,200
and I never had any trouble
coming back. There was a natural

273
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,640
congealing, but you have to
monitor your system very

274
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,660
carefully throughout. And I
would have a session, I would

275
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,660
write it all up, and I would
have two or three months to

276
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,920
think about it, absorb it, to
ponder, it to follow its

277
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,460
teachings, because it gives you
teachings, yes, and then I would

278
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,200
open up again, and the process
would repeat itself in this

279
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,440
manner,

280
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,440
Iain McNay: because you also
talked about, there's layers of

281
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,740
conditioning, yeah, that you're
letting go of, yeah, and it's

282
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,780
not like you are saying I'm
letting go. Yeah, in the

283
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,600
sessions, the letting go is
happening, yeah? Because you're

284
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,700
there's an allowance there,
yeah,

285
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,720
Chris Bache: I surrender it. The
universe, or this creative

286
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,340
intelligence takes me in.
Usually, what happens in a

287
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,320
session is the first half of the
session is spent in some form of

288
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,600
intense purification, and then
it reaches a peak, and you're

289
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,740
drawn then into the second half
of the session, which is some

290
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,880
type of ecstatic experience,
some deeper immersion into the

291
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,840
divine, and then a series of
teachings. And then the system

292
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,920
slowly closes

293
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,919
Iain McNay: down. And do you
remember all those teachings

294
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,279
when you come back? I do, wow.

295
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,120
Chris Bache: Now it have to
qualify that just a little bit,

296
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,520
many layers. And you go through
this Death-Rebirth cycle,

297
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,380
Death-Rebirth. And if you, if
you stop there. You stay at that

298
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,620
level. But if you keep pushing
and driving, and that's one of

299
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,920
the things I found about the
high dose LSD work. It's just

300
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,880
huge power. It keeps pushing you
to your edges, to your outer

301
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,500
limits when you break into a new
level, when you first break into

302
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,860
a new level, it's a different
system, different rules. It

303
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,580
works by a different process,
and when you first break

304
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,680
through, often recall is hard,
and you may you get pieces, you

305
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,980
get aspects, but they don't
always cohere in a way that

306
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,600
makes sense to you. So your your
account will have sessions will

307
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,740
have gaps. But if you go back
again and you go back again and

308
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,780
you go back again, you train
yourself how to stay conscious

309
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,500
in that level of reality. You go
through purification and more

310
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,400
purification, and eventually
you're able to maintain coherent

311
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,000
cognition at that level of
reality. At that point, the

312
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,020
pieces begin to cohere. You get
a more coherent map of what's

313
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,940
going on. You get a clear,
stabilized vision. And this is

314
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,200
one of the differences between
therapeutic work and tripping

315
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,580
it. If you trip, you may touch
these places here, there, but if

316
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,200
you want to have sustained
conscious experience at various

317
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,120
levels of reality, you have to
pay your dues, and you have to

318
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,780
work, to be conscious at that
level. When you do that, you

319
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:29,720
come back, I am able to bring it
all back. And when I write my

320
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,360
account, I found that I there's
a technique I used, which was

321
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,040
the day after a session, you're
kind of a horse. I would play

322
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,240
the music that was used in the
session in exactly the same

323
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,380
order in which it was played.
And I would write the session up

324
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,220
listening to the music that I
had used in the session. So it

325
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,840
kind of put me one foot in, one
foot out, and I would I could

326
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,680
get back into the space, and it
would help me remember, and help

327
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,940
me remember, and I would get it
down in print always, and

328
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,900
pushing it, but with work, with
careful attention in the

329
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:12,840
session, and afterwards you can
retain it.

330
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,620
Iain McNay: I think one of the
things that I particularly liked

331
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,420
when I when I it was in, I was
thinking it was in The Dark

332
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:26,600
Knight book was that you, you
kind of, you stressed that you

333
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,460
cannot waken fully awaken
individually, because you had

334
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,320
the realization that at the
absolute level which you were,

335
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,040
you were visiting certainly,
certainly part of the time, that

336
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,460
it is all one. So when you come
back to the human vessel, it

337
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,020
makes the it makes a real myth
that someone can awaken

338
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,860
individually when the next
person isn't fully awake. How

339
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,120
can that be that an individual
awakes, yeah, another individual

340
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,260
doesn't awake, yeah?

341
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,800
Chris Bache: You know, the
metaphor that I like to use when

342
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,700
I'm teaching this with my
students is the metaphor of the

343
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,200
leaf, leaves and the trees
leaves, if you imagine leaves

344
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,840
being individually conscious,
and yet they are manifestations

345
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,180
of the consciousness of the
tree. It's a both. And so we are

346
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,780
both individually conscious. And
there is a story of the

347
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,680
individual evolution. But if you
really kind of dig deep and you

348
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,520
ask, well, what is an
individual? Then you encounter

349
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,440
the collective psyche. You know,
the consciousness of the planet,

350
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,860
the consciousness of the galaxy
and from and then deeper into,

351
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,680
as you say, the absolute, what I
call my belovedness. In it,

352
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,920
individual awakening is really
kind of, it's a, it's just a.

353
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,620
Mistaken inference. It's true
that if you don't, if you don't

354
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,300
work individually, you don't
make progress. And yet, when you

355
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,160
make progress, you are actually
drawing into your work. I think

356
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,700
you would touch the
consciousness of many people,

357
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,440
and many people's consciousness
are represented in your work. So

358
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,740
it's impossible to put a
boundary on awakening, and the

359
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,460
universe doesn't, in this sense,
doesn't even think in terms of

360
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,840
individuals. I mean, it does,
but it also thinks in terms it's

361
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,840
interested in awakening the
entire species. It's not

362
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,600
interested in awakening this
religion and that religion, or

363
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,820
this planet, this this
continent, that continent, it's

364
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,200
interested in taking the whole
of the human family into its

365
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,780
evolutionary progression. And
that's so that's I began to

366
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,380
realize I wasn't doing these
sessions for my personal work. I

367
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,780
wasn't doing it to, you know,
for my personal healing or my

368
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,460
personal transformation?

369
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,860
Iain McNay: Yeah, it started
with the questions, but the

370
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,660
adventure led you far beyond
those initial questions,

371
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,080
Chris Bache: and then beyond
even collective transformation.

372
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,940
It just became an adventure in
knowing the universe, just an

373
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,080
adventure in being drawn deep
into intimacy with the creative

374
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,140
intelligence and drawn into
causal reality, into oneness,

375
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:36,020
into Shunyata emptiness and into
the fertile void, into the

376
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:43,060
Satchitananda you know, the
existence before existence. Just

377
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,920
one adventure after another,
deeper and deeper. And there I

378
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,780
have an acute sense of that the
universe loves to be known. I

379
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,160
mean the universe wants to be
known. So any part we are the

380
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,640
universe we we are part of its
knowing. And when we when we

381
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,680
return to source, when we begin
that journey back to point of

382
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:15,420
origin, we are met with the what
do you call it again? We are met

383
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,780
by this massive supreme
intelligence, this extraordinary

384
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,480
compassion and loving beyond
imagination. And it's so happy

385
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,820
that part of it has come back to
experience it and to know it.

386
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,440
And it wants to show you
creation. It wants to show you

387
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,080
what has been going on because
we're it's been working for

388
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,140
billions and billions and
billions of years, and we are

389
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,040
just getting to where, in the
last few 1000 years, we can

390
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,140
begin to open up deeply enough
to consciously participate and

391
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,460
to see the creative process. And
it's so happy when we do that.

392
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:06,060
Iain McNay: And do you have a
view on so your your adventure

393
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,900
took you to these, this
knowledge, this experience, and

394
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,020
yet, there's other people that
go the path of contemplation and

395
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,940
meditation that have very
similar experiences. Yeah, do

396
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,860
you? Do you feel that your way
was slightly different. I know

397
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,220
in terms of substance it was.
But do you feel that

398
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,180
realizations and the knowledge
of your way was that different

399
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,420
from from the way of
contemplation and meditation?

400
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,300
Chris Bache: No, I think that
the cosmology that came out of

401
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,580
this work is not different than
the cosmology that you see in

402
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,400
the great contemplative
traditions, the great spiritual

403
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,100
traditions, you know, all honor
to the great masters who have

404
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,920
done this under the very power
of their own daily practice. I

405
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,780
mean, I taught courses in
mysticism and meditation, and

406
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,120
the great spiritual sages were
always my teachers, always my

407
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,260
masters, and they kept me, but
what they describe and what I

408
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,960
experienced seemed to fit hand
in glove, so I don't There's

409
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,000
nothing new there. The only
thing new is that we have a

410
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,020
different method. Who could let
someone of modest spiritual

411
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,620
capacity, if they have
sufficient determination and

412
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,500
courage to submit to the
regimen, even someone of modest

413
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,420
spiritual capacity like me might
have temporary experience of

414
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,740
these things. Now, as Huston
Smith said, a mystical

415
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,780
experience does not a mystic
make so you can't take these

416
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:46,780
experiences in and use them to
maintain that consciousness

417
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,520
permanently. It would be so good
if you could, but by going back

418
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,120
and forth and back and forth and
doing the practice and doing

419
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,140
your work in the daily way,
hopefully more. More and more of

420
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:08,400
it internalizes itself in your
being and and you grow.

421
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,780
Iain McNay: You grow. Yeah, I
think one of the interesting

422
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,380
thing was that you, midway
through, through this event,

423
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,540
you, you wrote this book, yes,
the living classroom, yeah,

424
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:24,740
which was about the about what
was happening with you, with

425
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,000
your students, yeah? And you
don't mention psychedelic, yeah,

426
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,720
psychedelic experiments at all
in this Yeah. And yet, something

427
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,600
very special was happening
between you and your students.

428
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,760
Yeah. Do you want to talk
briefly about that?

429
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,820
Chris Bache: I wrote living
classroom towards the end of my

430
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:48,280
teaching career and and I don't
mention psychedelics at all,

431
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,860
because it's not about
psychedelics. It's about

432
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:56,140
consciousness. But the back
story to it is I was teaching,

433
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,920
and I was doing my private work,
and I never talked about my

434
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,660
psychedelic experiences to my
students, I never, you know, I

435
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,260
just kept a firewall between my
professional life and my

436
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,940
personal work. But what I found
over time was that my students

437
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,660
were being activated by my
private work, that when I would

438
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,360
go into deeper states of
consciousness or go through some

439
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,820
Death-Rebirth process, they were
spontaneously being activated in

440
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,380
their own life, in ways that I
began to recognize were parallel

441
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,460
to what was happening in my
practice. And another thing

442
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,020
began to happen when I was
lecturing on something, and I

443
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,840
would just need an example to
make a point about, and I would

444
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,060
just pause and wait, and I would
think of an example, and I would

445
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,920
use the example. And students
began to come up to me after

446
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,760
class, and they began to say,
you know, it's funny that you

447
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,300
used that example, because
that's exactly what happened to

448
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,860
me this week. And first this
happened. I thought, Well, okay,

449
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,880
coincidence, but it kept
happening. It kept happening.

450
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,900
And the deeper I went in my
work, these synchronicities

451
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,580
began to touch very, very deep
pieces of their life. And it was

452
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,660
like there was a radar operating
that was connecting me to where

453
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:23,420
they were hurt, what they needed
to hear some healing that they

454
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,560
needed, some idea that they
needed. And when they would hear

455
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,200
them their life being suddenly
in the room, they could not help

456
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,500
but get involved deeply. And
when I began to see that this

457
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,540
was happening pretty regularly,
I began to realize I have to

458
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,040
understand this. I have to, not
only do I have to understand it,

459
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,480
but I have to figure out how, as
an educator, how to work with

460
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,140
it. Do I need to protect them
from what's happening? Do I need

461
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:00,400
to build barriers? Or, how can
I, how can I be myself and teach

462
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,340
in a way that's safe for them
and yet also allows me to just

463
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,720
be who I am, what I am, and
that's what the living classroom

464
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,680
is about. It's about
consciousness, in its natural

465
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,340
condition, is boundless and
endless and doesn't have firm

466
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,200
membranes and edges. There is a
private consciousness of a sort,

467
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,640
but in its end, consciousness is
like a lake. You throw in a

468
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,620
stone, the RIP will spread out.
And so I developed a strategy, a

469
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:36,560
set of strategies, for how to
work with consciousness in the

470
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:42,700
context of rooms of people,
groups of people. And I also

471
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,960
found out that there is a field
energy. I mean, I'd read Rupert

472
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,460
Sheldrake and his work in
Morphic fields, but I'd always

473
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,060
thought of Morphic fields in
terms of species, whole species.

474
00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:00,660
But what I found is that there
are fields that congeal around

475
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,960
courses. There are fields that
congeal around students in a

476
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,340
room. And if you teach the same
course year after year after

477
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,300
year, there's a field that
congeals and gets stronger that

478
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,180
reflects the learning of all the
students who've taken that

479
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:20,540
course with you. And that field
accelerates the student the

480
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,480
learning of students who take
the course five or 10 years down

481
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,240
the road. And so once you know
that that's happening, you can

482
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,100
begin to work cooperatively,
strategically with those fields.

483
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,880
So there's just it's a whole
different modality of pedagogy.

484
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,140
You might call it, instead of a
Newtonian pedagogy, it's a

485
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:45,160
quantum pedagogy. So for
example, I found it's important

486
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,920
to close those fields at the end
of a course. So if you open the

487
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,260
room into kind of the collective
energy of these fields, students

488
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,380
get very deeply touched. I mean,
they get deeply activated. I.

489
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,080
Yeah, but at the end of the
course, I found that, I found

490
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,320
that students were kind of
showing up in my office after a

491
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,760
course was over, and they just
kind of wanted to talk or and at

492
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,180
first I thought, Oh, that's
nice. They had a good course.

493
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,140
But then I began to realize, now
something's wrong. They were

494
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,700
caught. They were still stuck.
They were still connected to the

495
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,480
field, but they didn't have any
place to take it. So I began to

496
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,780
realize, not only do you open
these fields and work with them

497
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,020
skillfully, you have to close
them skillfully. So you have to

498
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,000
go through a process, both
socially in the room and sort of

499
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,920
shamanically in spiritual
practice, to close the fields,

500
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,200
because you don't want to
encourage that type of

501
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,680
dependence. I want my students
to be independent. I want them

502
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,920
to take the learning, go to
their next course, integrate

503
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,100
what their next professor has,
to find their own field and find

504
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,160
their own field, and I want them
free in the world. And so it's

505
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,300
just lots of you know, there was
a lot of learning.

506
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,420
Iain McNay: I think there was
one interesting example you used

507
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,200
in the living classroom about
how you found that when a

508
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,380
student would ask you a
question, if you didn't reply

509
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,160
straight away, you just open for
a few seconds, you'd see, like

510
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,300
this door open, and a whole new
dimension to the answer to the

511
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,500
question would come,

512
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,760
Chris Bache: yeah. Well, it's
like I found if I stopped, and

513
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,280
instead of saying the first
thing that came to my mind,

514
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,680
because, you know, pretty much
every question they ask is

515
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,540
something you've already heard
before, but if I stopped, I

516
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,740
visualized suddenly I saw a
little blank door in the back of

517
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,360
my mind, and a piece of paper
came through that door, and I

518
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,840
read the paper and it was a
different answer. And so when,

519
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,100
if I, if I tried it, all of a
sudden the eyes would light up,

520
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,920
and the energy of the room would
light up, and we would, we would

521
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,800
go in a new and novel direction.
And and so my teaching began to

522
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,140
be a dialog between organized, I
organized. I do a lot of notes

523
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,420
and really thoroughly organized,
but then this improvisation, and

524
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,880
my understanding is the
improvisation that was coming

525
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,960
through this deeper
consciousness connection was

526
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,100
what happened when my mind was
put into the context of our

527
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,460
collective mind, and the
teaching came out of A dialog

528
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,020
between the minds who were there
and my mind who is there.

529
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,080
Iain McNay: And you also talked
about how the students were

530
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,780
changing you. Oh, yeah. Felt
that any talk about as a quote

531
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,380
from the book, over the years,
the students broke me down and

532
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,660
rebuilt me. Yeah, that's quite
radical to say. The students

533
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,820
broke you down and rebuilt you.

534
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,040
Chris Bache: Yeah, I've always,
was always blessed with really

535
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,360
good students. They were willing
to engage deeply the questions

536
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,680
that I asked, and we danced, we
danced together, and in that

537
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:07,860
process, they they opened up my
heart. They they invited me into

538
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,160
the room, and they let me into
their lives, you know, not in a

539
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,100
counseling kind of way, but in
an intellectual in a

540
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,540
philosophical inquiry kind of
way. And we worked together, and

541
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:26,240
in that process, they taught me
about this hidden territory in

542
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,460
the room. They taught me what
could happen when good people of

543
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,860
good hearts came together in
this adventure and and they did.

544
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,860
They broke me down. I learned,
for example, at first I thought,

545
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,920
you know, I would a student
would ask a question, and I

546
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,680
would have an answer only
because of an experience that

547
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,680
had recently happened to me, or
a book I had just recently read,

548
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,160
or a session I just had, and I
thought, Oh, that's interesting.

549
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,200
I do the work, and suddenly the
universe has this capacity to

550
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,700
use my knowledge to seed
knowledge in somebody else's

551
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,560
life. Then I began to realize I
had it all backwards, that

552
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,540
sometimes I was having the
experiences I was having and

553
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,840
reading the books that I was
having. Was reading because

554
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,540
there was a questioning student
who was coming to me in the

555
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,600
future, so that my learning was
actually being seeded by their

556
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,160
desire to know. And once you let
go at that level, once you stop

557
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,100
thinking that you were the
orchestrator of this entire

558
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,920
enterprise, that it's really a
collaborative enterprise right

559
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,560
from the start then, and you
realize that your learning and

560
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,120
teaching is so deeply embedded
in their learning and teaching,

561
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,040
then where is the self in that,
you know, where are the

562
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,100
boundaries of the self? You
know, it just becomes a dance of

563
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:57,340
presences in the room, and when
life uses you in that way, when

564
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:06,360
life kind of you. Uses you in
that delicious way to when that

565
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,920
cross fertilization takes place,
it's The Sweetest feeling in the

566
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,920
world to me. You know, you're
just part of something larger.

567
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,600
You release to it, and they
release and they release to it.

568
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,980
And they took me there. I could
not I could not go there by

569
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,420
myself. They took me there.

570
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:31,460
Iain McNay: And then at some
point, a great sadness came upon

571
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,820
you on your adventure, you talk
about, yeah, As years passed,

572
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,500
you found yourself entering a
deep sadness. Your enthusiasm

573
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,880
for life was fading, you began
to feel separated and marooned.

574
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,460
Reached a point where you
realize you was just waiting to

575
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,980
die, to return to your beloved.

576
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,220
Chris Bache: Yeah, that was
after I stopped the journey.

577
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,140
Yes, so I have to kind of fill
in a little bit of a blank, and

578
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,740
then I can say what happened
after the journey. In the book,

579
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,620
I tell the story in diamonds
from heaven. I tell the story of

580
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,580
ego death, moving into the ocean
of suffering, and then moving

581
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,180
into archetype of reality and
and then moving into causal

582
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,220
reality. And it's having these
wonderful unitive experiences

583
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:29,120
and and I, I was completely
satisfied at that point. I mean,

584
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,740
you know, to merge so deeply.
But there were still five years

585
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,780
in the journey ahead. And what
happened is, I went through yet

586
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:45,940
another cycle of death and
rebirth, and I was taken into a

587
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:51,760
domain of light that was so
clear, so exquisitely just

588
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:59,260
clear, clear beyond imagination.
Buddhism calls it Dharmakaya,

589
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:07,140
the absolute reality of clear
light. And over five years and

590
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,660
26 sessions, I was taken into
this reality four times, just

591
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,380
four times. And in between those
four sessions, there was

592
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:25,280
tremendous purification, you
know, and and so it was you,

593
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,380
literally in these states of
awareness, you become light. You

594
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,560
just dissolve completely into
light and you, and you have the

595
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,480
qualities of light and the
boundlessness of light and the

596
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,340
you just dissolved in the in the
in the crystalline nature of the

597
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,300
Divine. Now I don't mean divine
in any theistic sense or in any

598
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,240
conventional sense, but I don't
know how else to what other

599
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,480
vocabulary to give to it. In
each of those four adventures

600
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:02,880
going deeper into the divine,
there were a series of things

601
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,080
that happened. And then the
divine began to come deeper into

602
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:15,420
my body. But then I reached a
point after being handled very

603
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,720
carefully and broken down, but
handled carefully. And then this

604
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,500
consciousness came brought me to
the end of my work. It just it

605
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,580
brought me to the end. It gave
me an overview of all of my

606
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,460
sessions from the beginning to
the end, to show me the whole

607
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,960
pattern to put all the pieces
together. And then it gave me a

608
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,500
last set of instructions as I
was about to leave. I didn't

609
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,480
know it was over, but it called
it. And so I knew, I knew I had

610
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,100
to stop my work. And the primary
reason I stopped the work was

611
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,320
because it became too difficult
to come back from the light. It

612
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:03,780
became so painful to come back
into time and space after having

613
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,040
dissolved so completely into
this infinite light. And of

614
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,000
course, light comes in many,
many little it comes in early

615
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,540
on. It has layers and layers and
layers. But the diamond light is

616
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,780
what I call the diamond light is
a particularly, it's a

617
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,260
particular advanced form of the
light. It's a very, very deep

618
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:30,500
expression of light. So I
stopped my sessions, and I had

619
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,160
always been integrating my
sessions carefully all the way

620
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,960
through. But what I found was
when I stopped my sessions, and

621
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,260
I thought I would now, because
I'd done this work carefully, I

622
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,760
would be able to just enjoy the
fruits of that labor. But what I

623
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,520
found over time is that a deep
sadness settled in over me, and

624
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,060
over time, I began to realize I
was suffering from a loss of

625
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:03,360
communion. I just there. Such a
longing for that light, and I

626
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,060
did not have the spiritual
maturity or the spiritual

627
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:12,120
capacity to incarnate that light
in my physical existence. And I

628
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,240
reached a point where I began to
realize I was just waiting to

629
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,420
die. I was taking care of my
students, taking care of my

630
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,580
family. I was doing the things
that I would do, but in my heart

631
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,600
of hearts, I was waiting to die
so I could return to the light.

632
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,340
And I began, over the years, I
began to realize that this is

633
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,760
not right. This is not the way
it's supposed to go. Somewhere

634
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,340
along the way, I made a mistake.
I must have made a mistake,

635
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,960
because this is not the way it's
supposed to be. So I really went

636
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,640
back and re examined the whole
process, and I began to realize

637
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,160
that you could say I was
suffering from too much God. But

638
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:56,200
since the physical universe is a
man is the divine as well, I'd

639
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,660
say I had lost balance, a
balance between Transcendence

640
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:05,220
and immanence. I had plunged so
deeply into the transcendent

641
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,800
divine that I lost my foothold,
my place in the immanent divine.

642
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,060
And that's that's incredibly
valuable. The immanent Divine is

643
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:21,260
so valuable. So I had to make a
concerted effort to congeal my

644
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,360
life, and to come to terms with
being where I was, as I was, and

645
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,780
to continue the process of doing
my spiritual practice so that I

646
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,760
could let the divine, the the
light, enter more deeply into my

647
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,540
body and into my consciousness.
So it's a, it's an ongoing

648
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,740
process. I mean, it's, it's a
work still in process,

649
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,780
Iain McNay: yes, but you, you
also talk about in the book, the

650
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,340
books not published yet, the
diamonds from heaven. Yeah, that

651
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:57,940
it's it, the fact the human
things like the family, yeah,

652
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:02,340
was so important to you in
helping you sort of refine the

653
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:07,020
ground and finding pleasure
again in human things, because,

654
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,280
yes, you are almost blown away
by what was there. But there's

655
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,060
so much beauty also in the human
realms that somehow these are my

656
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,020
words rather than yours, which
been taken out of significance,

657
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,820
but in themselves, they're
wonderful,

658
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:28,280
Chris Bache: absolutely. I mean,
my family was always the my

659
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,300
rock, my students and my family.
I have three children, and just

660
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,360
always coming back wherever I
was on Saturday, Monday, I was

661
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:41,200
with my classes, and I was
always with my children, like

662
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,500
these flowers on the table. What
magnificent expressions of

663
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:50,260
creation there are, and the
diamond Luminosity, the light is

664
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:56,080
magnificent. We have a huge,
tremendous hunger to touch these

665
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,220
realms and return to them. But
the physical world is the

666
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,220
manifestation of that reality in
tangible form. And so nature has

667
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:09,840
been a tremendous balm for me.
It just just nature, the starry

668
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:16,440
sky, being in the woods, being
in nature, being with people.

669
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,980
This is another aspect of that
sadness. The sadness wasn't just

670
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,300
loss of communion, the other
isolation, the other sadness is

671
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,320
in our culture, I wasn't allowed
to talk about these things. You

672
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,900
know, in traditional culture,
you bring your visions back to

673
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,380
the elders who help you
understand them, and because

674
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,800
your visions were are not meant
for you, they're always

675
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,900
collective. But in my culture, I
wasn't allowed to talk about my

676
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,960
sessions. I couldn't bring these
visions back. I couldn't teach

677
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,320
from them. I couldn't share them
with my colleagues, and that

678
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,740
sickness of silence just added
to my sadness. It just isolated

679
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:01,920
me, and it makes you sick
inside. Living in a psychedelic

680
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,820
closet is just as injurious as
living in any other closet,

681
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,180
where you have to deny yourself
in order to live in your

682
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:14,940
culture. Writing diamonds from
Heaven was really my step back

683
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,480
to the world and sharing these
visions doing what I was

684
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,120
designed to do to be a teacher,
I find I share, just to just

685
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,000
bring them forward, just to let
hopefully they'll be of use to

686
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,420
people. Hopefully they'll find
them helpful in some way, and to

687
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,360
be able to begin to share them,
to bring them back, to be able

688
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:41,260
to speak without reservation of
about my experiences and and

689
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,740
it's my experiences are not
important in that what's

690
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,800
important is all of our
experiences. I mean, I What's

691
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,100
important is that all of our
experiences of the transcendent

692
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,700
reality, or these realities, be
put on the table. We look at

693
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,880
them together and we find out
what's important what's not

694
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,760
important. So I don't have any.
Attachment to my I don't own

695
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,080
these experiences,

696
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:09,240
Iain McNay: yeah, but it took
you says. You also saying in one

697
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,620
of the books that at the end of
the 20 years, yeah, you were

698
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:18,300
told, or you felt it would take
20 years of integration, yeah.

699
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,200
And actually, the 20 years is up
next year.

700
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,000
Chris Bache: It's getting close.
Yeah,

701
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,220
Iain McNay: it might take 20
lifetime

702
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,420
Chris Bache: Yeah, at first
when, after I'd done the

703
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,920
sessions, and when my meditation
Spirit told me 20 years in 20

704
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,080
years out, that it would take 20
years to absorb them. Now I'm

705
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,920
coming close to those 20 years
that I'm thinking that might

706
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,360
have been optimistic, because
these things are so deep that

707
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,720
sometimes it feels like it will
take many lifetimes to absorb

708
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,820
them, and that really, I have
really basic questions, how do

709
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:59,140
you experience? How do you
integrate infinity into finite

710
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,300
structures? You know, some of my
experiences involved going far

711
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,440
into deep, what I call deep
time, outside of time and space,

712
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:12,600
deep into the future, deep into
different dimensions of time.

713
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:18,120
How do you integrate those
breadths of time into Monday,

714
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,020
Tuesday, Wednesday,
consciousness, you know, and in

715
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,520
the end, where I am now, I don't
think you can, the only thing we

716
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,460
can do is integrate our finite
existence into the infinite. So

717
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,120
we do our practice, we
surrender, we make ourselves

718
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:40,660
available. We do everything we
can to respond to the needs of

719
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:46,780
the present, and if we do that
consistently, hopefully, then

720
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,760
the infinite becomes a deeper
and deeper living reality in our

721
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,080
conscious awareness.

722
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,860
Iain McNay: Yes, and again, I
was saying to last night that

723
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,200
it's not so much just the
experiences you had, which are

724
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:06,600
amazing experiences I find for
myself. It just I get to

725
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,180
understand something, or have an
experience or have a

726
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,720
realization, and it can take me
years to properly integrate

727
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,380
that. Yeah, I realize it's still
hanging around in a form that

728
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:22,340
isn't totally something I can
absorb. And I just think, I just

729
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,460
feel more and more on the kind
of the spiritual journey. People

730
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,640
often give themselves too much
of a hard time, because they

731
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,640
think, Well, yeah, I kind of got
that. I must move on, and now I

732
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,500
must get something else. Or I
should be clear, no, you do your

733
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,660
best, but as you found out, it's
a process. It takes time. You

734
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,960
cannot force these things. You
can be available. You can do the

735
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,580
you can do the meditation and
look after yourself and any

736
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,000
other supportive work. But it
happens in its own time.

737
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,000
Chris Bache: It does. It's a
slow and gradual process. You

738
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:59,680
you can't cheat nature. It takes
time. You can kind of push it,

739
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,740
but in the end, you have to let
nature take its course. Yes,

740
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,400
yeah,

741
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,640
Iain McNay: okay, Chris, I'm
looking at the clock, and

742
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,600
nature's taken its course, and
time is very up.

743
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,880
Chris Bache: Thank you so much.
Ian, it's been so good to have

744
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,800
this conversation with you.
Thank you for it.

745
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:19,679
Iain McNay: Thank you for coming
along to conscious TV. And I'm

746
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,059
going to mention your new book,
which should be out sometime

747
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:27,679
next year, next year, diamonds
from heaven, a 20 year journey

748
00:53:27,919 --> 00:53:31,759
into the mind of the universe.
And then the three books already

749
00:53:31,759 --> 00:53:37,219
out, dark night, early dawn,
living classroom, which we

750
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:40,899
touched on about halfway through
the interview about Chris's

751
00:53:40,899 --> 00:53:44,079
teaching, and the first book,
which I haven't actually life

752
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,099
cycles. Life cycles a study of
reincarnation in light of

753
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,699
contemporary consciousness
research. So if you're

754
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:55,959
interested in Chris, there's a
lot to read. There's also, I

755
00:53:55,959 --> 00:53:59,199
think, on your you haven't got a
website yet, but there is soon,

756
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:04,019
there is a lecture you did in
Prague, which is about an hour

757
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:07,379
long, which I found very useful
for picking up the details of

758
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:09,359
Chris's psychedelic adventure
the

759
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,879
Chris Bache: international
Transpersonal conference last

760
00:54:11,879 --> 00:54:13,739
September in Prague, right?

761
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,560
Iain McNay: Yeah, okay, yeah. So
there's a lot to follow, and I

762
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,300
think I'd like to explore this
more on conscious TV. So if

763
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,280
you've got any ideas of people
that we should look at

764
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:27,380
interviewing them, then get in
contact. Okay, thanks again,

765
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,800
Chris, thank you. Ian, thank you
for watching, and I hope we see

766
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,120
you again soon. Goodbye. You.

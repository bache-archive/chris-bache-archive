22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,220
like to introduce myself and a
couple of the co founders of

23
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,040
psychedelic society and a little
bit about what we're about here.

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,700
My name is Aaron Cruz. I'm a
psychedelic ceremonial

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,940
facilitator. I've been working
with Sacramento anthonyogenics

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,580

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,420

wonderful co facilitators, and

29
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,960

In the back, Daniel Polk, the

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,100
original founder who instigated
this whole amazing group here

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,720
together, and several community
members who have been a part of

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,480
this experience. I see some new
faces here, but many have been a

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,000
part of this for now, going on
over a little bit, over a year,

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,220
and kind of to just kind of
break things up and thank you,

36
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,160
Chris for this great idea. How
many of you are new to

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,140
psychedelics in general? Nude of
psychedelics. Okay, awesome. How

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,900
many of you have been kind of on
your own journey with

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,600
psychedelics, kind of growing
and emerging that maybe the last

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,100
few years, starting to get some
steam and momentum? There any

41
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,320
tenured Psychonauts and deep
divers out here. Okay, plenty of

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,460
hands. Excellent. Now, how many
of you guys work within the

43
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,140
mental health field? Just
curious there. Okay, awesome.

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,600
And let's see. Let's talk about
some specifics here. Favorable

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,800
to Psilocybin. How many people
are Psilocybin. Is your medicine

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,440
there? Excellent. LSD, okay, see
several hands going up several

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,020
times. Respect MDMA and how
about DMT or Ayahuasca?

48
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,720
Beautiful. Okay. Well, welcome
everybody. This is our tribe.

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,420
Before we kind of go into things
here, I'd like to kind of set

50
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,540
the stage with a little bit of
our mission. Of our mission, our

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,880
vision, and the ethics that we
represent. Then we'll kind of

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,520
dive into the deeper
conversation here. So a mission

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,340
of psychedelic Society of
Asheville is to educate,

54
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,620
advocate and create community
around the healing and

55
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,520
transformational power of
psychedelics. Now our vision we

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,660
provide support, resources and a
safe container for those seeking

57
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,720
guidance and healing, spiritual
growth and personal development,

58
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,240
through psychedelics, we serve
to foster the development of an

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,720
informed culture that respects
indigenous lineage, scientific

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,780
research, harm reduction,
principles, ethics and personal

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,540
responsibility in the
intentional use and facilitation

62
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,720
of psychedelic medicine for
ethics, These containers that we

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,260
strive for provide physical
safety. Just you guys know it's

64
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,580
very important that consent is
the highest priority, both in

65
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,520
what you choose to share, how
you choose to share that, and

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,460
how you choose to express and
experience touch and connection.

67
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,360
Psychological safety, of course,
is actually critical importance

68
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,140
as well. What we share here is
to be honored within the

69
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,160
confines of this space, unless
someone gives you a direct word

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,700
to take their their truth and
sail it outward. Otherwise,

71
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,020
please honor the respect of
someone's own discretion when

72
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,980
they're sharing with you in this
space transparency. Speak from

73
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,480
the authentic eye. Speak from
your own place of value and

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,200
honor those of others as well
diversity, equity and inclusion.

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,420
You know, we really strive to
make sure that there is a

76
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,960
balanced representation of
gender, balanced representation

77
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,680
of culture and also for people
how they self identify. And we

78
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,260
are on a quest to continue to
make this a more welcoming and

79
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,320
inviting place for all aspects
and walks of life. So if you see

80
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,800
people that are. Are represented
and curious about this

81
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
particular type of work. Please
welcome them in and love to make

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,500
them feel that this is a home
for however you identify, this

83
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,920
is a place for you, and we we
love and we're richer for it.

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,820
And self care is also incredibly
important to us. So do what you

85
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,700
need to do to feel healthy and
hail that means, you know,

86
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,180
stretching, taking a moment, you
know, all those things are very,

87
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,120
very important, and want to make
sure that you have the space to

88
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,500
shake the body well. So with
that there, we're going to kind

89
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,620
of dive into a few more things.
But first, you know what? Let's

90
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,500
go ahead and do a land
acknowledgement. We are on

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,620
Cherokee chilagi First Nation
land out here. And in the deep

92
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,560
time of our work in psychedelics
and deep time of our work in

93
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,020
stewardship of this planet, we
really lean into and learn from

94
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,780
the wisdom of our ancestors. So
I want to take a moment just to

95
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,080
acknowledge that this is sacred
land and that we are gifted with

96
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,660
the opportunity to be stewards
and caretakers of this space,

97
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,060
and may we uphold the virtues
and values they have brought

98
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,460
before us and carry that
forward. So let's give a couple

99
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,720
moments to honor the chilagi
Cherokee, First Nation.

100
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,900
All right, now on to the talk
here. So we are really grateful

101
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,120
to have two amazing gentlemen
here. I know Dr Turpin doesn't

102
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,240
maybe describe himself as an
elder yet, but you are an elder.

103
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,200
De merge, sir, you've made it.
Congratulations. So we you know

104
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,840
these two individuals have done
so much for the community, for

105
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,480
psychedelics at large, not just,
you know, in this particular

106
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,840
region, but in the larger
movement. So I'm going to go and

107
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,260
introduce the them both. You two
here for some basic bios, and

108
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,100
then we'll get into some
questions here for them. So Dr

109
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,240
Bache and November 24 1979
Christopher and Bache took the

110
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,620
first step of what would become
a life changing journey. Drawing

111
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,200
from his training as a
philosopher of religion, Bache

112
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,720
set out to explore his mind and
the mind of the universe as

113
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,120
deeply and systematically as
possible, with the help of

114
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,300
psychedelic drug, LSD, following
protocols established by the

115
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,320
great Stanislav Grof Beijing. 73
high dose LSD sessions over the

116
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,820
course of 20 years drew him into
a deep in communion with cosmic

117
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,400
consciousness. Christopher Bache
is a professor emeritus in the

118

in the relevant literature since
the mid 80s, hoping to

125
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,300
eventually legally use these
medicines in psychology practice

126

141
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,640
please welcome Dr children.

142
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,780
All right, so let's dive into
where this all began. So prior

143
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,040
to your first formal experience,
what first turned you guys on to

144
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,240
psychedelics? What was it about
these compounds that initially

145
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,340
piqued your interest and then
sparked engagement?

146
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,660
Raymond Turpin: I would have to
go back to probably 1980 early

147
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,260
84 probably when I was finishing
up my freshman year at the

148
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,620
University of Georgia, and just
kind of actually into the

149
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,160
summer, and I discovered
flashbacks, which was Timothy

150
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,360
Leary's autobiography. He was
still alive at the time, and I

151
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,080
read that, and, you know, I
already knew kind of who he was,

152
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,860
and I was just stunned by the
guy's brilliance in his writing

153
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,020
and his insight. And he wrote a
good bit about Psilocybin and

154
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,520
LSD in that book, and then, much
to my parents chagrin, all the

155
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,400
way to Mississippi at
Thanksgiving, I was in the

156
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,860
backseat chattering about
Timothy Leary, and my dad was

157
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,180
not real excited about that. He
was a little conservative. And

158
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,620
so it wasn't until October of 84
where I. I managed to score some

159
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,320
mushrooms with two of my good
friends that I'd grown up with,

160
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
and we migrated out to the
cemetery outside in Athens,

161
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,800
Georgia, which that sounds
creepy, but this was a place we

162
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,040
would kind of go and walk around
and just fascinated reading the

163
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,680
gravestones and putting stories
together. It was kind of a

164
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,220
sacred place to us. And so went
out there, found a little field

165
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,500
laid down by the creek, and I
was laying there, and I had this

166
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,260
intense vision of just seeing
myself. At the time, I was an

167
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,040
advertising major. I'd grown up
in Atlanta, had gone to this

168
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,100
prep school with a lot of old
Atlanta money, and my family was

169
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,040
definitely kind of middle class,
and so I felt like I was a dirt

170
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,440
farmer. And so when I got out of
high school, I thought it was

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,100
all about making money, so I
figured, kind of creative, I'll

172
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,520
do the advertising thing. And
during this Psilocybin

173
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,180
experience, which was quite
profound, it just kind of I saw

174
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,500
myself succeeding in this field
and feeling extremely empty

175
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,960
about it. And there was almost a
voice in my head saying, What

176
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,300
are you doing? You're going to
convince people to buy a bunch

177
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,360
of crap they don't need. What
are you doing? And I said, What

178
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,760
are you doing? And I said, What
am I doing? And then I started

179
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,340
figuring out where this is
coming from. This This wasn't in

180
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,220
the mushrooms. This was
unlocking a part of myself that

181
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,220
had kind of been socialized out
over the last few years, and it

182
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,980
seemed to be more of my true
self. So I got fascinated with

183
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,220
that. And then started going to
the UGA library and pulling off

184
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,040
old bound journals and finding
all the old LSD research,

185
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,900
particularly from the 50s and
the 60s, and realizing what all

186
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,120
was being done with these
compounds back then, and they

187
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,240
were doing some pretty amazing
studies, and some people that

188
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,900
had some pretty refractory
problems were getting well, and

189
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,620
then the fact that it had all
been buried astounded me. And so

190
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,320
I just kind of decided to devote
my life back then to continuing

191
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,680
to study these things,
continuing to research them,

192
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,640
personally and academically, and
hopefully be in a position one

193
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,100
day to be able to use these
things legally. So that's kind

194
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,920
of how it all got started. And
then the Grateful Dead was a big

195
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,060
piece of it. Once I went to my
first dead show Halloween, 1985

196
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,940
that locked me into a whole
nother level of psychedelics and

197
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,940
using it somewhat
ritualistically in large crowds.

198
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,320
So that was another big shaper
of my experiences growing up.

199
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,020
Unknown: Awesome. Yeah, get more
there. Too.

200
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,360
Raymond Turpin: Grateful, dead.
I'm afraid did not ever have a

201
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,980
significant impact on my life in
that respect, but I know I

202
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:30,320
respect, I was just out of
graduate school, had gone, had

203
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,700
been given the opportunity for a
high quality classical Ivy

204
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,160
League education. I was a pre
confirmed atheistically inclined

205
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,120
agnostic when I finished my
degree in religious studies and

206
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,340
philosophy of religion, and I
met the work of Stan Grof. Let

207
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,540
me back up Saturn Return, just
come out of my Saturn Return,

208
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
just begun my teaching career.
The first year of my teaching

209
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
career, looking around what to
do, I found Stan's book, realms

210
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,380
of the human unconscious, and he
lit the fire. And I knew that

211
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,560
this was really important to my
discipline, philosophy of

212
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,040
religion. And I knew the only
way to really work, this was not

213
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,100
intellectually and conceptually,
but you had to do the work. You

214
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,540
had to get into it and do the
work. This is 1978 and the work

215
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,420
was illegal at that point, so I
decided to be illegal, and I'm

216
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,980
not an illegal person by nature,
but I decided to sort of do my

217
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,240
academic work, and to do this
work with the idea that sooner

218
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,380
or later, somewhere down the
road I would be able to harvest

219
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,100
it as a philosopher of religion,
to bring it forward for its

220
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,240
cosmic, logical and
philosophical import. I wasn't

221
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,660
primarily interested in
therapeutic healing, though. A

222
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,920
lot of healing came. I wasn't I
started with an interest in

223
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,980
spiritual awakening, kind of
accelerating my spiritual

224
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,060
awakening, but that kind of got
knocked out within the first

225
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,480
couple of years, when the
journey took me in a different

226
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,840
way. After about three sessions,
I always worked in a Grof Ian

227
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,280
protocol, right shades, lying
down, headphones, eye shades.

228
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,820
I've never tripped in a
classical way. I've always done

229
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,420
therapeutically focused, intense
work. And as you know, if you've

230
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,100
done this work, it amplifies the
intensity of the experience many

231
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,280
times. And I think now that we
have the world's collection of

232
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,180
music available to us, and we
can contour our sessions with

233
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,840
that music, it just deepens it
even further. I made a choice

234
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,260
very early on, not to work
therapeutically or not to work

235
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,200
with other people, not to
introduce people into this a

236
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,740
very different responsibility, a
different set of

237
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,360
responsibilities. I always
worked solo, and I was concerned

238
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,360
just to push the boundaries as
far as I could go. This seemed

239
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,080
like a wonderful opportunity for
a philosopher to actually get

240
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,660
first hand experience of some of
the things that some of the

241
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,680
great sages and mystics and had
been talking about. And so

242
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,200
that's. What I did, I jumped in.
I followed a protocol of working

243
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,400
after the first few sessions at
high doses of LSD, 500 to 600

244
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,860
micrograms. I aimed always at
600 but I lower it to 500 just

245
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,560
in case. Some of the stuff I was
using wasn't completely pure,

246
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,320
though it was all pharmaceutical
grade. I do not recommend this

247
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,460
protocol, this is, this is not a
layman's protocol. When you work

248
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,300
at those doses, if that
consistently over 20 years, it

249
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,380
takes you places that are
extremely demanding. They

250
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,440
require a great deal of
discipline. They require a great

251
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,100
deal of spiritual practice to
stabilize and hold on to those

252
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,920
experiences and to work with
them. Yeah, that's, that's how I

253
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,580
got into it.

254
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:55,360
Ehren Cruz: Wow, yep, 500 Okay,
well, so you guys started

255
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,120
getting the momentum, you had
the impetus early on to kind of

256
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,620
follow that trail, you know, for
you, Dr Turpin, you know the

257
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,520
kind of medicine redirected you,
or kind of brought you into a

258
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,760
different landscape in your
life, and and you had really

259
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,000
kind of set off on this trail
through inspiration for Dr sand

260
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,080
Grof, so can you speak to me
about a particular time period,

261
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,500
maybe a parent dime shifting
moment for you, when you're

262
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,480
working With the medicine that
really just opened up you into a

263
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,700
new spate of awareness. And I
know you had many of those

264
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,280
expressed in your particular
book. There about maybe where

265
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,300
you had felt that this
particular trail, or this path,

266
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,840
it just led you into a different
level of how your devotion to

267
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,500
this work kind of expanded at
that particular time, from from

268
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,280
that experience,

269
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,160
Raymond Turpin: going go ahead.
I can't say any one particular

270
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,060
period or one particular time,
because it true one of the let

271
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,120
me ask for how many people have
read my book? LSD, in the mind

272
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,360
of the universe, that's why.
Okay, good. So I can start some

273
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,620
thoughts from scratch. For the
majority, working in this very

274
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:10,740
intense fashion. Over 20 years,
there were so many levels of

275
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,620
consciousness that I broke
through, or that the universe

276
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,520
took me through that I can't
point to any one time period as

277
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,620
a kind of culmination of that
period. I just kept at it, and

278
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,520
it kept taking me through level
after level after level of that

279
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,340
process. And I learned, I
learned that you have to learn

280
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,580
how to work with these states. I
mean, they're really complicated

281
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,920
to work with states if you're
dealing with states at the

282
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,200
personal level, that's kind of
one level of complexity. If

283
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,500
you're dealing with states at
the collective psyche level,

284
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,320
that's another level of
complexity. If you're pushing

285
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,860
beyond that into archetypal,
into causal, and transcending

286
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,000
time and space and going into
the deep territory of history,

287
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,380
that I learned requires a
tremendous amount of discipline

288
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,120
to stabilize and to stay
conscious at levels of

289
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,540
consciousness that usually when
you first go into them, it just

290
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,920
it takes your mind right out.
It's hard to hold on to them. It

291
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,800
was the length of the journey
and going through so many

292
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:21,260
stages, I guess if I were to
point to any one point, no, I'm

293
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,980
not going to point to any one
point. There's too many stages

294
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,400
going through it. There was one
period of the work when we were

295
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,320
experiencing, I think it was the
Neptune Uranus conjunction. And

296
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,360
it was squaring my lunar nodes,
if you're into astrology, it was

297
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,660
a square all year long. And that
particular year, which I think

298
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:52,660
was around 1993 94 just was
ripped open the level. And it it

299
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,140
opened up a new level. But that
wasn't the last level. That was

300
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,480
just a new level at that time,
but it was a, it was

301
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,860
extraordinarily productive
level. But the deeper level, the

302
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,220
last five years of my working
was what I call the diamond

303
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,100
Luminosity, and I'll just
mention that when I hit the

304
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,840
diamond Luminosity material,
once I touched that realm, I

305
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,440
wasn't interested in any of the
other realms that I had access

306
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,980
getting up to that level,
because the Power and intensity

307
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,960
of that domain was so extra
ordinary and it was so

308
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,160
attractive and so overwhelming
that for the last five years of

309
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,340
my work, that was the only thing
I was interested in getting back

310
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,440
to. But in those five years and
26 sessions, in those five

311
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,920
years, I only got to that
dimension four times, okay, and

312
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,460
that wasn't because, that was
because the cycle involves so

313
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,540
much intense purification in
order to get back into that

314
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,540
territory, than to absorb that
territory. And going through

315
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,860
anyway, I'm getting off on it,
but off track. But yeah, I guess

316
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,560
the diamond Luminosity would
constitute, in some ways, a

317
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,680
major. Turning point for me in
that material.

318
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,320
I'm afraid my story is a little
more terrestrial than yours.

319
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,960
Yeah, first of all, I am. I'm
honored to be on the stage with

320
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,740
this guy here. His book was
incredible, and it meant a lot

321
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,320
to me. When I did read it, I
felt like I was reading almost

322
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,520
like holy texts or something
kind of coming from, like the

323
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,940
king acid head or something, and
the fact that he's still intact

324
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,820
psychologically and emotionally
and everything was really

325
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,380
comforting to me when I finally
got to meet him. But yeah, I'm

326
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,500
kind of like Chris. I can't
really point to an experience

327
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,420
that really was a profound that
stands out more than some of the

328
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,960
others. I just know that, you
know, when I made this decision

329
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,780
back in the mid 80s that I
wanted to change my major to

330
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,560
psychology and work with people
doing this work, and devote my

331
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,440
life, really, to studying
psychedelics, there was no

332
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,440
support. I remember, I went to
the head of the UGA psychology

333
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,020
department, and he was like,
don't waste your time doing

334
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,480
this. This has all been tried.
It's not coming back. And almost

335
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,600
everybody I went to was not very
encouraging about it at Georgia,

336
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,240
which was kind of a conservative
I love the school, but it was

337
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,520
kind of a conservative
psychology department, so I

338
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,960
didn't get much encouragement
there, but I did find out about

339
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,840
West Georgia College, which was
at the time, was a humanistic

340
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,520
psychology program that had been
founded in 1968 and Carlton,

341
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,940
which there's not much going on
in Carlton, Georgia, but I got

342
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,400
out there and there was a guy,
Mike Aarons, who had actually

343
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,540
done some work with creativity,
and LSD back in the 60s. And

344
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,020
that's where we got to meet Stan
crippner. Stan Grof came and did

345
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,620
a talk there. So it was kind of
this deepening and and then

346
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,580
that's what led me to California
Institute of integral studies,

347
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,100
which, at the time was pretty
fringe. It wasn't even APA

348
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,800
accredited. My parents were
completely freaked out. I wanted

349
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,720
to go there and get my
doctorate. They're like, how are

350
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,060
you ever going to get a job? And
I said, I really don't care at

351
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,220
this point. I want to learn what
they're teaching and then I'll

352
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,280
figure it out afterwards. So I'm
not going there to worrying too

353
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,420
much about that. But then I
guess just kind of to kind of

354
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,680
answer your question. I think
there was just so many times of

355
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,740
doubt along the way where I was
worried that I was doing

356
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,920
something that was not going to
maybe, you know, work out for

357
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,980
me, you know, just times where
everybody gets doubts, and then

358
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,800
there was just always something
that would show up that would

359
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,740
reassure me and just kind of say
you're on this path, and it's

360
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,960
important that you stay on this
path. And I think another lesson

361
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,600
I learned very early on with
psychedelics, and I think this

362
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,360
also works as a psychotherapist
too, is maintaining how

363
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,480
important it is to maintain
humility when you're working

364
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,720
with these compounds. I can
remember when I was a therapist,

365
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,240
you know, somebody come in and
we'd have a great session, and

366
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,640
I'd be like, Man, I got this
shit. I'm gonna be like, I'm

367
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,120
Freud. Man, I'm going to be the
next Freud. I got this stuff.

368
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,700
And then about the next day,
somebody would come in

369
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,920
collapsing and talk about how,
you know how terrible they were

370
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,020
doing. Then I'd feel like the
worst therapist ever, and I

371
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,420
didn't know what I was doing.
And so I learned the hard way to

372
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,360
kind of find the middle ground
there. And I think psychedelics

373
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,540
did the same thing. It does not.
It wouldn't allow you to get too

374
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,880
down, and it wouldn't allow you
to get too high on yourself. I

375
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,540
always found that it would just
if I was getting a little high

376
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,000
about something, it would knock
me down. And if I was getting a

377
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,400
little low about something, it
would kind of bring me back to

378
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,660
that middle place. So I think it
was important to just trust that

379
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,500
what felt like the direction I
needed to go in is what I needed

380
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,320
to honor. And I think that's
kind of what was happening along

381
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,300
the way, is just having various
meeting people at particular

382
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,480
times, having particular
experiences that would just kind

383
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,180
of deepen that whole path and
just allow me to just kind of

384
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,060
continue to go on and feel good
about it. I think that's kind of

385
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,380
how it how it happened.

386
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,620
Ehren Cruz: Yeah, I love that.
For both of you too, the

387
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,940
catalyst of the psychedelic you
know, in and of itself, you know

388
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,340
those moments, although they can
be profound, it seems like the

389
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,160
context of your life, how you
synthesize that, how that

390
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,880
encouraged you forward. What you
learned over the larger spectrum

391
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,600
is the real lesson. Is the real
teaching that came through and

392
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,900
and so you guys, for large part
of your careers, you're working

393
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,860
in what was be considered the
dark ages of psychedelics

394
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,420
between, you know, the mid 1970s
through 2016 there's a complete

395
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,880
moratorium on research. You
know, it was pretty much

396
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,600
ostracized to the far reaches of
academia and culturally outside

397
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,540
of the Grateful Dead and a few
courageous other, you know,

398
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,720
keepers of the of the culture.
There was very, very little kind

399
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,520
of happening at that particular
time. So I guess what encouraged

400
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,800
you, you spoke a little bit
toward this, what encouraged you

401
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,820
to kind of continue on that path
where 360 around you, you know

402
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,700
people weren't lifting that up
or supporting you in that and

403
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,580
and the fulfillment of that
particular profession. And also,

404
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,060
were there any kind of prominent
mentors over this period of

405
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,080
time, either that you met, or
perhaps that you were learning

406
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,440
from their work extensively, and
how did that influence your

407
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,780
trajectory as you continue to
move on throughout your life?

408
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,080
Raymond Turpin: Yeah, take it
away. Try to remember all that.

409
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,060
Yeah, I would say, you know, the
thing that probably kept. Me

410
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,120
going more than anything, was
the fact that, you know, I was

411
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,180
learning about conventional
psychology and psychotherapy

412
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:11,340
techniques at Georgia, and then
later on, and there was just

413
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,640
when, when I was reading the Old
research, there was just

414
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,400
something so unique about the
way that they were working with

415
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,040
mental illness back then, and
that they were using LSD, and it

416
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,640
was a rough treatment. I mean,
people were reliving their fit

417
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,540
their traumas, and so there was
a real need to have safety and

418
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,300
trust with your therapist.
Unlike MDMA is nice because it

419
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,700
shuts down that amygdala, and so
you don't have that fight or

420
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,060
flight response. But when you're
taking LSD to do trauma work or

421
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,700
Psilocybin, it's not working on
the amygdala like that. So

422
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,020
there's a lot of anxiety and
trepidation and fear that can

423
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,160
come up when you're doing that
work and and just noticing the

424
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,520
development of psychiatric
medications, and the fact that

425
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,480
our whole drive was about
symptomology and trying to

426
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,240
mitigate symptoms so that people
could get out and function, that

427
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,080
was really what the with, what
the what the point was, and just

428
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,560
realizing that we weren't
getting At the core stuff. And

429
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,800
that reading that old LSD
research, you know, showed that

430
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,780
we were getting at that core
stuff, and there were these

431
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,960
profound changes taking place.
There was also a lot of

432
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,080
criticism about the research
back in the 50s and 60s, because

433
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,740
it didn't really cotton very
well with the old double blind

434
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,140
science routine study design.
Because, you know, when you got

435
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,260
a placebo and a psychedelic? You
know, within an hour who got the

436
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,440
psychedelic and who got the
placebo? So there was a lot of

437
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,260
criticism about it not being
able to be studied

438
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,280
scientifically. And then there
were some study designs back

439
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,800
then that I think were flawed,
of course, because people didn't

440
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,600
know what they were dealing
with. They were trying this

441
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,440
stuff for the first time. But I
would say probably the people

442
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,280
that really influenced me was
Stan Grof to just still a

443
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,480
brilliant guy. When I read
realms of the human unconscious,

444
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,840
it was, it was a shattering book
for me, just realizing that this

445
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,440
guy was going deeper than
anybody at the time. And and

446
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,260
then when I got the CIS one of
the reasons I went out there was

447
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:04,200
that Stan was teaching Ralph
Metzner was out there and, you

448
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,540
know, and then just San
Francisco, I got to see the dead

449
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,300
like 12 times a year without
leaving the Bay Area. So that

450
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,880
was always, that was kind of
another attraction out there.

451
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,360
But, you know, I think Jerry
Garcia was another influence of

452
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,260
mine. He wasn't a scientist or a
therapist or anything, but he

453
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,160
took a lot of psychedelics, and
he communicated what he learned

454
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,340
from psychedelics through his
music and and his art, his

455
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,240
guitar playing was everything
that's all he was about, was

456
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,540
expressing through that. And
then he ended up falling in with

457
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,060
these other guys that had the
same commitment and the same

458
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,200
pathway to exploring music and
the deep psyche. And so going to

459
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,280
their shows was something that
always, I would go to their

460
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,260
shows, and they would always
teach me something, or I would

461
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,560
just get reaffirmed that this,
this was this mattered, this

462
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,020
stuff mattered, and it was going
to matter and it was worth

463
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,600
sticking with. So and again, I
think when I read Chris's book,

464
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,420
I thought that was really
fabulous, because I just

465
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,280
thought, I'd always thought,
wow, what would happen if you

466
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,880
just took all the acid you could
and just went as deep as deep as

467
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,900
possible, what would you find?
It seems like there's this

468
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,560
endless well of something down
in there as you go, or out there

469
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,560
and and so when I found his
book, like I said, I was

470
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,560
astounded that somebody had
actually done that and been able

471
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,140
to bring back all that knowledge
about what you experienced was

472
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,320
profound. So, yeah, I've had a
number of teachers, I think

473
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,620
again, Mike Aarons. He was out
at West Georgia. A couple of

474
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,300
West Georgia alumni here, Steve
and David, those guys remember

475
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,240
Mike Aarons. And I think he was
probably pretty important to you

476
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,700
guys too. He was kind of the
soul of that whole program. And

477
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,560
he really kept it humanistic and
very different he didn't worry

478
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,440
about APA accreditation or
anything. Was about people going

479
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,080
in there and learning what he
felt like. It was important not

480
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,960
only to be a good therapist, but
to grow as a human being too.

481
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,160
And so that was really, that was
really important. So yeah,

482
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:05,520
you know, Stan was huge
influence, because he's such a

483
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,480
powerful intellect, and he had
done 20 years of research before

484
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,760
he wrote realms of the human
unconscious, and I could

485
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,660
recognize the caliber of his
scholarship. And he taught me,

486
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,960
just by reading him. He taught
me some essential things, but I

487
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,940
think the most important thing
he taught me was to absolutely

488
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,720
trust the consciousness of the
universe, to trust the process,

489
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,400
to allow yourself to go into
unknown territory, to allow

490
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,900
yourself to be sliced and diced
and broken down, no matter how

491
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,800
bad, no matter how inscrutable
it is if you're working in a

492
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,000
safe and contained environment,
surrender completely to that

493
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,480
environment, and it'll always
catch you in the end. You'll die

494
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,500
100 times, but it'll catch you
in the end, and it'll embrace

495
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,040
you. And that was a that was the
most and I don't think I would

496
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,340
have had the courage to go some
of the places I ended up going

497
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,320
if I hadn't known that Stan had
been there. First, and he had

498
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,900
survived the to tell about it,
outside of that and Stan, of

499
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,600
course, and I became friends and
colleagues, and he wrote the

500
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,760
forward to dark and early dawn
for me and and brought me to

501
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,060
some of the ITA meetings, where
we had wonderful encounters with

502
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,680
the different people, but I
never had outside of this

503
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,180
intellectual starting point. I
never I always am envious of

504
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,780
people who do Ayahuasca work and
they say, Well, I had this

505
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,860
shaman mentor for 10 years that
I worked with, and this other

506
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,100
person I worked with for another
10 years, and that's just not my

507
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,160
story at all. I've never had a
mentor like that. All of my

508
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,060
mentoring came directly from the
universe itself, which has some

509
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,080
advantages and has some
disadvantages, you know, but I

510
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,440
did not learn anything from
anybody. I mean, intellectually.

511
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,020
But this, we're not talking
intellect. We're talking about,

512
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,960
you know, dissolving into the
Soul of the Universe, dissolving

513
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,960
into the consciousness that that
created the universe. About that

514
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,800
process, I never had anyone to
help me, and it was just a

515
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,860
continuous conversation, but
then a communion, and then

516
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,540
dissolving deeper and deeper
into that, that consciousness,

517
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,000
that power, which is the
illuminating consciousness and

518
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,360
the origin, originating
consciousness of all existence,

519
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,220
coming back, scribbling it down,
trying to make sense of it, and

520
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,600
then digesting the larger
overall journey. And when I was

521
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,260
doing it, like you said, it was,
there was no one doing it. I

522
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,680
mean, I couldn't really talk. I
mean, my friends in the

523
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,080
department knew what I was
doing, but they didn't really

524
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,400
know what I was doing, and I
could never I didn't bring it to

525
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,160
campus. I didn't bring it to my
students. I couldn't teach out

526
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,400
of it, which became a real
problem down the road. Because

527
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,960
I'm a talker, I love to learn
and share, but I could not share

528
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,740
this. I couldn't talk about it.
Wasn't allowed to be part of the

529
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,040
curriculum, even though I did
teach courses in psychedelic

530
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,580
therapy, and I did teach courses
and seminars on Stan's work and

531
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:14,100
whatnot, I always had to hold my
own personal work back, and it

532
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,020
wasn't until I really set after
I retired and I saved writing

533
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,240
LSD in the Mind of the universe,
or my title for that book is

534
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,300
diamonds from heaven. LSD, in
the mind of the universe is the

535
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,140
publisher's title. My title is
diamonds from heaven. I did not

536
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,460
even try to attempt that until
after I was retired, until I was

537
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,700
after the statute of
limitations, and I knew that

538
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,500
neither the state of Ohio
couldn't fire me and the federal

539
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,160
government couldn't come after
me. But that is not the way it's

540
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,040
supposed to be. Is it?
Indigenous cultures? You come

541
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,800
out of a deep experience, first
thing you do is you share it

542
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,160
with the elders. Because first
of all, it's not your private

543
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,340
vision, necessarily. It's not
necessarily about your private

544
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,660
life. It's about the life of
your tribe. It's about the

545
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,920
larger life, and so the elders
are your first people to share

546
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,720
it with. But in my world, there
were no elders and there was no

547
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,060
sharing. And so it involved a
very long process of holding and

548
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,540
just holding and digesting this
material, personally,

549
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,880
individually, sharing it with my
wife and very small circle, but

550
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,600
it really had to be contained in
that way, and that's not

551
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,800
something I would wish on
anybody. And I'm very glad that

552
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,620
we're coming to a point in
history where no one else has to

553
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:38,420
go through that, that we can we
have enclaves of people you can

554
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,320
share and process this work,
because I think it's really

555
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,000
important to share and process
this work together and to draw

556
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,600
from other people's experience,
and to have to be able to say

557
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,860
out loud what are probably, for
many of us the deepest

558
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,980
experiences of our life. Yeah, I

559
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,580
think talking about the
indigenous cultures, I mean, one

560
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,880
of the reasons that they used
them so successfully for 1000s

561
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,400
of years, in some cases, is
because they had a framework for

562
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,760
respecting and valuing these
types of experiences, and they

563
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,660
also had a cultural blueprint
for when people came back about

564
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,420
how to integrate and understand
what they had experienced and

565
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,920
learned, and they were able to
do these things safely and

566
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,740
productively for 1000s of years.
And I think one of the issues

567
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,820
with our culture is that we were
up against, even in the 60s,

568
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,360
that there was no framework for
understanding or acceptable way

569
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,660
to use these things. We were all
criminals by taking them in and

570
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,800
of themselves. And so I do think
that's a role everybody has

571
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,760
right now. We're still very
early in this renaissance

572
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,620
period, and I think everybody
has a responsibility to learn

573
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,380
about these substances and how
to use them responsibly and

574
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,140
safely, and also be freely
teaching other people that are

575
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,560
curious about how to use it. So
I think that's a responsibility

576
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,520
all of us have here.

577
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,400
Ehren Cruz: I. Yeah, thank you
guys so much for sharing that.

578
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,160
You know, as part of my own
personal work, I got people

579
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,440
through high dose Psilocybin
experiences as a harm

580
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,820
reductionist, and it's deep and
it's profound, and in many ways,

581
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,900
you know, I feel as much as a
facilitator to doula at times,

582
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,320
and how the nature of our
reorientation and your own

583
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,420
perspective can be that paradigm
shifting that you have to re

584
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,300
acclimate yourself to how you
engage with family and friends

585
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,600
and and what that means to you
now you can't unknow what you

586
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,120
know you know. So with that new
imprint and within you, you have

587
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,120
to kind of set sail into a new
trajectory. So that support

588
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,320
structure is so, so critical and
and in that and then that

589
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,160
consideration there, I think two
things I wanted to ask you,

590
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,940
specifically, Chris, is, you
know, how first were you able

591
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,640
to, you know, how did that
impact your family, your you

592
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,360
know, your father, you have, you
know, a wife, and your wife at

593
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,820
the time that was supporting you
there. And, you know, have a new

594
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,400
partnership now, and all those
things that have transpired,

595
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,840
know, how were you able to kind
of endure in that, in that time

596
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,660
period there and and, yeah,
we'll stop for that one right

597
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,880
now and then have a kind of
follow up to that. But you know

598
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,040
what was? What was your
practice? Essentially, to be

599
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,520
able to do

600
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,320
Raymond Turpin: that, first, I
had a couple of strategic

601
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,060
advantages. I had a PhD in
philosophy in religious studies

602
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,160
and philosophy of religion, and
so I had the opportunity to

603
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,440
study theology and the history
of mysticism and mystical

604
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,160
traditions. I studied Eastern
and Western traditions. I taught

605
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,220
in both traditions. I taught in
Eastern traditions. I taught

606
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,900
courses in comparative
mysticism. So I really, I really

607
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,240
spend a lot of time with the
great masters and psychedelic

608
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,260
experience and great master
contemplative experience. These

609
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,220
are two different genres of
experience. Okay, psychedelic

610
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,400
experience is temporary. You
have to deal with the

611
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,040
temporaryness of it from the
very beginning. You have to use

612
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,840
those hours as productively as
you can. But you also have to

613
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,080
deal with the fact that you are
going into this elevated state,

614
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,680
and then you're coming back out
of it. Then you sit and absorb

615
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,680
and then you're going into it
again, and you're coming back

616
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,800
out of it. Contemplative
practice is different. There is

617
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,600
a fluctuation in and out, but
it's a much more of a you get to

618
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,360
hold on to more of what you
break into, and the psychedelic

619
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,040
state is not like that. And so
the process of stabilizing,

620
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,420
keeping yourself grounded in the
world, and absorbing this and

621
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,900
holding the position is really
important, especially if you're

622
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,320
working with a psychedelic. A
powerful psychedelic, says

623
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,960
pushing boundaries and breaking
structures and taking you in

624
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,640
places that, relatively
speaking, very few people have

625
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,720
gone, and certainly very few in
the academic community, if any,

626
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,900
have gone. So you don't have any
of that type of intellectual

627
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:02,520
support for it. You know When
Jung went on his deep episode

628
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,660
and of when he broke with Freud,
and he went into this tremendous

629
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,040
self explore, exploration, and
he faces tremendous being

630
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,220
overwhelmed by the content
flooding up from his psyche. He

631
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,480
said what grounded him was his
family and his work. And he

632
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,340
would say to himself every day,
sometimes, this is this is who I

633
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,160
am, this is where I live. These
are the people I live with.

634
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,100
These are my family. These are
my children. And I think that's

635
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:33,260
really true for me. It was
family. We had children, raising

636
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,220
children, and it was my
students. It was that wherever I

637
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,140
was on Saturday, on Tuesday,
Monday or Tuesday, I was back in

638
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,560
the classroom. I was teaching my
classes. The other thing that

639
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,580
was really important for me, for
stabilizing is to have I had a

640
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,880
sustained spiritual practice,
that a meditative practice. My

641
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,560
partner at the time, Carl, was a
serious meditator, contemplative

642
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,860
practitioner, and that was very
grounding. It was to know the

643
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,940
lives of the great masters, and
they were my role models for

644
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:14,580
what could be achieved, and to
use them as my role model and to

645
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,440
commit myself to a daily
practice that allowed me to

646
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,880
absorb not only intellectually
or consciously, but to absorb in

647
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,560
my body, to absorb the subtle
energy. The shifts in subtle

648
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,020
energy that psychedelics
activate, because you know, when

649
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,040
you states of consciousness are
states of body. So when you

650
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,300
enter extremely deep states of
consciousness your body, you're

651
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,080
asking your body to go into
extremely state, deep states of

652
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,320
consciousness, of states of
body. And when you enter very,

653
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,460
very pure states of awareness,
your body goes through intense

654
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,660
detoxification processes, which
continue long after the session

655
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:00,420
is over. So I had the
opportunity to understand. That

656
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,780
within the mystical tradition,
so that it gave me an

657
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,900
opportunity, it gave me a
knowledge that I use to ground

658
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,180
myself in the world. But I think
to me, it was the commitment of

659
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,860
of career, the commitment of
teaching in my students and the

660
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,680
equipment, and the commitment of
working with my children and my

661
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,420
family. I Right? Yeah.

662
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,820
Ehren Cruz: Thank you so much
for sharing that. And you know

663
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,580
that's that's so important to
recognize, is the immersive

664
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,480
quality of the psychedelic you
get that deep, profound

665
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,380
experience, but as it then
starts to subside, then that's

666
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,260
where the practice really, truly
begins. You know, how do we

667
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,580
synthesize that into life.
Choose actions, choose holistic

668
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,780
praise, to allow that to become
part of our walk of you know, to

669
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,780
sustain and support those
revelations through through life

670
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,600
changes and healthy, healthy
living wellness.

671
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,500
Raymond Turpin: After I stopped
my sessions in the very end

672
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,260
stages, one of the things
consciousness told me, and it

673
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,180
was important to me at the time
was there is the dying of

674
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,080
discovery, and we know what
that's about. But then there's

675
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,460
the dying of keeping. The dying
of keeping is different than the

676
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,880
dying of discovery. It's what
it's what you do when you come

677
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,500
back, so that you can hold on to
these experiences in some

678
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,820
meaningful way and integrate
them into your life in some

679
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,660
meaningful way.

680
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,920
Ehren Cruz: Thank you. Chris, so
Dr Turpin, I have a little bit

681
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,840
of a different angle here for
you. So, so it's no no secret

682
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,000
that your accomplished
psychedelic professional, you

683
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,540
know what you've been able to
attain with the pearl

684
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,600
psychedelic Institute, which is
only one of two facilities right

685
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,480
now that are approved for
expanded access trials and MDMA

686
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,800
and treatment for PTSD. And you
recently had someone move

687
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,980
through one of those trials. And
I just want to go ahead and give

688
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,380
a round of applause for the
incredible amount of work just

689
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,960
to do that get it to this level.
Lot of lot of hearts, lot of

690
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,800
hands that have had that happen
there. But one of the things

691
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,340
that I think you've been able to
accomplish is you hold both of

692
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,820
these different traditions. One
is the extremely diligent,

693
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,020
therapeutic professional lane
that has to be every i dotted,

694
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:20,480
every T crossed, to really
solidify that particular track

695
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,540
and simultaneously, on the other
hand, as you had alluded to

696
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,640
several times, is your deep love
for Grateful Dead and the

697
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,600
ecstatic tradition that other,
that other frontier that is, you

698
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,720
know, perhaps all encompasses a
little bit more wild west, but

699
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,320
does have a lot of power of
community, in some ways, I

700
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,320
think, has had more influence on
culture than any ceremony or

701
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,740
therapeutic the frontier of this
particular tradition. So I want

702
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,940
to get a sense of what your
thoughts are on the importance

703
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,060
of both of these particular
pathways, and take your time

704
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,700
with this. I know there's a lot
going on there importance of

705
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,320
both these particular pathways,
and then how you feel that they

706
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,220
can both be held, not as you
know, this grateful that is the

707
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,160
ugly step child of psychedelic
you know, use. But how can we

708
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,240
embrace both these pathways and
the importance of them,

709
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,460
furthering this renaissance,
furthering this culture?

710
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,920
Raymond Turpin: Good question. I
think it's doable. I think it's

711
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,920
necessary. Yeah, I think, you
know, the medical model that

712
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,980
we're kind of all kind of well,
that we're kind of pursuing

713
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,400
right now, it gets a bad rap
from a lot of folks. And when

714
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,300
you look back historically, 50s
and 60s, early 70s, when

715
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,940
psychedelic research was
happening, you know, it was old

716
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,720
white guys, they were all doing
it. There wasn't people of color

717
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,420
involved, and it was this very
kind of stodgy sciency thing,

718
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,920
guys in white lab coats, even
for a while there and and so I

719
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,500
think that there's some
criticism, some of it is

720
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,060
appropriate, that you know, that
you know, if we just keep this

721
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,960
to be the province of doctors,
that we're going to miss out on

722
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,320
a big piece of what we're trying
to accomplish here. And I think

723
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,660
Albert Hoffman even said,
Whatever you do, don't leave

724
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,480
this only in the hand of the
doctors. This is right before he

725
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,560
passed away, and but I think
that there's a couple of things

726
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,580
to think about. I think that the
way our culture is set up, I

727
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,200
honestly feel like the way that
we are going to finally get to

728
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,900
maybe get one of these schedule
one psychedelics across the

729
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,320
finish line, towards approval,
is going to have to be through

730
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,840
this medical model. It's going
to have to show that it may be

731
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,080
successfully treats mental
illness and other issues that

732
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,360
maybe we're not so successfully
treating right now. And so I do

733
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,220
feel like that that is going to
be important to be able to do

734
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,020
that. I think one of the reasons
maps and Rick Doblin chose to

735
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:52,180
push MDMA is that first one is
that unlike LSD and Psilocybin,

736
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,760
which can create, you know,
pretty profound perceptual

737
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,720
distortions and sometimes some
disorientation, MDMA even when

738
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,880
you're in the throes of a
person. Heavy dose is that there

739
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,540
is a mental acuity that stays
present, and people tend to have

740
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,020
good recall later about what
their experience was, and you

741
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,140
don't have that disorientation,
and typically not the perceptual

742
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,440
disturbances. And so I think he
thought very wisely that that

743
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,480
would probably be an easier one
to get the authorities, the FDA,

744
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,980
to consider passing and
accepting and making it approved

745
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:30,380
for medicine. So I think that
that is, it's a legitimate track

746
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,620
of research, and I think it's a
legitimate way to try to get it

747
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,560
in, across the line in our
culture, to get it initially

748
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,960
accepted. You know, now, in the
60s, it started off that way. It

749
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,380
was in the lab even Timothy
Leary, once he started doing his

750
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,380
Psilocybin research in Harvard.
You know, he had people like

751
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,160
Aldous Huxley and Gerald heard
and these philosophers and

752
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,940
writers coming in to Harvard and
having Psilocybin sessions done

753
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,720
with him. And Aldous Huxley was
very adamant about, do not let

754
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,800
this get out. You need to be
careful about who you turn on.

755
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,200
You need to turn on the writers
and the musicians and the

756
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,260
philosophers and the leaders,
and you need to introduce it to

757
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,960
the culture in this way. And
then Leary being at the

758
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,720
forefront of this thing, who
didn't you know. He didn't know

759
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,120
what he was doing. And this guy
was a deep was a deeply flawed

760
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,760
human being. I am a big Tim
Leary fan, but he was a deeply

761
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,080
flawed human being. And one of
the things he said was that he

762
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,780
made the decision that this
should be an egalitarian

763
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,420
experience, that he felt like it
was the fifth freedom, that

764
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,580
everybody should be able to
manage their own nervous

765
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,760
systems. And so he said, thereby
hangs the tail when he made that

766
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,180
decision, that it needed to be
available. And so the problem

767
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,640
was he went out there telling
everybody, everybody's got a

768
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,200
right to take LSD, everybody has
a right to find their inner God,

769
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,220
or whatever it was that people
could find. But the trouble was,

770
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,980
people would take it, go to a
party. Their childhood sexual

771
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,680
abuse would come up, they would
have no support, they would not

772
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,140
be an appropriate setting, and
they'd end up in the ER and on

773
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,840
the front page of the newspaper.
And so enough of those happened,

774
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,300
and it gave the government
everything they needed to do to

775
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,700
try to shut all this down. So I
think that we have to be very

776
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,200
careful about how it's put out
there in some ways. And I do

777
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,360
think right now, one of the
advantages we have that we

778
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,360
didn't have in the 70s is the
internet. You're not going to

779
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,640
put this genie back in the
bottle at this point. There's

780
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,820
too much information out there.
Too many people know about these

781
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,540
substances, and in a lot of
cases, how to use them safely,

782
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,640
because there is some good
information out there on the

783
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,160
internet. So I do feel like that
this medical model is for good

784
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,700
or ill than the necessary model
that we need to use to try to

785
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,360
start to establish these things
as medicines, and if our culture

786
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,140
can maintain some wisdom and
some objectivity in order to

787
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,720
continue to rate to measure
these compounds objectively as

788
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,180
medicines, then we're going to
have a much better chance of

789
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:50,560
getting these things approved.
So, so that's kind of that

790
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:55,960
statement over here. I had a lot
of fun, I had a lot of growth, I

791
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,020
had a lot of spiritual
experiences that were just

792
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,360
unbelievable, and these were not
under clinical supervision, you

793
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,840
know. And when you look back on
the use of psychedelics, plant

794
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,260
medicines, ritual and
celebration was a huge

795
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,380
fundamental human thing that
people did, and oftentimes

796
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,200
psychedelics were a part of
that. And so I think that

797
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,140
ability to celebrate being
alive, being here on this

798
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,980
planet, being with your friends,
listening to great music, or

799
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,140
whatever it is that you're
doing, camping or whatever

800
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,020
you're doing. I think that's
also a very important piece of

801
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:31,700
this. I do think that there is
more risk taking that model. I

802
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,160
definitely went to some shows
and saw some people really

803
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,680
struggling that probably should
not have been there, doing what

804
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,080
they were doing for whatever
reason, but the dead was it

805
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,320
eventually evolved into what I
call just it was psychotherapy

806
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,920
on a mass scale. It felt like
you'd have about 25,000 people

807
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,880
in there, most of them tripping
on something. And this music was

808
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,500
very it was born of LSD. I mean,
Owsley, who was their patron

809
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,300
saint, was probably the largest
LSD chemist in the history of

810
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,500
humanity. And he was basically
buying their equipment and

811
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,140
feeding them LSD, and so they
were high all the time figuring

812
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,600
out how to play their music
together. And so this music that

813
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,300
came out was an amalgamation of
all these different styles of

814
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,340
music, jazz, rock and roll,
blues, Dixieland, experimental.

815
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,380
And so you had this very bizarre
yet somehow familiar type of

816
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,440
music that came out and and I
think it spoke to a lot of

817
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,440
people, particularly when they
were in these states. Robert

818
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,600
hunter and a lot of the
lyricists for the dead, they

819
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,380
wrote very mystical, archetypal
types of songs. The lyrics were

820
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,280
very a song would mean something
to me for five years, and then

821
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,920
I'd be at a show going through a
particular experience in my

822
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,820
life, and that song would speak
to me in a completely different

823
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,700
way that I had been turned off,
had not been aware of before,

824
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,220
which is what great art does.
There's just levels of it in

825
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:53,320
there. And so it was this just
continuing flower for, I guess,

826
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,580
85 to 95 for 10 years, it was my
psychotherapy, but I felt like

827
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,600
that they had it set up in a way
that there was. Somewhat of a

828
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,480
container. There were rituals
around it, from getting the

829
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,300
tickets to get in there early to
getting in line to get in your

830
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,060
seats, taking care of each other
when you're in there, there was,

831
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,480
there was an idea that everybody
was there to take care of each

832
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,000
other that you don't really see
too much at shows anymore these

833
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,460
days, unfortunately, but back in
the day, there was really that

834
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,900
ethos at the Grateful Dead show.
So it did feel like a fairly

835
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,580
safe place that you could go and
let it all hang out and with a

836
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,040
lot of other people. And I can
remember times opening my eyes

837
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,220
with 20,000 people synced up,
and everybody grooving. And, I

838
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,920
mean, I just felt like my head
was going to explode. It was so

839
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,420
good. And you realize that there
was just a lot more to life than

840
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,320
the one dimensional life that we
kind of get up and go to work

841
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,320
and do a lot of days, and that
sort of inspired me, and

842
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,900
inspired a lot of other people
and a lot of other bands. I

843
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,180
mean, a lot of that. There's a
lot of other bands that came out

844
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:52,480
of that scene. So I think, to
answer your question, I think

845
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,780
that that whole realm of
psychedelic exploration is

846
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,680
absolutely important. It's
absolutely necessary, I think.

847
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,700
But I think that people have to
recognize that there's a little

848
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,040
more risk that comes with doing
them in that kind of

849
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,760
environment, and so you need to
take it upon yourself to educate

850
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,640
yourself about whatever it is
you're taking, who you're with.

851
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,520
Know something about set and
setting, so that you can go and

852
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,320
have a safe and productive good
time.

853
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,160
Ehren Cruz: Thank you, Ram. Yep,
there's, you know, the movements

854
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,860
that have spawn from that, many
of our favorite bands, from fish

855
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,220
to my personal STS, nine, I have
to give them a little credit out

856
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,700
there. But um, freeze and Mo and
and also other cultures, Rainbow

857
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,340
gatherings, Burning Man, this is
all from the stimulation of

858
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,440
their radical creativity.
Communitas, you know, the

859
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,960
environmental connection that
comes through that. And I think

860
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,140
it's important people forget,
you know, the ellucidian

861
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,440
mysteries, who were the Greek
sacred ceremonial mysteries,

862
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,440
with the ceremonial theater of
initiation, with the Qi, Qi, on

863
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,920
which is the elixir and beverage
that was found to have ergot,

864
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,700
which is the base component of
LSD. 25 two to 3000 people would

865
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,580
go through those mysteries at
the same time. So the idea of

866
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,020
large alchemical ecstatic ritual
is as old as humanity, and an

867
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:05,340
important part of this, of our
lineage, in a process. So, So,

868
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,520
Chris, I want to ask you about,
now, this high end dosage in

869
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,980
because now, as we've we've
talked about, you know, most of

870
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,020
the time when you're looking at
the research studies you're

871
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,600
working with, you know,
psychedelic doses, maybe a

872
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,700
moderate dose. You know,
everywhere from, I know, with

873
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:22,520
them, with Psilocybin, be like,
about a gram to about 3.5 grams

874
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,760
or so. And there's a lot of deep
value there that can come

875
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,000
through that particular
experience and is profound as

876
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,360
well. But most of the time that
works with your biographical

877
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,940
healing. You know, your own
personal wounds and traumas and

878
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:38,480
kind of working back to that
state of acceptance, release,

879
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,460
self forgiveness,
reconciliation. But why the high

880
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,920
dose, you know, like and you
know, there is, you talked about

881
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,500
there, you know, there's a
concept of spiritual, maybe self

882
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,100
actualization, those things.
But, you know, is there a realm

883
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,160
currently, right now, for people
to push further? And if there

884
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,880
is, you know, what is it that I
think, as a collective, we might

885
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,800
be seeking in that particular
space? I

886
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,860
Raymond Turpin: I, first of all,
I really agree with you,

887
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,480
Raymond, that it's the medical
work and the therapeutic work

888
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,300
with psychedelics, which is
bringing psychedelics back into

889
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,960
our society. And that's that's
so important, and it's so

890
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,960
important that we do it well,
and it's so important that we

891
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,020
document the therapeutic
capacity. And as we do and once

892
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,520
we do that, once we get it back
in, then the question naturally

893
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,700
arises, okay, if it's an
amplifier, and if it amplifies

894
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,940
our consciousness, and if it
pulls up all these dark things,

895
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,840
and we can address them and heal
them and and re establish some

896
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,900
type of spiritual communion with
the universe around us, then how

897
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:49,600
far can we take it? What's going
to happen next and and I think

898
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,780
that it's going to take some
time, and some people are

899
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:57,340
already, of course, pushing what
we're Where can it go next? But

900
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,960
in terms of institutional
exploration, we're not there

901
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,960
yet, but we will be. It's just a
matter of time, because in these

902
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,200
states, it's it's not the
psychedelic that does the work.

903
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,080
It's consciousness that does the
work. Psychedelic is an

904
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,500
amplifier. And so when you get
right down to it is the

905
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,060
psychedelic that does the work
that and so if you handle the

906
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:24,920
consciousness carefully. You can
use it in the same way that

907
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,420
happens on a meditation cushion
at a Zen session. And that's, I

908
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,020
call it my work sessions. I'm
very specific about that, and

909
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,580
it's really a play on the
Japanese word session. A session

910
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,260
is a period of concentrated
spiritual practice, all right?

911
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,860
And so that's where I think of
my psychedelic work, is there

912
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,580
were X number of sessions, and I
can tell you exactly what I was

913
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:52,420
doing on one particular day and
one particular year, on one

914
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:58,540
particular session in that
process, I really do. I

915
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,580
honestly, sincerely do. Not
recommend that people do what I

916
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,880
did, honestly. I mean, there's
so many ways for this to go

917
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,380
wrong, and I was fortunate, and
I had a constitution that I

918
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:16,740
found I had a capacity to open
up into great breath and to get

919
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,780
very fluid and to dissolve and
lose my boundaries at level

920
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:25,160
after level, and then I could
congeal naturally at the end of

921
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,580
the day. Not everybody is built
like that. Not everybody has

922
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:32,480
that capacity. People need more
support going into this type of

923
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,500
work. And I wouldn't do it the
same way over again. I just

924
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,320
would not. I would be much
gentler with myself. I would

925
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,540
work with the balance of high
doses, occasionally lower doses,

926
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:49,720
Psilocybin balancing with LSD,
maybe in Ayahuasca, but I really

927
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,980
would take a much more nuanced
balancing approach, integrative

928
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,980
approach. I mean, there's kind
of a breakthrough session, and

929
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,180
then lower dose work, maybe with
Psilocybin to absorb and

930
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:04,020
integrate that material. But one
of the reasons I would do it

931
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,560
differently than I did it when I
did it is because I had this

932
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,340
mindset in that when I did this
work, first of all, that I was

933
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,940
it was personal, and that I
learned it's not personal.

934
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,260
Personal is the first layer. But
if you push him deeper, then the

935
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,820
dynamics of your work. Stop
being personal. They become

936
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,340
collective. You're working with
the collective psyche. You're

937
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,160
working with, and then you're
working with an evolutionary

938
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,460
process. You're working with an
historical process. And the

939
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:34,040
visions are not personal
visions, they're historical

940
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,880
visions. They're human human
visions. And it's a different

941
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,620
scale. But I thought when I did
this work, I thought that the

942
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:45,220
goal was to get somewhere. The
goal was to become enlightened,

943
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,060
or to become one with God, or to
dissolve into the meta cosmic

944
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:56,980
void, as Dan used to say. And
what I learned is about 17 years

945
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,660
into my work, 16 years into my
work, when I was as deep as I

946
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,980
would ever go. In my psychedelic
exploration, I was in the

947
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,480
diamond Luminosity, and I was in
a sweet spot, way beyond time

948
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:15,180
and space, resting in the
luminous body of the divine in

949
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:21,980
Dharmakaya. In that context, I
had a visionary experience. The

950
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,440
World opened and showed me a
world far in the distance, a

951
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,880
light filled world, and a ray of
light hit me from that world,

952
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:37,280
and it absolutely shattered me.
It took me 20 minutes to kind of

953
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,200
pull myself back together into
the Lama Luminosity condition.

954
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,160
And that's when I learned it's
an infinite progression. There's

955
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,740
no such thing as getting to the
end of it. You're not going to

956
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,920
get to the end of it, no matter.
I couldn't get to the end of it.

957
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,040
And that's when I began to
appreciate that it's really

958
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,940
about opening up, letting as
much of the wisdom and of the

959
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,680
healing energy and the insight
energy that universe, letting as

960
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,260
much of it in this you can
manage as you can handle,

961
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:10,320
absorbing it, digesting it. It's
not about getting to a condition

962
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,520
of awakening or getting into a
condition of God realization. I

963
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,280
mean, those are all fine. Those
are all wonderful as they come.

964
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,240
But as a psychedelic path, it's
not about getting to a

965
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,040
condition. It's about really how
you live your life. So I'm much

966
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,480
more attentive now, or a
conscious now, of the dying, of

967
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,440
keeping the process of the
dying, of keeping how you live

968
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,800
with those experiences. Because
truly, I'm going to be doing

969
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,980
some teaching soon in the
Kettleman assistant training

970
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:47,200
program. What's in in San
Francisco? Pardon. Polaris,

971
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,440
yeah, and it, my job is
integration, talking about

972
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,800
integration and talking, you
know, our discussion of

973
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,160
integration works well when
you're working at the

974
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,020
psychodynamic level of the
personal unconscious level, even

975
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,860
when you are having spiritual
experiences, you're tapping into

976
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,560
the, you know, the intelligence
that runs through all things.

977
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,520
And you're tapping into, you
know, your divine nature, which

978
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,920
is part of the nature that runs
through all things. We have

979
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,240
spiritual models for how to
integrate those experiences. But

980
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,580
when you push deep, into the
deep waters, when you're really

981
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,360
tapping into deep levels of the
infinite and when you're

982
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,680
transcending time, how the fuck
do you integrate those

983
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,000
experiences? What does
integration even mean? How does

984
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,960
a finite being integrate the
infinite? How does it being

985
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,360
which is a time space being is
finely tuned to the dynamics of

986
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,500
linear time and three
dimensional space. How does that

987
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:52,300
being integrate trans temporal
experiences, trans spatial

988
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,380
experiences? What does it mean
to integrate them and and so I

989
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:00,180
think we have to sort of stop
erase everything that. We've

990
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,820
learned about integration, or
much of what we've learned when

991
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,760
we're talking about working at
the personal, unconscious level,

992
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,000
and it becomes something
different. And I think we can

993
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,620
learn a lot from the indigenous
cultures. But I also think that

994
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,320
if we look at the psychedelics
that indigenous cultures we're

995
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,900
using, and we're looking at the
psychedelics that are available

996
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,400
to us today and the therapeutic
protocols that are available to

997
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,840
us today. It's not an
unreasonable hypothesis that we

998
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,200
are pushing deeper than many of
the indigenous cultures pushed,

999
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,940
and that raises challenges that
go beyond even what we can learn

1000
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:39,680
from the indigenous cultures on
how to navigate those those

1001
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:44,260
encounters. I think we're going
we're going to get there. We're

1002
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,200
going to get to these issues
eventually. I don't think we're

1003
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,100
going to get to these issues,
probably while I'm alive. I

1004
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,860
think this is going to take
time. It's going to take time

1005
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,100
for Raymond and all the Raymonds
in this movement to really

1006
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,620
achieve a true grounding in our
culture of these psychedelics,

1007
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,580
and then we can start to open up
the deeper door, and then we'll

1008
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,000
and then we start to open up a
deeper door still, in a deeper

1009
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,300
door still, it's going to take,
I think it's going to be

1010
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:17,340
generations moving into this
material. This is not short term

1011
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,020
work as a culture. This is long
term work, because what we're

1012
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:25,040
talking about is not just
learning that there is a wisdom

1013
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,160
in the universe, that there is
an intelligence guiding the

1014
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,720
universe or birthing the
universe in the Big Bang process

1015
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,380
and the unfolding process, but
we're talking about changing, or

1016
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:42,100
expanding, radically expanding
our fundamental communion with

1017
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:47,140
that universe, then that that's
a deep, deep journey for all of

1018
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,060
us to be making culturally
together.

1019
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,360
Ehren Cruz: Yeah. Thank you so
much. Chris. You know, because

1020
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,540
the next, the next actual
question I had was showing how

1021
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:02,340
rapidly we're moving, and I
think that's really important

1022
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,700
that you immediately caution
that with slowing down and being

1023
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,580
patient with the synthesis of
what this means on such a

1024
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,780
transcendental level of you know
what it can mean for culture,

1025
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:16,920
for civilization as a whole.
Because, you know, looking at

1026
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,800
the current renaissance, you
know, right now, we have over

1027
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,540
350 universities opening formal
psychedelic research

1028
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:28,640
departments. We have 25,000 op
eds and over 2000 peer reviewed

1029
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,220
journal articles published on
psychedelics in just the past

1030
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,700
two years. FDA is impending
clearance of MDMA in 2024 for

1031
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,180
therapeutic use and decrim and
legalization movements across

1032
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:42,760
the country, city and state. So
we are hitting a momentum

1033
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,780
unprecedented to this level at
this time and and, of course,

1034
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:50,380
you know, from Oprah to Aaron
Rodgers, you know to, you turn

1035
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,780
on the TV, and every other day
there's another celebrities

1036
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,060
having an experience. So it's,
you know, the genie is very,

1037
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:59,920
very much out the bottle. But
this idea of that, this is going

1038
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,260
to leapfrog us directly into a
space where everybody has

1039
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,320
touched upon the illumination of
the psychedelic we're all ready

1040
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,560
to fully synthesize that into
daily life. I think that's

1041
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,260
something that's going to take a
lot of time to do it right, to

1042
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,860
have the ethics and honoring and
respect of the deep time of the

1043
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,660
lineages and the indigenous that
come before us. So this is kind

1044
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,720
of, this question is open ended.
But, you know, where do you see

1045
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,260
this headed in the next few
years? You know, I think from

1046
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,780
your behalf, Dr Turpin, you're
working right on the front lines

1047
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:34,100
of legality. So you're preparing
for the, at least the the gate

1048
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,980
of MDMA to open up. And, you
know, there's this a lot of work

1049
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,380
there, I know, just from the,
from the side, part of that all

1050
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:47,920
and and what do you have for
advice for us, as we continue to

1051
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,580
step into this ourselves, as as
people that are wanting to be

1052
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,460
caretakers of this medicine,
culture and movement now, what

1053
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,800
do you think from your
experiences going from the deep,

1054
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,980
depths of the underground and
the shadow days to now, where We

1055
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:03,060
are, where it's you know, it's
now becoming contemporary,

1056
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,760
acceptable to be open about it.
So those two questions there,

1057
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,280
what do you see this immediately
happening, and how's that going

1058
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:08,640
forward?

1059
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:16,080
Raymond Turpin: Good question.
Hmm. Well, you know, if taking a

1060
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,380
psychedelic made you better
human being, then we would all

1061
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:22,100
be, probably three fourths of
our country would be Buddhas by

1062
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:25,940
now. So taking a psychedelic
doesn't necessarily make you a

1063
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,420
better human being. I think
there's so much about intention

1064
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,880
and so much about the
integration. As far as what are

1065
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,400
you going to do with the
experience that matters? And so

1066
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,840
I think that we've got to
continue to educate people about

1067
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,100
the importance of that, it's not
just taking the compound, it's

1068
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,340
really doing the ritual work
afterwards and and, you know,

1069
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,400
when people come into our
ketamine program, I tell them

1070
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,220
right off the bat, don't expect
the ketamine to do the work. You

1071
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,400
know, it might make you feel
great. It might absolutely you

1072
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,680
know, you might lose a lot of
your depression symptoms you've

1073
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,920
had for 20 years. But if you
don't take the insights, the.

1074
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,820
You gained in that experience,
and bring them into your

1075
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:06,300
everyday life. Maybe do a little
less of this or more of this,

1076
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,360
then chances are you're going to
regress back to baseline in four

1077
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:13,020
to eight weeks. And so there's
it's so important that people

1078
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,620
understand that these things are
windows into the unconscious and

1079
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,920
windows into the deep self. I
like to use the Jung Ian giant s

1080
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,440
self that you know the self is
this almost limitless thing

1081
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,380
underneath our I know it's part
and parcel of our ego, but our

1082
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,620
ego is just a tiny little part
of this giant self. And that the

1083
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:34,760
self is this knowing. It is this
inner healing intelligence. It

1084
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,760
knows what we need to be whole
and balanced, and it's always

1085
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,660
pushing to be known, whether
it's through dreams or

1086
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:44,440
psychedelics or whatever. And so
teaching people how to

1087
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,180
understand that these
experiences are glimpses. They

1088
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,760
are, they're they're
instructional dreams, almost.

1089
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,120
They're glimpses into their deep
self, and then teaching people

1090
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,060
how to value and bring these
things forward is going to be

1091
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:03,060
the key. So I do see things
moving along at a pretty quick

1092
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,100
pace, quicker than I ever
thought. I mean, I was at the

1093
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,500
point where I was like, Damn,
I'm like, 50. I don't know if

1094
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,780
this is ever going to happen.
Maybe I need to think about

1095
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,540
going into the underground. But
then MDMA showed up, you know,

1096
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:15,120
and I was like, wow. Okay,
maybe, maybe it's not too late.

1097
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm still up, right? Maybe I got
another 10 or 15 years. That's

1098
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,940
good. So I was really excited to
see that happening. And you

1099
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:26,000
know, I think we all again, have
such a responsibility to educate

1100
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
other people, people that are
curious about these things, so

1101
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,880
that they get good information
that's grounded in science,

1102
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,760
that's grounded in tradition,
that's grounded in love and self

1103
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,000
caring and self acceptance. It's
also important as we go forward

1104
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,320
with this, what was the second
part of your question,

1105
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,920
Ehren Cruz: yeah, I think for
the insight as to advice of us

1106
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:48,520
moving forward as a collective
Yes, Vann, you know what you see

1107
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,820
immediately, too, with the MDMA
and Pearl. Oh, yeah,

1108
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,240
Raymond Turpin: yeah, the MDMA
is interesting right now, what

1109
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,140
I'm hearing, and Haley, correct
me if I'm wrong, is that maps is

1110
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,580
in the process of getting their
new drug application in place to

1111
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:06,060
submit to the FDA. The phase
three studies are over. We are

1112
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:10,320
treating our last three for us
MDMA patients, and that's all

1113
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,740
been closed. The last patients
are being treated. And then I

1114
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,980
understand that there is about a
pallet or two of paper that have

1115
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,980
to be submitted to the FDA and a
new drug application, and so

1116
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,940
that all is going to get
submitted, hopefully, maybe by

1117
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:26,240
early next year, maybe it sounds
like and then everything I'm

1118
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,300
hearing is that, hopefully, if
things go well, sometime next

1119
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,660
year, around this time, maybe
late 2024 we might find it

1120
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:36,980
approved for PTSD. The problem
is, is that, how long is it

1121
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,560
going to take for insurance
companies then get on board and

1122
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,580
be willing to reimburse for
these treatments. They are 4647

1123
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,740
hour protocols. There's two
guides or therapists every step

1124
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,560
of the way. For good reason. I
don't see that model changing

1125
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:54,160
after acceptance. One of the
things I do see is right now in

1126
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,860
the expanded access model, is
the treatment team has to be

1127
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,380
made up of a lead therapist
that's either an MD or a

1128
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:03,000
psychologist, and then the CO
therapist has to be a licensed

1129
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,520
therapist. And I think what
we're going to see after we move

1130
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,000
into approval is that one of the
treatment team is going to need

1131
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,480
to be a licensed therapist who's
been trained by maps, and then,

1132
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,540
technically, the other person
could be someone that's not a

1133
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,360
therapist. It could be a nurse.
It could even be a clergy

1134
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,440
member. It could be somebody
else, as long as they have been

1135
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:24,680
properly trained by maps. And so
I think that's going to be key

1136
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:28,400
to bringing the cost down, is
having that be the team makeups

1137
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,580
be a little bit more reasonable
like that. And one of the

1138
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,700
reasons we did our nonprofit was
to try to figure out a way to

1139
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,160
generate funding so that people
could access things like

1140
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,240
ketamine and MDMA, because it is
going to be expensive for most

1141
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:45,520
people until insurance companies
do get online. So, and I also

1142
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,920
think that there's going to be
an enormous need to train

1143
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,680
therapists and how to do MDMA
work. Maps has been doing a

1144
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,260
really good job of getting
people through their training

1145
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:56,740
program, but it gets you all the
way to the last step, and so

1146
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,320
essentially, we have hundreds of
therapists out there that have

1147
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,740
gone through the maps training,
but they lack what's called the

1148
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:04,980
supervised clinical experience,
which is where you actually

1149
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,080
treat somebody from the
beginning to the end of the

1150
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,960
protocol under clinical
supervision. That's the final

1151
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,960
step to being certified. So
we're going to have a bit of a

1152
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,500
bottleneck, I think, of
therapists at when it gets

1153
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,500
approved. And so one of the
things we're trying to do at the

1154
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,220
pearl is that my treatment
partner, Kim Skelton and I are

1155
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:25,700
trying to treat enough folks and
beg the folks at maps enough to

1156
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,640
where we could be a facility
where some of these folks from

1157
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,220
Asheville and in North Carolina
could come and hopefully finish

1158
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,620
their training, get their
certification done with us,

1159
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:37,640
without having to go out of
state and do that so. So I would

1160
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,260
suggest for people that are
interested in continuing to

1161
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,920
facilitate this opening of
psychedelics, or this reopening

1162
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,220
of psychedelics, or wanting to
get involved in it. It's really

1163
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:51,940
about educating yourself. There
are wonderful things out there

1164
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:54,580
that you can learn from. There's
YouTube videos, there's great

1165
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,940
books for people that want to do
MDMA work right now, you're

1166
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,140
going to have to go through the
maps program. Or that may open

1167
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,840
up in five. Who knows years? Who
knows? But right now, they're

1168
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,080
the ones that have the protocol
all down, and they're ready to

1169
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:12,000
train folks, but and then I
think Psilocybin is probably,

1170
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
maybe everything I'm hearing is
like, maybe three years behind.

1171
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:18,300
They're starting some of the
phase three studies. And so

1172
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,500
that'll move on, and hopefully
that'll be, I think Psilocybin

1173
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,040
is going to have greater utility
than MDMA. I think MDMA is

1174
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,580
always going to be dynamite for
trauma work and PTSD work, and

1175
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,460
also for relational problems,
interpersonal communication

1176
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,940
issues like marriage counseling,
couples work. That was what MDMA

1177
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,940
was shown to have great value
for in the early 80s, before it

1178
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:41,380
became a schedule one. And so I
do see it continuing to do that,

1179
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:45,160
and then I see Psilocybin having
really wide applicability to

1180
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:48,640
many different kinds of issues.
And I never thought I'd see LSD

1181
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,640
getting studied in my lifetime.
And it's actually the doors

1182
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,040
cracking open on that one too.
And that's a little harder,

1183
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,040
because you're looking at 10 to
12 hour sessions, which, as Stan

1184
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,620
said, were brutal, you know, to
have to be in there that long,

1185
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,180
even an eight hour MDMA session
can be long. We're exhausted by

1186
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,700
the end. By six o'clock, when
the overnight person gets there,

1187
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:10,500
we're like, man, we're ready. So
So anyway, I think things are on

1188
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,520
a good track. I'm always worried
something crazy is going to

1189
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,920
happen and be on the headlines,
and then it's going to set

1190
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,600
everything back. But you know,
so far, we've gotten pretty

1191
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,120
lucky, and I think part of that
is because of the internet, and

1192
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,580
there's been a dissemination of
information out there. There

1193
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:29,120
wasn't there back in the 70s and
60s, about what how these things

1194
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,060
operate, what they do in the
brain, the importance of set and

1195
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,280
setting, and how to have, how to
be able to use these things

1196
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,460
safely and responsibly. So my
advice would be able to just

1197
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,860
keep your eyes open and see
what's coming down the pipe.

1198
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,160
MDMA is, I think, going to be
the first one that gets

1199
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,940
approved, hopefully. And if
you're interested in going into

1200
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,940
that work, get the background
that you need to be able to

1201
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,220
apply to maps, to get the work
done, to get the stud the

1202
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,540
training done, and and then
again, just continue to model

1203
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:59,140
for people out there that this
is serious work, and we all take

1204
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:03,060
it responsibly and we have an
ethical it's incumbent upon all

1205
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,240
of us to have this ethical
responsibility as we conduct

1206
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,460
ourselves out there, because
people look at us and go, Oh,

1207
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,980
you're a psychedelic person, and
they want us. And I think it's

1208
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:14,340
important that we are able to
comport ourselves in a way that

1209
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,980
we're doing our part to help
push these things forward.

1210
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,900
I let me expand the context. I
completely agree with everything

1211
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,960
you're saying, Raymond. I really
do in terms of particularly

1212
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,020
applications of MDMA and the
broader role and range of

1213
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:36,500
Psilocybin, and we haven't
talked about five Meo DMT and

1214
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,320
its therapeutic potential. I'd
like to expand the context a

1215
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:47,620
little bit. Those of you who
know my work know that my

1216
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:51,220
visionary experience is that we
are coming into a time of

1217
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:55,840
profound social catharsis,
crisis, transformational Press,

1218
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,980
Press pressure. And so when I
look ahead 10 years, 20 years,

1219
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:06,060
and I picture this gathering
here 10 years from now. 20 years

1220
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:10,080
from now, the background, social
context, will be radically

1221
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,400
different. We're moving into
profound crisis, an ego

1222
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,240
environmental crisis, global
climate change crisis, which is

1223
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,020
triggering, going to be
triggering all sorts of economic

1224
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:25,040
and social crises, and that
means political crises. And you

1225
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,880
know, when the ocean level is
rising and cities are flooding

1226
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:35,120
and millions of ecological
refugees are moving across the

1227
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:42,280
planet, the social instability
is going to be enormous. And so

1228
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,100
that means, if we ask, well,
what is the role of psychedelics

1229
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:50,320
in that changing world? It's not
the simple therapeutic processes

1230
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:57,400
of today, but my background. I
believe in reincarnation. I

1231
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:02,040
don't think that's a hard sell
in this crowd. It's a it's a

1232
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,060
standard part of my experience
in psychedelic work and and that

1233
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,960
means that each one of us, if
our collective culture, is

1234
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,200
coming into a time of crisis
where we have to make life and

1235
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,020
death decisions about how we
live on this planet and how we

1236
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:22,400
live with each other inside, we
are carrying large pieces of the

1237
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,360
history of humanity inside our
being, in our reincarnational

1238
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:30,620
history. So what's trying to
take place in the world around

1239
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:35,120
us is also trying to take place
in the world inside of us. And

1240
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:40,160
if I, if you are like me, you
know that there's a tremendous

1241
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,120
purification process taking
place is a tremendous

1242
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,860
intergenerational, inner
evocative process, inner healing

1243
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:53,020
process, and it's like that's
why I think so many people are

1244
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:56,380
doing yoga and meditation, and
they need all the help they can

1245
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,920
get to handle the up rush that's
coming from deep within the.

1246
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,960
Psyche, and that's going to
increase. That's going to

1247
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:10,020
increase in the decades ahead.
Because this this process, we

1248
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:14,580
can't make the jump to where we
need to go to live on this earth

1249
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:19,860
until we have digested and
processed and transcended the

1250
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:23,360
history of our behavior on this
earth and the history of our

1251
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,080
behavior with each other, and it
has to come out, and it has to

1252
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,980
be dealt with at an individual
and a collective level in order

1253
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:36,080
for us to be receptive to the
inflow, the increased inflow of

1254
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,440
salvific energy that's coming
into us and moving us into a

1255
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,080
different phase. So that means
the dance is changing. The

1256
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:48,880
stability of our current world
hopefully will last long enough

1257
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,060
to allow us to get these
substances internal to our

1258
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:56,140
system. But when we move deeper
into crisis, I would see the

1259
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:59,620
role of psychedelics for
individual and collective

1260
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:03,420
healing to increase
exponentially if we've done our

1261
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:07,680
work at this stage well. And I
think that's just really,

1262
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:12,480
really, really critical,
important. And so my suggestion

1263
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,200
for how we move forward is we
can't simply focus on our

1264
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:20,540
internal work. We have to be
focused as well on the external

1265
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:24,080
work, we have to be working at
the political level and the

1266
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,620
social level and the larger
intellect international level,

1267
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,440
as well as working on the inner
level. And those are not

1268
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:34,700
separate processes. Those are
actually deeply, deeply

1269
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:38,420
integrated, synergistic
processes as we move forward.

1270
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:43,240
You know, it all changed with
the invention of the nuclear

1271
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:48,160
bomb. Right? When Eisenhower,
who led us in World War Two, saw

1272
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,640
the pictures of the nuclear
bomb, he said, That's it. That

1273
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:56,500
changes everything. And LSD is
kind of like that came into

1274
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,860
existence at the same period of
history. The inflow of

1275
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,540
indigenous cultural wisdom comes
in shortly thereafter,

1276
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:07,980
psychedelics change everything.
Tremendous intellectual

1277
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,440
revolution is right around the
wing, right around the corner.

1278
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,860
Tremendous religious and
spiritual revolutions are right

1279
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:18,480
around the corner because, you
know, it just unleashes

1280
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,480
tremendous evolutionary forces
in our individual lives and in

1281
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,680
our collective lives. How we
handle that is going to be

1282
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,240
really important the festivals
which will be coming, the the

1283
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,320
collective healing that takes
place in these festivals will be

1284
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:40,720
really important as we move
forward. Yeah, something like

1285
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,020
that.

1286
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,800
Ehren Cruz: Thank you so much.
Chris, you know the power of the

1287
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,980
social responsibility that you
gentlemen charge us with is

1288
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:57,280
quite profound, and not only for
how we hold these medicines

1289
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,980
ourselves and care take them and
leave them out there, but how we

1290
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:04,140
work with them collectively, how
we allow them to be a part of

1291
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:07,980
our larger maybe the catalyst
for some important shifts in our

1292
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,500
life and our culture. And one of
the things that I've recognized

1293
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,980
working with Psilocybin for so
many years is it reminds us of

1294
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,560
us being first and foremost
children of this world, you

1295
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,540
know, like the mycelium that is
underneath us. You know, we are

1296
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:23,780
stewards and caretakers of this
body. We are gifted with a

1297
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:27,140
garden for us to tend and and
the more that we learn how to do

1298
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:30,740
that and honor our differences
and and symbolic relationship

1299
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,040
with those around us that
creates the foundation for, you

1300
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,620
know, beautiful fruit, you know,
intellectually, spiritually,

1301
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:39,920
emotionally, that we create
together. So that's it's as old

1302
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,940
as time that lesson, but it's
new, and it's needed more than

1303
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,400
ever as well as we step into
this greater age of

1304
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,980
responsibility and
accountability. So So thank you

1305
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:50,440
all, as you're continuing to
work with these medicines, you

1306
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,020
know these are powerful and
profound. You know harm

1307
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,840
reduction principles,
preparation, navigation,

1308
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,840
integration and synthesis of
those, caretaking of those

1309
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,320
around you is all very, very
important part of the process

1310
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,260
and and more than we know. So
we're going to open up to

1311
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,500
questions here for from a couple
of you, but let's just again,

1312
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:10,740
give a big round of applause and
a big thank you to Dr Bache for

1313
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,580
their wisdom today.

1314
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,740
So we have time for maybe two or
three questions. If you guys

1315
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,940
wanted to share real quick,
anybody have something? Steve,

1316
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:29,840
right here? Do I need the mic?
Or just shout it out?

1317
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,780
Unknown: If you can then. Dr
Bache, I've read your book, and

1318
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:35,360
if anybody has it, right? LSD,
in the mind of the universe,

1319
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,860
read that thing. I've read about
six times, and every time I go

1320
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,840
in, I go deeper and deeper. I'd
like you to pontificate about,

1321
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,320
or elaborate about. You've
talked about the 200,000 year

1322
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,500
gestation period that humanity
is in, or just coming to

1323
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,160
transition, like in the birth
Could you talk about that?

1324
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,480
Elaborate on that a little

1325
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,560
Raymond Turpin: bit you. Only
way I can speak about that, of

1326
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,620
course, is if I speak out of my
visionary experience. And so

1327
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:07,620
it's just visionary experience,
and it is only visionary

1328
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:12,120
experience, and it is visionary
experience. The creative

1329
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,840
intelligence of the universe is
not things small. It thinks

1330
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,380
large. It doesn't really think
in terms of just individuals. It

1331
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,400
thinks it's in terms of whole
species. It thinks in terms of

1332
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:26,240
whole ecosystems and planetary
development. And so

1333
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,840
ask yourself, what is the finest
that human beings can become,

1334
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:46,240
what is, if we look ahead, what
is the finest that human beings

1335
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:53,440
can be? And then imagine that
the divine wants it to be like

1336
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,980
that, and it wants it to be even
more than that. The question

1337
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:01,320
then is, how do we go from
baboons or chimpanzees to that,

1338
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,940
and it takes time. It's a
repetitive cycle, lifetime by

1339
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,000
lifetime, we accumulate more
knowledge, more wisdom,

1340
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,540
hopefully more understanding,
more wounds. So we're taking

1341
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,940
care of the wounds. We're taking
care of the past, while we're

1342
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:19,860
expanding potential, lifetime
after lifetime, 1000s of years,

1343
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,440
10s of 1000s of years, hundreds
of 1000s of years we've been at

1344
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,980
this process. We have such a
tendency to think in terms of

1345
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:31,940
short term perspective. Achieve
salvation, go to heaven, achieve

1346
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:34,880
enlightenment, go to pari
nirvana. It's an up and out

1347
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,940
cosmology which has been driving
us. But the divine doesn't think

1348
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,840
in terms of up and out
cosmology. It's about a

1349
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,500
continual receding and a
fruition that's taking place on

1350
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,220
the planet and bringing us into
ever, ever deeper levels of

1351
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:52,060
communion with the creative
wisdom of the universe and the

1352
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:56,260
joy of the universe, and holding
it in our body, and holding it

1353
01:21:56,260 --> 01:22:00,720
in place, and holding it in this
world together in peace and

1354
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,420
harmony with the other members
of this other species that we

1355
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:07,440
share this planet with and with
everyone of the human species

1356
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,820
that would share the planet
with. My sense of what's

1357
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:15,660
happening is that we're coming
into a pivot point in history

1358
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:20,420
where all of the lives that we
have lived, each of us can just

1359
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:24,440
look around this room, imagine
how many lives are being are

1360
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,100
sitting in these chairs, how
many hundreds of lives are

1361
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:33,260
sitting in each chair, and all
of those 1000s of years of

1362
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:38,900
experience sitting in each
chair. And my sense is, what's

1363
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,680
happening in history is that
there's a coming together. Not

1364
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,380
only a coming together on the
planet, forcing of the changes

1365
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:47,200
that that's taken, but there's a
coming together in the soul,

1366
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,220
that all of our former lives are
coming together. And as they

1367
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,620
come together, the first thing
we have to deal with is all

1368
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,980
their unfinished business. So we
got this pain and that pain and

1369
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,680
that issue and that trauma that
comes from this life and that

1370
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,880
life, and we have to deal with
that, but as we deal with that,

1371
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,480
it makes it easier for these
lives to come together. And

1372
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,000
although it's not just the
problems that they're bringing

1373
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,660
that that may be the first wave
that shows up, but it's all the

1374
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:15,000
learning that they're bringing,
it's all the knowledge that

1375
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,280
they're bringing, it's all the
history and texture of their

1376
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,040
relationships that they're
bringing. And remember, these

1377
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:24,500
lives have been, black, white,
every every imaginal possibility

1378
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,100
on the planet, every position in
society, every position in

1379
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:32,000
class, all the adventures, and
they're all coming together. And

1380
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,620
I think they're coming together,
and they're beginning a process

1381
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:41,740
of fusing. And went in my
experience, in my sessions when

1382
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:44,800
I experienced all my former
lives coming together and

1383
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,520
fusing. There was an explosion.
It was like they hit a critical

1384
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:52,120
mass and there was an explosion.
And there was an explosion of

1385
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:55,660
diamond consciousness that just
broke out of my chest, and it

1386
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:59,140
threw me into a deep and
profound condition where I was

1387
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:03,420
an individual, but I wasn't an
individual. I wasn't Chris

1388
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:05,700
Bache, and I wasn't an
individual with any frame of

1389
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:08,640
reference that I had known
before, but I was an individual,

1390
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,420
but I was in a deep and profound
cosmic communion as an

1391
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:17,220
individual. And I think that's
what's happening to all of us in

1392
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:22,040
history, every continent, every
person on the planet is part of

1393
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,360
this process of facilitating an
integration of all of our lives.

1394
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:31,580
And this is what I call the
birth of the diamond soul. It is

1395
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:36,080
simply the birth of the soul
consciousness inside our human

1396
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:40,540
incarnation, so that when we
experience ourselves, we do not

1397
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:44,260
experience ourselves in any way
as defined by the beginning and

1398
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:48,880
ending of this life. We have a
natural, intuitive, awake

1399
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,960
awareness, conscious awareness
of our deep history, which means

1400
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,740
a conscious awareness of our
profound social connection, a

1401
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:59,500
profound awareness of the
relativity of all these little

1402
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,860
fights that. To get into, you
know, all these stupid things

1403
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:05,340
that we have reasons to get in
conflict with their Twitter are

1404
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:09,060
not important and not relevant.
We're swallowing all these

1405
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:12,780
things as we come together. And
I think we're moving towards an

1406
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:17,460
explosion of soul consciousness
on the planet. I don't think we

1407
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,480
can live on this planet out of
egoic consciousness. And I think

1408
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,940
the ego is a beautiful, you
know, individual ego

1409
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:26,960
consciousness is a beautiful,
magnificent thing, but we cannot

1410
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,660
afford to live on this planet.
Out of that state of

1411
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:33,680
consciousness. We either evolve
into the next state of

1412
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:37,220
consciousness, which I think is
fundamentally the soul

1413
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:41,680
consciousness, or we go extinct.
And extinction is a powerful,

1414
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:46,240
psychedelic, powerful
transformational motivator, and

1415
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:51,040
I think that's the process that
we're coming into now. So how

1416
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,960
long will this take? How fast
can it happen? I don't know. And

1417
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,600
when I've seen it, when I've
experienced it in my sessions,

1418
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,440
it didn't come with dates, and
it didn't come with the with the

1419
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:05,700
brochure, the detailing how it's
going to take place. But I, but

1420
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:11,040
I've know in my bones that it's
happening, and I also know from

1421
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,940
my, I offer you, from my
visionary experience, that we

1422
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:18,300
will make it through this
process. We will survive. We

1423
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:23,300
will transform humanity. Will
make it through. It won't look

1424
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,880
like we're going to make it
through for a time. It will look

1425
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,360
like we're going to die in this
process. That is the death and

1426
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:33,860
rebirth process. We're going to
have to put it all on the line.

1427
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:36,920
We're going to have to lay it
all down and make a complete,

1428
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:40,960
radical commitment to this
process. But my experience is

1429
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:47,320
that the diamond soul is born in
history, the future human is

1430
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:53,020
born, and that future human is
magnificently beautiful, just

1431
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:58,900
beautiful beyond description.
And we see glimpses of it in the

1432
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:03,000
Great. We see it in Christ, and
we see it in the great in the

1433
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:06,720
Buddhas and the prophets of
history. Catch glimpses of

1434
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,620
what's emerging forward and
what's coming forward in all of

1435
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:13,620
our lives. We're being taken
there, and we're not in control

1436
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,440
of this process, right? We're
not in control of evolution.

1437
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,680
We're hardly in control of our
own individual evolution. There

1438
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:24,080
are deep, forces at work that
are pushing us, driving us. And

1439
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,840
lastly, we all knew what we were
getting into before we

1440
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,320
incarnated. We made a choice to
be part of this, and we'll make

1441
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,100
a choice to be part of the next
generation. We chose to be part

1442
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:41,260
of this evolutionary transition.
When you die, you don't want to

1443
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:45,040
just have a comfortable life or
an easy life. You want to have a

1444
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,580
meaningful life. And is there
anything more meaningful than

1445
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:52,120
supporting this transition that
humanity is making collectively

1446
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,980
so that we can really learn to
live together in peace on this

1447
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:02,280
planet, healed, truly healed on
the heart of all the wars and

1448
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,980
all the wounds and all the
terrible things we've done to

1449
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,860
each other and all the things
that were left unfinished

1450
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:12,840
lifetime after lifetime. Imagine
a species that's truly healed

1451
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:18,420
all that stuff, individually,
collectively healed. It Robert

1452
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,080
Monroe, whom some of you know
from his books on out of body,

1453
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:25,280
and is the Monroe Institute. He
his in his intelligent guides

1454
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,220
took him to a place in the
future, which he estimated was

1455
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:34,220
about 3000 ad and in that time
in the future, when he went

1456
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:38,900
there, the entire Bardo, where
souls go in between their

1457
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:44,380
incarnations, was empty. We had
integrated the Bardo, because

1458
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:47,800
the Bardo is basically filled
with soul fragments, just pieces

1459
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:52,780
of our lives which we didn't get
finished or whatnot. Imagine all

1460
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:56,920
of those pieces integrated into
us so that we are now whole and

1461
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,040
complete within ourselves,
within our history, and so is

1462
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:06,240
everybody else that we're living
with. If the Bardo is empty, the

1463
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,540
divine intelligence can reach
more deeply, more easily, more

1464
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:12,600
fluidly, right into the very
center of our hearts and into

1465
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,120
our minds. And that's what I
think we're all working for.

1466
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,780
That's what we're all yearning
for. So we feel it. We can feel

1467
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:22,040
it in our bones. We touch it
when we do our in our individual

1468
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,860
healing, we touch that and we
know that there's something

1469
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:29,600
afoot which is much deeper even
than our personal healing, but

1470
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,900
our personal healing is part of
it. We have to go through that

1471
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,640
if we're going to contribute to
the birth of the diamond soul in

1472
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:41,680
history. Yeah. Wow.

1473
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:52,120
Ehren Cruz: Well, I think we
might have gone on time with

1474
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,420
that, but, and I almost don't
feel like it seemed, I don't

1475
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:58,240
know how you could actually
follow that up. Be honest. I.

1476
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,540
Um, but we will be here for some
time. So if you guys want to

1477
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:08,520
connect afterward and mingle,
and please do come up and share.

1478
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:11,040
And these, these gentlemen be
here for a little bit of time to

1479
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,100
connect. And so we're going to
be wrapping up this session. But

1480
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,760
on behalf of the psychedelic
Society of Asheville, we are so,

1481
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,960
so grateful and honored to have
these wonderful guests do a

1482
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,960
fireside chat with us here this
evening. So once again, thank

1483
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:31,220
you guys so much, and please do
stay in touch with us here.

1484
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:34,400
We're psychedelic society,
avl.com, we do once a month,

1485
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:38,600
usually the final Sunday, or you
know, of a gathering together.

1486
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:41,740
We shift different topic
matters. We have, sometimes more

1487
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:44,500
back and forth sessions. We're
connecting with people, you

1488
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,140
know, cross pollinating.
Sometimes it's more harm

1489
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,420
reduction guidance, you know,
getting insights how to do this

1490
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,940
safely, ethically, stepping into
this work in medicine, with

1491
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:55,120
education resources, sometimes
bringing our creative friends in

1492
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,660
there. We had a panel of artists
that came in and gave how this

1493
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:01,920
medicine has influenced their
beautiful crafts. So please do

1494
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,980
be a part of this community
where we're open hearted and

1495
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:08,280
welcoming of all peoples and and
stick around for a little bit

1496
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,680
and say hello to each other.
There's a lot of beautiful folks

1497
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,320
in here that we'd love to, you
know, continue to establish

1498
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,140
relationships and friendships
here. So once again, thank you

1499
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:18,840
to Melissa and Joe from Sky
Mountain as well, helping us

1500
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:22,340
have this beautiful setting for
the talk. Kind of wish I was

1501
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:26,240
facing this one, but this was
excellent as well. And Blessings

1502
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,700
to you all. And have a wonderful
evening. Thanks for coming out

1503
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:39,200
tonight. You.

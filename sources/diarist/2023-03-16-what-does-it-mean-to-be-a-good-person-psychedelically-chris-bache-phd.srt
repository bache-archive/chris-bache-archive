1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,900
Unknown: Given where we are,
given what's happening. And

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,960
maybe you've already said this,
you've already answered this

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,140
somehow, but given where we are
from the perspective of the

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,520
deep, psychedelic work that
you've done, you know, what does

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,580
it mean to be a good person
right now? What is it what does

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,300
it mean to be what does it take
you know, yeah,

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,500
Chris Bache: man, it's a large
question. I

8
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,699
I think of a half dozen ways to
answer that question pop into my

9
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:56,019
mind, and all of them are wrong.
So I'm kind of sifting through

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,099
layers. I

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,780
in some of my deepest
experiences, there are moments.

12
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,640
There are times when and even
after a session, but under the

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:33,140
influence of the learning of a
session, when something just

14
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:45,520
falls away, something opens you.
Earth, and I experience the

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,260
world truly as living and
breathing as one. I feel like my

16
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,380
feet are rooted in the earth the
way a tree is rooted in the

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,160
earth. I look down at the grass
and I feel complete continuity

18
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,920
of being between everything
around me and my own being. I

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,600
feel us breathing the same air.
I feel us all different species

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,760
sharing the same moment in time.
I feel the pulse of the universe

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,260
in its utter simplicity, not
paying attention to any of our

22
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,140
divisions of species or moods or
incarnations or anything like

23
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:36,920
that, the entire universe just
being itself, and I am part of

24
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,940
that in grateful it's not even
communion, because communion

25
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,900
implies a subtle duality, and
this is when all of that falls

26
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:55,300
away and a Great transparency of
being opens from within that

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,140
position. You

28
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:21,260
I experience an opening of my
mind, kind of a delicious sense

29
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,760
of presence. It gives me an
intimacy with grass. And then at

30
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,940
a deeper level, I experience an
opening of my heart in which the

31
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,180
idea of harming anyone is the
farthest thing from my mind and

32
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,920
the idea of helping everyone is
the most natural thing in the

33
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:55,420
world. It's not being good, it
just it's it's being alive

34
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:03,000
within this reality of oneness.
So to me, goodness is simply an

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,640
approximation. Or it's a, it's
a, it's a compass needle that

36
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,320
points in the direction of this
fundamental truth of oneness.

37
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,320
And the truth of oneness has all
these derivatives that flow from

38
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,360
it circumstances, but at
essence, it's very, very simple.

39
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,940
And I think compassion,
goodness, in that way, fairness,

40
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,460
justice, are all aspects of
oneness. Are all kind of fractal

41
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:44,440
manifestations of oneness. So
what does it take to be a good

42
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,620
person today? I think it takes a
willingness, a commitment, to

43
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,280
serving a collective good, to
serving a good that's not

44
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,620
private, that opens up to future
generations, that opens up to

45
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,260
people. People who are unlike me
and species who are unlike me

46
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,880
just an honest confrontation
with what is in order to bring

47
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,160
about a better life for other
beings. I know this is very

48
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:26,180
simple, but to me, goodness is,
is, is simple. It is, is that

49
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,980
simple? It gets complicated in
the enacting of it, but in the

50
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,580
at its core it it's an action
that comes out of oneness, and

51
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,420
if it's not coming out of a deep
grounding in oneness, then maybe

52
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,140
there's something not to trust
in it, because deep goodness

53
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,660
comes out of oneness. I think,
now I don't know if this really

54
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,440
addresses the depth thought of
which your question is coming,

55
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:05,280
because I understand the true
the true angst, not angst, but

56
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,760
the true kind of quandary from
which that question comes. But

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,060
the deepest answer I have in
response to it, I'm afraid, is

58
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,260
just a mystical experience, a
mystical experience of oneness,

59
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,380
in which that context goodness
just becomes an insignificant

60
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,280
component, a spontaneous
component, just like the way you

61
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,700
react when you see something
beautiful. It's just, it's an

62
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,720
arising. It comes up inside of
you. Goodness is simply an

63
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,360
arising that comes up inside of
you when you're in the condition

64
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,440
of oneness.

65
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,140
Unknown: I have a have a, maybe
a more sort of serious response,

66
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,360
and I have a more joking
response. And the more serious

67
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,640
responses is saying along the
lines of, like, what? What does

68
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:11,220
it what does it look like to
what does the dance look like?

69
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,600
You said, it becomes difficult
in the enactment. You know, what

70
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,740
does the dance look like
between, okay, having that

71
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,640
experience, because I've had
that experience, and I can tell

72
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:31,040
you fully 100% honestly, that
anywhere from 10% of the time to

73
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,340
99% of the time, I'm not there
at all. There's no sense of it

74
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,960
whatsoever in my experience, you
know, and I am and I'm not in

75
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,160
the ground of that as I'm as,
I'm as I'm showing up in the

76
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,720
world. And I'm wondering, yeah,
you know, in the same way that

77
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,500
also the playful response was so
we all should all take 500 mics

78
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,880
of LSD, right? No, no, in the
what does it look like to have

79
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,140
had that experience? Because the
way that you speak about it, and

80
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,600
I think naturally it makes
sense, like when you're there,

81
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,440
goodness just flows from you,
right? It is the most organic

82
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,260
and natural expression of being
in the world is when you're

83
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,760
coming from that place. And yet,
having a deep and profound

84
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,400
experience doesn't make you a
deep and profound person.

85
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,560
Experiencing oneness doesn't
mean that you now walk through

86
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,980
the world inspired and infused
in all your actions. You know

87
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,620
oneness just streams from your
fingertips, and every

88
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,620
interaction is a blessing with
the world from the depth of the

89
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,260
oneness that I have embodied
simply by taking enough

90
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,580
mushrooms to touch it once. So
what does it look like then? I

91
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,960
mean, maybe this is a question
around integration. What does it

92
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,380
mean to remember that, and what
does it mean to to catch

93
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,420
ourselves in forgetting?

94
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:55,179
Chris Bache: Yeah, that's that
is, you know, we we go up on the

95
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:58,719
mountain, we see some things, we
may be given some blessings, and

96
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:01,499
then we come down, and then we
have to go to work on Monday

97
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,999
morning, and that's over and
over again. It means a matter of

98
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:13,319
constantly engaging, being aware
of how you're engaging, checking

99
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:18,179
yourself, recommitting yourself
to doing a better job, over and

100
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,179
over and over again. For me,
much of it was in my work as a

101
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:29,359
teacher, constantly, always
enjoying it, always loving to be

102
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:33,499
with the students, always
wanting to do it better, but

103
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:38,659
constantly catching myself
making assumptions, making false

104
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:42,399
inferences, not doing a good
enough job, being a little

105
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,039
tired, letting my students down
on a particular day, coming back

106
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:51,519
and trying to do better, coming
do better. The next day, do

107
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,359
better, the next week, better,
the next semester, over and over

108
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:59,919
again, trying to live up to the
things that we know to be true.

109
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:06,119
So integration is a is a strange
term, I'm not sure. I'm glad

110
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,639
that the psychedelic community
is paying more attention to

111
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,499
integration, because it's
really, really critical. But and

112
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:17,279
there are dimensions and aspects
of integration, and the word

113
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,579
integrate carries us a certain
distance, doesn't, doesn't carry

114
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:28,279
us so far, but it's it's hard to
live our visions. It's hard to

115
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,399
live the truth of what we've
seen it because it commits you

116
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,599
to constantly being aware, if
you take the time to remit to

117
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:40,299
pay attention to yourself, how
bad a job we're doing at living

118
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:44,439
those truths. But that's just,
that's the nature of the beast,

119
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:51,699
though we just it's constantly I
mean, if we are, if we live

120
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:58,119
around people who are really
good, people who really have a

121
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:04,139
deeper natural instinct for
goodness and kindness and

122
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:12,119
generosity than we have. Then it
makes it easier to sort of face

123
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:16,919
our own shortcomings, because we
have someone that we can look at

124
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:20,839
and say, Ah, that person doing
this better than I do. So this

125
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,379
gives me a measuring stick. I
can do better. I'll do it better

126
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:29,839
tomorrow. I'll keep working on
it. And that's why, you know, in

127
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,779
the Buddhist tradition,
spiritual friends, people who

128
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,339
are also have committed
themselves to awakening. That's

129
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:42,039
really one of the great Sangha
community is one of the great

130
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:48,639
pillars of progress. So, yeah,
you're right. It's wonderful to

131
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,399
have the experience, but we
don't walk around in that state,

132
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,819
but we practice and practice and
practice and then maybe 10 years

133
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:58,359
later, we were in a little bit
more. 10 years later, maybe

134
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:03,119
we're in it a little bit more,
but practice and practice and

135
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:06,599
practice. And if we ever think
that we're really there, then

136
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:10,019
all we do is ask our young
children, and they'll remind us

137
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,199
that we're not really there as
far along as we think we are,

138
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,499
our our kids will set us
straight.

139
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,620
Unknown: Or perhaps, or perhaps
we could. I think it was a Baba

140
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,340
Ram Dass said, If you ever think
you're spiritually awake and go

141
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,520
spend a week at your parents or
something like that, so maybe

142
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,540
it's the other way around.

143
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,939
Chris Bache: Yeah,

144
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,120
Unknown: you.

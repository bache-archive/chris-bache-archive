00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,845
Marc Caron: Hello and welcome to
conscious living. My name is

2
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:30,645
Mark Caron, and today I'm coming
here live from the beautiful I'm

3
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:35,025
awake Foundation Center where
they do consciousness research

4
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:37,605
and a lot of really interesting
work in the field of

5
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,585
spirituality, medicines,
consciousness and

6
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:42,765
transformation. I was blessed to
be invited, and I'm actually

7
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:46,650
broadcasting live from here
today in this episode of

8
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,530
conscious living radio where
it's going to be another Spira

9
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,190
plant medicine focused program,
and I'm happy to invite my good

10
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,150
friend and partner of the
conference, Steven gray. And

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,850
Steven always a pleasure to have
you here. We're going to be

12
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,010
airing our program today on
100.5 cfro FM in Vancouver, Co

13
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,115
Op radio. We're happy to have
been running that program for

14
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:14,415
over 15 years now locally. And
Steven, you've been a guest many

15
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:18,435
times and really a co host in
many programs. So thank you for

16
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:22,575
joining me in what's I'm sure,
going to be a really, really

17
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:25,755
great conversation with our
guests today,

18
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,620
Stephen Gray: absolutely.

19
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,700
Marc Caron: Well, Steven, I
guess you know you're a man of

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,880
many words today. Why don't you
introduce our guest? You've done

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,440
it many times, that's for sure.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,860
Stephen Gray: Yeah, happy to
Well, that's partly because I

23
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,280
have a big heart feeling toward
Chris, but also an immense

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,280
amount of respect for him as a
person and for the work that

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,380
he's done on behalf of the rest
of us in elucidating central

26
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:05,820
issues of our time. So Chris, I
could ask you for a very brief

27
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,500
synopsis of that 20 year
journey, but maybe you'd allow

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,260
me to stumble through it, and
then you can sit back and smile

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,420
and see if I got it right. So
welcome to the people who are

30
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,640
alive and those who are going to
join us later. Chris Bache, the

31
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,980
story I know about Chris is that
he is now a retired professor of

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,620
religion and philosophy, or
religious studies and

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,120
philosophy, from Ohio State
University and Youngstown, Ohio.

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,300
And early in his career, he
Well, he he was always

35
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,500
interested in mysticism and deep
spiritual exploration, and he

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,020
came upon the work of the
legendary excuse me psychiatrist

37
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,520
Stanislav Grof, who pioneered a
protocol for working with high

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,920
doses of LSD in particular. And
Chris undertook what amounted to

39
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,120
what turned out to be a 20 year
journey of 73 high dose LSD

40
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,980
sessions following the Stan Grof
protocol. Those were sessions

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,900
using 500 to 600 micrograms of
LSD, which, for any of you who

42
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,020
are not familiar with that kind
of calculation, that's a high

43
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,460
dose. And that protocol involves
at home or in a, you know, safe,

44
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,840
quiet space with headphones on
and a carefully curated

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,340
playlist, excuse me, eyeshades
to keep block out the light so

46
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,000
that inner visions are not
obstructed or mitigated, and a

47
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,860
qualified sitter. The person
that he had, in this case, is a

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,060
therapist, was a therapist, and
so knew what she was doing with

49
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,800
the situation and the following
day. So he generally did this on

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,300
a Saturday, and then the
following day, again, following

51
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,220
the Grof protocol, he spent
basically the whole day, as far

52
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,880
as I recall, with those
headphones on again to kind of

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,300
trigger memories of what was
playing on the music when he had

54
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,960
certain kinds of experiences and
visions, and then meticulously

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,560
transcribing all that. So Chris
is the author of several books,

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,860
including a book that I long
before I ever met him, from 20

57
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,860
years ago or so called dark
night, early dawn, which was

58
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,000
really a really impressive book.
I really liked it. Stand Out

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,900
book. I still have it in my
shelves back here the living

60
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,900
classroom, which I have not
read, and hope to because

61
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,660
there's a new edition coming
out, I believe, right. Chris,

62
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,440
Yep, yeah. And the incredible
LSD in the mind of the universe,

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,520
subtitled diamonds from heaven,
which many people have read now.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,880
So excuse me. I just want to add
a little bit more about how I

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,940
understand what happened in that
20 year journey. Mind you, this

66
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,800
would be like an all day
description. I. If it were to do

67
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,240
justice to what happened. But
the very, very short version is,

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,020
and again, please correct the
nuances of this if I didn't

69
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,420
quite remember it correctly,
Chris, in each one of those 73

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,860
journeys the first two hours
was, as you described it in the

71
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,600
book. I believe Chris at one
point, sometimes exquisitely

72
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,700
painful as you had to go through
the difficult process, which

73
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,620
most of us probably would never
want to go through, actually, of

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,940
ego dissolution and beyond, in a
sense, beyond ego, personal, ego

75
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,220
dissolution, but letting go of
any kind of identity, even as a

76
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,420
human as I recall. And then what
happened? And again, please

77
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,840
correct my language if I haven't
got it quite right, Chris. But

78
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,500
as I recall, and in my language,
you broke out into what you have

79
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,300
called in various ways, but one
way is the vast intelligences of

80
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,460
the universe. And believe me,
folks, I this is no

81
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,700
exaggeration. The kind of
material that Chris, you might

82
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,720
say, downloaded or brought back,
is absolutely stunning and

83
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,700
absolutely relevant to what's
going on on the planet. One of

84
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,900
the things that's most in my
mind, anyway important and

85
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,900
absolutely central about the
things that Chris downloaded, as

86
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:30,800
it were, is that, especially in
the in the, I believe, the

87
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,400
latter third or so of the 20
years, he started to get

88
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,820
increasingly clear, and I would
say, or interpret it as

89
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,580
confident messages that we are,
well, he had already heard, I

90
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,700
guess, that we've been we are
going through, as a species, a a

91
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,280
death and rebirth trajectory or
process that has been coming

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,140
toward us for perhaps hundreds
of 1000 years or whatever. And

93
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,780
excuse me, but the confidence
that I just mentioned implied

94
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,640
that in the later years, as I
recall Chris, these voices or

95
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,080
this intelligence started
indicating a greater likelihood

96
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,660
that we would indeed somehow get
through this and and that we

97
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,920
will come out into what you
might call a natural state of

98
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,940
being on this planet, you've
labeled it the birth of the

99
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,100
future human. So there are so
many questions we could ask you

100
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,060
about that, but let me ask you a
two part question to start with.

101
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,200
First of all, correct me on
anything that I didn't quite get

102
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,740
right. And secondly, I've been
thinking a lot about this, off

103
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,520
and on. It's central to, you
know, my life and where my mind

104
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,460
wants to go. And so one thing
that I'm wondering about is you

105
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,640
have, I think you first said you
thought this process might take

106
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,300
hundreds of years before
something you know, the light

107
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,520
might shine again, so to speak.
But I think it was in a either

108
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,060
an email or a phone conversation
in the last few months, you said

109
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,560
you might have had to correct
that to say 1000s of years, or

110
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,660
more than 1000 years. So I'm
trying to keep this simple and

111
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,840
turn it over to you, but the
context of that question that

112
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm going to put to you is that
one of the things that I and I

113
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,000
think Mark also is really tuned
into, and probably you is that

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,840
there's an incredible amount of
energy going on right now on the

115
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,560
planet to try to re correct that
dis spiritual disconnection. So,

116
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,980
you know, I guess the question
is, is it really going to be a

117
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,480
complete, you know, emptying and
dying off over the next decades?

118
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,900
Or might there be a cross fade
where things start to lighten

119
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,320
up, or, you know, the light
starts to shine in more to

120
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,540
counterbalance that dissolution,
so to speak, species dissolution

121
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,180
over the next decades. For
example, pardon me one more

122
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,940
little thing, because you know
this, you're the person who

123
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,060
turned Dwayne Elgin onto me for
my book how psychedelics can

124
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,440
help save the world. And he laid
out sort of a possible scenario

125
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,560
over the next six or seven
decades that might result in

126
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,940
what he called the birth of a
mature planetary civilization.

127
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,420
So how are you seeing all that
now, timelines and all that?

128
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,179
Chris Bache: Yeah, first Steven,
thank you, buddy for that very

129
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:36,259
nice and warm introduction. I
really appreciate our

130
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:39,979
friendship, and I appreciate the
what you what you're doing with

131
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,839
the conference, and mark you
too. This is a great conference.

132
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,919
It's my favorite psychedelic
conference to participate in,

133
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,719
and I always find it such a
rich, rich setting and audience

134
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:56,739
and soup to ask and answer, to
address these types of

135
00:09:56,739 --> 00:10:00,599
questions, so to focus
specifically in. Question you

136
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:06,419
ask, I would strengthen the
visionary component. It was

137
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:10,979
really less like messages
downloading as deep and profound

138
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:15,719
immersion into transtemporal
states of consciousness, going

139
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:19,319
into what I call deep time,
letting go, moving outside

140
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:25,039
linear time, and also these,
these visions started coming

141
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:32,479
into me when I was a good 1214,
years into my process. So a lot

142
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:36,499
of things that happened before
then, ego death, of entering

143
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:40,959
into this collective suffering,
of entering into what I think is

144
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:47,259
some dimension of the collective
unconscious of humanity, which

145
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,859
stores all of its pain and
suffering that humanity has

146
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,099
experienced, just as an
individual, stores their

147
00:10:54,099 --> 00:11:01,559
individual trauma, going through
that and going into archetypal

148
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:04,559
reality. And when I was in
archetype of reality beginning

149
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,659
this work, I began to be
download a series of visionary

150
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:14,279
encounters, which kept on
showing me the same basic story

151
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,119
that humanity was coming to a
pivot point in its evolutionary

152
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:22,759
journey, that this was that
we're like the karmic streams of

153
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,659
history were entering a canyon.
We were about to go through a

154
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:31,699
revolutionary pivot that would
be retro. We would see it in

155
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:37,159
time as a before and after,
transformational event, of an

156
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:41,559
event that was so powerful it
was going to literally trigger a

157
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:47,079
shift in the collective psyche
of humanity, so that all beings

158
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,399
born after this shift had taken
place would be operating out of

159
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,959
a different inner landscape, a
different collective psychic

160
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:01,259
landscape. And this was ra I
just was completely unprepared

161
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,339
for this, because I had begun
this work thinking that this was

162
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,179
about personal transformation,
and then thinking it was about

163
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,719
maybe personal awakening,
spiritual awakening. But then I

164
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:16,919
enter these profound collective
territories, and then I began to

165
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,039
have these visionary downloads
about where the where the

166
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,399
creative intelligence of the
universe, or where the divine

167
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,759
intelligence was taking
humanity, where all this was

168
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,259
going. And so there's these,
these deep experiences of

169
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:38,959
extraordinary spiritual
awakening taking place at a

170
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,119
collective level, extreme
transformation, a deep

171
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:47,919
intelligence working inside
nature, inside history,

172
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:53,439
underneath us all, bringing this
about. And then, but it didn't

173
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,979
show me how this was ever going
to take place. It didn't show me

174
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:02,579
the how of it. And then, in 1995
which look how long ago. This is

175
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:09,719
almost 30 years ago. I went
through a very deep experience

176
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:14,819
in which I was dissolved well
beyond egoic identity, dissolved

177
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:19,019
into the human species, became
one with the human family, and

178
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:23,839
in that condition, experienced a
the death and rebirth of

179
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,679
humanity, a profound unraveling,
a loss of control. It was a

180
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,039
global systems crisis that
seemed to be triggered by a

181
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:40,959
cascading series of eco crises.
It was, it was excruciating to

182
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,059
experience, and it kept building
in intensity. And I experienced

183
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,019
this not as a human being, not
as an individual human being,

184
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:55,839
but I experienced this as the
species. And then it seemed to

185
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,459
be getting deeper and deeper. We
were all forced into survival

186
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:07,319
mode, and just when it was at
its worst, the peak passed, and

187
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:12,719
the dangers began to recede, and
we began to pick ourselves up

188
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,399
and to put the pieces back
together. And when we did, we

189
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,099
were changed. We found that
something had been unleashed

190
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:25,159
enough, something had been
tapped into, something had been

191
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:30,019
broken open at the very deep
level of our being, so that when

192
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:35,659
we began to build after this
crisis, all of our work, all of

193
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:38,299
our being, all of our
relationships, were filled with

194
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:42,099
new insights, new values, new
understandings of the Human

195
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:46,179
Project, and there was a
creative contagion that where

196
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:49,239
the work of individuals and
collectives fed back into each

197
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:54,099
other, that was just spiraling
us into very quickly, in a into

198
00:14:54,099 --> 00:15:01,379
a new condition. I think now
that's. Basic outline, and

199
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:06,719
that's clear, but like Black Elk
in the visions that he received

200
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:10,799
as a young boy about the future
of his people, the my visions

201
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,799
did not come with dates and it
did not come with a lot of

202
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,839
detail. There were in a lot of
attention paid to the mechanisms

203
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,539
involved, but not to the
specific pattern of causation

204
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:27,619
other than this escalating
global eco crisis, also, it did

205
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:33,559
not come with dates, so I don't
really have a sense of, Well, of

206
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,159
from the visionary perspective,
when this will happen, how long

207
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,439
it will last. So in order to
fill in all that information, I

208
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:45,879
have to turn to the scientist in
terms of their calculations for

209
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,539
the depth and the speed with
which the Eco crisis is moving.

210
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,099
I turn to people like Dwayne
Elgin, who has been processing

211
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:59,139
all this information for
decades. And I've come to first.

212
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,299
I've been surprised that the
crisis is coming at us as fast

213
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,019
as it has. I thought we had more
time, but it's coming out as

214
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:11,639
fast. It's coming out as hard.
We're still in the early stages,

215
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,839
and I think Dwayne is right. The
next 50 years are going to be

216
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,739
absolutely pivotal in terms of
the intensity of the ecological

217
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:24,439
forces that will be bearing down
on us that will have to be

218
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:29,539
responding to. I don't think we
have 1000 years if we don't

219
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:34,099
address this. I don't think I
think of this as kind of and

220
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:38,119
again, I don't say this as a
Psychonaut or as a visionary. I

221
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:41,439
say this just as a person trying
to understand historical

222
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:45,039
information. I think this thing
may take three or four

223
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,159
generations, and if we don't
make the pivot within that time

224
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,779
frame, we may lose the planet. I
think the 21st Century is the

225
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:56,139
critical century that is going
to bring us to our knees and

226
00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:01,139
force us to make choices that
we're not willing to make now

227
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,759
for a variety of different
reasons. And then, and I think

228
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,439
this is going to be such a deep
pivot, it's going to be result

229
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,119
in a shift in what I might call
the plate tectonics of the

230
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,659
collective psyche, a shift at
the very, very core of our

231
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:22,999
being. And in other ways. I
think this represents a

232
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:26,959
culmination of a reincarnational
process which has been building

233
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,879
for 1000s, 10s of 1000s,
hundreds of 1000s of years. I

234
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:36,079
think we've been gestating the
next iteration of the human

235
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,739
condition for all this time.
We've been reincarnating

236
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:44,859
learning, learning, exploring,
growing, becoming more gestation

237
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:50,739
is long. Labor is short and
intense, life threatening. I

238
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:55,659
think we've been in gestation
for a long time, and we are

239
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:59,859
entering into labor, which is
it's going to be a volatile and

240
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:05,879
very dangerous period. And I
think we will give birth to this

241
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:09,839
new human, this future human,
many people have these are

242
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,839
having this vision. They call it
different things, Homo

243
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:18,119
spiritualis, homo noeticus. But
basically, there is this common

244
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:23,539
intuition that something new is
coming up underneath us. It's

245
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,119
coming into expression
underneath us, and it's being

246
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,379
driven by the same intelligence
that drove the creation of

247
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:34,159
galaxies, the creation of the
planet, the emergence of life on

248
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,859
the planet, the emergence of
conscious awareness on the

249
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:41,379
planet. This is being driven
from deep inside the process.

250
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:47,019
Now, I think that we classically
say there are no certain

251
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:51,759
outcomes. Everybody has to exert
full and complete exertion for

252
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,539
us to get through this like
labor. It's potentially life

253
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:59,559
threatening, and mothers dying
labor. Children die in labor all

254
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,799
the time. I understand that. I
really endorse that. And at the

255
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,639
same time,

256
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,979
the entire trajectory of my
psychedelic experience,

257
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:15,239
particularly those in the last
five years or so, took me so

258
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:21,619
deep into the future with such
realistic perception, and gave

259
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:27,079
me experiences of what this
future human will be like, and

260
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:32,539
those touches of the future of
humanity just bring me to my

261
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,379
knees. They're so
extraordinarily beautiful. It's,

262
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:41,679
it's our deepest dreams come
true, and I experienced this

263
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,679
pivot as something which was yet
to be accomplished, but also had

264
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,939
already been accomplished. So
that from deep time, I

265
00:19:51,939 --> 00:19:56,919
experienced this as an actuality
that had taken place, and yet,

266
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,843
from my linear time, it's an
actuality which is yet. Be take

267
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:08,043
place. And so in my heart, I
don't doubt that humanity will

268
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:11,883
make it through this transition.
My concern is how many of our

269
00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:14,943
children, how many of the
world's children will have to

270
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:18,723
die before we come to our
spiritual senses?

271
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:23,780
Stephen Gray: So that definitely
leaves it open for, as you say,

272
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,120
incredible exertion, which is
something that's really

273
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,000
important to people like Mark
and I very

274
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,160
Chris Bache: important. Oh,
yeah, you mentioned in that

275
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,980
context. One of the thing, one
of the things that this series,

276
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,940
visionary series, showed me, is
that as we enter deeper into

277
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,820
crisis, the whole foundation of
the psyche and our culture will

278
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,300
be shifting into what chaos
theoreticians would call

279
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,800
nonlinear systems. Would there
be so much energy, so much

280
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,540
engagement to high energy
engagement, that we would be

281
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:01,020
shifting out of a linear dynamic
of history into a nonlinear and

282
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,860
in nonlinear, we know something
about how nonlinear systems

283
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,680
behave, and some of the
characteristics, and one of the

284
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,720
important characteristics is in
a nonlinear condition, systems

285
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,980
are particularly susceptible to
small influences, small

286
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,160
perturbations, and that means,
as we go into this crisis, the

287
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,140
actions of individuals will have
proportionately greater impact

288
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,380
than they would have had at
earlier, more quiet periods of

289
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,900
history, so the individual
becomes a more dynamic player

290
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,860
moving forward than individuals
have been In the past.

291
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,580
Stephen Gray: That's an
incredibly important message for

292
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,580
people. Go ahead, Mark, I see
your mouth moving.

293
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,220
Marc Caron: Well, you did partly
answer what I was thinking a

294
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,660
little bit, Chris, because, you
know, there's so much you said

295
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,620
there and then my question is,
is, what can we do as

296
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,140
individuals, as groups, as
collective society. And you

297
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,200
know, it's hard enough to
organize important stuff in the

298
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,600
world for a lot of people. How
do you suggest that we move

299
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:23,180
forward from starting as Me to
We, to the many what, what do

300
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,040
you think is a good approach for
that?

301
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,159
Chris Bache: Yeah, you know, I
think they're probably people

302
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,739
who are better qualified and
more skilled at filling in that

303
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:36,859
particular place. Piece of, how
can we respond? I mean, I know

304
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:40,159
Dwayne Elgin is really good at
that. Other people are really

305
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,999
focused on, how can we move
forward, dynamically, creatively

306
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:53,799
in this process, and so I'd
rather not Barbara Marx Hubbard

307
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,559
was great. Remember on her wheel
and all the different

308
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,799
professions, I think it's going
to take all of us to get through

309
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,419
this. Take all the scientists,
all the educators, all the

310
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,599
politicians, all the artists.
It's going to take every one of

311
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,259
us and all the skills that we
bring to our various livelihoods

312
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,579
to move into this. What I would
offer is the metaphysical

313
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:18,359
perspective that comes from
reincarnation research and

314
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:22,699
without going into the data
supporting us, but the basic

315
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:28,579
vision is, when we incarnate, we
choose our incarnation. We

316
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:32,419
choose the time and place and
circumstances of our birth. And

317
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:36,319
therefore it's it's an axiom of
my thought that all the human

318
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,739
beings on the planet right now
knew what they were getting into

319
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,139
when they chose to incarnate in
this century under these very

320
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:48,579
demanding circumstances, and
they chose to incarnate with a

321
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:54,219
specific kind of karmic agenda,
with a specific sense of how to

322
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:59,739
contribute. So I think each one
of us needs. All we need to do

323
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:04,079
is look deeply, look under our
feet, to look at where we are,

324
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,979
who we are, how we are
positioned. And the question is

325
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:12,959
not really, I think, how do we
find the right thing to do? I

326
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:17,459
think the deeper question is,
will we have the courage? Where

327
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:22,159
do we find the courage to do
what we discover that we can do

328
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:26,599
absolutely. The essence of this
pivot is a pivot into oneness,

329
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,439
an awakening of oneness
underneath our feet, which will

330
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:35,059
completely change technology,
how we apply technology,

331
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:39,979
international conflict, social
relationships, organization of

332
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:44,859
society that fundamental
awakening in the human heart,

333
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,819
the healing of the human heart,
and awakening, awakening into a

334
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:53,679
true, deep, vivid, mystical
experience of the fundamental

335
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,539
oneness of all life. And that
means that's an inclusive

336
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:04,979
vision. And so. So as we move
toward that time in history and

337
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:08,519
back into ecological balance, of
course, a oneness that includes

338
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,719
all living species on the
planet, the more we become the

339
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:17,219
human being that is trying, that
the Earth needs right now, that

340
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:20,939
culture needs right now, the
more we accelerate the

341
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:24,439
transformation of this, this
transformational change in our

342
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:29,899
own role in it, we must become
the future being that Earth

343
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:34,519
needs, and as we do, we enter
into synergistic relationship

344
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,839
with other beings who are also
working to become what the

345
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,999
planet needs right now. Yeah,
beautiful, that's not very most

346
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,699
specifics. There are other
people who are better with

347
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:47,139
specifics,

348
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,260
Stephen Gray: right? Well, I I
agree with you, you know, I

349
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,460
mean, in the sense that we don't
know what people need to do. And

350
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,300
if I may dare, a bit of a
provisional answer about that,

351
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,160
I've got Mark interested in this
term that I got from Steve and

352
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,000
her at Buhner, which I believe
he translated from William

353
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,120
Blake, which is follow the
golden thread. And so, you know,

354
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,580
obviously, I mean, think we all
know as a it's almost a

355
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,140
platitude in some ways, that the
inner work is the foundation for

356
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,940
moving out into the outer work,
and that one would hope that if

357
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,220
the inner work is being done
properly effectively, then you

358
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,280
can follow the golden thread,
or, as they sometimes say, let

359
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,780
go and let God, and then it's
like, that's, I think, another

360
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,320
central component of this
revision that we're dealing with

361
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,860
is we're moving hopefully, we
need to move from sort of head

362
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,560
based calculation of how to move
through the world to heart

363
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,980
based, or intuitive based, you
know, through that. And then

364
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,320
I'll just add one more thing
before tossing it back to you,

365
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,400
if I may, Chris, one of our
other speakers, Mary Sanders,

366
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,960
just sent me the title of her
talk for the spirit plant

367
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,840
matters conference, conference
for this year, and it's

368
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,020
reimagining collective care as a
path to liberation. And seems to

369
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,020
me that's another central
component of it. You know, you

370
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,860
talk about us moving toward
oneness, so the recognition of

371
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,380
the power of connection and
shared vision and shared prayer.

372
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,860
You might even say, shared
manifestation seems to me

373
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,680
central to this movement
forward.

374
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,840
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think

375
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,840
Marc Caron: I just wanted to add
one more thing, if I could,

376
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,040
gentlemen, because Steven, you
said something about, you know,

377
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,980
you mentioned the head and you
mentioned the heart. And I think

378
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,940
we have so much wisdom and
knowledge, you know, education

379
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:53,920
type knowledge, that it's when
we lead that with our heart is

380
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,820
so much more powerful because,
you know, we can just repeat

381
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:03,540
what we hear, what we read and
what we learn, but it's a in my

382
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,020
experience, you know, in terms
of when I share, I know when I'm

383
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,020
in my head and I'm in my heart,
and the difference that it makes

384
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,140
in rapport and relating, and
same as when somebody's

385
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,960
presenting or you're working
with someone, you know the

386
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,540
difference between that and it
kind of reminds me of a quote

387
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,660
that I always loved hearing that
made a lot of sense was the

388
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,140
longest journey you'll ever take
is the one between your head and

389
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,620
your heart.

390
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,739
Chris Bache: Yeah, now I would
add the third piece, and that is

391
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:37,819
the body of the body's wisdom.
And of course, this is the

392
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:42,579
context within head and heart
meet. And of course, one of the

393
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:47,979
reasons we're in so much trouble
in terms of the planet is we're

394
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:52,659
just our theologies and
philosophies had tended to aim

395
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:56,919
us away from the body, away from
physical embodiment, away from

396
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:01,559
the Earth, and ignoring the
messages that we've been getting

397
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,779
from the earth. And so it the an
opening of the heart at that

398
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,559
level, an opening of the mind at
a level, and an opening of our

399
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,979
body to our body as a cell in
the body of the planet. So lots

400
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:20,959
of levels going on all at the
same time. Yeah, very

401
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:21,499
interesting,

402
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,820
Marc Caron: yeah. And to add to
that, if I may, because the

403
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,900
body, of course, is the
connector between spirit and and

404
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,100
the planet, with the importance
of of food and what we put in

405
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,920
our body. So you know, our
conference called Spirit plant

406
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,340
medicine, all plants have
spirit, whether it be broccoli,

407
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,260
cannabis, Iboga, mushrooms,
whatever it is. And the

408
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,660
importance, I think, for us to
get back to clean, nutritious

409
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,940
food that isn't contaminated in
the same way lets our body work

410
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,440
in a much better way. And when
we acknowledge this, plants the

411
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,940
spirit. Of the plants, whether
it be a psychedelic medicine or

412
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,500
something psychoactive, to
something that's just something

413
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,800
to nurture our body for
nutrition and health and

414
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,880
vitamins and all the things that
we need. In a good way, makes

415
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,480
that connection even more
powerful. And I feel that, you

416
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,980
know, in so many ways, when we
look at the mass population of,

417
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,100
you know, just say, North
America. You know, the quality

418
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,300
of our store bought food is, you
know, really beautiful we all

419
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,440
need to become aware of,

420
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,860
Stephen Gray: yeah. So no more
beer and pizza mark, no.

421
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,200
Marc Caron: Well, everything in
moderation. I have to believe

422
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,280
it's like, you know, every now
and again you have to have a zag

423
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,100
or not, but you understand what
I'm saying. It's just what you

424
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,760
put in is,

425
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:48,939
Stephen Gray: of course, no,
that's really important. When I

426
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,279
think, you know, Chris, you
might have things to say about

427
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,439
that, but I'd like to try
leading you in another

428
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:56,379
direction, if I may, just before
my no Mark's going to want to

429
00:30:56,379 --> 00:31:01,559
turn it to questions soon. You
know, you've spoken, obviously

430
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:07,919
about the birth of the future
human. And there's a, there's a

431
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,199
kind of humorous saying from the
famous baseball catcher and

432
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:16,919
pitcher from the Yankees, from
way back when Yogi Berra, who

433
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,739
was prone to these sort of
malapropisms that ended up kind

434
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:23,719
of making sense anyway, and one
of them was something like, If

435
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:26,059
you don't know where you're
going, you might end up

436
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:30,439
somewhere else. So it's a sort
of like a two part question.

437
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:33,079
It's like, and I don't even know
if you can answer this, I don't

438
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,599
want, I know you don't want to
step beyond the bands, bounds of

439
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:41,499
your knowledge. But what you
know, we've talked about this

440
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:45,999
before. How would you describe
what the awakened human looks

441
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:50,979
like, in terms of how they move
in the world and so on, and what

442
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:54,639
might be the kinds of signs of
awakening that people might look

443
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:57,039
for? And it's on this principle,
if you don't know where you're

444
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,599
going, kind of idea, right?
Like, I think it is helpful and

445
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,079
correct me anyone if I'm wrong,
but to have some kind of

446
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,759
signpost is, what is the natural
human being looking like? What

447
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,339
is the birth of the future
human, or with a future human

448
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:12,119
looking like?

449
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,740
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, I think
our spiritual traditions have

450
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,460
been giving us insights into
what's emerging, I think all of

451
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:31,640
the great saints and sages that
were responsible for

452
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,900
establishing or starting seeding
the religions of the Axial Age,

453
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,680
one of the things that drew us
to them, Drew humanity to them

454
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,380
is because we could feel a deep
resonance with them. And they

455
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,280
were kind of the prototypes,
archetypal prototypes of what we

456
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,060
were becoming, and they invited
us to become what they had

457
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,560
become. And in that way, I
think, in the Buddhas and the

458
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,780
prophets and the Christ and the
great saints of all the deepest

459
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,640
spiritual traditions, we can see
the prototypes of what's coming

460
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:15,120
so and the difference is, I
think that some people have

461
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,300
said, and I agree, that the age
of individual enlightenment is

462
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,500
over. Now it's collective
enlightenment or death. You

463
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,440
know, it's a collective game. So
the dynamic that's so unusual is

464
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,380
the entire that nature seems, at
least in my experience,

465
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,160
visionary experience, nature
seems intent on awakening the

466
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,580
entire species to really and the
entire species is going to go

467
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,480
through what individual mystics
have gone through in their

468
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,840
individual awakening. The
individual mystic goes through

469
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,740
the dark night of the soul, a
period of intense purification,

470
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,200
offloading past karma, past
negativity or behavior, en route

471
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,660
to entering into a clear state
of awareness, which we would

472
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,840
call spiritual awakening, or
enlightenment, or something

473
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,280
along those lines. I think
humanity as a whole was going is

474
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,800
going through, or will be going
through, is beginning to go

475
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,480
through a collective dark night
of the soul, a period of

476
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,240
profound purification of
confronting what we might think

477
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,540
of as the sins of our fathers,
which are our sins, because we

478
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,620
are our own fathers in this way,
but going through a tremendous

479
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:36,560
kind of purification process in
order to clear out our basement,

480
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,920
so to speak, in order To make us
more receptive to increasing

481
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,420
energies entering us at this
from the spiritual dimension at

482
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,200
this time in history. Now,
another way of putting this, and

483
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,720
it ran through my sessions, is,
I think the future human. I

484
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,500
think we're coming to a pivot
point in our reincarnational

485
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,960
story. Story. We've been
reincarnating. We die. We expand

486
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,400
to soul. We incarnate. We
contract into ego. We expand to

487
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,640
soul. We contract into ego. And
we just keep this up for 1000s

488
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,660
and 1000s and 1000s of years.
And we're learning and we're

489
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,380
growing. And sometimes we step
back, and mostly we step

490
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,360
forward, but we keep on learning
and growing. And enlightenment

491
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,020
is the Eastern traditions have
tended to see enlightenment,

492
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,980
this culminating in
enlightenment. But if we really

493
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,660
look at what that means and and
often they think, they've tended

494
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,040
to place it in a context, you
become enlightened, and then you

495
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,180
can leave you leave time and
space. You leave Samsara, who

496
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,900
wants to be in time and space
when you can be in the bliss of

497
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,000
eternity. But I think that's a
short sighted understanding of

498
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,120
what's taking place. Now that we
have a better understanding of

499
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,640
how big the universe is, how old
it is, and how complex it is, it

500
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,000
doesn't really make much sense
to think that after all these

501
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,600
hundreds of 1000s of years of
evolving humanity the point of

502
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,980
individuated consciousness, and
about just 5000 years ago,

503
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,940
humanity begins to sink down at
that depth layer where they

504
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,040
begin to tap into that dimension
of their own mind, which is one

505
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,480
with the mind of all living
things, just at that point, 5000

506
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,140
years after we've developed
writing, then when we achieve

507
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,200
spiritual awakening, then we
leave, we just leave it all

508
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,260
behind. I don't think that's
what's happening. I think now

509
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,380
we're beginning to have a deeper
understanding, and that is,

510
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,460
we've been reincarnating,
reincarnating, reincarnating.

511
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,480
And I think we are at a time
when all of our former lives are

512
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,480
beginning to come together.
They're they're beginning to

513
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,500
come to us. And as they come
together, they bring forward, of

514
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,860
course, all their unfinished
business, which becomes our

515
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,080
unfinished business. And this is
happening collectively. And when

516
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,100
this process reaches critical
stage, at least, this is how it

517
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,420
unfolded in my session. So I
just, I asked the listeners

518
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,500
indulgence. There was a time
when all my former lives started

519
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,400
coming into me fast and furious,
and they were fusing. And I've

520
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,020
done a lot of past life therapy
work, so I'm familiar with a lot

521
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,680
of them, but they were just
coming in, coming in, and then

522
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,120
they seemed to fuse. They hit a
critical mass. And when they hit

523
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,320
a critical mass, there was an
explosion of diamond light out

524
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,060
of my chest, and it catapulted
me into a state of consciousness

525
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,640
where I was an individual, but
an individual beyond any frame

526
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,620
of reference that I had ever
imagined before. And I think

527
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,780
what I was being shown or taken
into was what happens to an

528
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,100
individual when they reach this
turning point in their

529
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,680
evolutionary journey where all
of our former lives come

530
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,940
together and fuse, and a new
identity is born. And this

531
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,600
identity, I think, is the
identity of the soul. But it's

532
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,100
not the soul that we encounter
after we die. It is that, but

533
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,180
it's the soul in a human
incarnation, in the earth, in

534
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,680
the body. And this is what I
call the birth of the diamond

535
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,800
soul. That is, I think, the
future human will be a human

536
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,020
being, where the operating
identity will not be any

537
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,280
individual, private identity,
not 100 year old identity, but

538
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,980
it'll be 100,000 year old
identity. We will have a sense

539
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,360
of ourselves, a living,
conscious memory of ourselves as

540
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,860
a being that's been living in
and out of time for 1000s and

541
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:58,600
1000s of years, and a s any
being who is just larger has a

542
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,980
deeper sense of themselves, a
deeper sense of relationships

543
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,580
with other human beings, because
if they remember their former

544
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,480
lives, they remember their
relationships that they're they

545
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,900
were all involved in. And as we
have been male female, we've

546
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,980
been every race imaginable,
every religion imaginable, and

547
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,320
all of these differences are
coming together and fusing to

548
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,600
produce an individuality that
holds all of that as an

549
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:36,200
integrated, harmonious
singularity, okay, that I think

550
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,180
is, is the best take I have on
the future human. And I can tell

551
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:46,000
you that when I was taken toward
the end of my journeys into the

552
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:52,900
deep time and was given the
grace of experiencing this new

553
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:59,140
archetype, this future human, it
just it moved me to tears. Was

554
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:04,380
so beautiful. So I mean, picture
a humanity completely healed of

555
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,560
all the wounds of history,
completely healed of all the

556
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,400
divisions that we've etched in
history, a humanity with an

557
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,760
open, expansive, compassionate
heart like the best of the

558
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,420
saints through history, humanity
with their consciousness open

559
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,220
into deep communion with the
creative intelligence of the

560
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:31,580
universe, with fewer interfering
Bardo echoes, shadows in the in

561
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:37,520
the way, and a human being who
is deeply committed to being in

562
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,520
the body, not trying To get out
of time and space, but living

563
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:48,040
increasingly strong, focused,
intentional life, an integration

564
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:54,400
of spirit and matter inside
their physical existence. That's

565
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,580
kind of the bit. That's what has
been coming into me. That's what

566
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,480
I have to offer.

567
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,840
Stephen Gray: That was
absolutely beautiful. Chris, you

568
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,800
know, I think I'm going to play
this back to myself with

569
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,800
headphones on, just before
bedtime for a beautiful bedtime

570
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,060
story, and before a beautiful

571
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,200
Chris Bache: story, we really
are. It is ordinary, hard times

572
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,260
ahead, but deep beauty.

573
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,700
Stephen Gray: We need that kind
of encouragement. Chris, this is

574
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,960
such a gift that you offer to
people. You know, it puts me in

575
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,640
mind of something Bishop Desmond
Tutu once said, that is the

576
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,920
problem with most people, is
they don't believe in the

577
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,180
possibility of possibility. We
need people to take heart. We

578
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,280
need people to believe that what
they do, as you say, matters

579
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,820
more than ever, right? Yeah.
Anyway, I'm guessing, Mark you'd

580
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,440
like to open it up to some
questions,

581
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,780
Marc Caron: yeah, and just a
second. I just wanted to add to

582
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,440
that, because I believe that,
you know, as human beings, we

583
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,860
can do so much more than that.
We think we can do. We have such

584
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,660
an ability to push through, to
persevere, to, you know, I don't

585
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,640
mean work hard, as in, you know,
crazy, but we can do more than

586
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,760
we think we can do, and it's by
pushing that limit, by pushing

587
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,180
ourselves. Is, you know, how we
build the muscles? You don't go

588
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,980
to the gym. Build Muscle, you
know, light and few reps, you've

589
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,400
got to push through the pain,
and, you know, the challenging,

590
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,360
the things that are making it
build. And I think it's

591
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,840
something that you know, in some
cases, and I can speak for

592
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,660
myself personally, that we
sometimes you get a little soft,

593
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,600
you know, and to remember that
we have the ability to be able

594
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:46,120
to have that strength to push
through. So before we go to two

595
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,580
questions, I have one question
that some people may be

596
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,740
thinking, I don't know if
anybody will ask, and I know

597
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:57,700
I've asked this question of you
before, Chris, but you've done

598
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:03,780
such an amazing work on 72 high
dose journeys, and as a

599
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,920
professor of religious studies,
most people would think that's

600
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,100
not what a professor of
religious studies would be

601
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,620
doing, because you know the
stigma of what LSD might be seen

602
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:23,060
as, what Made you what inspired
you to choose that direction or

603
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:29,000
that path for this deep dive
philosophical work. And what

604
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,060
would you say to anybody who,
after hearing what you've done

605
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,880
and experienced, is there
anything that you would say to

606
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,380
them in terms of, you know, some
sage advice,

607
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,879
Chris Bache: starting at Vienna,
my advice is, please don't do

608
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:47,499
it. Don't do it the way I did
it. I was young and foolish. I

609
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:51,219
know I understand much more now
than I did then. I would advise

610
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:56,199
a different protocol. But how I
got into this is a simple story.

611
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:59,859
I came out of graduate school
kind of an atheistically

612
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:03,119
inclined agnostic in philosophy
of religion, but I've had a

613
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,459
long, lifelong, passionate
desire to ask the big questions

614
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:10,979
and to seek the big answers. I
mean, I really wanted to

615
00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:15,119
understand how life works,
what's going on, what's Why is

616
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:18,419
life filled with so much
suffering? What's is there an

617
00:44:18,419 --> 00:44:23,419
intelligence inside the universe
expressing itself? I really

618
00:44:23,419 --> 00:44:27,019
wanted to answer those questions
if I could. And right after I

619
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:30,739
finished graduate school, I met
the work of Stan Grof and his

620
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:34,819
work, realms of the human
unconscious changed my life, and

621
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:39,379
very quickly, was followed in
1980 BY HIS Manual LSD

622
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:44,619
psychotherapy. And I just, I
knew I wanted, I wanted to do

623
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:47,859
this work. I needed to do this
work. I don't like breaking the

624
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:52,419
law, but I would. I went
underground, basically in part

625
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:56,379
of the transitional underground
generation that did this work,

626
00:44:56,499 --> 00:45:00,779
and I started doing the high
dose work. First. Us a matter of

627
00:45:00,779 --> 00:45:04,379
efficiency. That is, I was still
thinking it was a personal

628
00:45:04,379 --> 00:45:09,599
model, and I knew the sessions
would be more intense, but it

629
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,279
would turn up more of my psyche,
and I would, if I could manage

630
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:18,419
the intensity, I would clean up
my shit faster, and I'd get to

631
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:23,539
enlightenment faster. Turns out
all my assumptions were wrong.

632
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:26,539
Is not about personal and and
when you work with high high

633
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:30,619
doses, you activate a larger
piece of the fabric of

634
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:34,459
existence, and your what may
begin is your individual

635
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:38,959
transformational process becomes
part and parcel of humanity's

636
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:44,859
larger collective
transformational process. But

637
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,539
then when, when I began to
understand some of this, three

638
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:53,379
or four years into the process,
I found that I had developed a

639
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:58,179
taste for working with high
doses. I was able my

640
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:03,839
constitution was wired such that
I seemed to have the ability to

641
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,219
get very large and spacious, and
very importantly, I had the

642
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:13,259
ability to contract safely at
the end. And this is, you know,

643
00:46:13,259 --> 00:46:16,019
not everybody, you know, a lot
of people shouldn't work with

644
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:19,139
psychedelics at all, and a lot
of people should not work with

645
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:22,939
high doses of a powerful
psychedelic like LSD. So this

646
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:26,239
is, you know, and I would do it
differently, even if you have a

647
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,719
natural aptitude, even if you
have the capacity, even if you

648
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:33,679
have the strong social setting
that supports you. In this work,

649
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:38,359
I would be much gentler. I would
be a Gen take a gentler way in

650
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:42,399
I'd work with more lower doses.
I would balance the occasional

651
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:47,979
high dose with integrating lower
doses. I'd work with not only

652
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:52,179
LSD, but I'd balance it with
working with Psilocybin or

653
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:57,939
Ayahuasca, the vegetative
psychedelics. So there's just a

654
00:46:57,939 --> 00:47:00,299
lot of things I would do
differently, yeah,

655
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,420
Stephen Gray: but, but, you
know, you can't answer this

656
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,480
question, of course, because
it's the road not taken. But you

657
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,680
know, just speculatively, would
you have been able to bring back

658
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,760
such deep and powerful
information had you not put

659
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,440
yourself through this fire?

660
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:20,959
Unknown: It? I It,

661
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,980
Chris Bache: it, I found that it
takes a lot of work and a lot of

662
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:33,140
discipline in order. When you go
very deep in the universe, and

663
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,700
you transcend so many levels of
time and space and identity and

664
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,260
species identity and into
archetypal and beyond archetype

665
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,580
reality, you're breaking into so
many layers of new territory

666
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,040
that it's very hard to stay
conscious at those levels, and

667
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,820
often people only bring back
pieces. But if you work

668
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,180
consistently and with
discipline, you can learn how to

669
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,620
stay conscious at those levels,
and you can bring back more and

670
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,620
more, but it's a discipline.
It's really, for me, it's a

671
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,520
philosophical discipline to
really, not only engage and

672
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,440
break into new territory, but to
bring the experiences back and

673
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,880
get them down in writing or art
or music, different people in

674
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,400
different modalities, but to
bring them inside one's being to

675
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:30,680
learn to live by the insights
that they give you. So I may not

676
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:37,460
have gone out as far as I ended
up going out, but I also learned

677
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,460
that going out is not everything
that I thought it was going to

678
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,840
be in the early stages. I
thought that the farther out you

679
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,640
went, the more profound the
impact would have and allow you

680
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,700
to hold and change your life,
and you'd become an enlightened

681
00:48:54,700 --> 00:49:01,020
being and and so depth was
related to, if you if you did it

682
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,220
right, was related to
stabilizing the impact of these

683
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,640
deep immersions. What I learned
is that it's a much more

684
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,660
complicated process than I had
initially thought. The process

685
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,620
of retaining and holding on to
those experiences is much bigger

686
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,220
than simply remembering them. To
integrate a journey is different

687
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:26,420
than integrating individual
sessions, and I found that the

688
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:32,540
task of integrating such a
radical journey, it will take me

689
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:38,120
lifetimes. I think, integrate
where I went, and I don't think

690
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,880
I could ever integrate them in
that sense of being able to hold

691
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,460
them, enter them, live from
them. During my current

692
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:53,500
lifetime, this just the universe
is too big, and it took me in

693
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:59,020
too deeply to sort of hold it
well.

694
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,740
Stephen Gray: I thank you.
Deeply. The for having done that

695
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,040
work for us anyway. I know you
wouldn't start out to do it for

696
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,260
quote, us, but it turned out
that way.

697
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,060
Chris Bache: Turned out that
way. Yeah,

698
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:16,440
Marc Caron: I like the comment
on efficiency. So we have

699
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,900
comment here in the chat.
Melanie White says, Thank you,

700
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,040
Chris. She loved the book LSD in
the mind of the universe. And

701
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,160
thank you for sharing your
insights with us tonight. And I

702
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,640
think that'd be a great segue
for those of you watching

703
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,760
online, maybe just the live
streams, after the factor even

704
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,720
live right now, we have a studio
audience here in our zoom where

705
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,500
we're going to take some
questions. We do have a question

706
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:46,720
here from Jacob. Michael, if you
can bring Jacob in, we'll unmute

707
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,860
him and we'll hear what he has
to ask. Welcome to the program,

708
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:55,660
Jacob. Thanks for for joining us
and asking a question.

709
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,040
Unknown: Yeah, thank you. It's
going to be my first spirit

710
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,180
plant medicine conference this
year. So very exciting to kind

711
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:09,240
of join you beforehand. I was
deeply struck by the book

712
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:14,460
Christopher and it articulated a
process that I seem to find

713
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:20,180
myself in some of the early
stages of not to presuppose that

714
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,600
it would go in the same
direction, but certainly I'd

715
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,420
never encountered anybody who
had been dropping into those

716
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:34,640
collective levels. And yeah,
much, much more to say about the

717
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,120
richness of the work. But the
question I wanted to put to you

718
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:44,896
is really whether you'd really
encountered like, how does this

719
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:50,596
process and journey for you
relate to Christology, or did

720
00:51:50,596 --> 00:51:55,876
you have kind of Christ avatar
experiences, and how does that

721
00:51:55,876 --> 00:51:59,716
kind of map On to the process
for you?

722
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:05,700
Chris Bache: Yeah, interesting
question, Jacob, there have been

723
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,780
two religious traditions, or
spiritual traditions, that have

724
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,080
had the largest influence on my
life. The first was

725
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:17,160
Christianity, and the second is
Buddhism. And I also taught

726
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,900
world religions for decades, and
so I spent semester after

727
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,320
semester, going around the
planet, in my mind, with my

728
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,400
students doing a huge, you know,
Huston Smith kind of journey in

729
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,760
and out of the world religions.
And I, they just all became,

730
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,960
they became passionate lovers
for me. And each one of them

731
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,440
taught me so much. And while I
started, in a sense, within the

732
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,200
Christian framework, I also
began to understand over time

733
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:53,320
that Christ is the fruition of a
spiritual impulse in the Middle

734
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,120
East that parallels in certain
seminal ways, the fruition of

735
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,820
the Spiritual impulse in India,
the fruition in Africa, the

736
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:08,700
fruition in South America, that
I began to see larger patterns.

737
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:16,020
So for me, if Christology is the
study of the Christ archetype,

738
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:22,820
for me, that archetype is bigger
than Jesus, but it kind of, it's

739
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:28,700
a larger dynamic of profound
awakening of the human heart,

740
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:36,320
profound awakening of the of the
mind, of the Spirit. So I just,

741
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,320
kind of, I live and breathe in
in kind of the Universalist

742
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,420
waters, which, on the one hand,
recognizes the distinctness of

743
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,280
each of the lineages, but also
recognize the or the overlapping

744
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:54,820
common ground. Now, I, you know,
I didn't have a lot of

745
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:02,580
experiences of Avatar kind of
beings or angelic beings, or

746
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:10,320
even spirit guys. I didn't have,
you know, the machine elves

747
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:15,900
encounter that people do at the
DMT and I didn't have a lot of

748
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:21,440
experience of individuated
beings in my journey. And I know

749
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,560
that a lot of people do, and so
I don't question that there the

750
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,640
universe is filled with beings
that we often counter in

751
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,860
psychedelic sessions. My sense
is that the nature of the work I

752
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:40,420
did. My sense is that maybe this
is a hypothesis. You have to be

753
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,980
a being, to experience beings,
you have to be a self to

754
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:49,060
experience cells in the
universe. And if your work

755
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,800
grinds you fine, just grinds you
repeatedly into dust. Then when

756
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,760
that dust goes out into the
universe, it sort of takes you

757
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,756
into the fabric of life. Rather
than putting you into individual

758
00:55:02,756 --> 00:55:08,336
dialog with individual pieces of
life, even deeply spiritual,

759
00:55:08,516 --> 00:55:14,036
large pieces of life, so I was
drawn into archetypal dynamics,

760
00:55:14,096 --> 00:55:19,136
archetypal dimensions I was
drawn into, and I always was in.

761
00:55:19,436 --> 00:55:23,120
There was a consciousness
guiding my sessions. I always

762
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:30,920
felt in the hands of some
massive consciousness. But this

763
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,520
consciousness never appeared to
me in any kind of concrete,

764
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:40,040
physical, this type of form. I
felt it as a presence. It guided

765
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,380
me deeper and deeper and deeper.
It was open ended and infinite,

766
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:51,640
but didn't distill itself into
particular forms. So was that.

767
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,840
You see how that kind of gets
complicated around Christology,

768
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,740
on the one hand, it affirms the
deep essence of it. On the other

769
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,860
hand, it it doesn't get
concretized into our

770
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,440
historically specific
expressions.

771
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,460
Stephen Gray: Yeah, was there a
visual component to these

772
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,120
journeys?

773
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,420
Chris Bache: Very strong visual
components, not hallucinatory. I

774
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,720
mean, I could pull off my eye
shades in the middle of the

775
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,900
journey, and I was not
hallucinating, but very, very

776
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:31,880
deep visual components, yes, but
I never saw the intelligence

777
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,840
that I was experiencing so
intimately. I mean, this

778
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,360
intelligence would draw me into
it would purify me and beat me

779
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,460
up and crush me and destroy me
again and again. And then, when

780
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,280
I'd gone through the
purification process, it would

781
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,420
receive me and take me and
educate me and take me through

782
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,420
things over and over again until
it was sure that I understood

783
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,660
what it wanted me to know. And
then it would take me on deeper

784
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:05,820
but it never adopted a form that
I could identify as such? Wow,

785
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,100
Unknown: could I do a brief,
brief follow up question?

786
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,340
Marc Caron: Sure nobody else has
their hands up, so go for it

787
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,780
cool.

788
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,780
Unknown: Your work also
resonated a lot for me with that

789
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,660
of Pierre Tolle, hard de
Chardin, and I wondered if

790
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:28,100
you're like to what, how did,
how do you feel his work kind of

791
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:34,040
mapping with your sense of this
kind of as an EPO birth period?

792
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,320
Yeah, I just assuming you're
familiar with his realms.

793
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,880
Chris Bache: And isn't it
striking, the overlap, I mean,

794
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,440
really the profound insights
that he had to humanity coming

795
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,240
to a turning point and the news
sphere. And, you know, he was

796
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,740
trained as a geologist, and so
he had this large historical

797
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:01,800
landscape, and with his deep
natural spirituality and his

798
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,780
deep Christian faith, he saw so
much, and I think there is an

799
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:12,360
overlap. And I had read, you
know, Chardin in graduate

800
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:16,800
school, and I had read many
spiritual teachers and many, but

801
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,200
I don't think they, I mean, just
to sort of anticipate a question

802
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,840
that some readers might have, I
don't think it shaped my

803
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,800
experience of what actually
happened in the sessions. It

804
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,580
helped me understand and
interpret what happened in the

805
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,600
sessions. But the Sessions had
their own generative power,

806
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,980
which seemed to be drawing from
a different kind of source, but

807
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:45,640
that sardin saw as much as he
sell all on his own in his non

808
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,740
amplified capacity. Just
awesome. Just awesome.

809
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,520
Marc Caron: Yeah. Well, thank
you so much for the question

810
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,200
Jacob. And if anybody else has
any questions for Chris, now is

811
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,160
the time if you want to raise
your digital can turn your

812
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:09,720
camera on, we'd be happy to take
your question. Looks like we're

813
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,000
good, or you can raise your
physical hand, oh, there we go.

814
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,680
Jackie, are you good? There we
go. We'll ask you to unmute

815
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,280
here.

816
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,560
Unknown: Awesome. Hi, Chris, Hi,
Jackie,

817
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,560
so this is maybe, like you had
said, in terms of, like, the

818
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:31,460
movement of the planet and all
the urgency and what direction

819
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,540
we move into that there are
people better suited, maybe, to

820
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,500
fill in the details, but I'm
thinking about like, what are

821
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,180
the things that might be
happening now in terms of

822
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:47,560
accelerating shifts in
consciousness, like, are there

823
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,920
things is, are psychedelics part
of that, you know, Stevens book,

824
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,080
can psychedelics help change the
world? How do we stabilize those

825
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,300
things? And I'm, I'm thinking
about, like, I know. There are

826
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,200
groups of meditators, deep
meditators, for example, who are

827
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:10,200
working with low dose five Meo
as a kind of ally for achieving

828
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:16,200
nature of mind meditation, or a
kind of idea that somehow these

829
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,160
excursions can help us
restructure so that we can

830
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,320
contain more or have more
capacity for these shifts in

831
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:29,060
consciousness. So I'm just
curious your thoughts on that

832
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,580
like, not that I know, of
course, you can't advocate that

833
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,880
everybody go do psychedelics,
but just what your thoughts are

834
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,640
like if you had a workshop, what
would you train people to do?

835
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,280
Chris Bache: Well, first I just
want to a big yes to everything

836
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:48,340
you're saying. I think we're all
hardwired into the collective

837
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,960
psyche. I mean, it's we are
truly embedded our individual

838
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,820
life is a cell within the life
of our species, physically at a

839
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:01,680
physical, biological level, and
also at a mental level,

840
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,300
spiritual level. So everything
we do registers in the

841
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:10,260
collective psyche, and the
collective psyche shapes

842
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,880
everything that we do. I mean,
it creates the structures and

843
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,880
the territory. So an extreme
example is, I think when I die,

844
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,100
I take my psychedelic
experiences with me, but I also

845
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:30,020
think that the species mind will
keeps it too, because I was a

846
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,560
human being when I had these
experiences, so they become part

847
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,160
of the human family of
experience, and therefore they

848
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,440
continue to even if I never
reincarnated again, these

849
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,560
experiences would be alive
within the human family, and

850
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,040
this is true for all of us.
Everything we're doing continues

851
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,920
to live. So the harm that we
bring into life registers in the

852
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,880
human family, the healing that
we bring into life, the insights

853
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,200
that we bring, the care and
compassion that we bring, all

854
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,760
kind of infuse the network of
life that is the human family

855
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,980
and beyond the human family. So,
yeah, I think that when we work

856
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,360
as the spiritual traditions tell
us there is no such thing as

857
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:20,280
private spiritual practice. So
you know, the first thing you do

858
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,260
in Buddhist tradition, when you
do a practice is you cultivate

859
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:28,340
bodhichitta, or the desire to
save or to in to help all

860
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,520
sentient beings. The last thing
you do at the end of the

861
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,240
practice is you distribute the
merit to all levels of being,

862
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,500
all six levels of the Bardo, to
all levels. So you're constantly

863
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,680
the trap that we can get caught
in is to think that it's all

864
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,740
about some personal
enlightenment or personal

865
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:51,160
exercise, and the spiritual
traditions are telling us just

866
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,960
the opposite. It's not about You
dummy, it's all of us. It's all

867
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,980
of us. So open your heart, open
your mind, let the pain in,

868
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:05,220
bring the healing out, and when
we do that, I think we can just

869
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:10,320
trust that everything we're
doing is being conserved and

870
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:14,640
used by the other beings who are
alive at this point in time. In

871
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,700
fact, that's one of the things
I'm going to be talking about at

872
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,580
the conference, because in my
life, I was an academic. I had

873
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:26,360
to keep all this work completely
hidden. I never let my students

874
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,720
knew know what I was doing. I
was always, you know, that was a

875
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:34,520
private part of my life, but I
found that my students began to

876
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:40,120
be activated by my psychedelic
work, and they there was a

877
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,720
certain transparency opening
between their mind and my mind,

878
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,640
and I began to understand it was
as if my students were showing

879
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,340
me that what I had experienced
about the nature of

880
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:54,820
consciousness, that ultimately
it's all one integrated

881
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:58,360
consciousness. It was as if what
was happening in my classroom

882
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,920
was demonstrating that this is
true, and eventually it forced

883
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,960
me to learn an entirely new way
of teaching that was respectful

884
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,680
of these quantum fields that
were emerging in our work

885
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,160
together. So there is no such
thing as private practice. There

886
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,500
is no such thing, you know,
we're all in this together.

887
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:21,080
We're arm in arm. Everything we
do serves everyone in the

888
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:21,680
process.

889
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:22,519
Unknown: Beautiful. Thank you.

890
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:26,599
Marc Caron: Thank you. Thank you
for that question. Jackie was

891
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:29,179
coming in from Philadelphia.
It's really great to see people

892
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:32,239
coming in from different parts
of the world. We have another

893
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:37,039
one person joining us from
Salisbury, UK, different parts

894
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:42,759
of Well, here's Albuquerque, New
Mexico. Albuquerque. Technology,

895
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:47,439
all right. Michael K, Michael K,
has a question. I'll unmute you

896
01:04:47,439 --> 01:04:53,979
here. Michael, there we go. Oh,
you're muted. You're not at your

897
01:04:54,459 --> 01:04:58,059
you'll have to, there you go.
You'll have to put the request.

898
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:02,040
Unknown: There you are. Hello,
everyone. You. Hello. Yeah, I'm

899
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:08,220
calling from Lake, Lake Geneva,
Wisconsin, and Chris, I wanted

900
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:13,080
to focus on your experience in
the collective of the human

901
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:20,180
species and relating that to
individual efforts today. And

902
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,840
you mentioned that you carry
hope for the future. You were

903
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,500
that we will come through this
birthing process. But could you

904
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,920
expand a little bit more on the
relationship between the

905
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:36,140
individual and collective and de
with what you just said? And the

906
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,320
final comments on the last
question, do you think that the

907
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,900
right inspiration from the right
individual will spread much

908
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,140
faster in the future into the
collective consciousness, with

909
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:51,160
acceptance, far faster than it
has been in the past.

910
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:55,540
Chris Bache: Yeah, where if we,
if we just look at what's going

911
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:58,180
on around us right now, you
know, America's in a

912
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,980
presidential election, and we
see a deeply divided country,

913
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:06,480
and we couldn't have candidates
more polar opposites than the

914
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:13,140
candidates we have in such deep
polarization of political of the

915
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:17,220
political spectrum, and we see
this in so many different areas

916
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,560
of discourse. So it is
extraordinary, very turbulent,

917
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:30,620
choppy, uncertain times, and I
it's not just the truth that

918
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,940
catalyzes connections with
greater truth, but also lying

919
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:39,800
catalyzes lying, you know, and
darkness catalyzes darkness. So

920
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,540
the collective this dynamic
between the individual and the

921
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:49,960
collective is not simply a sunny
side of the street dynamic. It

922
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,560
also applies to the darker side
of the street, and we see this

923
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:57,640
in in shamanic cultures, where
they are dealing not just with

924
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,320
healing, but they're also
dealing with dark forces and

925
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:06,720
managing them or controlling
them. I think, however, that

926
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:14,040
Carl Jung is right that nature
tilts towards growth. I think it

927
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:20,220
tilts towards us becoming more
than we are, larger than we are,

928
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:25,100
wiser than we are more
intelligent than we are. Nature

929
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:31,040
tilts towards growth. And I
think that if nature is trying

930
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,940
to bring about this pivot
towards this higher form of

931
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:39,020
consciousness, emerging even
though we are experiencing

932
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:43,000
tremendous upheaval from the at
the collective level,

933
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:50,560
politically, socially,
culturally, I think the deeper

934
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:57,100
movement is towards higher,
better, truer, clearer, better,

935
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:04,140
good, More good. And so I think
that if nature favors growth,

936
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:09,000
that individuals who have made
the transition in their own

937
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,560
being, that humanity is trying
to make collectively, I think of

938
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:17,760
those individuals as becoming
kind of seed catalyst. Their

939
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:23,000
very presence helps catalyze
what's trying to emerge out

940
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,180
underneath our feet at a
collective level. So I do think

941
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:31,700
that individuals have tremendous
power to influence, not just

942
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:36,740
physically, not just by physical
contact, but all the spiritual

943
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,440
traditions have recognized that
there is a subtler form of

944
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,380
influence that radiates around
people when they do deep

945
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:48,160
spiritual practice. That's why
the Chinese traditions always

946
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,780
valued having a contemplative
practicing in their community

947
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:57,820
outside of town. The Christian
monasteries and nunneries have

948
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:01,140
always understood that their
work, their spiritual practice

949
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:05,940
had a beneficent influence on
the surrounding communities, so

950
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,940
I think that's going to be
increasing as we move forward.

951
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:10,680
Beautiful.

952
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:18,000
Marc Caron: Great question.
Thank you for that, Michael. And

953
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,740
I think unless anybody else
raises her hand in the next you

954
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:25,580
know, half a second or so,
we'll, we'll start wrapping up

955
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:30,800
our program. And Chris, I first
I want to just thank you for you

956
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,840
know, the work that you do, and
let you know how much I

957
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,360
appreciate you. I've got to know
you over the past number of

958
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,800
years, as you've been a great
supporter of their spirit, plant

959
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:47,620
medicine, conference and your
graciousness, your wisdom, your

960
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:50,500
energy, and that of your
beautiful wife, Christina, as

961
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:55,480
well. You know it's just it's so
beautiful to be in your presence

962
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:59,500
and to hear your words and bring
take that in. So I just want to

963
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,940
let you. How grateful I am for
you and the work that you do,

964
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,400
and I'm going to have to pay you
later when you get up here,

965
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,860
Chris, you know, at the
beginning, you said it's one of

966
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:12,540
the best psychedelic conferences
ever. So thank you for that.

967
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,980
Which leads into a segment that
I just wanted to share with

968
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,200
people that you know, if you're
here in the Zoom Room and you're

969
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,620
watching, and you're thinking
about coming to the conference,

970
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,620
or you're not sure, or you're
watching online, one of the

971
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:28,640
things that we do is bring in
this virtual aspect, so that we

972
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:34,400
can be live in person, maybe not
in person, but we have a virtual

973
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,160
community where you can connect
with each other, you can have

974
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:41,260
questions and answers with the
speakers in the room as well. We

975
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:43,900
bring in. Chris was one of our
surprise guests last year who

976
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:48,100
came in and talked to some folks
in the room. And, you know, just

977
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:52,120
have that different way of
connecting and being able to

978
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,840
participate, because not
everybody we understand can come

979
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,440
and join us physically. There's
always limitations and time

980
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,780
frames, but if you can join us
in person, we'd love to see you

981
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:08,580
there, and we love to see you in
the virtual room. And the bonus

982
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,980
of the virtual stuff too is you
get replays, and you can come

983
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,040
back into the membership and you
can catch up on it, instead of

984
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,640
just getting that one hit from
the room in a physical presence.

985
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,980
So thank you so much for your
work, Chris, I really appreciate

986
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:25,940
the support of you and your
beautiful wife with our

987
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:29,060
conference. And I got a shirt
for you because I know the ones

988
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:29,660
you like,

989
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,580
Chris Bache: Ah, good, yeah,
I've worn the other ones so much

990
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,500
they're getting worn out. So a
new shirt is

991
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,440
Marc Caron: good. You know, the
only one is a fun side note, but

992
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,080
it's true. I was at the unicorn
Music Festival, for those who

993
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,400
don't know, and John, and John
Stockton is he's a beautiful

994
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,400
soul, and he's a lawyer from the
days of cannabis and everything

995
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,880
else. I had seen him for a
while. And he comes up to our,

996
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:55,360
our tent and stuff at the at the
conference, and he's wearing the

997
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,480
same shirt, the green tree
shirt, and like you said, Chris,

998
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,380
it was all worn out. He loved
it. It it was one of his

999
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,620
favorite shirts, so he had to
set him up with another just a

1000
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:09,180
funny story as a sidebar for
that. But if there's anything

1001
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:14,160
that you want to add, Steven or
Chris before we wrap it up, that

1002
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:14,940
would be great.

1003
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:21,140
Stephen Gray: Well, excuse me,
I'm assuming you'll say a little

1004
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:24,680
bit more about ways that people
can join the conference mark.

1005
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:29,840
But also, I have a particular
question for a friend of mine

1006
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,160
who lives in Switzerland and
wanted to catch this interview,

1007
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,440
but it'll be 2am there right
now, or when this started. And

1008
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,560
so how can he see this later?
Because, and the other thing I

1009
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,040
want to say to anyone who's
still with us now, plus anyone

1010
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:52,660
who sees this later, is if you,
if you heard the things that

1011
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,720
Chris said, said today, along
with perhaps other information

1012
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:59,860
that he has shared, this is
absolutely important for our

1013
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:02,880
planet right now to hear these
things that Chris is saying

1014
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:09,300
absolutely central and at the
very least, I mean, you know,

1015
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,440
the basic ground of that, in a
sense, is the encouragement and

1016
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,380
sort of upliftingness that's
going to be needed as we go

1017
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:19,440
through these, you know,
increasingly challenging times

1018
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,760
on the material level. I mean,
there's going to be no doubt you

1019
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,780
know what's already happened,
and it will increase further is

1020
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,200
deeper levels of anxiety and
depression and confusion and

1021
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:34,940
tendencies to grasp on to, you
know, unreasonable hopes, such

1022
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:38,000
as, you know what's going on in
the Maga movement, for example,

1023
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:45,280
etc, etc. So I my my dream, my
hope, is that 1000s and 1000s of

1024
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,120
people will watch this
interview. And so starting with

1025
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,120
my friend Craig in Switzerland,
how can he tune into it?

1026
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:55,119
Marc Caron: Mark, well, what a
great question. Steven, thanks

1027
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:58,239
for asking. It's really simple.
First off, for anybody who

1028
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,739
signed up, we're going to send
out an email with the link,

1029
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:04,739
direct link. But you can check
out our spirit plant medicine

1030
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:09,119
YouTube channel. It's streaming
there live as we speak. You can

1031
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:13,319
check out our Facebook page as
well. It's streaming live there

1032
01:14:13,379 --> 01:14:17,099
as we speak. And so they're
always there for replays after

1033
01:14:17,099 --> 01:14:21,799
the fact. And if you're inspired
or moved by what you're hearing,

1034
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:26,359
please. Please share it with
your friends. Share it far and

1035
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:29,239
wide, and that helps the
algorithms as well in the social

1036
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:34,519
media platforms to, you know,
start showing it more and more.

1037
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:37,099
So it's really important that if
there's something here that

1038
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:40,939
moved you, please, you know,
find those and share them far

1039
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:44,319
and wide, so it's easy to find,
and we'll send out some email

1040
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:45,039
reminders.

1041
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,880
Stephen Gray: And I would like
to put in one final pitch for

1042
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,360
people to attend the conference,
because of the, again, the kinds

1043
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,820
of things that Chris has been
sharing is that we are moving

1044
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:58,960
into a collective journey. And
quite honestly, this is not

1045
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,040
really a sales pitch. I don't
see it that way. It's a, it's a,

1046
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:06,300
it's a call to a gathering. I've
been I've been tending to think

1047
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,840
of the conference as an
empowerment hub, now that we can

1048
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,260
support and empower and
encourage each other by meeting,

1049
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:17,520
whether it be, you know, they
can only make it virtually or

1050
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,620
even better. Of course, in
person, it's, it's, it's part of

1051
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,140
the collective journey that
we're working with here.

1052
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,120
Marc Caron: Yeah, yeah. And I

1053
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:31,700
Chris Bache: can jump in and
just heartfelt plug for the

1054
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,720
conference, because, I mean,
truly, I just love going to the

1055
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,180
conference. It's an intimate
conference. It's not like, god

1056
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:43,720
bless maps. You know, it's not
like the 13,000 mega

1057
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:49,060
conferences. This is a group of
dedicated practitioners working

1058
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,780
with many therapeutic
modalities, with many substances

1059
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:57,400
as opportunities for
conversations and a lot of new

1060
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:02,820
things get open there. I release
diamonds, LSD in the mind of the

1061
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:08,040
universe in 2019 I think it was
right. We got it early release

1062
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:12,000
there. And now at this
conference, I'm going to be

1063
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,720
releasing, as part of my
presentation, the new edition of

1064
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:19,620
the living classroom, which is
the first time that I'm able to

1065
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,000
really tell the story of the
role of psychedelics that

1066
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,160
psychedelic played in the the
ideas that I wrote about in the

1067
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,940
original version of 2000 in of
the living classroom in 2008

1068
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:35,720
where I thought it was best to
keep psychedelics out of the

1069
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,500
story. So there's just, there's
new material that comes forward,

1070
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:43,780
new ideas, and there's just
nothing like the contagious

1071
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:49,060
quality of being in the room
with like minded people and the

1072
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:53,620
interactions and exchanges that
take place. It's just, it's just

1073
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,600
a really, a wonderful, wonderful
place to be.

1074
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:59,260
Stephen Gray: Hey, Chris, have
you been talking to Colin at all

1075
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:02,640
about getting that book in time
for the conference, yes.

1076
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:05,760
Chris Bache: Oh, good. I think
we're going to have it in time.

1077
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:11,640
It's going to be an advanced
release. I don't know whether

1078
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,040
we'll have the paperback. I
don't think the paperback is

1079
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,140
going to be out. And so that
means it's going to be a bit

1080
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:19,680
pricey, because it'll be the
hard back, you know, and it's

1081
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:27,020
SUNY press, State University of
New York Press and but, yeah, we

1082
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,540
will have copies there. I wish
we were going to have the

1083
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,060
paperback, but that won't be out
for another year.

1084
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,560
Stephen Gray: Hey, Mark, maybe
we could offer a slight special

1085
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,600
discount ticket price if they
purchase the book at the same

1086
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,020
time.

1087
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,320
Marc Caron: Well, that's a good
one. I'm not sure how I would

1088
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,960
rip that out of my mind right
now.

1089
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:51,400
Chris Bache: Warn you, it's a
pricey I don't remember exactly

1090
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,040
what it is, but it's, it's aimed
at libraries. You know, the

1091
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,320
heart of that challenge is,
yeah, it was the

1092
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,720
Marc Caron: publisher.
Definitely share it. Share it

1093
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:03,120
out there, far and wide for
those interested as well through

1094
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,780
our community. And you know,
it's thank you for your kind

1095
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:13,560
words, Chris in it is the, let
me just get the marbles out of

1096
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:17,280
my mouth. It's not really a
conference. We just call it a

1097
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,380
conference. It's a ceremony, and
then we kind of put a conference

1098
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:27,620
inside of it, right? So it
certainly is, is a community

1099
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:31,760
based gathering. And you know,
I'm blessed to be here today at

1100
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:37,460
the I am awake Foundation. And
this is a story about Chris and

1101
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,920
Jen and the work that they're
doing in consciousness, research

1102
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,580
and exploration. And they met at
the Spira plant medicine

1103
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:46,840
conference in 2019 and their
work grew from there. So they've

1104
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,960
been doing this beautiful work
for five years. We've met so

1105
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:53,980
many people who have met and,
you know, created relationships.

1106
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:57,880
And you know, doing business and
working together and just

1107
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,560
connecting that, that we've seen
is a great connecting

1108
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,560
opportunity, and even if you're
not in person, you still have

1109
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,980
that ability in the virtual
world as well, because you have

1110
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:11,940
the ability to connect and chat
with like minded people. So if

1111
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:15,300
you're interested, by all means,
please join us. There's many

1112
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:19,080
ways to do so, and we'd love to
see you there, whether

1113
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,840
virtually, and of course, in
person, there's always room. So

1114
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:27,800
that being said, I just want to
thank you again, Chris for the

1115
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,440
work you do. I look forward to
seeing you and Christina again

1116
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:35,540
in the very near future. And
Steven, thank you as well for

1117
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:39,380
being my partner and co host and
everything that we do together.

1118
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:42,160
It's always, always a pleasure.
And I also want to give a big

1119
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:47,200
shout out to Michael Krause, who
is behind the scenes. He's just

1120
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,080
a beautiful soul who does a lot
of great work with unify the

1121
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:53,560
world peace movement and many,
many different things regarding

1122
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,080
spirituality of consciousness.
There he is, there, Michael,

1123
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,080
thank you for your support
always, as we do these programs

1124
01:19:59,080 --> 01:19:59,620
so we can I.

1125
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,320
Unknown: You can, can? I can't
raise my hand because of the

1126
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,700
technology behind it.

1127
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,520
Marc Caron: Well, you've got,
you've got all the power,

1128
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,240
really, man.

1129
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:15,840
Unknown: And I just wanted to
deeply, deeply express my

1130
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,260
gratitude to you, specifically,
Chris, for your wisdom, for your

1131
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:25,280
knowledge, and having done the
work for all of us, and, and

1132
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,540
what I really got from you and
and, and really feeling into

1133
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:33,620
your energy, and you said
presence early on, is where

1134
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:38,960
you've arrived in that deepest,
deepest level of the of the

1135
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,660
gentleness of your heart. And
that, to me, that is what we

1136
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:48,820
need to cultivate across the
planet if we want to move into

1137
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:55,540
that new transformation. And I,
I I would want to get emotional

1138
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:59,560
almost because I can, I can feel
the presence of you and and I, I

1139
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:04,380
just deeply one about you, for
your work, for your wisdom, for

1140
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:08,460
your knowledge and and, and the
beauty of your soul and and

1141
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,580
thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And it What an honor to be

1142
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,260
supporting this through the
technology here in the in the

1143
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:20,960
background and and also, thank
you, Steve, and thank you, Mark,

1144
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:26,000
the beauty that shines through
you is and the commitment is is

1145
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,380
unparalleled. So

1146
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,500
Marc Caron: thank you for that,
Michael. And you know, as a

1147
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:37,520
segue, hey, Steven, next this
Thursday, two days from now,

1148
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,560
we've got a great series coming
up in the in the next month of

1149
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,740
pre conference events and
conversations. This Thursday,

1150
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:49,540
four o'clock, Marco Sanchez and
acashia Lewis will be joining

1151
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:49,840
us,

1152
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:53,199
Stephen Gray: and they're both
absolutely brilliant. They were,

1153
01:21:53,619 --> 01:21:56,799
in my humble opinion, no offense
to any of the other speakers

1154
01:21:56,799 --> 01:21:59,079
last year, they were the two
strongest, and for me

1155
01:21:59,139 --> 01:22:02,939
personally, they're both
brilliant and have a lot of

1156
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:06,719
really relevant things to say.
And Hey, Michael, if you're

1157
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,259
still listening, I'm lucky for
you, Chris has gone beyond the

1158
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:13,499
level of spiritual realization
where he's seduced by flattery.

1159
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:23,780
Marc Caron: And then lastly,
hey, next a week from today,

1160
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:29,660
Rick Doblin from Matt, and then
I think the following Thursday

01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:34,760

1162
01:22:35,419 --> 01:22:38,299
Stephen Gray: soy, Ken a Yeah,
actually, we have to talk about

1163
01:22:38,299 --> 01:22:38,599

1164
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,840
Marc Caron: the time. Let's just
talk about who's joining us next

1165
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,540
Thursday, and we'll talk about
that.

1166
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:46,960
Stephen Gray: No part of that
Mark is we might possibly have

1167
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,560
to switch that to Wednesday for
Anya, but we'll have to talk

1168
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,040
about it.

1169
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,560
Marc Caron: Okay. Well, next

1170
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,100

1172
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,720

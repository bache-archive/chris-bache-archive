Unknown: Sand, welcome to what
is going on for new thought from

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,200
veteran broadcaster, author and
media consultant Sandy sedgbeer

00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,440
conducts thought provoking
interviews with inspirational

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,820
authors, artists, musicians,
scientists, speakers and

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,420
filmmakers who are working at
the point where spirituality and

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,860
science meet consciousness at
the very edge of AUM. Here is

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,020
your host, Sandy sedgbeer,

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,320
Sandy Sedgbeer: hello.
Throughout the years that I've

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,860
been conducting interviews on
science, consciousness and

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,320
spirituality, I've read numerous
mind shifting books and heard

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,720
goodness knows how many
extraordinary stories, but the

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,360
story you're going to hear today
is so far beyond remarkable that

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,680
I've struggled to find words to
adequately describe it. All I

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,340
can say by way of introduction,
is that what you're about to

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,100
hear is a story that I didn't
know until I read it, that I and

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,620
no doubt countless millions of
seekers have been waiting for

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,360
our entire lives. Christopher em
Bache is professor emeritus in

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,900
the Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at Youngstown

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,820
State University, where he
taught for 33 years a fellow at

21
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,600
the Institute of Noetic
Sciences. He's also adjunct

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,060
faculty at the California
Institute of integral studies,

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,040
and on the advisory board for
Grof Transpersonal training and

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,480
the Grof Foundation, an award
winning teacher and

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,340
international speaker, Chris
Bache joins me now to discuss

26
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,720
his Book LSD and the mind of the
universe diamonds from heaven,

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,860
which has been held as a
gripping account of an utterly

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,380
unique and extraordinary hero's
journey that opens our minds and

29
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,960
hearts to a new vision of our
universe and ourselves as

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,140
inseparable from the ineffable
being that we have called God.

31
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,760
Chris Bache, welcome,

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,360
Chris Bache: hi, Sandy. It's a
pleasure to be here with you

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,900
today.

34
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,600
Sandy Sedgbeer: This is a long
awaited interview, I have to

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,540
say. Chris so little background,
in 1979 you took the first step

36
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,700
on a life changing journey to
explore your mind and the mind

37
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,260
of the universe as deeply and
systematically as possible, with

38
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,740
the help of LSD, if you had
known then that it would take 20

39
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,880
years of excruciating pain,
suffering, bliss and intense

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,100
purification, plus many more
years of digesting, processing,

41
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,640
organizing and writing to
publish this book, would you

42
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,800
still have put yourself through
it?

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,420
Chris Bache: That's a good
question. I'm not sure that I

44
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,820
would. I think knowing now what
i If I had known then what I

45
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,620
know now, I would have been
gentler on myself. I would have

46
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,360
used in a gentler protocol,
balancing high versus low doses,

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,760
balancing LSD with Psilocybin
and Ayahuasca. I still would

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,960
have taken the journey, but it
might not have been as taken as

49
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,360
aggressively as I did.

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,320
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, yeah.
Well, knowing the outcome, you

51
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,080
can't really say No, I wouldn't
have done it. So you experienced

52
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,300
73 higher dose LSD sessions
following protocols established

53
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,380
by Stanislav Grof with the
intention of engaging hyper

54
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,440
intensive states in a way that
would allow the initial chaos at

55
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,640
each new level to clear and also
allow your own biophysical and

56
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,240
psychological systems to adapt.
How did you know the precise

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,960
dosage to accomplish that in the
way that you wanted to

58
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,079
Chris Bache: well, Stan was very
clear in his early books and in

59
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,879
LSD psychotherapy, it was
published in 1980 the protocol

60
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,539
differences between psycholytic
and low dose therapy versus

61
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:33,979
psychedelic high dose therapy,
psycholytic Running doses

62
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:40,479
anywhere 50 150 micrograms and
high dose psychedelic therapy

63
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:47,739
between four to 503 50 to 500
and at that time, high dose

64
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:52,299
psychedelic therapy was being
worked used at Spring Grove

65
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:57,159
Hospital in Baltimore, and they
were trying to basically trigger

66
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,479
something approximating a
Near-Death Experience. Variants

67
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,659
for people who were dying, they
were terminal patients, and

68
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:07,019
trying to give them a glimpse of
where they were going. And I

69
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,979
thought, well, if you could do
this work three times safely,

70
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,299
then you could do it more than
three times safely. And I chose

71
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:19,979
to work with high doses of LSD
for a couple of reasons. One

72
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:26,419
night, I had an A false model of
of what the project was. The

73
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:29,599
model I had was a model of
personal transformation. I

74
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:33,199
thought this was about my
personal healing, my personal

75
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,179
spiritual awakening. That turned
out to be an incomplete,

76
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:43,599
profoundly incomplete model. And
I was thinking that, you know,

77
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,439
spiritual awakening is about
clearing your karma. Our karma

78
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,939
ultimately is finite, and by
working with high doses, I would

79
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,679
basically being it was I knew it
would be more difficult work,

80
00:05:56,679 --> 00:06:01,019
but I thought of myself as
basically biting off my karma

81
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:05,519
and larger bites and clearing it
faster. Turns out that that's a

82
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,579
false model. Personal
Transformation was too small to

83
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,779
describe it, and the doses I
took from the literature, I

84
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,619
basically wanted to push my
system as hard as I could to be

85
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:20,839
efficient. I mean, I was in a
dual career marriage. Getting

86
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,799
time for these sessions was very
complicated. Had to balance a

87
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:28,639
lot of schedules, and I wanted
to get as much done in every

88
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,399
session as I could. Again, what
I learned on along the way is

89
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,619
because consciousness is unified
at its source, that when you

90
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:42,579
hyper stimulate consciousness.
You're not just hyper

91
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:46,659
stimulating your personal field
of consciousness. You're hyper

92
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:50,799
stimulating some portion of the
unified field of consciousness.

93
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:55,539
And therefore, the dynamic that
get activated, the dynamics of

94
00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:00,719
healing and purification and
illumination, are much, much

95
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:04,259
larger than personal dynamics.

96
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,800
Sandy Sedgbeer: At what point
did you realize this, this

97
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,680
wasn't going to be a personal
journey at all, that there was

98
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,540
so much more going on.

99
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,740
Chris Bache: Well, for about the
first two and a half years, it

100
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,840
looked it followed very much the
material that Stan Grof had been

101
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,620
tracking my first two and a half
years of work were very much

102
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,780
perinatal in nature, going
through the Death-Rebirth

103
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,460
process, experiencing re
experiencing one's birth,

104
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,300
experiencing a profound
confrontation with death and the

105
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,740
meaninglessness of existence.
But then i This culminated in a

106
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,780
crushing ego death experience
and a liberating ego death

107
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,420
experience. And then, according
to Stan's early descriptions,

108
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,340
what I was expecting after going
through Ego Death access to

109
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,600
Transpersonal reality would get
easier. But what happened in my

110
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:05,160
sessions is that I began to go
through the periods of vast

111
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,620
suffering that got deeper and
deeper and larger, terrible

112
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,420
suffering and pain, not
personal, collective opening up

113
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,180
to the suffering of 1000s and
hundreds of 1000s of people and

114
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,160
1000s of years of time. And at
first I thought this represented

115
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,300
a deepening of ego death. But it
went on for so long and it

116
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,860
involved so many people that
eventually I had no alternative

117
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,840
to but to come to the conclusion
that what was being healed or

118
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,020
transformed in this process was
not my personal psyche, but some

119
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,160
aspect of the collective psyche
of humanity that just as

120
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,060
personal trauma gets
internalized in our personal

121
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,280
psyche and can produce
pathology, likewise, the vast

122
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,980
quantities of trauma that
humanity has absorbed through

123
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,240
history, gets collected and
internalized in the collective

124
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,740
psyche and produces a kind of
Social Pathology at the

125
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,940
collective level. And something
was using my sessions to

126
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,800
basically address and heal to
some degree, this collective

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,400
trauma.

128
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,120
Sandy Sedgbeer: So there didn't
seem to be anything random about

129
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,960
this journey, because sometimes
you didn't have a session for

130
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,860
long periods, even years, but
when you went back, you always

131
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,660
seem to, you know, catch up
where you were at the time

132
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,040
before, yeah,

133
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,920
Chris Bache: that was my sense
of it, too, that I was engaging

134
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,180
a long and sustained
conversation, communion,

135
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,740
initiation, with a larger
consciousness. And the size and

136
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,540
scale of this consciousness kept
deepening and changing. Working

137
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:07,020
as my work continued, and I
always felt myself engaging in

138
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,640
intelligence. When this is most
dramatic, perhaps, this

139
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,740
continuity across time. I did
four years of work, I stopped

140
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,100
for six years, and then I
started again for another 10

141
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,440
years of work. When I stopped, I
was working on the ocean of

142
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,220
suffering material in the
purification phase of a session

143
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,600
I was engaged in this ocean of
suffering. I stopped for six

144
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,160
years, six years later in a
completely different time of my

145
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,960
life, with different
expectations. When I went into

146
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,860
the work again, the ocean of
suffering started exactly where

147
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,260
it had stopped and continued,
indicating clearly that the

148
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,060
intelligence that I was engaging
was guiding what was happening.

149
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,500
It was in charge of my sessions,
and all I did was really open

150
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,900
up, isolate myself from the
world, open up and follow

151
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,740
wherever it wanted to take me.
And I found that if I trusted

152
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,740
myself completely and
surrendered to where it would

153
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,520
take me, I would go through
these intense purification

154
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,900
processes or death processes.
Eventually it would culminate in

155
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,100
some type of crisis or
breakthrough, and then I would

156
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,420
be spun into ecstatic,
revelatory experiences for the

157
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,600
remainder of the session, and
the next session would begin the

158
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,560
cycle again. So I just, I
learned to trust that process,

159
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,160
Sandy Sedgbeer: but, but the
suffering, you know, there were,

160
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,080
I was listening to it on Audible
as well as reading the book. And

161
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,420
there were times when I was, you
know, speaking to you and

162
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,200
saying, My goodness, why are you
going back? You know, it is so

163
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,160
painful.

164
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,860
Chris Bache: You go back not
because the, you know, I don't

165
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,360
like pain. Who likes pain for
nothing like that? You go back

166
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,620
for the joy that's waiting on
the other side of pain, you go

167
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,180
back with the understanding that
this, the suffering, this pain,

168
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,720
is in some way a purification
process, which I did not

169
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,560
understand the full scope of it
at the time, but I trusted

170
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,600
Stan's work, and it was affirmed
in my work that this is A

171
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,200
purification process, and that
when you go through it, then the

172
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,760
doors open, and that's why you
do it, for the revelations, for

173
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,840
the insights, for the visions,
for the for the opportunity to

174
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,160
enter into such deep and
profound communion with the

175
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,060
universe.

176
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,260
Sandy Sedgbeer: So the suffering
is the gateway. It's a gateway.

177
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,900
Chris Bache: It's, it's just a
product. You know, we have to

178
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,060
let go of being small in order
to enter into being large, and

179
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,020
it's not always easy to let go
of being small, but it's not

180
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,560
just let going, letting go of
your personal identity. You

181
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,900
know, we in therapy, we often
focus on ego death. And many of

182
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,680
the mystical traditions focus on
ego death, but what I found was

183
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,260
that ego death was just the
first of many patterns of death

184
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,960
and rebirth, so that what one is
letting go of at deeper levels

185
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,160
of the journey are much larger,
much deeper than just egoic

186
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,140
structures. And it's such a
mystery that at the end of the

187
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,200
book, I actually have an
appendix where I ask the

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,820
question, what dies when you're
so far beyond ego death, and yet

189
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,620
you are still having sensations
of dying, loss of control. What

190
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,980
is it that's actually dying in
that process?

191
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,880
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, yeah,
exactly. And when we listen to

192
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,540
it, you know, we can't help
asking the same question. So I

193
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,860
don't want to focus too much on
individual sessions, but there

194
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,940
was one that I really did want
to bring up, and it's actually a

195
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,120
whole collection of sessions
where you experience life as

196
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,680
many different women in turn.
What do you think was the

197
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,940
purpose of those experiences and
how did they impact you?

198
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,080
Chris Bache: Well, that was my
that was my ego death

199
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,960
experience, where the universe
after about this is a 10th

200
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,600
session, ninth, 10th session. It
just broke me like a twig. It

201
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,680
just took my identity and
snapped it. Now I had begun the

202
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,480
day as a white Ivy League
educated philosopher,

203
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,220
passionately concerned with the
meaning of existence and the

204
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,860
universe, forced me to become
the exact opposite of that. I

205
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,240
became women. I became women of
color. I became women who were

206
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,660
not interested in the meaning of
life at all, who were not

207
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,220
educated at all, and it did not
allow me to experience I was

208
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,320
myself, but I was myself in all
these other roles, other modes

209
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,540
and. It terrified me. It just
scared the bejeebas out of me,

210
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,020
and I fought it, but eventually,
when I gave up and I

211
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,680
surrendered, and I allowed
myself to become all these

212
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:17,040
women, then suddenly things
shifted, and I was taken under

213
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,260
the arm of the Great Mother and
initiated into the lives of

214
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,380
hundreds of women, the more
positive side of female

215
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,420
experience given many
experiences of women's lives,

216
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,520
conceiving, giving birth, loving
husbands, loving children. And I

217
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,640
think that the fundamental
message here was not reclaim

218
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,060
your former lives as women. I
know I have former lives as

219
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,140
women. That has never been a
question for me. I think the

220
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,780
issue was where you are going.
Gender does not exist. Let go.

221
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,960
So I was being taken into a
level of reality where male

222
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,120
female is irrelevant. But to do
that, I had to be broken of my

223
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,640
male identity. I had to allow
myself to go into some larger

224
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,780
identity. And becoming women was
simply just part of that

225
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,220
breaking process.

226
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,800
Sandy Sedgbeer: The whole the
whole 20 years seems to have

227
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,700
been quite a massive break in
process. I mean, you were doing

228
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,300
this. Nobody knew about it
except your wife. You weren't

229
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,880
allowed to talk about it to
anyone, or you didn't allow

230
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,980
yourself to. You were teaching
mature students philosophy, and

231
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,920
often, you know, there were
aspects of things that you were

232
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,260
teaching where your experiences
would have been the perfect

233
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,680
example to offer them, but you
couldn't do that. What was that

234
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,580
like for you?

235
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,920
Chris Bache: It wasn't so bad in
the beginning, but it got

236
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,620
increasingly difficult as I went
on, especially when I could feel

237
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,560
a question coming from students
that had personal, deep

238
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,780
significance to them, and an
answer would spontaneously rise

239
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:15,000
from my person, which but an
answer that was grounded in my

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,820
psychedelic experience, and I
couldn't some of them I could

241
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,620
lay off On the Stan Grof
experiences or other psychedelic

242
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,700
research experiences, but some
of them, I couldn't lay off, and

243
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,540
I could not bring my own
psychedelic experiences forward,

244
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,940
and I began to experience a
catch in my throat. My voice

245
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,780
would actually kind of, I would
lose control for a split second,

246
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,580
and it would sound like a little
bark coming out of my voice. It

247
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,140
was embarrassing. I mean, I was
I was literally strangling on

248
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,180
what I wanted to say and was not
allowed to say, and that became

249
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:58,000
difficult because the cost of
doing this work I knew would be

250
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,960
my silence, and I paid that
price, but I did not realize in

251
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,400
the beginning that when you
commit to dividing your life in

252
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,620
this way, to have a daytime job
as a straight professor and then

253
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,500
a nighttime job as a Psychonaut,
that It causes fractures in your

254
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,680
psyche which reached deeper than
you may have anticipated in the

255
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,660
beginning and in the end, these
cracks were only able to be

256
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,940
healed when I finally came out
of the psychedelic closet and

257
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,680
began to allow myself to speak
openly about these experiences

258
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,360
Sandy Sedgbeer: most people
these days, especially in the

259
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,860
spiritual arena, are familiar
with NDS, reincarnation,

260
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,600
channeled works that explain who
we are and where we go in the

261
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,380
afterlife. And you've taught
courses on these yourselves, but

262
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,560
your experience took you way
beyond where anyone has gone

263
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,720
before. It gave you a whole new
vision of the Bardo. Tell us a

264
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,620
bit about that.

265
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,640
Chris Bache: Well, the classic
understanding of the Bardo, I

266
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,900
think, was affirmed in my
sessions. That is, there are

267
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,840
many, many, many layers of
spiritual reality. And when we

268
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,940
return to that layer that
reflects our spiritual

269
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,360
development or spiritual
maturity. And it's a, it's a,

270
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,900
it's a social domain. There,
there are other beings. There,

271
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,300
not only other incarnate beings
or discarnate beings, but there

272
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,480
are also guardians and guides
and so forth. And the basic idea

273
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,540
is, after you die, you go
through a debrief process in

274
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,080
which you process your most
recently completed life. You

275
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,220
learn what you kind of what you
did poorly and what you did very

276
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,960
well. You go through this
process, and then you go through

277
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,700
kind of a return. Coming to the
world of spirit, to returning

278
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,540
home, and eventually you go
through when it's time to

279
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,800
incarnate again, to the choice
process of incarnating again.

280
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,260
And because, because the
evolution of the soul is so vast

281
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,900
and covers such a wide spectrum
of development, it takes many,

282
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,440
many, many lifetimes to
actualize the full potential of

283
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,760
a human existence. And so there
are many tiers of the Bardo

284
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,860
domain, and my experience
affirms this classic vision. I

285
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:39,680
had many experiences of kind of
tapping into Bardo reality. And

286
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,480
it's a collective reality. I
think the ocean of suffering

287
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,320
kind of is analogous to the
Buddhist concept of the hell

288
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,640
realm. I tapped into levels
which would be analogous to the

289
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,340
the high deity realm in the
Buddhist cosmology of the Six

290
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,500
Lokas, or the six realms. And
there are also there is a

291
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,900
reality that's outside the Bardo
when you get basically, in a

292
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,520
sense, graduate from the Earth
system, when you move beyond

293
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,520
that spiritual echo of time,
space experience and enter into

294
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,920
the reality beyond all Bardo
existence, and that is

295
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,720
correlated with what I would
describe as the diamond

296
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,360
Luminosity, the domain of
diamond Luminosity.

297
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,060
Sandy Sedgbeer: Why do you call
it that?

298
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,140
Chris Bache: Because that's,
that's, that was the experience

299
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,160
one encounters light, often in
deep spiritual experiences and

300
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,540
near death experiences in
psychedelic experiences, when

301
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,840
you go through a Death-Rebirth
process, often you have the

302
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,160
sensation of being flooded with
light, encountering light. It's

303
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,600
almost a universal in spiritual
traditions. And I had

304
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,920
experienced light at many forms
and many times in my practice,

305
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,300
but when I came to this advanced
stage of my work, which started

306
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,860
with the 45th session, I
encountered a light that was

307
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,460
unlike anything I had
encountered previously. It was

308
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,780
incredibly bright, incredibly
beautiful and clear. The hardest

309
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,140
thing to describe when I say
light, it's almost like it

310
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,980
becomes so refined and so
intense, it becomes invisible.

311
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,780
It's just Clear. Clear. Your
mind is just so incredibly

312
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,720
clear. And I came to understand
what the Buddhists meant when

313
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,840
they say touching this for one
second undoes 1000s of years of

314
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:53,080
living in the shadows of karma.
It is radically pure, clear, and

315
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,220
once I touched that, I wasn't
interested in exploring any of

316
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,540
the other dimensions of
spiritual reality that I had

317
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,840
encountered before, which
include collective dimensions,

318
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,260
the collective unconscious,
archetypal reality, even

319
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,060
dimensions of causal oneness.
This was something totally,

320
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,920
completely different. And in the
last five years of my work, in

321
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,160
26 sessions, which is 1/3 of my
entire journey, I only touched

322
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,760
this reality four times, okay,
and every time I touched it, it

323
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,080
would trigger more purification,
more detoxification, and a

324
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,440
year's worth of work before I
was able to come back and touch

325
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,100
it again.

326
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,680
Sandy Sedgbeer: Wow. And was
that something having touched it

327
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,160
that kept you going, got you
know, had you seeking it again

328
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,900
and again? Absolutely?

329
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,240
Chris Bache: Yeah, the last
third of my work, that was my

330
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,980
agenda, was to go back, so do
whatever I needed to do to go

331
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,600
back into that reality.

332
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,620
Sandy Sedgbeer: So if I
understand this, right? And, you

333
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,500
know, I haven't read a huge
amount about the Bardo, but what

334
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,820
you're saying is that there are
these different layers, if you

335
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:15,000
like, almost stages, and over
probably millennia, we gradually

336
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,440
go through them, but you went
through them, you know, in that

337
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,360
much time. You know, what kind
of effect does that have? On

338
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,900
someone?

339
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,340
Chris Bache: Well, I want to be
careful here. I think what

340
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,340
happens in a psychedelic,
therapeutically focused

341
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,040
psychedelic session, or
spiritually focused psychedelic

342
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,880
session, is that you speed up
what is happening in life at a

343
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,680
slower pace in a natural
process. So reincarnation, as I

344
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,940
understand it, we are growing,
we are evolving. We die, we

345
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,380
return to soul consciousness.
We're born. We contract down

346
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,920
into egoic consciousness. We
die, we go back into soul.

347
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,080
Consciousness and that we keep
this up and keep this up over

348
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,240
long periods of time, we choose
lives which challenge us,

349
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,940
stretch us, heal us, allow us to
develop new talents, new

350
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,780
capacities, to deepen the
capacities that we've started.

351
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,760
What happens, I think, in
psychedelic therapy, is that

352
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,120
that whole process is
accelerated. This is, I think

353
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,320
this is true for meditation. In
meditation, when you do long,

354
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,860
sustained retreats of
meditation, you are speeding up

355
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:39,260
the process that's taking place
at a slower pace in ordinary

356
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:48,280
life. And so I get you do bite
off larger pieces of personal

357
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,500
karma, but then something else
takes over. It's not about your

358
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,740
personal enlightenment. It's not
about your personal development,

359
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,180
your ties to the human family,
your ties to the family of life,

360
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,980
your ties to the universe,
deepen, and you begin to feel a

361
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,540
sense of dance, or a sense of
engagement of this deep,

362
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:19,140
profound life process. And I
think, I think you can take it

363
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,780
too far. Then is comfortable.
You can take it so deeply, you

364
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,840
can you can be dissolved so
completely into these vast flows

365
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:36,440
of consciousness and vast
dimensions of existence that

366
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,740
it's very hard to come back out
of them. And it's it's hard, in

367
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,660
the sense that it's hard to
leave the joy, it's hard to

368
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,280
leave the clarity and the
ecstasy and come back into time

369
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:54,100
and space. Now that doesn't mean
because you've touched them and

370
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,340
because you've known them. It
doesn't mean that you can

371
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,260
stabilize that awareness back
inside time and space. It

372
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,140
doesn't mean that you have
accomplished what some of the

373
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,520
great spiritual teachers have
accomplished, who can abide one

374
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,000
foot in, one foot out in those
realities. I really, really

375
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,620
emphasize this is a path of
temporary immersion. It's

376
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,540
temporary you have not just
because you've had a temporary

377
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,740
experience of oneness of life or
Transcendence, doesn't mean that

378
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,300
you are as fully developed a
spiritual being as somebody who

379
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:35,300
can abide in that reality. And I
all honor truly to the great

380
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,740
spiritual masters who have
abiding the capacity to abide in

381
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:49,660
that reality. So I wouldn't say
necessarily that I accomplished

382
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,700
all of those evolutionary
journeys in one lifetime, but I

383
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,120
certainly did do something
pointing in that direction.

384
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,640
Sandy Sedgbeer: But you also you
can't un know what you know, and

385
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,780
when you come back knowing what
you know, it must be hell to,

386
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:12,840
you know, have to, you know,
move into a world that is so far

387
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,100
away from that that is just, you
know, falling apart on every

388
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,860
level. I mean, how do you cope
with that? It's such a

389
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,640
dichotomy.

390
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:28,220
Chris Bache: You it is
challenging. There are

391
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,920
mitigating processes, though
too, because the deeper your

392
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,620
experience of the intelligence
of life and the joy of the

393
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,720
creative intelligence in
manifesting existence. Then you

394
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,640
begin to look around you, and
you see the universe for what it

395
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,080
is. The universe is the body of
the Divine. The body of God. The

396
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,540
universe is the manifestation of
the intelligence, of a profound

397
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,220
intelligence, and once you touch
that intelligence. I mean, we

398
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,000
all know what intelligence looks
and feels like. We recognize it

399
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,140
when we meet it in people, and
this is a cosmic intelligence

400
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,800
that just overwhelms you with
its brilliance and its wisdom

401
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,140
and overwhelms you with love,
unlike beyond anything I had

402
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,100
ever known in this lifetime, and
I've known love in this

403
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,480
lifetime. This is a different
order of love. And once you

404
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,100
experience those things, then it
changes how you see the

405
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,120
universe. It changes how you see
life, and it also gives you a

406
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,600
larger horizon within which to
understand the human experience.

407
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,960
I mean it, I read, I adopted
reincarnation on the basis of

408
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,080
the empirical evidence. Early in
my career, I read Ian

409
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,800
Stevenson's work. I read the
early work on a past life

410
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,220
therapist, and I was convinced
intellectually that

411
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,500
reincarnation was a fact of
life, but it still. Takes years

412
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:07,440
to truly absorb and live into
the fabric of a universe that

413
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,660
pulses in a reincarnation cycle,
not just for the individual, but

414
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,160
for the entire human species. So
I had experiences in which I

415
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:23,120
understood my current life as a
continuity of extending from

416
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,440
previous lifetimes. But I also
had at a deeper level,

417
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:34,100
experiences of the entire human
species pulsing generation by

418
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,800
generation, pulsing in as a
reincarnating species, and that

419
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,080
all of our individual
challenges, and our individual

420
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,940
karma was a fractal
manifestation of this larger

421
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,720
species challenge, and this
species karma that we were

422
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,180
working and when you have those
experiences, you look at other

423
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,680
human beings differently. You
look at the planet differently.

424
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,520
You look at the Galaxy
differently. There is a sense of

425
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,080
deeper participation in a
mystery, which you may not

426
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,820
understand the details of, but
you can feel the joy because you

427
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,120
know the you've touched the
intelligence that's behind it,

428
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,280
and that makes it eat, that
makes it more joyful to enter

429
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,240
into it. Now there is a sadness
that you can't sustain those

430
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,340
peak experiences. But in another
month or two or I was doing this

431
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,480
about four or five times a year,
I would go back into this

432
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,260
reality, and not every time
necessarily, but I would go back

433
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:44,800
often enough that I would be
able to drink deeply again. The

434
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:51,520
full cost of how deep I went did
not really emerge until I

435
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:57,640
stopped my sessions. At the end
of the journey, the universe

436
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,400
basically told me it was time to
stop, and I could feel that it

437
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,960
was time to stop, and I stopped.
But it was only then, when I

438
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,880
wasn't returning in a few months
to have another deep communion

439
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:19,080
with my beloved that I began to
realize the true cost of over

440
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,080
extending, over extending myself
as deeply as I had into the

441
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,540
transcendental side of
existence.

442
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,400
Sandy Sedgbeer: Before we go to
the break, there's a one

443
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,700
question. You said that the
universe is the body of God.

444
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,960
What are we?

445
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,080
Chris Bache: We are part of the
universe. So we are part of the

446
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,740
body of God too. We are part of
the manifestation of the

447
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,840
intention of the universe to
create our mind, just as our

448
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,980
body is rooted in the quantum
reality of life and the atomic

449
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,440
reality of life and the whole
evolutionary story is built into

450
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,400
the nerves and the vascular
systems and the organs of our

451
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,520
body. So we become inseparable
from life as it is manifesting

452
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,260
in the galaxy, in the planet on
this continent. Likewise, our

453
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,600
minds are part of the creative
intelligence that's manifesting

454
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:25,340
existence. That's why, when we
go deep into our minds, we drop

455
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,440
down into the curse depth of our
personal mind, and we find that

456
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,880
there is no floor at the bottom
of our mind. We fall right

457
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,960
through into the mind of the
species, right through into the

458
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,820
mind of the universe. And when,
when you go that deep, then,

459
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,360
then the Hindu teaching, Atman
is Brahman, the essence of the

460
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,740
individual is the essence of the
totality that just becomes the

461
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,740
most natural thing in the world,
that becomes core truth and one

462
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:08,940
of the likewise a core truth is
oneness. To Brahman is one, and

463
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,020
we are part. We are an aspect of
fractal manifestation of that

464
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:18,420
oneness. Once one has known that
then even when you go back to

465
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,040
paying your bills and doing the
things we do in the physical

466
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,780
world, all you have to do is
step back, and then you can re

467
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,820
appreciate these deeper truths,
which are the deeper pulsing of

468
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,340
life. We're going

469
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,480
Sandy Sedgbeer: to take a short
break now. I'm Sandy sedgbeer.

470
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,040
My guest today is eminent
philosopher and theologian,

471
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,600
speaker and author, Christopher
M Bache, whose latest book, LSD

472
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,220
in the mind of the universe,
diamonds from heaven, which

473
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,680
rigorously chronicles his
intensive, systematic, 73

474
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,340
session, 20 years psychedelic.
Series of journeys into a

475
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,540
unified field of consciousness
that underlies all physical

476
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,140
existence. This is completely
mind blowing, so I need a break

477
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:15,240
just to reset my mind so that I
can ask intelligent questions.

478
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,920
We'll be back in a few moments.
Stay tuned. Welcome back. Chris

479
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,460
Bache, you've made it quite
clear that there is an

480
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,180
evolutionary dimension to all of
this. And as you move into the

481
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,300
later chapters in the book,
where you talk about the birth

482
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:35,480
of the diamond soul, you begin
to see that we are at an

483
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,380
evolutionary cusp, and the
global systems crisis that you

484
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:45,160
know we're all experiencing
right now is part of that for

485
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,600
what point? What? What is the
ultimate, you know, purpose here

486
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,980
of all of this happening?

487
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,900
Chris Bache: Yeah. Well, let me
break that down into two parts,

488
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,080
the classical vision, first on
reincarnation. A few words, the

489
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,140
classical vision of
reincarnation as it's held in

490
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:12,780
most Eastern traditions, is that
you grow, you get clear, kinder,

491
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,900
more generous, you cultivate
deeper and better qualities, and

492
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,660
eventually you come to a
spiritual maturing, where your

493
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,380
consciousness opens to the core
of your being, and you awaken to

494
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,800
the fact that the essence of
your nature is, in fact, the

495
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,300
essence of all nature, and that
all beings and you are sharing

496
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,520
the same nature. There's an
explosion of compassion and a

497
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,200
deep embrace of the universe,
and their interpretation of what

498
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,060
happens next is that you are now
free to leave time and space you

499
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:56,440
in the Hindus called it Moksha
escape, to escape Samsara, and

500
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,100
this up and out cosmology. All
the religions of the Axial Age,

501
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,420
in one way or another, are all
part of a pattern of an up and

502
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,140
out cosmology. We don't want to
be on Earth. We got here by

503
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,560
accident. It's a veil of tears.
We want to get out of here,

504
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,740
either by salvation or
enlightenment. We want to get

505
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,780
out of here, but that leaves
fundamentally unexplained. What

506
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,800
is the purpose of the universe?
What is the purpose of this

507
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,660
magnificent creation? And now we
have a deeper understanding of

508
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,620
the size of existence, the
magnitude of the universe. How

509
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,700
many billions of years went into
the evolving and unfolding of

510
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,840
the universe. And it just
becomes profoundly unacceptable

511
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,120
short sighted to think that the
purpose of life is to awaken to

512
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:49,540
your true nature and then escape
into nirvana or escape into some

513
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:55,120
off planet paradise. At a
critical point in my work, I had

514
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,140
the experience of all of my
former lives coming into me.

515
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,640
They were just coming in, one
right after another, and it was

516
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,540
like wrapping string, white
filament of light, white light

517
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,640
around a kite spool. And at a
certain point, all those lives

518
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,160
fused into one consciousness.
And at that point there was an

519
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,840
explosion of this diamond light
out of my chest, and I was

520
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,080
catapulted into a deeper state
of consciousness than I had ever

521
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,880
touched before. And I was an
individual, but an individual

522
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,440
beyond any frame of reference
that I had ever known. And this

523
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,360
is what I came to call the birth
of the diamond soul. And that

524
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,380
is, I think that as we incarnate
over and over and over and over

525
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,220
again, sooner or later, the
soul, consciousness that we

526
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:53,800
return to when we die, wakes up
and manifests inside our time

527
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,540
space consciousness, we
literally the soul wakes up

528
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:04,740
inside time and space, fully
conscious, 100,000 year old

529
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,520
being not 100 year old being
fully consciousness with an

530
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,420
intuitive awareness of the
breadth of human relationships

531
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,680
and an ability to enter into
deeper communion with the cosmic

532
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:23,360
intelligence. And at that point,
we don't leave. At that point,

533
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,920
we begin to live differently on
the planet. And I think the

534
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,920
entire human species is evolving
into the in this direction to

535
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,380
this point, the entire human
species is evolving into fully

536
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,140
manifesting soul consciousness.
And you know, when I say soul

537
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,040
consciousness, I don't mean
separate, isolated from each

538
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,600
other, fully transparent.
Shunyata, emptiness. Anata, no

539
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:59,140
self concept, all affirmed but a
soul manifesting consciousness.

540
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:05,280
And if you can. Imagine a planet
of a species filled with souls,

541
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,420
fully conscious souls, that
species would create a different

542
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,360
life on this planet than we've
ever seen before. At another

543
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,860
point in my work, later in my
work, I began, actually, over a

544
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:24,680
period of about four years,
amidst everything else that was

545
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,120
going on in my sessions, I began
to have dumped into my awareness

546
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,520
a series of visions about human
evolution. And the message was

547
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,360
always the same, we're coming to
a turning point, a point of

548
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,060
profound spiritual awakening, a
before and after in human

549
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,900
history, that it would involve
tremendous collective

550
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,840
purification, but this
collective purification was

551
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,940
emptying out the kind of the
pains of history to lay a new

552
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,600
foundation for this infusion, a
new infusion of divine energy

553
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:06,420
that was rising up within us. It
was clear that, and I was given

554
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,860
a taste glimpses of the future
human this a transformed

555
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,700
humanity that would emerge out
of this. But it never showed me

556
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,020
how nature was going to pull
this off. It never showed me how

557
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:23,480
this would would work. And then
several years later, in 1995

558
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,700
when I was already had already
transitioned to the diamond

559
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,180
Luminosity phase of my work. So
I was working at pretty advanced

560
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:37,580
places on a particular day at
the end of 95 when I was

561
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,140
expecting to be taken, hopefully
back into the diamond

562
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:46,180
Luminosity. Instead, it took me,
it dissolved me into the

563
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,200
species. And so Chris Bache just
dissolved into the human family.

564
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,000
And then as the human family, I
was taken into the future, into

565
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,980
what I call deep time. And there
I began to experience what I

566
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:06,240
came to understand was a death
and rebirth process that was

567
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,920
impacting the entire human
family, just as an individual

568
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,280
goes through an intense
Death-Rebirth process when they

569
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,240
do spiritual practice or
psychedelic practice, history

570
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,100
was putting the entire human
family into a Death-Rebirth

571
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,680
process. I experienced an
unraveling of life, a profound

572
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,880
loss of control. We were losing
control of all the ordinary

573
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,900
assumptions of life. There was
just a cascading series of

574
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,360
crises that were breaking us
down level by level. I was not

575
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,100
given any details. I wasn't
given any calendar of events,

576
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,320
but this was a global crisis
that seemed to be triggered by a

577
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:55,900
cascading series of ecological
crises. Beyond that, I wasn't

578
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,360
given the details, but the whole
the whole system of life was

579
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,520
coming crashing down, and then
just when it was at its worst,

580
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,300
Just when it seemed like we
would all be dying, that this

581
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:15,660
was an extinction event, the
peak of the storm passed, and

582
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,120
things began to get easier, and
we began to pick ourselves up,

583
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,580
and we began to rebuild
civilization. And when we did,

584
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,260
our entire existence was
different. We were suffused with

585
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,940
new ideas, new things, new ways
of thinking, new values, new

586
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,480
capacities within the human
heart, which generated new

587
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,940
social relationships and new
social institutions somehow

588
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:48,580
going through this profound
global systems crisis broke us

589
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,920
down, broke us open, and tapped
us into the universe at a deeper

590
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,760
level than we had ever been
tapped into before, so that when

591
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,220
we went through this crisis, we
were changed profoundly as a

592
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,660
species, and what came out of
this crisis was not just a new

593
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:12,120
civilization or a new economy or
a new industry. What came out of

594
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,880
it was literally a new kind of
human being that this is a shift

595
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,400
in the plate tectonics of the
collective psyche, a shift in

596
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,840
the fundamental core of the
collective psyche. Now, humanity

597
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,140
has been through shifts in the
past like this. There was a time

598
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,820
when we shifted and our brain
size increased 50% that's

599
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,900
enormous shift. This is
something like that. It's a deep

600
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,540
shift of the collective psyche
so that every human being born

601
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,800
after this takes place will be
living their individual

602
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,900
awareness, will be alive within
a field of a collective

603
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,680
awareness which is different
than the field that we are in

604
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,940
now and today.

605
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:03,240
This is what I. Call the birth
of the future human. And I think

606
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,380
the form that the future human
will take will be the diamond

607
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,680
soul. We are giving birth to a
new species on this planet, a

608
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,420
species which is spiritually
awake, a species which is

609
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:24,020
spiritually mature, and a
species which is a soul

610
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:28,340
conscious species, a soul aware
species. And by that I mean

611
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:32,240
something beyond anything that
we've ever talked about soul

612
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,200
before. Because I think our
restrictions, our concept of

613
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,320
soul, have been restricted by
assumptions we've been making.

614
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,700
And that's why I call it the
diamond soul, to signal that

615
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,540
this is something new. This is
something different. And I think

616
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,460
our great spiritual masters, our
great saints and saviors, Jesus

617
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,200
the Christ, the Buddhas, the
prophets, these have been giving

618
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,100
us foreshadowing insights into
the nature of the being that we

619
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,820
are becoming. They are the
prototypes of the being that we

620
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,020
are all becoming. And then late
in my and even later in my

621
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,520
journey, I was taken deep into
deep time, and was given my

622
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:21,620
deepest experience of the future
human and this being is most

623
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:27,140
magnificent being just an
extraordinarily magnificent,

624
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:34,340
beautiful being of a vast heart
of a mind capable of drinking in

625
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,980
deep from the creative
intelligence and a heart capable

626
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:45,640
of experiencing the fundamental
oneness of all of life, and a

627
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,940
being that experiences the
fundamental oneness of life

628
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,060
would never hurt another being,
not just another human being,

629
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,480
never hurt another being. And
such a being would build a

630
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,840
different world than the world
we're building now.

631
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,520
Sandy Sedgbeer: So such a being
has no need to evolve.

632
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,280
Chris Bache: Well, I think this
is simply the next step in our

633
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,820
evolutionary saga. I don't know
how long it's going to take for

634
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,540
this transition to be affected.
I truly don't I mean, I think

635
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,460
it'll be at least generations,
whether it'll be something that

636
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,700
will be accomplished in 100
years or several 100 years, I

637
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,060
don't know. But however long it
takes, let's say it took 1000

638
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,580
years, which I think is
stretching it, because I think

639
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,640
we'll be dead if we don't make
this transition sooner than

640
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,060
that, we are either going to go
extinct, I think, or we're going

641
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,220
to transition into this new
form. Extinction is a tremendous

642
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,580
accelerator of evolution. Near
extinction, the threat of

643
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,020
extinction, whatever, however
long it takes, whatever we

644
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:55,420
become, evolution isn't going to
stop. We've been at this for

645
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,420
billions of years. We're going
we're going to be at this for

646
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,060
billions and billions of years
more. There's no telling where

647
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,260
we might be going next and then
next after that. So I don't see

648
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,800
it as an end point or a stopping
point. I see it as simply the

649
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,500
next point. And the next point
is to wake up to who, what's

650
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,960
been really going on, to who we
really are, to wake up to the

651
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,260
depth and breadth of our
relationships with life itself

652
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:28,760
and other people and other
species, and then we continue.

653
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,180
Sandy Sedgbeer: It's been 24
years since you stopped. Do you

654
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,420
feel that you have fully
integrated all of those

655
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,380
experiences?

656
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,820
Chris Bache: No, I haven't. When
I finished my sessions and was

657
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:51,700
beginning the digesting process,
my meditation in my meditation

658
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:56,920
of the universe, said to me, 20
years in, 20 years out. And I

659
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,320
thought, Oh, it'll take me 20
years to assimilate 20 years of

660
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,880
my journey, and as I was getting
to the end, when I was writing

661
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,620
diamonds from heaven, I thought
that was probably an optimistic

662
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:15,360
assessment. I think it'll take
me many lifetimes to fully

663
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,480
integrate all the gifts that
I've been given.

664
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,940
Sandy Sedgbeer: What do you
think in the light of what

665
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,180
you've told us, what you've
learned, what you've seen, we

666
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,860
most urgently need to address
now as a species,

667
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,320
Chris Bache: boy, there's so
many layers to that question. I

668
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:44,080
think first we start by taking
full responsibility for our

669
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:49,480
shadow, for engaging our side,
our shadow, and clearing any

670
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:55,000
obstacles and blocks which are
impeding our compassion, which

671
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,380
are impeding our healthy whole.
Uh, psycho spiritual

672
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:07,860
functioning. We need to
reconnect and rediscover our

673
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,220
relationship with the universe
and our fundamental core

674
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:15,900
identity with the universe. We
need to overcome all these

675
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,140
several 1000 years now of
teaching which places humanity

676
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,520
at the top of the evolutionary
pyramid, and as being unique and

677
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,260
kind, and not just unique in
degree, but unique and kind and

678
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,560
superior to all other life
forms, and all other life forms

679
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,580
serve us and can be used
exploitively by us, all that has

680
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,820
to be transcended, and we have
to enter into a renewed

681
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,980
communion with the universe,
with spiritual reality and with

682
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,900
physical reality. I think we
need to recognize that our body

683
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,660
is divine, not just our mind and
our heart, but our body is part

684
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:03,060
of the manifestation of
divinity. Sri Aurobindo thought

685
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:08,220
that humanity eventually would
become so spiritually energized

686
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,600
that the body was sufficiently
psychoplastic that the body had

687
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,640
the capacity to live forever. He
said his calculation would was

688
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,740
that it would take 300 years of
spiritual practice before we

689
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,160
would reach the point where we
could set in motion the chain

690
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,000
reaction that would have our
biological body perpetually

691
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,160
refreshing itself as we live in
communion with divinity. Now I

692
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,220
don't know about that, but I
find it to be an intriguing

693
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:41,560
vision from a profound teacher
about the potential that we're

694
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,940
activating. What's important is
to realize weird. We're just

695
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,860
children waking up in the garden
that's been underway, being

696
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:55,360
developed for billions of years.
We just are beginning to wake up

697
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:01,440
to what's going on, to who we
are, to what's happening. We

698
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,760
really are like children in in
the playpen, but where I think

699
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,580
we're about to get out of the
playpen, I think we're about to

700
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:13,020
walk I think we're about to
become mature adults.

701
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,200
Sandy Sedgbeer: You feel that
there is an urgent need to get

702
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:25,160
psychedelics back on the table
so that their efficacy can be

703
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,260
proven, and we can start
adopting them as a way of

704
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:36,260
helping people to, you know,
heal their wounds and hopefully

705
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,600
evolve even more quickly.

706
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,340
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think so. I
think they're very valuable

707
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,000
substance, and fortunately, we
are reclaiming them after our 40

708
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,920
year interruption. Because these
are amplifiers of consciousness.

709
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,200
Everything hinges on how we use
those hours of amplification. If

710
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,680
we use those hours of
amplification carefully and

711
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,860
wisely, then these these
substances can help us heal the

712
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:09,660
wounds of life. We can go deeper
than that. These substances can

713
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,920
help us recover the insights of
our true nature, of our

714
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,060
essential nature, of our
fundamental core identity with

715
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:24,800
all other life forms. They open
up spiritual platforms within a

716
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:29,660
sec. I think that psychedelics
have a profound philosophical

717
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,240
significance. This is a
different way of doing

718
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,380
philosophy, where we
systematically temporarily

719
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,620
expand our mind and then come
back and then write it down, and

720
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:46,300
then analyze and crunch our
experiences and compare them to

721
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:51,280
other people's experiences. One
person's experiences are never

722
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,900
important by themselves. It's
when we get many, many people's

723
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,740
experiences and put them all on
the table together and begin to

724
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,480
find out where the common ground
is. What are the common themes

725
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,560
that emerge? That's where we
begin to develop a truly

726
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,900
trustable epistemology, a
trustable set of insights into

727
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,620
what's going on. So I think
these are enormously valuable.

728
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,540
They have to be used very
carefully. They should be used

729
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:25,460
with great respect. When one
amplifies one consciousness, the

730
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,180
dirt comes out of the system,
and if you're not prepared to

731
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,480
meet that dirt, or you open up
under wrong circumstances, it

732
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,440
can be terrifying. You can do
dangerous things, but if you've

733
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,100
taken all the precautions and
you open up under the right

734
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,560
circumstances, there is nothing
that comes out that can't be

735
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:50,500
beneficial if you face it with
courage and with grounding and

736
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,940
with skill. And I think we are
we are now training the next

737
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,360
generation of psychedelic
therapists. We are training

738
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,640
people to help other. People use
these substances beneficially?

739
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,880
Sandy Sedgbeer: Well, of course,
you know, back in the 60s, there

740
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,560
was a move. A lot of people were
involved in doing experiments

741
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,860
with these to find out how they
could be useful to humanity, and

742
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,780
they got shut down. Are you
hopeful that this time we will

743
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,820
be able to move forward with
this and find the benefits and

744
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,700
allow people to benefit.

745
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,180
Chris Bache: I hope so. That
seems to be where we're going.

746
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,720
The psychedelic Renaissance is
really focused on personal

747
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,400
healing and by treating the
conditions that are generated by

748
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,840
modern culture, post traumatic
stress disorder, depression,

749
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:48,160
addiction, death, anxiety, we're
using scientific methodologies

750
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,540
and carefully framed studies in
order to document the beneficial

751
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,860
effect of these substances. Now,
once we do that, once we

752
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:01,680
establish them and bring them
back as legitimate subjects for

753
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,560
discussion in scientific and
just educated society. Then I

754
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,520
think we'll be going into the
next second and third levels,

755
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,120
where we'll begin to realize
that these capacities, these

756
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,080
substances, not only heal, have
the capacity to heal, but they

757
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,600
have the capacity to reveal, to
open, to illumine. Now

758
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,660
civilizations have known
Indigenous peoples have known

759
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:33,080
this for millennia. Ayahuasca is
used in South America going back

760
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:38,660
at least 1500 years. Peyote,
Mescaline, mushrooms, indigenous

761
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:43,600
people have been using these
substances to open up spiritual

762
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:49,360
communion. For millennia, we're
catching up, and so therefore

763
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:54,400
the indigenous people really are
our teachers in how to use these

764
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,720
substances wisely.

765
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:01,560
Sandy Sedgbeer: Do you ever
wonder, why you Why did you have

766
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,560
this experience and not someone
else?

767
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:14,580
Chris Bache: Well, first, many
people have used these

768
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:18,060
substances wisely and have had
these and types of these

769
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:22,160
experiences. So I'm just a
representative of a whole social

770
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,960
movement, and maybe I pushed the
edge harder than most, and maybe

771
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,360
I because of my training, maybe
I wrote it down and and analyzed

772
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,440
it and kind of worked out the
details more than most. But I

773
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,360
don't see myself as unique in
any way. I see myself as part of

774
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:45,580
a social movement. When I got
out of graduate school and I met

775
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:49,360
Stan Grof work. As soon as I met
his work, I said I knew this was

776
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:54,880
my work. This was my calling. It
was just it woke up inside why

777
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,140
that was the case. Eventually,
it really came back to decisions

778
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,540
that were made when I was in the
Bardo before I incarnated, what

779
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:08,460
my soul's work was going to be,
and my soul's work really was

780
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:13,380
very much around education and
very much around healing, but

781
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:18,600
not psychotherapeutic healing
one on one, but really engaging

782
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,160
healing at a very Deep
collective level. And I think

783
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,360
that there are many, many people
working at this level. I think

784
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,720
there are many hidden saints
working to bring about the birth

785
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,200
of the huge human I think there
are many Bodhisattvas in the

786
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,380
world. Some of them are
recognized and most of them are

787
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:41,020
not recognized. But who really
are they invest their life and

788
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:44,740
bringing about the
transformation of the lives of

789
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,000
others, of helping others and
helping us make it through this

790
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,200
crisis of that we are entering
into, the global systems crisis,

791
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,920
the ecological crisis, as it
bearing down on us, it's going

792
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,640
to take all of us, I think All
of us chose to be here at the

793
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,240
time and the form that we
incarnated. I think there are no

794
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:11,040
victims, there are no there is
no compulsion and reincarnation.

795
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:16,140
We all chose to enter this time
in history. We we may not

796
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:20,420
remember why, but we chose to be

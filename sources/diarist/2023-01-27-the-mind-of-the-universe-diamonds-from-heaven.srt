1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,180
Aviv Shahar: Central to the
portals project is the inquiry

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,480
about the future and the
evolutionary change underway. We

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,960
seek to perceive what is
emerging at the edge of the

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,080
human experience, to de code and
integrate insights about how we

5
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,960
humans are evolving through this
liminal transition. Chris Bache

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,200
is a professor emeritus in the
Department of Philosophy and

7
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,640
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University, where he

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,920
taught for 33 years a fellow at
the Institute of Noetic

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,160
Sciences. Chris is the author of
the living classroom teaching

10
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,760
and collective consciousness,
and of dark night, early dawn,

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:11,100
Steps to a deep ecology of mind.
And his third book, LSD and the

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,960
mind of the universe, diamonds
from heaven, where Chris

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,700
describes his 20 years of
intensive work through 73 LSD

14
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,500
sessions in the interest of
transparency, I have never

15
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,820
touched LSD and never touched
any psychedelic or any mushroom.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,840
My own 42 years of Journey to
unlock the universal human

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,240
potential was centered on the
premise that the human brain,

18
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,100
when we are open to the blessing
realms, is the most advanced

19
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,460
chemistry and pharmaceutical
production unit in the universe.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,620
And I've applied my spiritual
and development search in ways

21
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,620
that promote naturally arising
states and inner conductivity.

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,040
So we are not here to recommend
that you should do anything.

23
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,160
I've invited Chris because Chris
of your rigor and Focused

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,040
Inquiry, which are profound, and
your account where you frame

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,640
insights and perspectives that
are of great interest as we seek

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,020
to appreciate what is emerging
at the edge of human

27
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,540
consciousness. Chris, welcome.

28
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,719
Chris Bache: Thank you, Aviv,
it's a real pleasure to be here

29
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,559
with you today.

30
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,720
Aviv Shahar: So you have already
lived several lifetimes in this

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,060
one life, you've had a full
academic career. You published

32
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,000
three books. You've raised a
family and three children, and

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,460
alongside all of this, you've
done this intense 20 years

34
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,100
research work. So let me first
ask, what is the portal you are

35
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,600
in right now? What is the
inquiry you're working on at

36
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,200
this time.

37
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,239
Chris Bache: Well, when I
published LSD in the mind of the

38
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,239
universe, or, as I prefer to
call it, diamonds from heaven,

39
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,339
that's its name for me, when I
published that, I felt like I

40
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:17,879
had accomplished my life's work.
I mean, after a long career of

41
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,939
teaching as a philosopher of
religion, this was my most

42
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:28,099
important gift to the history of
philosophical inquiry into the

43
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:32,659
deep structure of existence. And
that brought with it a

44
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,339
tremendous sense of closure and
relaxation. And since the book

45
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:41,139
has come out into the world
three years ago, now, just about

46
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,499
three years, I've just been
content to follow the book out

47
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:49,539
into the world and to follow
into conversations that people

48
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:53,079
want to have around the issues
that have come up with the book.

49
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:59,859
I don't have any agenda. I don't
have any felt need to achieve

50
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:05,939
anything. I have moved to North
Carolina in the last three

51
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,379
years, and so I've been doing a
lot of yard work. My hands are

52
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,719
in the soil, and all those basic
things. I have children and

53
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,499
grandchildren that I love to
stay in touch with as often as I

54
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:23,119
can. They live farther away.
They're not close by, so that

55
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:30,439
takes some work. So I'm kind of
growing old in a comfortable

56
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:37,399
place. I am cultivating a form
of a way of spiritual practice

57
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:44,619
that builds upon the systematic
remembering of the experiences

58
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:52,659
that I had on the 73 days
covered in my book. And those

59
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:58,899
are living memories for me, and
I'm experimenting with how to

60
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:05,099
use those memories. Memories to
more deeply absorb and integrate

61
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:10,679
the realities that I touched
very intimately on those session

62
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,459
days.

63
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,079
Aviv Shahar: So we will pick up
this thread, which is

64
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,479
fascinating. You're describing a
condition where a memory is not

65
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,279
frozen in time, it's a living
stream of intelligence that

66
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,939
continues to inform you, even
into into the here and now, and

67
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:35,359
we will pick this up as we
unfold the conversation in his

68
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:41,379
forward to your book. Irwin
Laszlo writes this is one of the

69
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:46,779
most insightful and significant
books I have ever read. But to

70
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,619
understand its significance, one
must be willing to entertain

71
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:55,959
three premises. A, there is an
intelligence behind the things

72
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:01,319
that exist in the universe. B,
that there is purpose exhibited

73
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:07,919
by this intelligence, and see
that it is humanly possible to

74
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,779
access some elements of this
intelligence and learn some

75
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,759
aspects of its purpose. So I'm
interested, given the way you're

76
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,959
describing where you are, how is
this deliberation unfolding for

77
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,879
you in terms of your belief,
your feeling about these three

78
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,959
premises, a that the universe is
an intelligent place, that there

79
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:36,979
is an inherent or latent
purpose, and that we actually

80
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:41,859
have, as humans, the capacity to
unpack or to connect or to de

81
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,599
code. Both

82
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:53,379
Chris Bache: those premises are
absolutely foundational to my

83
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:58,659
lived reality these days, the
worldview that I was educated in

84
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:02,579
in graduate school is the
scientific worldview, or the

85
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,719
early 20th century scientific
worldview, that the world is

86
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:12,059
basically a fantastic machine.
It has no innate intelligence.

87
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:15,479
Intelligence is lucky accident
that sprung up somewhere along

88
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,919
the way, that our existence is
accidental. It's not purposive,

89
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,099
and that when we die, when our
brain ceases to function

90
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:27,739
correctly, then our
consciousness disappears, and we

91
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,519
so there is no existential
meaning or significance to our

92
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,079
lives. And all of those
assumptions have been overturned

93
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:41,379
in my psychedelic work, what I
found is that by dissolving into

94
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,899
the deeper levels of my own
mind, I opened beyond my own

95
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,279
personal existence into the mind
of the universe itself. And in

96
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,059
that process, repeatedly, over
and over again, through many

97
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:59,379
years, came into communion with
an intelligence that was

98
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,919
profound, just extraordinarily
brilliant and vast beyond

99
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:10,739
imagination and compassionate
beyond measure. And so returning

100
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:15,539
to that intelligence and
drinking from it and being

101
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,499
willing to undergo very
challenging processes of

102
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:24,799
initiation, but always being
rewarded with deeper intimacy

103
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:28,999
with this intelligence that the
universe I now live in is

104
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:33,439
saturated with intelligence at
all the levels I can see and at

105
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:38,899
levels I can't see. The world I
live in, intellectually and

106
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,839
emotionally, is a world of
genius unfolding itself

107
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,019
systematically over vast epics
of time, and it's also a world

108
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:55,059
in which humanity's
participation in this creative

109
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:59,679
endeavor is not a participation
that's limited to 100 year

110
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,599
lifetime or one single lifetime,
but it's a participation that

111
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:07,859
continues lifetime after
lifetime after lifetime through

112
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,719
the process that we classically
have known as reincarnation. But

113
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:17,159
it's larger than that. It's that
our entire species and the

114
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:20,359
development of this planet and
this solar system in this

115
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:25,639
galaxy, is all part of an
exquisite, purposeful,

116
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:32,599
systematic unfolding of the
creative power of this creative

117
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:35,959
intelligence. And I hesitate to
call it God or call it the

118
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,739
divine, because as a professor
of religious studies, I know how

119
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:42,819
that word has been used, and I
know what it has come to mean in

120
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:46,239
different cultures around the
world. And while part of it is

121
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,959
good and beautiful, so many
other parts of it are limiting.

122
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:54,819
So I prefer to speak in terms of
the creative intelligence of the

123
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:59,919
universe, the intelligence that
is behind existence and the.

124
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,419
Intelligence that is inside
existence, expressing itself in

125
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,799
the complexity of life.

126
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,240
Aviv Shahar: So in many ways,
you have just given us the

127
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,340
condensed preview version of the
the everything we are about to

128
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,000
unfold in the next hour and so
on, which is beautiful. It's

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,160
exactly what, what I was hoping
we can do give, give the people

130
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,940
that join us a sense on the
front end of what we are about

131
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,480
to unfold in, in the way you
just described that. You were

132
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,220
again describing three layers
there as as you talked about,

133
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,940
first making contact with this
intelligence, appreciating this

134
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,380
intelligence, and then you're
describing that as you engage

135
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,580
with that intelligence, there is
an aspect of communion, a fuller

136
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,900
whole person experience, and
then the deeper inside that you

137
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,840
discover the sense of compassion
and intimacy. So and you say

138
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,700
that the universe is interested
in our experience of it. What do

139
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,100
you believe about why that is
the case?

140
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,160
Chris Bache: Well, first of all,
part of my experience has been

141
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,180
the classic teaching in some of
the Eastern traditions that the

142
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,720
essence of the individual is the
same as the essence of the

143
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,200
totality that Atman is Brahman,
that our our nature is the

144
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,000
nature of the Divine, which is
the nature of reality itself. So

145
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,500
it's not completely true to
think of this in terms of a

146
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,800
duality between me and it at a
deeper level, my being is a

147
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:47,920
fractal emanation, manifestation
of its reality, of its truth. So

148
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:55,360
our relationship is, it's deeply
essential and mutually

149
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,860
participating right from the
start, but in terms of function,

150
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,320
in terms of Chris Bache, his
actual function, I am so small

151
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,740
and it is so vast, that
relatively speaking, there's a

152
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,080
relative duality involved. And
of course, it's not just the

153
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,340
small bit and the totality, but
between the totality and my

154
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,180
little small bit, there's layers
and layers and layers and

155
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,740
layers. It's a very, very
complex, organic system of

156
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:31,820
massive scale. So my to get to
the focus of your question, my

157
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,760
experience has been that as I
went through my spiritual work,

158
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,040
and went through my spiritual
practice, psychedelic practice,

159
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,660
and went through the initiations
and the cycles of death and

160
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,940
rebirth that I'm sure we'll talk
to later, and opened into

161
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,120
periods where I would spend
hours absorbed in communion and

162
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,760
dialog or with this
intelligence, and then, as I

163
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,860
would begin to get smaller and
come back into my normal shape

164
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,300
and size, so there was a window
that would open and stay open

165
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,260
for hours, and then a window
that would close, I repeatedly

166
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,900
had the sense of that This
intelligence was so pleased to

167
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:28,760
have this opportunity to share,
to commune, to convey it, not

168
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,880
just not with me, but with
humanity as a whole, that we are

169
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,680
just getting after 13 point 7
billion years, we are just

170
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,620
getting able to begin to
embrace, to open Up to the scale

171
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:47,680
of the intelligence of the
universe, so that for 13 point 7

172
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,240
billion years, this intelligence
has been creating this universe,

173
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,760
this magnificent garden, and
holding it while we evolve

174
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,940
slowly to the point where we can
just begin to become aware of

175
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:09,300
what it has been doing, and it
seems to be so pleased to be

176
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,620
able to share consciously, what
it has previously been

177
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,600
constructing unconsciously,

178
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,720
Aviv Shahar: the idea of seeing
ourselves as a fractal of the

179
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,620
whole inside a nested reality
that is interpenetrating.

180
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,320
Carries some some powerful
propositions and ideas that we

181
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,540
will unfold and you unfold in
your book. Because what it says

182
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,540
is that as I change in myself as
you change in yourself, because

183
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,260
we are a fractal of the whole
we, in some way, facilitate and

184
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,480
catalyze a bigger change. So we
are participant to this

185
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,160
unfolding, gigantic story that
you are describing.

186
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,920
Chris Bache: Absolutely we are
participants. We are an

187
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,580
expression of the creative
process. We are continuance of

188
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,360
the creative process, and we are
learning to be generators, more

189
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,260
and more conscious generators of
the creative process.

190
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,500
Aviv Shahar: Yes. So would it be
right to say that when you

191
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,080
suggest and when we contemplate
that the universe is interested

192
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,600
in us, in humanity, that it's a
form of the universe, interest

193
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,520
in itself, in its own evolution,
that it comes to experience

194
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,940
through its beloved human I

195
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,180
Chris Bache: think so. I think
that's, you know, that's widely

196
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,940
viewed insight in many of the
mystical traditions of the

197
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:49,540
world, that there's a deep
collaboration. And the in this

198
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,700
intelligence is interested in
its expansion, and we are, in

199
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,660
some ways, at this point in
time, one of the cutting edges

200
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,200
of its expansion, its learning

201
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,840
Aviv Shahar: well, so let's
begin to explore a little into

202
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,040
and through the journey. Just
there to pick up on your

203
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,940
description that we are at the
leading edge of something that's

204
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,440
evolving through this universe,
and you describe in Session Six,

205
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,200
the vast community of explorers.
And you write, I experienced

206
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,360
explorers in different fields of
learning as part of a vast

207
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
cooperative enterprise. What do
you believe about and how did

208
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,800
you experience then and when you
reflect now on this community of

209
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,480
explorers, and I get the visual
sense of people who are in

210
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,560
different spaces and domains
right at the edge, the cutting

211
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,520
edge of discovery.

212
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,120
Chris Bache: Well, you know, as
I was first trained as an

213
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,700
historian, and then as in
philosophy of religion. And so I

214
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,600
spent, you know, years and years
and years studying some of the

215
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,220
great thinkers in history in
these fields. And so I had a

216
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,100
real sense of great beings and
great autobiographies who have

217
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,260
contributed systematically to
the tapestry of learning that I

218
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,660
was an inheritor of in various
ways, and this session was

219
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:34,700
really about it was helping
liberate me from a felt sense of

220
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,080
responsibility to The
intellectual lineages that I had

221
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,460
been educated into. It was as if
I was above the earth, and I was

222
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,020
watching these beings through
time, through history, do make

223
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,580
their great contributions to art
and literature and science and

224
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,260
philosophy and theology, and
usually I would be just

225
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,440
intimidated by, you know,
genius, you know how great they

226
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,920
were. But here I felt myself as
a young learner, entering the

227
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,120
company of older learners and
entering into the fellowship of

228
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:23,360
learning. But then the next step
was I came to see I was given a

229
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,600
survey of all the knowledge that
I had acquired through all the

230
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,320
years of college and graduate
school, and I was given a series

231
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,040
of lessons which taught me the
incompleteness of this

232
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:40,040
knowledge. And then I was shown
a new way of doing philosophy

233
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,440
that was opening in my life with
this work, and I believe that

234
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,120
psychedelics represent a
revolution in the way of doing

235
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,560
philosophy, not just certain
insights into consciousness, but

236
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,120
how philosophy can be done and
and this new way is to first

237
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,040
systematic, systematically
expand the boundaries of

238
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,060
experience to enter into
Non-ordinary states of

239
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,300
consciousness, which, of course,
humanity has been doing for

240
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,220
1000s and 1000s of years through
meditation, yoga, Transcendence,

241
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,060
and also psychedelics, but
moving into non ordinary state

242
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,540
of consciousness, in my case
with psychedelics, paying very

243
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,660
careful and critical attention
to what happens in those

244
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,840
experiences, come back and
record them very precisely, as

245
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,300
exactly as possible, within 24
hours, and then to reflect on

246
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,260
them, to integrate them, To
integrate them with bodies of

247
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,440
knowledge and other disciplines,
and to compare them to the

248
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,880
experiences that other people
are having in these states, and

249
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,840
by systematically expanding and
contracting consciousness in

250
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,180
this way, but not just having
interesting experiences, but

251
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,340
intellectually digesting the.
Experiences, internalizing those

252
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,640
experiences. What I think we're
able to do is that we can begin

253
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,420
to think about things and to
understand things and talk about

254
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,580
things that previously most
human beings could never talk

255
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,080
about, could never envision,
only the most sophisticated

256
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,280
mystics in the most esoteric
traditions could have access to

257
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,760
some of these domains, but with
psychedelics, if they are

258
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,720
handled responsibly and
conscientiously, even a modest a

259
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,200
person of modest means can have
access to this reality, these

260
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,380
realities, and begin to
understand some of the workings

261
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,800
of the universe that are
revealed through these states.

262
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,600
Because as our as our mind,
changes its sensitivity, we

263
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,400
begin to be able to experience
different aspects of the cosmos.

264
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,740
So it's like the color spectrum.
We see a certain portion of the

265
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,940
visible spectrum, but when we
could slide our our awareness to

266
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,520
a different portion of the
spectrum, A Different World of

267
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,160
Color opens to us the same way
with consciousness. So what I

268
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,560
what this session gave me, was
intellectual permission to not

269
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:31,280
try to prove everything to the
satisfaction of my peers, but to

270
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,600
rather begin a new methodology
in philosophy that may not be

271
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,180
recognized for generations and
it would take the rest of my

272
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,960
life to really carry out, and
that's why I did this work for

273
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,040
20 years of psychedelic
exploration, and then I spent

274
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,480
another 20 years thinking about
and digesting those experiences

275
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,700
before publishing diamonds from
heaven.

276
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,600
Aviv Shahar: Would it be correct
to say that so in any of the

277
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,780
pathways to altered states that
whatever we come into contact

278
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,160
with, whether you view it as a
stream of intelligence, or

279
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,900
whatever way you frame this,
that it depends still on the

280
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,000
frame of reference that you have
cultivated before. So in your

281
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,760
case, your various studies and
research and work in Philosophy

282
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,240
and Religion provided, in a way,
inner scaffolds, inner

283
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,080
structures for the experience
that you were going through by

284
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,980
way of translation. That is to
say, if somebody else showed up

285
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,320
adjacent through an adjacent
experience, but with different

286
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,200
scaffolds, with different inner
topography, they would be

287
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,980
interpreting their experience
possibly differently. Would you

288
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,820
how would you restate what I'm
trying to get to and sense there

289
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,240
Chris Bache: good point and
really an important thing to

290
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,020
consider. It's not just the
question is not just whether

291
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,020
they would interpret their
experiences differently, but

292
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,140
would they actually be having
different experiences because

293
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,220
their conditioning was different
going into the experiences? This

294
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,360
is a discussion that I've had
with Ken ring, one of the

295
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,500
founders of near death episode
research, and the author of a

296
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,180
number of books, and he and I
published our dialog around this

297
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,520
particular point in an article
called are deep psychedelic

298
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,780
experiences trustable? Do they
simply reflect the conditioning

299
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,920
of the personal psyche or the
even the collective psyche, or

300
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,620
do they actually go beyond one's
conditioning and give us access

301
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,480
to something truly veridical
about the universe? And I want

302
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,700
to be I want to honor both sides
of this discussion, because I

303
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,780
subscribe to what some have
called a participatory model of

304
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,520
spiritual experience, which
means these experiences are not

305
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,760
like apples hanging on the
cosmic tree that you just reach

306
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,820
up and pluck and they're just
there for the taking, and

307
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,460
anybody can reach up and pluck
them, and it's there for the

308
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:18,540
taking. It's a much more complex
dynamic that's involved, but,

309
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,740
and I'll explain that in a
minute, but first, I want to say

310
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,620
that my conditioning was
shattered again and again and

311
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,640
again as I took this journey.
And I think that's true for

312
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,960
people who work systematically
with these states, that in the

313
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,800
beginning, our conditioning has
a strong coloring and shaping

314
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,880
the role, and simply our
personal history has a shaping

315
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,740
role, but very quickly, after
several years, you reach a point

316
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,420
where you get past all the
conditioning that you've had,

317
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,440
even. From birth forward, and
you're you're you literally your

318
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,500
entire physical existence
collapses, and in that collapse,

319
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,300
one moves beyond territory that
you've ever known intellectually

320
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,920
are the I think my My academic
background helped me understand

321
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,960
what I was experiencing, but did
not structure what I was

322
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,740
experiencing. I was often wished
that I had PhDs in in physics

323
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,320
and astrophysics, and
particularly to better

324
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,900
understand some of the phenomena
that I was being shown. But

325
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,620
instead of picking an apple from
a tree, I think it's something

326
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:50,860
like this, as I have experienced
it, the mind of the cosmos. The

327
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,640
mind of the universe is an
infinite lake of infinite

328
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,860
potential capable of giving us
infinite variety of experiences.

329
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,680
And our mind acts like a seed
catalyst that we drop it into

330
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,420
this infinite potential, and it
catalyzes a certain response, a

331
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,600
certain set of experiences which
reflect that seed crystal. As we

332
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,740
internalize those experiences,
we go through a process of

333
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,080
purification and transformation,
which changes the nature of our

334
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,700
individual consciousness, so
that later, when we return to

335
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,420
that infinite lake where the
seed crystal that we drop into

336
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,460
it has been changed, expanded,
and it precipitates a different

337
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,440
set of experiences out of its
infinite potential. This is what

338
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,700
I mean by it's a participatory
cosmology, a participatory

339
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:52,300
model. And it's not that our our
consciousness, creates or

340
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,620
dictates what emerges. It's just
that there is a complicated

341
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,840
feedback process that's going
and the more we go into this,

342
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,000
the more we do it, the more new
and new and new frontiers begin

343
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,200
to open that are far beyond
anything we could imagine,

344
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,120
beyond anything, even against
many of the things that we've

345
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,080
been taught. It's just it's new
territory, and then comes the

346
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,320
task of trying to make sense of
what it was that you experience.

347
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:30,140
And these experiences are kind
of sequential. It's like

348
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,240
exploring new territory. So one
experience leads to another,

349
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,060
which leads to another, which
leads to another in a complex,

350
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:43,240
overlapping manner. So in the
end, you have to examine the

351
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,260
structure of the whole
trajectory of experiences,

352
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,800
because it's like a giant jigsaw
puzzle to puzzle.

353
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:57,100
Aviv Shahar: Yeah, there is a
potent way you describe the very

354
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,620
thing you just painted for us
when you talk about the

355
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:07,740
foundation of teaching that
finds you in session 16, which

356
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,480
you call self generating fields
of experience. And you write, we

357
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,100
are self generating fields of
energy in a living universe. We

358
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,080
generate energy by making
choices, and the universe

359
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,020
responds to this energy. That's
what you were just describing

360
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,760
with a lake in complex and
subtle ways. We are always

361
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,080
creating our own experience. And
then you add, we control the

362
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:39,080
flow of energy out from and back
into our lives. What comes to us

363
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,080
from without originates from
within. The more one moves

364
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,460
towards one's center and engages
the deeper levels of one's

365
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,060
conditioning, the more one
becomes conscious of being the

366
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,300
source of one's experience. I
suppose that's what you were

367
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,500
describing now in in the way
that insight continues to evolve

368
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,460
with you. It's a powerful
synthesizing of the human

369
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,360
journey, whether you do any
psychedelics or not, because

370
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,580
that insight is true in the in
the normal day to day

371
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,520
consciousness, you don't need to
be in an altered state to

372
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,040
realize it and or you can
discover the edge of your own

373
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:28,460
experience and realize that you
actually are the catalyst of

374
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,620
what it is that the universe
brings to you

375
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,560
Chris Bache: absolutely this.
I'd like to I really hope that

376
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,220
what I've shared in this book is
used by and is useful to people

377
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,060
who never take a psychedelic
whatsoever, because, in the end,

378
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,560
psychedelics are not critical.
My understanding is that

379
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,400
psychedelics, and particularly
the psychedelic that I used in

380
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,560
my work, LSD, is an amplifier of
consciousness. It does not give

381
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,120
you any. Specific experiences.
It's not a hallucinogen. It

382
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,680
doesn't give you false visions.
It amplifies consciousness. It's

383
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,600
all it does, how you use that
amplified consciousness, how you

384
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,900
care, take it, how you protect
it, isolate it, internalize it,

385
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,660
meditate with it, and engage
your mind during those hours of

386
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:28,160
hypersensitivity is what
determines the quality of the

387
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,980
perception that emerges from
that dialog. So many people have

388
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,700
written me and they said, I've
never taken a psychedelic in my

389
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,860
life. I've been meditating for
40 years. I understand what

390
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,100
you're writing about. It really
parallels my own experience and

391
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,660
my own spiritual practice. And I
say yes, because it's not about

392
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,260
psychedelics. What we're
exploring is the nature of

393
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,960
consciousness to reveal the
deeper truths of its own being

394
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,500
and of the universe. And so this
idea that we are self generating

395
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,880
fields of experience is an
ancient idea. I mean, it really

396
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,500
is at the core of the belief in
karma and rebirth that we are,

397
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,540
it's we are a learning system.
We are born in circumstances of

398
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,060
our choosing, of our destiny. We
make choices in response to

399
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:28,160
those circumstances. We learn in
response to those circumstances

400
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,900
and and in that process, we are
changed. And when we die, that

401
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,680
process doesn't end, but it
continues. And so what I was

402
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,760
experiencing was simply an L, an
escalated and intensified vision

403
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,340
of that ancient teaching.

404
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,520
Aviv Shahar: You then describe,
later a cosmic tour, and you say

405
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,480
that for several hours, the
consciousness that accompanied

406
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,860
you took you on a tour of the
universe to show you its work,

407
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,780
and that it brought an
overwhelming sense of

408
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,700
Homecoming. What did you
discover about the universe

409
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,120
through this tour, and what was
the sense of Homecoming?

410
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,240
Chris Bache: Well, this was my
19th session, so by this time, I

411
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:29,420
was about 334, years into the
work, and I had gone through ego

412
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,560
death, and I had entered into
what in the book I described as

413
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:40,160
the ocean of suffering, kind of
a the hell realms of of the

414
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,840
collective psyche, the where the
collective psyche stores, it's,

415
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,280
it's, it's, most torturous
memories of the history of the

416
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:55,180
species. And I had navigated
that, and as almost a the gift

417
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:02,220
or the grace of because I had
volunteered to participate in a

418
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,940
in a healing of some aspect of
the collective psyche. The

419
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,440
universe gave me this gift, many
gifts at that time, and one of

420
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,720
them was this cosmic tour where
it would take me. This is where

421
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,520
I wish I had degrees in physics
so I would be able to concretize

422
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,020
or conceptualize some of the
things it was showing me, but

423
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:29,840
over and over again, it took me
and showed me some aspect of our

424
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,200
cosmic reality and overwhelm. I
was overwhelmed repeatedly by

425
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,140
the genius of it, by the
intelligence of it, by the

426
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,920
intentionality of it. It taught
me a lot about reincarnation. It

427
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,340
taught me about the
reincarnation patterns of our

428
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,240
species, not just individuals,
but of the dynamics of

429
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,660
collective reincarnation. It
took me into some of the

430
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:01,800
formation structures of
galaxies. And then I'm not, not

431
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,200
sure whether it was this, this
particular part, or in the

432
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,180
immediately next it it took me,
I would go through a succession

433
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:14,160
of death and rebirth processes
internal to this tour. And it

434
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,000
took me into deeper and deeper
levels of ontological

435
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,060
simplicity, and I began to
experience a deeper and deeper

436
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Quiet, quiet beyond any quiet I
had ever imagined. And

437
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,220
saturating the silence was a
sense of Homecoming, deeper and

438
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,660
deeper levels of Homecoming. And
at one particular transition, I

439
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:45,640
went into this extraordinary
piece, extraordinary homecoming.

440
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:52,120
And I was overwhelmed by how sad
it was that we had lost contact

441
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:59,500
with this innate quality of our
own being at this cosmic level

442
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,980
of. Yeah. And I asked what, what
had happened? And it said this

443
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:11,460
voice that was accom, that the
consciousness I was with said we

444
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,840
had left time. We left time. And
then it said we never intended

445
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,480
so many to get caught in time.
It was as if linear time was

446
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,380
simply one of the experiments
that the universe was having. So

447
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,300
somehow moving deeper into home
also meant moving beyond the

448
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,740
conditions of space and time. So
this was a universe, a tour, not

449
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,520
only of the physical universe,
but it was a tour of the levels

450
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,580
of reality behind the universe
that kind of give birth to space

451
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,500
and time itself. And we come
from these realities. Our

452
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,820
substance is made from these
realities. So we participate

453
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,600
inside the divine creation of
space and time as a spiritual

454
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,480
being who was rooted in these
spiritual realities,

455
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,140
Aviv Shahar: and we will get
further to both the divine

456
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:16,200
reality and the various cycles
of death and rebirth. But just

457
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,560
to pick where you started, there
the sense of suffering that you

458
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,760
were describing. What do you
understand? Stepping back and

459
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,160
looking at the way you interpret
the experience, what do you

460
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,500
understand to be the
significance of suffering in the

461
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,740
place of suffering in the
evolutionary process? Why is

462
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,720
suffering part of the
evolutionary process?

463
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:43,179
Chris Bache: That really is a
core question, isn't it? It's a

464
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:48,639
deep question, and it's a hard
question to answer without

465
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,019
preparing the ground well, and
preparing the ground well would

466
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:56,499
take much longer than we have
room for here, so I'm going to

467
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:59,079
have to take shortcuts, and I'm
going to have to ask the

468
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:06,839
indulgence of your listener,
during the same period of the

469
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,079
cosmic tour, During the same
year, when I was being given a

470
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,119
crash course in cosmology, 101,
I was taken back to what

471
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,379
appeared to be the beginning of
creation itself, the Beginning

472
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:23,719
of Time and Space, and I
experienced an overwhelming

473
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:30,859
love, just completely saturating
me and just overwhelming me. It

474
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:37,579
was a cosmic love. And then I
experienced all of evolution,

475
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:42,339
the birth of space and time, and
all the evolution of space and

476
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:48,459
time taking place inside this
love, and this love was holding

477
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:54,399
it and guiding it. And I,
because of experiences that I

478
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:58,659
had had, I knew that evolution
involved tremendous suffering,

479
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:02,639
terrible suffering, not just for
the human race, but for species

480
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,419
up and down the evolutionary
line. But let's just focus on

481
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:10,619
the human race. I knew history,
and I knew how much harm we had

482
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,979
done to each other and how much
harm the planet had done to us,

483
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:17,639
and how much suffering was
involved. And in this

484
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:24,259
experience, I experienced all of
this suffering as something that

485
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:31,699
humanity had taken on, as by
free choice, and by free choice

486
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:35,359
motivated by the Divine Love of
creation that lies Behind

487
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:42,879
creation, so that the suffering
that is inevitable in an

488
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:46,059
evolutionary project which is
stretched across billions of

489
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:50,559
years, was not something which
was being done to us, it was not

490
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,039
a punishment. It was not being
inflicted on us. It was not the

491
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,999
work of demonic forces, but it
literally was a burden that we

492
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:02,759
had consciously chosen in order
to participate in this creative

493
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:07,919
project. Now, why is there so
much suffering? There are layers

494
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:12,539
and layers of a response to
this. One of them is we make

495
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:15,599
choices. Sometimes we make good
choices, sometimes we make bad

496
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,439
choices. We learn by inheriting
the consequences of those of our

497
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:25,999
choices. And sometimes we
inherit bad consequences from

498
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:29,539
bad choices. But I think the
answer is much deeper. Goes much

499
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:36,739
deeper than that. In order to
understand why human beings

500
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:40,659
suffer, we have to have some
understanding of what a human

501
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:45,039
being is, and, more importantly,
what a human being is becoming.

502
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:49,599
We are not finished as a
species. We are just beginning.

503
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,919
We only develop sufficient
consciousness to to reach our

504
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:59,379
minds down to the source of our
own mind. About 5000 years ago,

505
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:03,839
you. We're going to be evolving
for millions and billions of

506
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,679
years. Yet we are not finished.
We are just getting started.

507
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:12,839
Much of the suffering inherent
in human existence has to do

508
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:17,879
with the unfinished nature of
our own evolutionary process.

509
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:21,619
There will come a time I'm sure
that we will have sufficient

510
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,039
consciousness and sufficient
self control that we will be

511
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:28,999
able to wash disease out of our
body through complete control of

512
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:34,339
our mind. But we're not there
yet. We will be capable of so

513
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:39,139
many things that we are not
capable of now, but that all of

514
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:42,279
the things we are going through
now are part of not only the

515
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:47,439
learning exercise, but the
building exercise of building a

516
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:53,439
form of human being much more
advanced than the form of human

517
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:57,939
being we are today, just as Homo
sapiens is more advanced than

518
00:40:57,939 --> 00:41:01,619
Homo erectus, which is more
advanced than our ancient

519
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:06,839
ancestors in the primate
kingdom. So I think the core,

520
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,159
the deepest level of the answer
to your question, what is the

521
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:16,979
role of suffering in evolution?
The deepest level is that it's

522
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:23,599
simply a burden that we take on
voluntarily to participate in

523
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,579
the joy of creating the
universe, of creating our

524
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:33,439
species in the universe, and
that in the end, it benefits us.

525
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:37,759
It's in some ways, like the
suffering that a woman takes on

526
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:41,319
when she gives birth. She knows
it's coming. She does it

527
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:43,719
voluntarily. It's absolutely
terrible. It's really

528
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,699
horrendous. But when she holds
her child, it's worth it. And I

529
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:52,719
think that's true for evolution
too. There will come a time when

530
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,379
we will have evolved to a point
where we will look back on the

531
00:41:56,379 --> 00:42:00,959
entire history of all that pain,
without diluting it, without

532
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:05,759
denying it, and we will say it
was worth it in order to become

533
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:07,259
what we have become today.

534
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:13,679
Aviv Shahar: So central ethos in
this is recognizing that we are

535
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,339
involved in an unfinished
project. As you say, Evolution

536
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:22,219
The universe is an evolving
unfinished project, and you're

537
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:27,679
making, right there in in your
journey, some potent points

538
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,059
about the cost of existence and
of the physical universe, and in

539
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:36,439
that context, as you just framed
it now, and this entire

540
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:42,639
appreciation of the visible
universe as it contains only

541
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:45,999
small parts of the universe, so
which for us, for all intents

542
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:48,939
and purposes, the dimensions
that you are describing that you

543
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:53,019
said you wish you had
astrophysics in your degrees in

544
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:57,219
education, some of those
dimensions is what scientists

545
00:42:57,219 --> 00:43:03,119
today describe as dark energy
and and dark matter, which I

546
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:07,619
Intuit we can anticipate is a
very crude, primitive definition

547
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:11,159
of the so much more that is
going to be discovered once we

548
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:15,119
are prepared to reintegrate the
greater realities of

549
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,199
consciousness and human
possibility and escape this idea

550
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:24,799
that The universe is a is a
machine that just reproduced the

551
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:30,919
same but as you describe the and
just painted the sense of the

552
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:35,539
physical universe, you're making
a very important point, which is

553
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:39,679
that the universe is not
physical. Universe is not a

554
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:46,839
trap, not a punishment that we
have fallen into of or from, and

555
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:50,499
that there is this purpose
inherent in the totality of

556
00:43:50,499 --> 00:43:55,719
life, which you describe as the
continual transformation, the

557
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:00,839
continual growth. So for me,
what you are describing, there

558
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:06,839
is a lucid and beautiful
distinction about the project,

559
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:11,819
the evolutionary project, which
you just narrated again. What

560
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:18,539
else must we whether you choose
to do any psychedelic or any

561
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,039
other expedition to altered
states. What? What else must we

562
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,219
understand about that
relationship of the universe at

563
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:32,839
large, the physical universe,
and us as agents of the cutting

564
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,759
edge, the leading edge of this
process?

565
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,239
Chris Bache: Boy, you're asking
good questions. Let me. Let me

566
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:45,519
step back and put this in the
context all of the religions of

567
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,299
the last 5000 years, the what I
call the Axial Age, religions

568
00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:54,819
all came into existence, you
know, five 3000 years ago, when

569
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:59,619
we first began to get underneath
our individual consciousness

570
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:02,699
and. Tap into spiritual
consciousness, tap into the

571
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,639
consciousness of the universe,
or the consciousness of the

572
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:10,079
Divine all of the religions of
this era, both Western and

573
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,519
Eastern religions, are examples
of what I would call an up and

574
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:19,259
out cosmology, and I understand
their intention when you begin

575
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:25,759
to experientially touch your
divine essence. It is so much so

576
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:30,799
ecstatic fill, so bliss filled,
so much more satisfying than

577
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:35,839
physical existence, that how
could you not but think that you

578
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,359
belong there more than here? And
so all the theologies that were

579
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:44,619
given birth to in this period
are theologies of return, which

580
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:48,279
basically say we don't belong on
Earth. We belong in heaven,

581
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:52,539
somehow, through some mishap or
some misfortune or punishment,

582
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:57,279
we've here. But what we want to
do is get out of here and get

583
00:45:57,279 --> 00:46:01,139
back to there, and whether it's
by Western concepts of

584
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:06,239
salvation, being saved by faith
are Eastern concepts of

585
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,899
reincarnation, where you evolve,
evolve, evolve, until you wake

586
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:14,279
up spiritually. And when you
wake up, the Hindus say they

587
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:18,599
call that Moksha escape, because
you escape back to spiritual

588
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:24,379
paradise. So the whole agenda of
the Axial Age religions is to

589
00:46:24,379 --> 00:46:29,539
achieve some type of catharsis
which allows you to abandon time

590
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:33,679
and space and to return home.
But that leaves open the

591
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,779
fundamental question, what is
the purpose of time and space?

592
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:42,459
What is the purpose of the
entire created order. When we

593
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:46,179
were thinking that the universe
might be only 6000 years old, as

594
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:51,699
many of we did in ancient times,
you might justify an up and out

595
00:46:51,699 --> 00:46:56,079
cosmology. But now that we
understand much more how big our

596
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,479
universe is, how old it is, and
how brilliant it is, and how

597
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:04,859
filled with genius, the idea
that spiritual awakeness,

598
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:11,219
spiritual fruition should result
in leaving the physical universe

599
00:47:11,399 --> 00:47:14,819
just doesn't ring true as
powerful. It doesn't have the

600
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:18,839
same appeal. And I think what's
happening is we are now growing

601
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:24,319
up enough to recognize the to
understand that first vision,

602
00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:28,759
but to see that it's actually a
very incomplete cosmology,

603
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:34,159
because now we're beginning to
understand that the the next

604
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:40,219
step after waking up, or the
step of waking up To the reality

605
00:47:40,219 --> 00:47:44,439
of one's divine nature and the
CO participation, the

606
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:49,119
coexistence of divinity and
physicality, and physicality

607
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,679
itself as an aspect of divinity.
Then that opens up the

608
00:47:53,679 --> 00:48:00,959
possibility of waking up and
then bringing heaven to earth,

609
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:05,819
bringing truly the ecstatic
experience, the ecstatic

610
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:11,699
experience of heavenly
consciousness inside, into time,

611
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:18,839
space, reality and building and
truly shaping the physical world

612
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:24,919
In a way to be a reflection and
an embodiment of spiritual

613
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:30,439
Paradise, and that's where we
find the importance of emergent

614
00:48:30,439 --> 00:48:36,499
spirituality, of a of a embodied
spirituality, this theme which

615
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:39,799
is becoming more and more
prevalent. It's not an escapist

616
00:48:39,799 --> 00:48:44,439
spirituality, it's an embodied
spirituality. And psychedelics,

617
00:48:44,439 --> 00:48:47,679
if they give us a sensitivity,
it's not about getting up and

618
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,699
out. It's really about getting
more and more deeply within, to

619
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:55,179
open up, to bring it in deeper
and deeper and deeper within.

620
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:59,679
And so then the question
becomes, okay, now, if we

621
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:03,839
understand that if that speaks
truth to us, if we feel that

622
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:09,899
that's true, how can we do this?
And then the question becomes,

623
00:49:09,899 --> 00:49:12,719
well, now we're talking
practicalities.

624
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,980
Aviv Shahar: Yes, well, so
before we transition to that,

625
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,940
this axial vision that you
describe of the two worlds

626
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,520
described in different religious
texts in variety of different

627
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:34,760
ways. So you're really narrating
in your experience and updating

628
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:42,220
of that theological cosmological
view when you describe the sense

629
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:47,920
of two cosmic beings, one that
had the nature of a of a he, and

630
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,920
one that had the nature of a
she. And you describe the the

631
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,220
feminine cosmic being, if, if I
get that correctly, as the one

632
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:02,340
that devoted itself to the Qi.
Creation of time and space and

633
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:08,100
the physical manifestation. And
it's partnering intelligence in

634
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:18,180
he holding that other part of
that compassionate communion of

635
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,820
love, describe, describe what
that insight was and how it

636
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,260
builds on what you were just
narrating, that that the this

637
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,000
next phase of evolution in what
you were proposing is actually

638
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:36,260
those two parts of the of the
cosmic process, getting

639
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,300
integrated and interpenetrating
into each other, such that they

640
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,340
liberate each other of their
loneliness.

641
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,079
Chris Bache: I want to be
careful, and I want to remind us

642
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:57,219
that a finite mind does as best
as it can to give cognitive

643
00:50:57,219 --> 00:51:01,859
structure to transcendent
experiences. So what I'm about

644
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:06,059
to describe is in terms of, just
as you summarized it, a

645
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:09,179
splitting of the Divine
Principle into two halves, a

646
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:13,499
male half that stays outside of
time and space in a transcendent

647
00:51:13,499 --> 00:51:19,079
position, and a female half that
begins the process of

648
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:24,679
manifesting time and space in
the entire physical cosmos. Now

649
00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:28,819
I don't literally think in terms
of male female in this way, but

650
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:34,459
this is the best my mind could
come up with to understand. So

651
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:38,479
it's the principle that's
important. The principle is that

652
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,639
not all of the creative
intelligence manifest as

653
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,319
physical reality. Some of it
stays and holds the position

654
00:51:47,379 --> 00:51:51,279
outside physical reality. So
there is a spiritual reality

655
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:56,619
which gives birth to physical
reality. My experience was now,

656
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:00,039
as we are growing up through
1000s and 1000s of years,

657
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:02,879
millions of years of evolution,
we finally have reached the

658
00:52:02,879 --> 00:52:08,699
point where physical reality is
sufficiently conscious that it

659
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:17,399
can return to transcendent
reality and not merge, but enter

660
00:52:17,399 --> 00:52:22,759
into communion, into con to
consummate a return. And this

661
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:27,499
return doesn't lead to an up and
out exit, but this return leads

662
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:32,359
to the Divine wedding, the
divine marriage, the infusion,

663
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:37,459
deeper and deeper infusion of
the transcendent divine and the

664
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:41,859
eminent divine. I think of this
as kind of like white light, the

665
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:46,119
transcendent divine and the
immanent Divine is kind of green

666
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:51,039
light, green energy. So when the
white energy and the green

667
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:59,919
energy fuse, we have awakened
resplendent physical existence

668
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:07,079
with a consciousness that far
Transcendence, what we have

669
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:11,039
known up to this point in time.
And I think we see this in the

670
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:14,819
lives of the great mystics, the
lives of the great spiritual

671
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:21,139
teachers. They are living a
absolutely grounded physical

672
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:26,959
life, and yet they are also
living a profoundly spiritual

673
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:31,759
life simultaneously. And from
that perspective, the Buddhists

674
00:53:31,759 --> 00:53:38,239
say nirvana is Samsara. Samsara
the world of form and Nirvana,

675
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:41,379
the world of Transcendence.
Those are not two separate

676
00:53:41,379 --> 00:53:46,839
realities. Those are now co
existent realities in our lives

677
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:50,199
that is embodied spirituality.

678
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:53,739
Aviv Shahar: And I would say
that one of the ways for us to

679
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:58,239
describe this is to that we are
engaged in the project of

680
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,259
spiritualizing this world. We
don't need to go to another

681
00:54:01,259 --> 00:54:05,459
world to gain the spiritual
experience we are in the

682
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:10,319
physical form to help
spiritualize this world. Part of

683
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:16,199
the report from these journeys
that you're offering us is the

684
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:20,839
validation that indeed we have
entered a time where you don't

685
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:25,399
need to be high Lama or just a
special priest. It actually is

686
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:30,559
an invitation for humanity at
large to each in our own way,

687
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:34,339
become participant in what you
called earlier, the fellowship

688
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:41,379
of learning, and then become
involved in the in the

689
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:47,739
evolutionary project. So I want
here now to start to make the

690
00:54:47,739 --> 00:54:53,559
next transition for you to
describe the realization of the

691
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:58,179
relationship between the
personal awakening and the

692
00:54:58,179 --> 00:55:03,059
collective awakening and how.
How you have gone through these

693
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:08,759
different cycles of death and
rebirth through this experience

694
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,999
and the significance of these
and how do they facilitate

695
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:14,279
collective awakening?

696
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:19,679
Chris Bache: Well, first, what
I'm going to describe is my

697
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:25,279
variation on an ancient teaching
in Buddhism, for example, when

698
00:55:25,279 --> 00:55:29,179
one sits down to meditate or do
some form of spiritual practice,

699
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,079
the first thing they do is
cultivate what is called

700
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:37,399
bodhicitta. And bodhichitta is
the wish to save all sentient

701
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:41,139
beings. So you do this practice
not for your personal benefit.

702
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:44,919
You do it to nourish the
uplifting of the whole of

703
00:55:44,919 --> 00:55:49,299
creation. The last thing you do
at the end of your practice is

704
00:55:49,299 --> 00:55:52,539
what's called distribution of
the merit. You give all the

705
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:55,359
blessings you've acquired. You
don't try to hold them to

706
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:59,619
yourself. You give them away. So
everything you're doing in in

707
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:03,599
mature spiritual practice is not
for your personal benefit. It's

708
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,499
for the benefit of the whole
these ideas show up in the

709
00:56:07,499 --> 00:56:12,839
spiritual traditions up and down
the line. So the way this showed

710
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:17,219
up in my practice, in my
psychedelic practice, I began my

711
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:20,719
psychedelic practice thinking
that this was part of a personal

712
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:24,799
transformation. So I would, I
would go through some

713
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:29,119
purification process, some
Death-Rebirth process, that

714
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,859
would result in my personal
healing and my personal

715
00:56:33,859 --> 00:56:36,619
liberation, perhaps, or
something. But it was always

716
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:40,779
sort of personally referenced.
But what happened was, after

717
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:44,739
about two years after I had gone
through a lot of personal

718
00:56:44,979 --> 00:56:47,919
cleansing and had relived my own
birth and gone through a

719
00:56:47,919 --> 00:56:52,839
Death-Rebirth process and had my
earth identity shattered, I

720
00:56:52,839 --> 00:56:57,879
entered into a new cycle of
very, very intense purification

721
00:56:57,879 --> 00:57:01,859
processes. But they were not
personal. They were collective.

722
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:08,099
They systematically got larger
and larger for two years until

723
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:13,379
they were they included the
experiences of hundreds millions

724
00:57:13,379 --> 00:57:18,419
of human beings over 1000s of
years, and there were periods of

725
00:57:18,419 --> 00:57:26,239
just intense agony and suffering
and violence. And at first I

726
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:30,979
thought this must be some form
of a deeper ego death. But it

727
00:57:30,979 --> 00:57:35,119
went on for so long and it
involved so many beings that

728
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,899
eventually I came to a new way
of thinking about it, and it was

729
00:57:38,899 --> 00:57:41,799
very challenging. It took me
years to even admit this

730
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:46,299
possibility, but what I came to
eventually was the conviction

731
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:51,999
that in these sessions, I was
not working to heal or transform

732
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:58,059
my individual being, but I was
being used cooperatively to heal

733
00:57:58,059 --> 00:58:03,299
and transform my entire human
family, that the pain that I was

734
00:58:03,299 --> 00:58:06,479
engaging was not part of my
personal pain or even my

735
00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:11,579
reincarnational soul pain, but
it was, it was part of the pain

736
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:17,039
of humanity's history itself,
that this pain of history was

737
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,139
lodged in the collective psyche,
just as My personal pain might

738
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:25,279
be lodged in my personal psyche.
Humanity's collective pain was

739
00:58:25,279 --> 00:58:30,079
lodged and stuck in the
collective psyche. And somehow,

740
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:35,239
by becoming as large as these
sessions allowed me to become, I

741
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:40,039
was able to take on this
suffering and to digest it just

742
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:43,659
as at an earlier time, I had
taken on and digested my

743
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:49,419
personal suffering as a result
of making this choice, of

744
00:58:49,419 --> 00:58:55,779
allowing this to happen, the
universe began to not only take

745
00:58:55,779 --> 00:58:59,319
me deeper into its pain, which
lasted about two years. And then

746
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:03,779
there was a crescendo, and then
it was finished. I was not taken

747
00:59:03,779 --> 00:59:07,439
back into this territory
anymore. I went beyond. But the

748
00:59:07,439 --> 00:59:15,359
universe took me deeply into a
spiritual awakening process,

749
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:19,679
which was again, not personal,
it was collective. It began to

750
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:25,399
take me into the future, into
what I came to call deep time.

751
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:30,499
And it took me there, not as an
individual, but as a field of

752
00:59:30,499 --> 00:59:34,999
energy, somehow encompassing
large swaths of the of the

753
00:59:34,999 --> 00:59:42,999
collective psyche. And I had
repeatedly this experience that

754
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:47,199
there is no ultimate membrane
between the individual and the

755
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:50,139
collective, between the
individual and the species.

756
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:55,059
Everything that the individual
is is a distillation of

757
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:59,439
something that's going on in the
species, and the species is the

758
00:59:59,439 --> 01:00:02,759
collection. Of everything that's
going on in its individual

759
01:00:02,759 --> 01:00:07,499
manners, pick any problem, any
issue that anybody is working on

760
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:11,159
in their life, and they would
not have that issue if it

761
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:15,719
weren't for some pattern of this
issue that's really touching the

762
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:20,599
lives of many, many people in
the human family. So that I

763
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:24,259
learned over and over again in
many different settings and

764
01:00:24,259 --> 01:00:28,279
context that the work of
spiritual transformation of the

765
01:00:28,279 --> 01:00:31,879
individual and the work of
spiritual transformation of the

766
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:36,979
collective as a whole are all
intertwined, and there are no

767
01:00:36,979 --> 01:00:40,179
absolute boundaries. There are
relative boundaries, but there

768
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:45,339
are no absolute boundaries. So
that my book, this my book dark

769
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:49,359
night, early dawn, I describe
this in terms of the dark night

770
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,139
of the soul. And the dark night
of the soul is a very, very

771
01:00:53,139 --> 01:00:56,919
intense period of spiritual
purification that takes place

772
01:00:56,919 --> 01:01:00,659
before the individual mystic
awakens into spiritual

773
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:04,499
realization. But here I was
talking about the dark night of

774
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:08,519
our collective soul, that
humanity as a whole was going

775
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:13,979
through a dark night, a period
of profound purification, which

776
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:20,399
I think, by analogy, is a period
which is leading up to a

777
01:01:20,399 --> 01:01:26,239
profound spiritual awakening for
humanity as a whole. I don't

778
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:30,799
many people have said this. We
are past the age of individuals

779
01:01:30,919 --> 01:01:34,999
enlightenment. Now. We either
become enlightened as a species,

780
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:38,719
we either wake up as a species,
or we're going to lose this

781
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:43,839
planet. So my work has been
about collective transformation,

782
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,119
not personal transformation, so
much

783
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:51,339
Aviv Shahar: and implicit inside
this, this insight is also the

784
01:01:51,339 --> 01:01:57,459
idea that anybody you can choose
to work on your individual

785
01:01:57,459 --> 01:02:01,679
struggle or on your individual
healing, and when you work on

786
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:06,299
the individual, you can choose
devotionally or by sentiment or

787
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:12,419
by a frame of mind. Recognize
that your work on yourself is

788
01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:15,239
part of your contribution to the
whole, and if you make that

789
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:20,339
internal inclusion and
integration, you become part of

790
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:27,319
the fellowship of learning and
healing, and essentially you you

791
01:02:27,319 --> 01:02:29,239
opt in to the evolutionary
project.

792
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,900
Chris Bache: Yeah, now you are
in the you evolutionary project,

793
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,780
whether or not you recognize it.
Whether or not you opt in, you

794
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,900
are part in it. You are hard
wired into it. But if you

795
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:42,880
recognize it, then you can
consciously participate, and

796
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,720
that deepens and enriches that
process.

797
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,600
Aviv Shahar: And then, as the
journey continued, you moved

798
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,160
from the personal to the
collective and to the archetypal

799
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,840
and to the higher archetypal
dimension describe what these

800
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:03,960
realms and these cycles of death
and rebirth meant for you in

801
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,740
this discovery.

802
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,320
Chris Bache: Well, after two
years of working in what I came

803
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,200
to call this collective
suffering, the ocean of

804
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,600
suffering and experiencing the
blessings of insights that were

805
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,180
also coming in a chapter I
called the initiation into the

806
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,840
universe, where I was given
these teachings of cosmology,

807
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:31,820
101, the suffering kind of
reached a culmination. It's hard

808
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:36,740
to describe, but it was kind of
a collective breakthrough, and

809
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:43,660
then it spun me into a level of
reality that was stunningly old.

810
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,860
It was ancient, and for the next
year and a half it kept bringing

811
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,400
me back. Now it's always
progressive, so it take me back

812
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,880
to that level of reality. And
every time I entered that

813
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,900
reality, what was stunning about
it was it was ancient and it was

814
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,000
more real than physical time
space was, and that's very

815
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,300
disorienting, you know, to think
that there is a reality which is

816
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:14,880
more real than physical reality,
it just completely shattered me.

817
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,600
But it was such a consistent
part I had to no chance but to

818
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,920
choice, but to yield and give
into that.

819
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,620
Aviv Shahar: So part of your
struggle, part of your struggle

820
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,680
in the journey, must have been
the how do you stabilize these

821
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,800
insights and awarenesses when
you need to come back to teach

822
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,860
in the classroom and and be a
family man and all the rest of

823
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,220
that?

824
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,700
Chris Bache: Wherever I was on
Saturday, in my inner work, on

825
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,420
Monday, I was back in the
classroom teaching my courses,

826
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,360
which is part of the very
grounding. It's really, really

827
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,600
important if you're going to go
deep, you have to be grounded.

828
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,780
You have to lifestyle of
commitment to grounded practice.

829
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:53,740
And for me, that grounding was
provided by my family and by my

830
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:58,600
teaching, my students always but
it is difficult. And there's one

831
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,800
thing I'll mention that Eric.
Every time you break through to

832
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,200
a new level of reality, it's
cognitively very confusing. You

833
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,620
don't understand what you're
experiencing at first, and when

834
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:15,060
you write up your description,
it has gaps and fragments. But

835
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,360
if you go back again and again
to that level of reality,

836
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:23,960
eventually your mind learns to
adapt to it, and you begin to be

837
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:28,820
more capable of having more
coherent experiences there. So

838
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,420
in the beginning, your your
write ups maybe have holes in

839
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:36,740
them, but with repetition, those
holes are filled in, and you

840
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:40,540
have more complete pictures. And
this is part of what I mean by

841
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:45,820
cultivating the philosophical
discipline that's required to

842
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:49,660
have coherent, sustained
experiences of deeper levels of

843
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:54,580
reality, the second part that's
required is, and this is a

844
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:59,740
again, this applies at multiple
levels of of the adventure,

845
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:06,540
higher levels of reality are
deeper levels, let's say of

846
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:10,500
reality are higher levels of
energy. Every deeper level of

847
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:15,600
reality functions at a higher
level of energy. So when I made

848
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:20,360
the transition into archetypal
reality, I went through huge

849
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:25,100
purification processes in which
I was dissolved into white hot

850
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:30,740
lava, plunged into burning suns,
just tremendous fields of energy

851
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:35,780
that just burning more and more
out of me. And if I hadn't gone

852
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:38,780
through that, I wouldn't have
been able to have coherent

853
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:42,820
consciousness. Because you
literally, you have to become a

854
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:49,180
being that can live at that
level for hours at a time, even

855
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:54,340
only temporarily, in order to
have coherent cognition at that

856
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:59,560
level. So to enter into
archetype of reality, yeah, it

857
01:06:59,560 --> 01:06:59,920
takes

858
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,520
Aviv Shahar: us to capture the
principle you're describing

859
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,720
there, because that would be the
case, not just in the

860
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,480
psychedelic experience, but in
any developmental journey.

861
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:15,960
Because if you are to embrace
larger and more potent realms,

862
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:21,440
then there are several processes
that will have to take place for

863
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,460
a start, what you're describing
is you're being rewired on the

864
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,280
inside, because there are
different circuitries in your

865
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:32,780
brain and in the energy field
that you are that get activated,

866
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:37,040
get switched on in the process,
and then secondarily, once

867
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:41,680
you're engaging with higher
level of potency, the what you

868
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,680
describe as purification
process, your system need to

869
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:49,720
cleanse, need to actually
release any of the residue of

870
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,680
the previous infrastructure that
you were part of. Because what

871
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,640
you're describing that the
universe is a compassionate,

872
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:03,300
loving actuality, but it's not
socialistic environment. Rather,

873
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:08,580
it is a gradient. It has levels
and dimensions, and those can

874
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:12,840
sometimes interpenetrate. But
there are also containers that

875
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:18,420
for the sanctity of their and
the fidelity of the process,

876
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,940
they must be retained, and if
you are as a human vessel to

877
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:26,900
enter these realms, your system,
your physical system, need to be

878
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,820
rewired and updated to be able
to manage that. And the 51% of

879
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:35,480
the work is actually stabilizing
the work that you got exposed

880
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,680
to. That's how I would translate
what you just shared through my

881
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:45,820
lens of of of non psychedelic
experience, but engaged on on

882
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:48,640
the cutting edge of the
spiritual and developmental

883
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,000
journey.

884
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:53,860
Chris Bache: Absolutely And all
we're seeing is a particular

885
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:59,320
variation of a universal pattern
that if you want to open to

886
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:03,900
deeper truths and to a deeper
participatory relationship with

887
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:07,560
the universe, you have to empty
yourself of everything which is

888
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,040
keeping you small. You have to
empty yourself of old ways of

889
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,060
thinking, old ways of feeling,
and all of these thoughts and

890
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:19,080
Feeling patterns have biological
correlates. So you go through a

891
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:23,120
detoxification process which is
physical as well as mental and

892
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:28,580
emotional, when a when a monk in
Tibetan Buddhism wants to

893
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,080
receive higher levels of
teaching, teachings which are

894
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:38,300
capable of generating awakening
or enlightenment, They must

895
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:43,360
first do what's called NDR the
preparatory practices, which of

896
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,440
the 500 preparatory practices
are five practices you do

897
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,640
100,000 times each. And one of
those practices is doing full

898
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:56,800
body prostrations while reciting
prayerful mantras. So you're

899
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,840
you're going on the ground,
you're lying down, you're

900
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,720
getting up, you're praying,
you're. Going on the ground.

901
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:05,460
You're lying up, and you're not
only retuning your mind with

902
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,580
these mantras and you're
retuning your heart with the

903
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,120
devotion of these mantras, but
you literally are working your

904
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:16,980
body and working your body to
purify your body, while you are

905
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,360
purifying your mind and your
heart. And this is way it is for

906
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,840
all spiritual practice, isn't
it? We always are having to

907
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:29,780
purify ourselves. And if, if
psychedelics push you into a

908
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:34,160
higher state of consciousness
kind of quickly, you then have

909
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,980
to purify after you go into that
state of consciousness.

910
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,200
Aviv Shahar: You either, you
either need to do the you either

911
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,860
need to pay on the front end or
during or after

912
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,140
Chris Bache: now or pay me
later, but you have to pay Yeah.

913
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,460
Aviv Shahar: The one distinction
I'd make, and I'm interested in

914
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:56,140
your comment, is so some of
those Buddhist practices, they

915
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:00,040
emerged in ancient times. What
we're describing is that

916
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,600
humanity has now entered an
environment, a universal

917
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:08,220
environment, where you may be
able to go through an

918
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:12,360
accelerated journey, not just in
the way you have done that

919
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,200
journey, but because in in
metaphoric terms or in actual

920
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:21,260
terms, we can say the universe
has come, has drawn nearer to

921
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:25,040
the human realm. That's part of
the epochal shift that we are

922
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,600
experiencing at this time, such
that, because of what you're

923
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,800
describing, that we have entered
the phase of collective

924
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:39,020
awakening. We may be in one
lifetime go through, we may be

925
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:42,700
able to go through an
accelerated journey, especially

926
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:46,480
when we engage with the with the
exercise, not through the lens

927
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,440
of the individual, but as part
of the bigger project of the

928
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,920
humanity participating in the
evolutionary process.

929
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:58,840
Chris Bache: Yeah. And so if you
open your individual life,

930
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:03,540
whether it's spiritual practice
or psychological transformation,

931
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:09,120
or even as you engage diseases
in your physical body to this

932
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,380
larger collective landscape
landscape, then I think you

933
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:18,240
participate in this evolutionary
project in a new and Intense

934
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:22,280
fashion. Also, if you are
engaged in social

935
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,160
transformation, if you are
trying to bring working for

936
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:29,840
social justice, working for true
equality in our healthcare

937
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:35,180
delivery systems and so on and
so forth, with a conscious

938
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,480
understanding that this is the
time we must change our culture.

939
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:45,280
We must change our historical
practices. We must let go of the

940
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:49,000
divisions of the history. We
must lay a foundation for a

941
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,200
future that works for all of its
citizens, not just for some of

942
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,640
its citizens. Then that too,
even if you're not meditating,

943
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,540
even if you're not doing those
internal practices, if you're

944
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:05,520
social activist, then that too
is part of this larger, deep

945
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,280
transformation. And I think
you're right. I think what we're

946
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:12,540
finding is in many spiritual
practitioners and visionaries in

947
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:16,380
many different lineages are
coming to the same conclusion

948
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:20,660
that everything is speeding up,
that our evolution is speeding

949
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:25,040
up, and humanity is coming to a
critical pivot point, a

950
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:29,840
bifurcation point, a point of
critical instability that we are

951
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:36,920
we either grow up or we probably
go extinct. We cannot continue

952
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,280
to manage the planet with the
lower level of consciousness

953
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:44,440
that we have been operating out
of in the past, we have to

954
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:52,600
achieve a breakthrough of depth
and breadth in order to grow up

955
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:57,640
to the species that's been
growing inside of us for 1000s

956
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,560
of years. And I understand this
in terms of reincarnation. It's

957
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,900
like we've been reincarnating
and reincarnating and

958
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,840
reincarnating. We've been
learning bits and pieces,

959
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,960
learning and learning and
learning. And I think what's

960
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,640
happening is, as the world is
trying to become an integrated

961
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:20,120
whole as a planet, we're dealing
with problems the magnitude of

962
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,300
which we cannot solve at a local
level. They have to be solved at

963
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:28,340
a global level. Likewise,
individually, intra psychically,

964
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:32,660
we are bringing together all of
the lives and all of the karma

965
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:37,160
from all of our previous lives.
We have lived in every race. We

966
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,800
have been every race on the
planet. We have been every

967
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,880
religion. We have been every
nationality. We have all these

968
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:49,480
lives inside of us, and now,
whereas in the past, we would

969
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,140
the world has torn itself apart,
nation against nation, race

970
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:56,920
against race, likewise, all
these divisions are inside of

971
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:02,640
us, and as we become one and
whole. So we fuse that history

972
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:08,040
into one integrated being, and
in that process, we support

973
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:13,800
humanity that is fusing its past
into one integrated being, and

974
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:18,840
that's giving birth to what I
call the diamond soul. Will

975
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,960
fully awaken soul consciousness

976
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:25,280
Aviv Shahar: just before we get
to the diamond revelation and

977
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:30,440
experience, what bridging Will
you offer? I mean, what you just

978
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:34,700
framed there is that a way to
view the meta crisis unfolding

979
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:38,120
in just any and every aspect of
of life on the planet. Right

980
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:43,120
now, we can choose to view it as
the living crucible, the

981
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,800
initiatory crucible of this
evolutionary project, in a way,

982
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,220
forcing us to realize that we
can't do it on our own. We have

983
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:57,760
to come together. So what
bridging comment will you offer

984
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:02,520
about that journey where you
appreciate the archetype, and

985
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,080
earlier on, and through that you
you come to some vision of the

986
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:11,400
birth of the future human, that
new species that that's arising.

987
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:15,000
What else? What other scaffolds
you want to put there before we

988
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,320
explore the sense of diamond
Luminosity?

989
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,980
Chris Bache: Well, what I share
with you now doesn't come from

990
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,980
an intellectual basis. It
doesn't come from books I've

991
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:35,900
read, and I wish I could give it
that and give you footnotes, and

992
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,660
you know that type of
documentation that academics

993
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:43,540
love to give, but I I have to
speak to you only out of my

994
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,280
spiritual experiences, only out
of my psychedelic experiences.

995
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:55,360
And over the course of this long
journey, I was plunged into a

996
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,720
series of initiations and
initiation visionary

997
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:06,960
experiences. And what I shared
in that last statement is

998
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,520
basically simply what was given
to me, what was shown me with

999
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,320
consistency, that humanity is
coming into a critical time, a

1000
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:22,760
critically in stable time, a
bifurcation time, bifurcation

1001
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:27,440
point that the world was
entering into a global crisis

1002
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:32,000
that seemed to be driven by a
cascading series of ecological

1003
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,620
crises, that these ecological
crises were hitting us again And

1004
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:42,460
again, causing a profound
breakdown, a breakdown that

1005
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:47,440
already many people see it
coming, and it is so severe,

1006
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:52,120
many very wise people think that
it's an extinction event. We are

1007
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,420
really going extinct as a
species. We will not be able to

1008
01:17:55,420 --> 01:18:01,380
survive what's coming. My
experience as a visionary in the

1009
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,440
psychedelic condition is that
that is not what's going to

1010
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:09,660
happen, that we are coming into
a time of acute suffering, acute

1011
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:16,560
dismantling, a surrendering of
the past, but in that process,

1012
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:21,380
we will give birth to something
extraordinary, not simply a new

1013
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:26,360
civilization or a new culture,
and not simply a new economics

1014
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,600
or a new industrial production,
a green production, we are

1015
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,320
literally giving birth to the
next form of the human being,

1016
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:40,220
the future human. And I couldn't
have dreamed this up. I couldn't

1017
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:44,620
have made this up and but it's
been a it's been to me a vision

1018
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,940
which was given me, starting in
the late night, early 90s,

1019
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:56,560
culminating in 1995 and it was
given to me not as A visionary

1020
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:07,620
experience of what will be, but
at great after great work, well,

1021
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:11,220
I was taken into what I call
deep time and taken into the

1022
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:16,020
future, taken into whole time,
and was experienced This

1023
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:22,460
transformation that humanity is
undergoing as what has happened,

1024
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,760
not all simultaneously what will
happen, but also what has

1025
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,360
happened

1026
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:32,300
Aviv Shahar: with time, where
time is non linear, so you could

1027
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:37,160
be in those different positions
and experiences concurrently.

1028
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,360
Yes.

1029
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:42,760
Chris Bache: And so for me, it
is out of that basis that I say

1030
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:47,560
this is an initiatory event. It
is not an extinction event. It

1031
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:51,340
is a process that we will go
through now. We can go through

1032
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:58,660
it kind of clumsily and
awkwardly and dragging our

1033
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:04,020
heels, or we. And go through it
cooperatively with vision and

1034
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:08,820
foresight, and we can accelerate
our way through it, or we can

1035
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:13,500
fight it and make it'll become
worse, right? That's our choice.

1036
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,400
I mean, you said you all, we all
grow. We either go, we drag, get

1037
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,320
dragged through, or we walk
through with elegance. And

1038
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,700
that's our choice. Now, do we go
forward with vision, or do we

1039
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,240
try to hold on to the past, or
try to go back to some time in

1040
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:33,560
history when things were easier,
they made sense? Or do we forge

1041
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,020
ahead into a new future?

1042
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,240
Aviv Shahar: So this must have
been and in many ways you

1043
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,540
describe that sense, the
realization of that, the

1044
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:48,400
feeling, experience, communion
of that, and the calling that

1045
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:52,540
makes that became a driving
issue, just stabilizing that and

1046
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:57,880
operating in life was, I
imagine, a challenge by itself.

1047
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:04,800
When you speak of it now, it
leaves in you as as powerfully

1048
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:10,080
and as passionately, all while
you you communicate that this is

1049
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:14,580
a an experience and a set of
insights that you must contain,

1050
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:19,260
because it's it's not about
jumping on rooftops and

1051
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:23,180
screaming. It actually is about
containing and giving birth to

1052
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:27,500
the realization of these
extraordinary shape shifting

1053
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:32,120
events that are unfolding right
as we speak on the global stage,

1054
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:36,140
and that these are theaters of
experience through which the

1055
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:40,040
individual, the collective, the
archetypal consciousness that

1056
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:46,300
the human experience represents
can be transformed to become

1057
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:49,720
participatory in in the
evolutionary process.

1058
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:54,940
Chris Bache: Yes, exactly when I
first had the this kind of

1059
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:58,000
culminating breakthrough, after
years of these visions and I

1060
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,060
experienced the death and
rebirth of humanity. It took me

1061
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:07,980
about a year to recover. It was
such a powerful experience. It

1062
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:11,820
was like, as I say in the book,
it was like walking around

1063
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:16,800
Hiroshima a week before the bomb
was dropped, and I had such

1064
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,680
profound compassion and such
deep respect for every person

1065
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:26,960
that I was seeing, because my
understanding was that each one

1066
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:32,300
of us chose to incarnate at this
time in history, knowing what we

1067
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:35,840
were getting into, knowing that
it was going to be hard, knowing

1068
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,540
that it was going to be very,
very difficult. But there are no

1069
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:42,340
victims here. There are only
saints, there are only

1070
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:45,880
volunteers who have chosen to
participate in this and that

1071
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:49,000
every person here, whether or
not I agree with them

1072
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,580
politically or whether you know
whatever, whatever our

1073
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:55,660
differences may be, every person
here deserves my complete

1074
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:59,680
respect because they are a soul
who has chosen to participate in

1075
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,500
this historic transformation,

1076
01:23:02,939 --> 01:23:07,679
Aviv Shahar: and then you will
let later into the diamond

1077
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,299
Luminosity and its discovery,
describe that transition,

1078
01:23:12,299 --> 01:23:12,779
please.

1079
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,800
Chris Bache: Well, I have to
back up just a little bit,

1080
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,800
because I described going into
archetypal reality, and I

1081
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,940
haven't described too much about
what went on there, but let's

1082
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:26,780
just kind of jump over that. And
then I went through another

1083
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:30,440
death and rebirth process. And
then I entered what I came to

1084
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:38,420
call causal mind, or the
universe, experienced in a

1085
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:44,560
condition of consciousness where
everything is one, all the

1086
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:49,900
diversity of life pulses as a
single life form, just a single

1087
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:55,660
totality, an overwhelming,
absorbing experience in the

1088
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:59,860
fundamental oneness of life,
where My boundaries dissolved

1089
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:03,900
completely, not only my personal
boundaries, but I saw that there

1090
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,500
were no boundaries. From this
perspective throughout the

1091
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:12,960
entire universe, that we all
were aspects of this fundamental

1092
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,640
oneness. And I experienced what
the Buddhists call Shunyata,

1093
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,680
emptiness, emptiness of self,
transparency. There was another

1094
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,460
session where I was taken into
the cosmic void, into the

1095
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:31,280
fertile void, out of which the
universe emerged, an experience

1096
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:37,520
of overwhelming cosmic love. And
that went on for a year. I just

1097
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:43,000
was absorbed in extraordinary
blessings, and I was completely

1098
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:49,900
satisfied. As a philosopher, I
was totally satisfied. And then

1099
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,860
I went through yet another
Death-Rebirth experience, a very

1100
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:57,760
intense Death-Rebirth
experience. And when I came

1101
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:06,120
through it, i. Taken into a
consciousness of clear, clear

1102
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,100
light, just I had known light
many times before. Light had

1103
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:14,100
shown up in many Death-Rebirth
processes, but this was

1104
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:18,000
different. This was an
exceptionally hyper, clear

1105
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,240
Luminosity, and I came to call
it the diamond light, the

1106
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:27,680
diamond Luminosity. And when I
looked at other sources in the

1107
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,040
spiritual literature, again,
Buddhism is one of the ones I

1108
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:34,460
know the best. And when I
studied the Buddhist literature,

1109
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:39,620
I think this is what they call
Dharmakaya, the clear light of

1110
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:46,780
absolute reality. It is a light
so clear that it eventually

1111
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:51,700
becomes invisible. But it's just
crystalline, clear, and in that

1112
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:58,720
clarity, there is an ecstasy
that goes beyond bliss, beyond

1113
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,340
any of the ecstasy associated
with form, because this is pure

1114
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:08,760
formlessness. Once I touched
this, then the only thing I

1115
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,120
wanted to do was get back to it.
I mean, once you touch this kind

1116
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,900
of diamond Luminosity,
everything else becomes

1117
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:23,540
insignificant. And over the next
four years and 26 sessions, I

1118
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:28,700
only went back into the diamond
Luminosity four times, about

1119
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:33,500
once a year. And in between
those four sessions, there was

1120
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:37,280
sessions of intense
purification. More purification,

1121
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:43,300
you know, more so on so forth.
In the middle of that cycle, I

1122
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,300
had the experience of the Great
Awakening, the experience of the

1123
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,600
death and rebirth of humanity.
So the diamond Luminosity work

1124
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,600
started developed. Then I had
the experience of the future

1125
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:00,720
awakening of humanity. And then
I went back into two more years

1126
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:04,860
of work with two more
initiations into the diamond

1127
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:10,200
Luminosity. In the first two
sessions, I went deeper and

1128
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:14,520
deeper into the diamond
Luminosity. And then in the last

1129
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,300
two the diamond Luminosity
crunched itself deeper and

1130
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:23,900
deeper into my physical body
into my mind, and I experienced

1131
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:29,720
it kind of remaking me, almost
at a cellular I don't understand

1132
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:34,520
the process, but it was infused.
It was entering into my body so

1133
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:40,160
that eventually it changed not
only how I think and how I feel.

1134
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:46,360
It gave me a brief glimpse in my
very, very last session of a

1135
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:54,700
change in my vision. I had an
experience of seeing 100 times

1136
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:59,320
clear, 100 times more refined
than I had ever seen in my

1137
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,940
ordinary consciousness. And it
wasn't a hallucination. It was

1138
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,660
what I came to call diamond
vision, and I and then after

1139
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:10,200
about 10 minutes, it
disappeared, and I was back to

1140
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,860
my ordinary, clear vision. And
that's when I began to

1141
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:19,440
understand that the future human
that we are giving birth to is

1142
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:24,980
not only a human being with a
healed and expansive heart, and

1143
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:28,880
not only a human being with an
open mind open to deeper

1144
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,500
communion with the universe, but
it's a human being which lives

1145
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:38,360
physically differently. All of
our senses are not simply

1146
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:42,940
biomechanical processes. They
are functions of a level of

1147
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:47,380
consciousness we hold within the
body. And so our vision is

1148
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:52,180
capable of infinitely more
refinement than in our hearing

1149
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:55,660
and our tastes and our touches.
So when we talk about bringing

1150
01:28:55,660 --> 01:29:00,040
heaven to earth, it's not simply
like, you know, a social, nice,

1151
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:05,280
Harmony social we're talking
about weaving divine

1152
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:11,280
consciousness, activating Divine
Consciousness inside our body,

1153
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:16,620
so that our body becomes
profoundly satisfying, capable

1154
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:21,800
of much, much more refined
sensory experience, not just

1155
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,540
emotional and physics and what

1156
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:26,120
Aviv Shahar: you're describing,
what you're describing there,

1157
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:30,140
building on everything you said
earlier, is the universe is

1158
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:36,020
interested not just in altered
human consciousness. It wants

1159
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:40,540
that consciousness to permeate
all the levels of physical

1160
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:45,400
reality such that the universe
can experience through us the

1161
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,620
sensory portal and the mental
portal and the embodied

1162
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:54,400
experience all at a richer,
higher fidelity, higher quality,

1163
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:55,660
kind of a way,

1164
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:59,740
Chris Bache: yes, and I would
say the way I think of this is

1165
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:03,120
not. So much that it can
experience though, I'm I'm sure

1166
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:07,860
that's true, but I think it's
actually sharing with us the

1167
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:12,120
gift of its capacity. It's,
it's, it's literally kind of

1168
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:18,360
cloning itself. It's sharing,
it's sharing the gift of how it

1169
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:22,880
experiences life with us, and
it's growing us and growing us

1170
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,020
to allow us to incarnate and
embody its experience of life at

1171
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:30,860
deeper and deeper levels. And
that means it's an act of

1172
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:31,880
generosity.

1173
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,540
Aviv Shahar: Well, Chris, this
has been a fascinating

1174
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:40,840
exploration, and I so much
appreciate that you're able to

1175
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:47,800
both narrate your experience,
integrate into it, your teaching

1176
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:53,980
and spiritual practice and and
also talk to it from the

1177
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:57,580
extemporaneous experience of
this moment in time of being a

1178
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:01,620
conscious being On this
tormented planet as humanity is

1179
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:06,600
going through these very
difficult transitional events,

1180
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,340
but what makes the whole
difference? I mean, the teaching

1181
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:14,580
from Viktor, frankly, is if when
you're in the most difficult

1182
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:20,040
circumstance, if you carry with
you a different logo, therapy, a

1183
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,940
different reason, a different
purpose, a different awareness,

1184
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:25,940
a different recognition and
insight about what it is that

1185
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:30,560
you are undergoing, whether it's
illness, whether it's pain,

1186
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:35,300
about the greater planetary
situation, there is a

1187
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,240
difference, because do we
experience what We experience

1188
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:43,000
merely personally, or do we
experience the personal

1189
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,640
dimension when we are merged
inside that greater actuality

1190
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:53,800
and that search, that inquiry,
that struggle, is actually part

1191
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:57,760
of the spiritual work of this
time, which you discovered

1192
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:04,200
through psychedelics? My
experience is it's accessible in

1193
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:13,140
the day to day tasking of life,
of being a parent and a spouse

1194
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:17,640
and a teacher and a leader, and
working through the day to day

1195
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,260
struggles of life and asking,
How can I make the higher

1196
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:25,400
choices, how can I be the better
version of myself? How can I

1197
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:31,880
find resources to transcend the
moment of conflict, to

1198
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:37,940
metabolize and transmogrify the
moment of being triggered to

1199
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:41,560
instead of acting out on being
triggered, to use it as a

1200
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,040
trampoline to engage with a
higher, cosmic, universal

1201
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:48,940
dimension of life. That's the
invitation that I hear in your

1202
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,360
narrative.

1203
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,220
Chris Bache: Yeah, absolutely,
there's psychedelics are totally

1204
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:58,420
incidental. They're simply how I
encountered these principles.

1205
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:02,100
And one can encounter these
principles in so many different

1206
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:07,920
forms, in so many contexts, as
we enter this dark night of our

1207
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:11,220
collective soul, which I think
has begun, and it's going to get

1208
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:14,760
worse, but as we enter it, we're
going to hear people say all

1209
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,980
sorts of things. They're going
to offer all sorts of

1210
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:20,720
interpretations that we're being
punished, or this is the end of

1211
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:25,400
time, and this is that we're
being plagued by demons. And are

1212
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:29,840
this we were this is a
punishment that is owed to us.

1213
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:35,540
And I think it's very important
that we have a deep vision of

1214
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:39,800
what is being produced, what is
taking place in history, a

1215
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:44,260
vision of the future human that
we are in the process of giving

1216
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:49,900
birth to inside ourselves and
collectively. If imagine a woman

1217
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:53,200
who's giving birth and she
doesn't know that she's pregnant

1218
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:56,500
and she doesn't know anything
about labor or what's actually

1219
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,680
taking place, what a horrible
day it would be. But if she

1220
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:03,720
understands that she's giving
birth to a new life, then it all

1221
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:10,140
kind of coheres to to see the
intelligence of the universe and

1222
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:13,380
the compassion of the universe,
you have to look very, very

1223
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:17,340
deep, because on the surface,
the universe does not appear to

1224
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:20,240
be very compassionate, and it
doesn't appear to Be very

1225
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:26,240
intelligent, it appears to be a
really brutal being to see that

1226
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,780
compassion. You have to
understand existence at a very,

1227
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:33,200
very deep level. And as we enter
this time in history,

1228
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,220
particularly this century, we
have to be capable of looking

1229
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:41,680
very, very deeply. And when we
look deeply, then we cooperate

1230
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:44,200
with that process of
transformation. It doesn't

1231
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,380
require psychedelics at all, but
when we record, when we

1232
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:52,060
participate and cooperate with
the challenges that we are

1233
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:56,260
living in our immediate life, in
our immediate circumstances, and

1234
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:00,300
we find our way to the highest
good, the highest. Highest

1235
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:03,900
choices, the greatest good for
the greatest number, then we,

1236
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:09,780
then we feed into good outcome
for the delivery of this future

1237
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:13,920
human, both in our own life and
in the lives of our children and

1238
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,800
our grandchildren and to future
generations.

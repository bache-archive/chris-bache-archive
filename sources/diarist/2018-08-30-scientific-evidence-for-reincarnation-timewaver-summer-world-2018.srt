1
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,680
Chris Bache: The good news, do I
have a mic? Yeah, the good news

2
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,480
is that after me, it's lunch, so
I'm the end of your day. Now.

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,300
I'm a professor. I've been at
this game for a long time, so I

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,240
know a tired audience when I see
one. It's been a long morning

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,660
and a lot of wonderful ideas. So
I'd like to take real quick.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,440
Everybody stand up. Just stand
up and stretch your arms up.

7
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,900
Bring in that more good energy.
Bring it in. Okay, okay, now sit

8
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,380
down.

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,440
If the most important
philosophical question one can

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,880
ask in life is, do we survive
the death of our body, which Dr

11
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,840
Van Lommel is asking, I think
the second most important

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,480
question is, do we live once, or
do we live more than once? And

13
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,860
it all hinges on time. The
problem the significances of

14
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,720
time as a teacher, if I give a
quiz, I have a right to expect a

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,680
certain performance from the
students. If I give an hour

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,400
exam, I have a right to expect a
higher level of performance. And

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,000
if I give a take home research
paper, I expect a higher level

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,384
of performance because they have
more time. If this universe, if

19
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:50,424
this magnificent universe that
we are in, has a purpose, then

20
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:54,564
as a philosopher, we can, we
have to measure the purpose of

21
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:57,864
the universe proportionate to
the time. We have to fulfill

22
00:01:57,864 --> 00:02:03,360
that purpose. If we only live
one time, then we might

23
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,900
extrapolate or estimate or
calculate the purpose of

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,160
existence to be but if we live
100 times, if we live 1000

25
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,660
times, if we live 10,000 times,
if our participation in this

26
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:29,960
magnificent universe is truly
open ended, then we have a very

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,780
different relationship with the
universe, and then we have a

28
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,580
reason to think about the
possible purpose of existence in

29
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,660
a completely different
framework. And the religions of

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,440
the last 4000 years have had a
tendency to not value physical

31
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,840
existence. They've had a
tendency to say, well, you

32
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,600
achieve realization, you achieve
enlightenment, and then you

33
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,740
leave Nirvana, Samsara, you
escape. Samsara, moksha, escape

34
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,540
or you achieve salvation, and
then you leave. But that leaves

35
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,300
the fundamental question, what
is the purpose of the universe

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,900
unanswered? What is the purpose
of my physical existence in the

37
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,940
universe? But if we come back,
if we come back to this life

38
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,840
many times, then we have a
different story that begins to

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,240
unfold, and it doesn't. I think
it. I think our understanding of

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,440
reincarnation is completely
incomplete at this point, just

41
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,560
as we've begun to understand the
true depth and breadth of the

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,400
universe that we are part of,
likewise, when we begin to

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,120
understand that we participate,
we're dancing with this universe

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,240
for extended period of time,
then we have a deeper

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,180
understanding of what the
universe might actually be

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,400
trying to accomplish in us, and
what might be our gift to the

47
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,000
universe in the continual
refinement and compounding of

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,140
our talent over time. So what
I'd like to do today is talk

49
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,480
about the evidence for
reincarnation, and I've been

50
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,720
thinking about this and been in
this game for a long time. The

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,320
first book I wrote, it was, is
life cycles. And notice how long

52
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,360
ago I wrote it. It was the first
book I wrote as an academic. And

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,900
that is a signal of how
important I think this topic is,

54
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,360
and that there is good, critical
empirical evidence that allows

55
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,020
us to decide this topic. If
there weren't critical evidence,

56
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,500
then it would just be a wasted
exercise. And I think this

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,060
evidence did not exist 50 years
ago, and the theologians used to

58
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,720
debate about reincarnation go
round and round. But today we

59
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,040
have a different body of
physical of empirical evidence

60
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,400
on reincarnation that has moved
the topic from the theologians

61
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,060
table to the psychologist table
to the philosopher's table to

62
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,080
the to the psychiatrist table,
and that's what I'd like to take

63
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,440
you through some today. Now when
looking at the evidence for

64
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,920
reincarnation, we can either
look at go small or go large.

65
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,260
Large, we either look at the
detailed cases in or we look at

66
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,760
the larger body of literature.
The Beauty and the real joy is

67
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,640
in the detailed cases. But in 45
minutes, I've chosen to go

68
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,140
large. What I would really like
to do is encourage you today to

69
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,180
read one book on reincarnation
that you haven't read yet, and

70
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,460
so I want to take you into some
of the literature on

71
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,340
reincarnation and show you some
of the patterns that are

72
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,420
emerging in the literature in
rebirth. Okay, ready to go?

73
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:41,500
Let's go 20 cases suggestive of
reincarnation by Ian Stevenson.

74
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,700
This is a book that changed my
life, because, like many people,

75
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,560
when I finished graduate school
in 1978 I was an atheistically

76
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,360
inclined agnostic. I was trained
in philosophy of religion, but

77
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,800
all that training basically made
me an atheist. But when I

78
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,540
encountered this book right
after finishing graduate school.

79
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,660
He turned my life around because
he convinced me that there was

80
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,800
evidence that we live on life
more than once. He is the Ah,

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,840
okay. Oh, good. Steven. Steve
Stevenson is the Carlson

82
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,660
professor. Was the Carlson
Professor the University of

83
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,900
Virginia between 1967 and 2001
he has written 11 books on

84
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,420
reincarnation. Some of the most
important are these cases of

85
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,600
reincarnation, type written over
a seven year period from 73 to

86
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:50,320
84 unlearn language, languages
by children about children who

87
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,320
have an ability to speak a
language which no one in their

88
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,420
family speaks, no one in their
entire town speaks, sometimes an

89
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:05,280
ancient language, children who
remember previous lives. And his

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,820
last book, his Monu mopis, a
1000 page, two volume work, a

91
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,800
study of 187 cases of children
who not only have detailed

92
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,080
memories of their most previous
of their immediate life, but

93
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,160
actually carry the scars in
their body which relate to the

94
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,420
death wounds of the body in
their previous personality. And

95
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,860
that, of course, really upsets
academics. I mean, it's one

96
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,340
thing to have continuity of
memory that's bad enough, but to

97
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,040
suggest that a wound of death
can actually be transferred into

98
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,280
the physical body of a
subsequent personality that

99
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,860
drives my colleagues right up a
wall. But 187 cases, well

100
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,500
documented case histories. It's
a magnificent book. What are we

101
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,680
looking at with Stevenson? We're
looking at cases of children

102
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,720
from around the world who have
detailed recall of their most

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,820
immediate recent life. They know
their way around towns that

104
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,560
they've never been in before.
They can recognize persons when

105
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,900
they're brought into the life
place of the previous

106
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,920
personality. They can recognize
persons that they have never met

107
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,140
before. They know the personal
history, their personal history

108
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,820
with that person. They have the
appropriate emotional responses

109
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,100
with that person. Husbands. For
wives, children, you have cases

110
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,600
of a five year old child who is
showing all the feelings of the

111
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,400
husband of a 35 year old woman
with all the emotional

112
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,500
responses. There is one case of
a child called parmed When he

113
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,220
was reunited with the family of
the previous personality. He was

114
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,640
very shy around the wife of the
previous personality. He

115
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,520
wouldn't identify her until she
left the room, but then he

116
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,500
identified her, and then later
he took her aside and he said

117
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,860
two things to her. He said, I've
come but you have not fixed

118
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,700
bindi, which is the spot that
Indian women wear on their Ford,

119
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,420
is an indication that they're
married. And he also criticized

120
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,260
her for wearing a white sari
instead of a colorful sari. And

121
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,560
the tradition in India is when
you become a widow, you don't

122
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,460
wear color from the rest of your
life, you wear only white.

123
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,240
Essentially, this five year old
boy was saying to this 35 year

124
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,380
old woman, I've come but you're
acting like you're not married.

125
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,000
They know the inner architecture
of homes that they've never been

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,180
in. They know people who owed
them money when they died and

127
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,340
the debt had not been collected.
In one case, this little child

128
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,240
was brought back to the home of
the previous personality, and

129
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,260
the wife of the previous
personality said, Okay, if

130
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,300
you're my husband, where did you
put the will? We couldn't. Find

131
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,680
the will. The little boy walked
over to a floorboard in the

132
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,560
kitchen, pulled up the
floorboard and pulled the will

133
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,620
out of this little secret place
that only he knew about in the

134
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:16,320
floor of the kitchen. Cases like
that drive my philosophical

135
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,920
colleagues at the University
right up a wall. They don't know

136
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,420
what to do with it. It's hard
for them deny it, but there it

137
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:30,620
is. Some patterns in the data,
the average time interval

138
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,860
between the death of the first
personality and the birth of the

139
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,120
second personality. Stevens
finds about two and a half years

140
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,460
the average distance between the
life place of the first

141
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,600
personality and the life place
of the second personality, 50

142
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,700
miles. And these children tend
to lose their memories around

143
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,660
the year, around eight years
old, when they become begins to

144
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,260
get into school and in a more
complex social environment, they

145
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,400
basically forget. They lose
their memories. So we're looking

146
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,300
at a small time window from
research, from about three years

147
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,780
old to eight years old, a five
minute time window to get to

148
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,500
these children and document
their memories. The remaining

149
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
90% forget them by the time
they're eight. The remaining 10%

150
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,260
the vast majority of those,
forget them when they hit

151
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,700
puberty, when they hit puberty.
You know, all hell breaks loose,

152
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,060
and they forget their subtle
traces of their former lives.

153
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,840
Stevenson asked, why do these
children remember what most of

154
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,240
us forget? And his answer is, he
doesn't know we need more

155
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,960
research. It's all research. He
has a hypothesis. He points out

156
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,840
that about 60% of these children
died violently in their previous

157
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:57,760
life. The remaining 40% died
either early, suddenly or with

158
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,460
an acute sense of unfinished
business, like a mother who dies

159
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,860
shortly after the birth of her
baby. His hypothesis is maybe

160
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,980
there's something about the
trauma of being wrenched from

161
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,640
life violently, suddenly with an
acute sense of unfinished

162
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,960
business that encodes the
consciousness in a way that

163
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,840
draws them back faster than
usual and closer than usual,

164
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,780
because this time, I don't have
time to give all the evidence,

165
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,560
but this two and a half and 52
and a half years 50 miles, is

166
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,180
faster than the population at
large and closer to home than

167
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,320
the population at large.

168
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,299
In reviewing 20 cases suggestive
of reincarnation, the Journal of

169
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,319
American Medical Association,
wrote Stevenson has

170
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:54,879
painstakingly and unemotionally
collected a detailed series of

171
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,199
cases in which the evidence for
reincarnation is difficult to

172
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:04,259
understand on other grounds. Two
years later, the Journal of

173
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,319
Nervous and Mental disease, a
major psychiatric journal in the

174
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,099
United States, published an
entire journal devoted to

175
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:15,119
Stevenson's cases. And that it
was such an unusual move that

176
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:19,139
they published an editorial to
justify or to explain their

177
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,479
rationale, and in the editorial
they wrote, Our decision to

178
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:28,039
publish this material recognizes
the legitimacy of his research

179
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:31,879
methods and the conformity of
his reasoning to the usual

180
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,079
canons of rational thought.
That's the way an academic

181
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:44,439
qualifies their endorsement. Now
the philosophical institution,

182
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:49,479
the guardians of Orthodoxy, are
not going to let Stevenson get

183
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:53,199
away with this, not without a
fight. And he has had his

184
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,719
critics, and the most important
critic is a man named Paul

185
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:01,799
Edwards. And I promise you, this
is the best picture I could find

186
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,719
of Paul Edwards online. His book
reincarnation, a critical

187
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:12,179
examination. Paul Edwards was a
major American philosopher. He

188
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:16,079
taught at the New School for
Social Research. He's best known

189
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,719
for having been the editor in
chief of the eight volume

190
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:25,759
Encyclopedia of Philosophy. So
he's a major heavyweight in the

191
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:31,159
philosophical tradition. He
wrote a series of articles in

192
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:37,399
1986 to 87 a four part article
on reincarnation. And eventually

193
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,779
he published these articles in a
later form, in this book

194
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:47,499
reincarnation and his he is the
harshest critic of Stevenson. He

195
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:53,199
accuses Stevenson of fraud. He
accuses Stevenson of not being

196
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,399
sufficiently rigorous in his
analysis of the data. He accuses

197
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:02,579
Stevenson of not not. Actually
verifying that he thinks that

198
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,759
there could have been contact
between the two families, that

199
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,359
Stevenson isn't really critical
in proving that these families,

200
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,699
the first and second
personality, have never had

201
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:16,439
contact. But there's actually a
deeper you know, to accuse

202
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:20,599
someone of bad research and to
prove bad research two different

203
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:24,139
things. And if you go through
Stevenson's arguments very

204
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,279
carefully, I'm sorry, Edwards
arguments very carefully, you

205
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,279
see that there's kind of a
deeper logic operating in his

206
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,019
work. He says reincarnation
would represent a crucifixion of

207
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,479
our understanding. And by our
understanding he means secular

208
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:43,959
humanism, the philosophical
scientific tradition, the

209
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,559
Newtonian, Cartesian
philosophical tradition. He

210
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:50,859
says, If you believe in
reincarnation, you must accept

211
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:55,479
what he calls six collateral
assumptions. And these

212
00:15:55,479 --> 00:16:03,179
collateral assumptions are that
materialism is false, that that

213
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:10,079
mind is not reducible to brain,
that our identity is more than

214
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,119
our personality, that there is a
domain other than space time,

215
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:22,039
that death is an illusion, that
there may be a deeper logic to

216
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:28,219
our lives. Edwards says these
assumptions are surely

217
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:32,659
fantastic, if not indeed
nonsense, and even in the

218
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:37,699
absence of a demonstration of
specific flaws, a rational

219
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:41,259
person will conclude either that
Stevenson's reports are

220
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:45,639
seriously defective, or that his
alleged facts can be explained

221
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,999
without bringing in
reincarnation. Well, I won't go

222
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:57,639
over Edwards arguments more
carefully, because Robert Robert

223
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,599
almeter has done this for us.
Robert almiter is another major

224
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,399
American philosopher. He is
Professor Emeritus at Georgia

225
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:11,639
State University. He has
authored, or co authored 24

226
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:17,579
books. He wrote this book in
which he is evaluating five

227
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,339
categories of evidence for
survival of death, the major

228
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:26,299
analysis he's doing in this book
is the debate between Stevenson

229
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:31,279
and Edwards. And what he shows
by analyzing Edwards argument is

230
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,939
that Edwards does not refute
Stevenson's argument. What he

231
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:39,139
does is refuse to even look at
it seriously, because he is so

232
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:44,139
convinced that it must be false.
He says his argument constitutes

233
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:48,759
a blatant bit of question
begging, because he always

234
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,539
assumes precisely what is in
contention. What is in

235
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:59,139
contention is, Can consciousness
exist without a brain? And

236
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:02,459
because he believes that science
has proven that consciousness

237
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:06,599
can exist without a brain,
therefore we know that there

238
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:11,699
must be something wrong with the
evidence. Albert says if you

239
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:15,839
have a very commanding argument
that you can that you cannot

240
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,227
refute, then not to accept the
argument is to act irrationally.

241
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:29,027
Stevenson's tradition continues,
even though he's passed on, he's

242
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:31,847
now looking from the bleacher
seats, watching us from there

243
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:36,707
this book by Tom Schroeder, old
souls. Tom Schroeder wins the

244
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:41,379
definitely wins for having the
award for having the worst cover

245
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:47,019
of any book in reincarnation
research. But Tom Schroeder is

246
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:50,379
an interesting guy. He's a
reporter. He's a Pulitzer Prize

247
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,679
winning reporter. He's also one
of the editors for The

248
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,639
Washington Post, a major
American newspaper, and he was

249
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:01,259
interested in whether
Stevenson's research could stand

250
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:05,459
up to a critical reporter's eye.
So he went with Stevenson on one

251
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:08,399
of his trips around the world,
studying these small children.

252
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:12,899
He looked over his shoulder, and
he came away convinced, as the

253
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:16,439
subtitle shows, compelling
evidence from children who

254
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:21,259
remember past lives, convinced
that this Stevenson's methods

255
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:25,159
were good, the data would stand
up. These children were real.

256
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,599
This is a compelling case for
reincarnation, and at the

257
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,079
University of Virginia,
Stevenson's work continues in

258
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,919
the person of Jim Tucker, who
has now inherited Stevenson's

259
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:42,999
chair. This book is a wonderful
book, very much in the Stevenson

260
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:47,439
tradition, continuing to look in
detail, the detail cases, and

261
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:52,059
explaining why these cases
cannot be attributed to weaker

262
00:19:52,119 --> 00:20:00,479
hypotheses like super psi or
something like this. I. Might

263
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:04,799
mention that Jim Tucker's book
is a lot easier to read than

264
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,239
Stevenson's book. Stevenson
writes and thinks like a lawyer.

265
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,759
It's very good, but it's very,
very detailed, very dry. Jim

266
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,779
Tucker brings a little more life
to the subject matter. Now

267
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:24,139
everything we've been looking at
so far has to do with what I

268
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,259
would call the evidence from
spontaneous memories, just

269
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,459
children who spontaneously have
memories of previous life. But

270
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,579
there's another body of evidence
you have to approach it with a

271
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:38,719
different framework. It's evoked
memories, memories which have

272
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:42,579
been evoked in some way,
different techniques, even

273
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:46,419
massage, can evoke a former life
memory, but the most common one

274
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,359
that we're familiar with is
hypnotherapy, some type of

275
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,839
hypnosis. The following cases,
the following books are

276
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:56,739
representative titles of people
who have worked in the field of

277
00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:02,579
past life therapy. My favorite
book written by a single

278
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:07,019
therapist who has worked in the
area of past life therapy and

279
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,579
has thought about it a great
deal. Is this book by Roger

280
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:17,459
Wilber. Notice the date an
earlier book, other lives, other

281
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:21,859
cells, started as a Jungian,
ended up in past life therapy,

282
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:25,039
doing past life's work, even
though Carl Jung, I don't know

283
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,039
whether you probably know, he
himself, believed in

284
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,219
reincarnation towards the later
years of his life, but he kind

285
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:36,559
of kept it quiet. This is a
wonderful book, intellectually,

286
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,399
totally competent, a wonderful
review of detailed cases and a

287
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:47,439
discussion of the implications
of these cases. Past life

288
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,399
therapy began to really explode
in the 70s, 80s, and there were

289
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:54,219
a lot of therapists who were
concerned that there was not a

290
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:57,219
graduate school, there was no
curriculum, there was no agreed

291
00:21:57,219 --> 00:22:00,899
upon curriculum for how to
establish the credentials for

292
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:04,499
people who wanted to do past
life therapy. And this task was

293
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:11,159
taken on by Winifred Lucas, who
wrote a magnificent two volume

294
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,539
anthology, which is a compendium
of essays and articles of the

295
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,319
best of the best of the people
working at that time in past

296
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,659
life therapy. So if you wanted
to read a single book, I would

297
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:28,459
read Wilbers book by one author.
But if you wanted to see an

298
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:31,939
overview of multiple people
writing in the field, I would go

299
00:22:31,939 --> 00:22:36,019
to Winifred Lucas' book
regression therapy, a handbook

300
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,399
for professionals.

301
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:49,576
Carol Bowman was a social
worker. She wasn't interested in

302
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:54,256
past life therapy. She got into
it because her son started

303
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:58,216
having nightmares. He started
waking up with very disturbing

304
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:01,980
nightmares, and she approached
him. She tried to work with him,

305
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,740
took him to therapist, tried to
do conventional things, but it

306
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,220
didn't work. And then she began
to do her homework. She began to

307
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,460
look into past life therapy. She
began to learn the field, and

308
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,740
she began to help her own child
solve his own trauma carried

309
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,040
over from a previous life that
was both spontaneously bubbling

310
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,120
up in his life, she began to
attract other people, with other

311
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,300
children who are also having
problems, and eventually she

312
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,680
wrote this beautiful book,
specifically a therapeutic book

313
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,020
for parents who have children
who are having traumatic memory

314
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,640
surface that they're having
difficulty dealing with was very

315
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,440
successful, very persuasive. It
really made, had a lot of

316
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,160
impact. She got more business
coming in, she wrote a second

317
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,300
book. She gets the award for the
second worst title, a cover on

318
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,020
reincarnation book, return from
heaven. She's looking

319
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,540
specifically at relatives who
have been reincarnated within

320
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,460
their own families. Now, as a
philosopher, that's a weaker

321
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,300
body of evidence, right? Because
there's so much potential for

322
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,240
contamination if you're
remembering your grandfather.

323
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,440
But as a father, this is
interesting. It's interesting,

324
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,440
because reincarnation simply
doesn't happen where it works

325
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,500
well for the researchers, across
great distances and great

326
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,280
families, but inside families is
a very common occurrence, and

327
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:41,560
therefore it deserves to be
looked at and next. Michael

328
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,600
Newton, two wonderful books, and
I must confess a special

329
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,560
partiality if you want to read
some, if you wanted to just pick

330
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,460
out one or two books out of this
entire list, I can't help but

331
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,840
wish that you would read Michael
Newton's work. Michael Newton

332
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,360
was a hip. Therapist who got
into past life therapy and was

333
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,740
doing past life therapy, and
then he accidentally discovered

334
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,820
that his clients in deep
hypnosis had the ability not

335
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,720
only to remember their previous
life, but to remember what

336
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,440
happened to them after they
died. They could remember

337
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,820
basically his clients were
beginning to describe the

338
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,900
afterlife, and he thought, he
didn't think this was possible,

339
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,000
but he followed his clients,
good therapist that he is, and

340
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,860
he took hundreds of people into
deep hypnotic regressions, and

341
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,680
he followed them when they would
go through their former life and

342
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,160
they would go through the death
experience, he would follow them

343
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,600
into their memories, continuing
on, and then he would ask them

344
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,680
questions. And he kept detailed
notes. He would ask questions

345
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,620
about, what was this? What was
going on, what was it like? And

346
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,540
what he found was, regardless of
what background people came

347
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,760
from, whatever their cultural
enculturation was fundamentalist

348
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:09,540
Baptist, Carl, Marxist, atheist,
hard core, scientific

349
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,660
reductionist, whatever their
background was, people were

350
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,440
describing the same fundamental
reality in the after death

351
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,480
state. They were describing a
world that had order, that had

352
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,220
structure that had logic. There
was actually a social structure.

353
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,940
It was a world in which older
learners taught younger

354
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,020
learners. And it was also a
world where people made the

355
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,340
choice to reincarnate as a
conscious, careful decision.

356
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,780
It's one of the most important
choices you make if you go to

357
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,520
college, what courses you sign
up for, that's an important

358
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,860
choice, because once you sign up
for a course, you're committed

359
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,240
for the entire semester. When
you incarnate, what life you

360
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,980
take on is an important choice.
And Michael Newton found that,

361
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,440
in fact, in the spiritual world,
the choice of what life to take

362
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,660
is a consciously taken choice,
made under the guidance of your

363
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,260
spiritual helpers and made in
cooperation with the other

364
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,220
persons that you're going to be
incarnating with. So before we

365
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:20,720
knew, before we were born, when
we knew more than we know now,

366
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,900
when we were aware of more than
we are aware now, we chose the

367
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:34,460
life that we are living now,
that fact alone just bears deep

368
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,660
meditation. Two last examples,
not from professionals, they're

369
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,900
from amateurs, but that's what
makes them interesting. The

370
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,080
first is this book looking for
Carol Beckwith, and what makes

371
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,100
it interesting is the man who
wrote it, Robert snow. Because

372
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,120
Robert snow is the commander of
the homicide division of the

373
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,840
Indianapolis Police Department.
All right, so he's Chief of

374
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,900
Detectives of he investigates
murders. His opinion is very

375
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,740
important. It must stand up in
court. He would be the last

376
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,440
person that you would think
would be doing research on a

377
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,700
former life. But it happened
that he kind of, he did a hypno

378
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,300
a hypnotic session not oriented
towards past lives. He just kind

379
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,280
of on a lark, he did the
hypnotic session, and in this

380
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,240
hypnotic session, he was hit in
the face with a life that

381
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,520
appeared to be his life, but it
was it scared him to death, and

382
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,380
he literally ran out of the
room. But he was curious, and so

383
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,080
he brought all of his detective
skills to the systematic search

384
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,100
to see if he could identify and
track down whether there was

385
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,640
such a person. And the story of
his experience and the story of

386
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,560
his detective work is told in
this short book, looking for

387
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:00,780
Carol Beckwith. And lastly, this
book Sole Survivor, which you

388
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,440
may have seen it because they
did some news clips, decent news

389
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,700
clips on it, written by Bruce
and Andrew leininga about their

390
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,720
son, James. And this is a case
of a child, three years old, two

391
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,760
years old, who started having
spontaneous memories and trauma,

392
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,140
waking up crying in the middle
of the night, spontaneous

393
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,060
memories of appear, apparently
dying in World War Two as an

394
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:33,020
airplane pilot over the over the
coast of Japan. And his father

395
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,740
was a fundamentalist Baptist,
and he was absolutely,

396
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,720
vehemently opposed to his son
reincarnating. Mother was a

397
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,500
little more receptive. So they
got involved in first they

398
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,480
wanted to help their son, but he
got involved in the the inquiry

399
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,340
because he wanted to disprove
reincarnation, whatever was

400
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,180
going on with James. He wanted
to disprove reincarnation to

401
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,836
protect his faith. In the end,
they tracked down this pilot.

402
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,496
They tracked down the story.
They were able to reunite James

403
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:12,996
with the people at a military
reunion, with the people who had

404
00:30:12,996 --> 00:30:16,656
served with this pilot. And
James was able to identify

405
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:20,016
people out of this group. The
father became convinced that, in

406
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:24,200
fact, his son was a
reincarnation of this pilot, and

407
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:32,180
reincarnation is true. Now I'd
like to just finish with two,

408
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,840
two observations. Quick
observation says lunch awaits.

409
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,400
I'd like to emphasize what we
don't know about reincarnation.

410
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,740
The evidence for reincarnation
may be compelling. However, we

411
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,700
don't really know a lot about
how reincarnation takes place,

412
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,320
or what the physics of rebirth
is. We're still beginners in

413
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,860
this at this point, we can't say
what the soul is, or what it's

414
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:07,980
made of. How does it come and go
from the physical body? How does

415
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,780
it interface with our biology
and our genetic makeup? How does

416
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,280
it encode its previous learning
into our present body? And how

417
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,620
does it leave with its learning
intact after we die, these

418
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,340
things right now are beyond our
present grasp. I'm sure we'll

419
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,880
make progress in the future, but
before we do, we're going to

420
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,580
have to start we're going to
have to stop reducing mind to

421
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,700
brain, and we're going to be
have to approach this research

422
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,240
with a more multi dimensional
metaphysical cosmology. And

423
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,560
lastly, I'd like to point to a
certain paradox in the evidence.

424
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,400
And to do this paradox, I need
to really go back to Ian

425
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,500
Stevenson. Stevenson's evidence,
I think, is the most powerful

426
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,280
evidence for reincarnation, and
his evidence liberates our

427
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,440
thinking at one level, but it
also constricts our thinking at

428
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,120
another. Because the strongest
evidence for reincarnation comes

429
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,760
from lives that show the
tightest connection, the

430
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,300
tightest correlation. But the
correlation can be so tight it

431
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,680
can lead, if you just study
Stevenson's evidence, it can

432
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,400
lead to a

433
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:29,299
anemic an under developed vision
of what life is like when we

434
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:32,959
die, when most of us die. In
that respect, we must remember

435
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:36,859
that Stevenson's cases are not
typical cases. These children

436
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:41,019
are coming back very fast and
very close to home. Most people

437
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,799
spend much more quote time in
the timeless condition of the

438
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:51,519
spirit world. They have a much
wider breadth of experiences. So

439
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:57,519
Stevenson's evidence liberates
us to thinking about the soul

440
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,139
and thinking about our lives and
thinking about our existence in

441
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:04,919
a much larger, expanded
framework. But in order to

442
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,479
actually fill in that Canvas, in
order to actually explore more

443
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:13,439
deeply what happens to us when
we die, and what the larger

444
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:16,799
circle of life is like, from
expanded consciousness to

445
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,379
contracted consciousness and
back into expanded

446
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:23,179
consciousness, we need to look
at other bodies of data. I think

447
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:26,179
Michael Newton's work is an
important body of data that

448
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:29,299
gives us a larger vision. And
this afternoon, when I talk

449
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:33,079
about psychedelic research, I'll
look at another body of data,

450
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:36,439
which I think can give us an
expanded vision of our life in

451
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:38,959
this universe. Thank you very
much. Applause.

452
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,120
Unknown: Again, Chris, again.
Thank you so much. This was,

453
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,360
again a real experience to
listen to you, and I so much

454
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,440
like how you how you make clear
that this is the knowledge which

455
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,280
makes really such a difference
how we live our life, which

456
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,460
makes such a difference how we
approach every minute in our

457
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,280
life. If this is true or not,
makes the real difference. Like,

458
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,980
I think all the three speakers
of this session fitted together

459
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,180
so well. It's, I think it's so
much arranged, and it's really

460
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:37,820
the core of the Institute for
existential consciousness,

461
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,880
because these are the real
existential questions. And there

462
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,780
is a scientific basis, and we
have to bring it to society to

463
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,840
make a shift in consciousness
again. So thank you very much,

464
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,900
and I'm so much looking forward
to your next lecture. You.

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,900
My guests today are Michael
Pollan and Chris Bache. I'll

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,060
introduce Michael first. Michael
is the author of eight books,

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,300
including how to change your
mind. Michael, say something,

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,820
because Chris's voice is,
picture is on the screen.

17
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,240
Michael Pollan: Yeah. Hi, Rick,
hi Chris, perfect to be here.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,300
Rick Archer: There we go.
There's Michael. Mike, I think

19
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,020
Chris sniffled or something,
brought him up. He's the author

20
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,480
of eight books, including how to
change your mind, which is the

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,140
one we're going to be talking
about today, and the number of

22
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,180
books about food, including
cooked food rules in defense of

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,620
food, The Omnivore's Dilemma and
the Botany of Desire, all of

24
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,440
which were New York Times
bestsellers. Michael is a

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,620
longtime contributor to the New
York Times Magazine. He also

26
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,440
teaches writing at Harvard and
the University of California,

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,880
Berkeley, where he is the John S
and James L Knight, Professor of

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,100
science journalism in 2010 Time
Magazine named him one of the

29
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:16,440
100 most influential people in
the world. Okay, Chris Bache has

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,320
been on batgap before in a panel
discussion about five or six

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,460
years ago, you go ahead and say
something, Chris, so your

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,100
Chris Bache: picture Good to be
here, looking forward to our

33
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,200
conversation today. Good. There
you go.

34
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,080
Rick Archer: My software
switches back and forth

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,380
according to who's talking.
Chris is a professor emeritus in

36
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,620
the Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at Youngstown

37
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,900
State University where he taught
for 33 years. He's also adjunct

38
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,600
faculty at the California
Institute of integral studies

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,900
and a fellow at the Institute of
Noetic Sciences, an award

40
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,840
winning teacher. Chris' work
explores the philosophical

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,720
implications of Non-ordinary
states of consciousness,

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,740
especially psychedelic states.
Chris has written four books,

43
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,300
life cycles, a study of
reincarnation in light of

44
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,440
contemporary consciousness,
research dark night, early dawn,

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,320
a pioneering work in cycle,
psychedelic philosophy and

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,820
collective consciousness and the
living classroom, an exploration

47
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,960
of teaching and collective
fields of consciousness. His new

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,220
book is LSD and the mind of the
universe, and get the cover up.

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,180
That's Michael's book. LSD, in
the mind of the universe,

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,760
diamonds from heaven. And I
didn't show Chris Michael's book

51
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,400
when I mentioned it. Here's a
picture of Michael's book, how

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,120
to change your mind. The
subtitle is what the new science

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,360
of psychedelics teaches us about
consciousness, dying, addiction,

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,380
depression and Transcendence. So
it's great to have you guys as

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,020
I've been really looking forward
to this and really enjoying

56
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,560
preparing for it, and there's
been a lot of excitement, I

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,900
think, among the batgap
listeners and viewers. In fact,

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,740
I mentioned this interview the
other day on some Facebook

59
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,360
group. I mentioned Michael
Pollan's name, and some guy said

60
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:11,100
the food guy. Michael, how did
you, how did you switch, if you

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,460
did from being the food guy to
invest into exploring

62
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,240
psychedelics.

63
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,979
Michael Pollan: Well, before I
was the food guy, I was, I was

64
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:22,159
kind of the nature guy. I've
always been interested the

65
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:25,159
reason I got into food is I was
very interested in the in the

66
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,419
reciprocal relationship between
people and particularly plants,

67
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:34,099
but other species in general,
and CO evolution, and in book

68
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,979
you mentioned earlier, the
Botany of Desire, I had looked

69
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,319
at this whole question of
domesticated plants and propose

70
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,679
the idea that they manipulate us
as much as we manipulate them,

71
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:49,299
and that that a very fine
evolutionary strategy for a

72
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:53,319
select group of plants, and this
is true for animals too, is to

73
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,339
figure out. And by that I mean
you know, through trial and

74
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:02,519
error, natural selection or.
Visual selection, what sorts of

75
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,859
how, how to gratify human
desire. And a big human desire,

76
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,079
obviously, is for food. And
that's, that's what most

77
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:14,459
domesticated plants have worked
on, that strategy. But beauty is

78
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,599
another. And I mean, there's a
whole bunch of them, and but the

79
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:23,839
one that I found most curious is
is the plants that thrive by

80
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,159
gratifying our desire to change
consciousness. And so in that

81
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:33,379
book, I wrote a long chapter on
cannabis and and looking at the

82
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:40,159
you know how it has served the
cannabis plant to basically

83
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:43,479
through trial and error, figure
out how to engage with the whole

84
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,319
receptor network in our brains
and elsewhere in our body. And

85
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,759
so I've had this long standing
interest in in plant medicines

86
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,679
and psychoactive plants. And so
that was and I kind of laid

87
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,979
that, you know, aside while I
was doing all this food research

88
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,059
for the last several years, and
then stumbled on this new

89
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:06,539
research going on to use
Psilocybin specifically, which I

90
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:11,999
realize is not a plant, but a
fungus. Mushroom to Well, no,

91
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:14,759
it's technically, it's not. It's
another kingdom entirely.

92
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,619
Actually, we're more like fungi
than we are like plants. Plants

93
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:22,699
are primary producers. They can
take sunlight and make food from

94
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:26,959
it. We are parasitic on them,
and so are mushrooms. So we

95
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:33,139
share that we depend on plants
use of photosynthesis anyway, I

96
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,319
heard about this research giving
Psilocybin to people who were

97
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,659
had terminal cancer, and that it
was helping them deal with the

98
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:44,319
prospect of death or the fear of
recurrence. And this struck me

99
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,819
as a very curious, very curious
thing to do. On its face, I

100
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:53,739
didn't see the logic of it and
and then I was also, kind of, as

101
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:57,099
journalists do, picking up that
there was something in the air

102
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,039
around psychedelics right now,
and that there was a kind of

103
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,339
renewed interest that was very
serious from a scientific or

104
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:11,159
philosophical point of view. And
that came, I was at a dinner

105
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,759
party and with a group of
people. I didn't know it was a

106
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,819
long table and a big house, and
I heard down at the end of the

107
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,139
table this woman who looked at
beauty about my age, talking

108
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,099
about her acid trip, and I
figured she was talking about

109
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:27,799
some college adventure. And then
I listened a little closely, and

110
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:31,219
it was a couple of weeks ago,
and here she was, she's very

111
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,339
prominent developmental
psychologist, talking about the

112
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:38,599
insights into the consciousness
of children that her new

113
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,059
acquaintance with LSD had given
her. And so as journalists, we

114
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:45,819
put together a couple of data
points, and that was enough to

115
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,039
convince me that there's
something going on here that I

116
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,459
want to look into so that that's
kind of how it happened. I was

117
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,839
also just thrilled to have a new
topic as rich as this and and

118
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,839
one that, you know, I mean, I
was a total neophyte when it

119
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,239
comes to spiritual matters,
neuro scientific matters,

120
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:07,859
psychological matters. So to me,
the great thing about writing

121
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:11,159
books and being a journalist and
not a specialist is you get to

122
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,879
master whole new topics as an
adult, and you get paid to do

123
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,499
it. It's kind of a gig.

124
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,919
Rick Archer: Yeah, I kind of
feel that way doing this. It's

125
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,219
although it's pretty much the
same topic, but a different

126
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:28,819
flavor of it every week, and I
love just focusing on it. So one

127
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:31,819
thing that comes through in your
book, Michael, is that, and one

128
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,299
thing you just kind of alluded
to, is that there's certain

129
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,719
intelligence in the plant
kingdom, and also, and

130
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,619
specifically in the psychedelic
plant kingdom that you know,

131
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:47,859
they're not just dumb chemicals.
It's almost as if there's a

132
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:52,539
spirit of the of the plants,
which has an agenda, which has

133
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:56,379
an initiative, which wants, in
some people's estimation, to

134
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:01,559
foster human evolution by
providing themselves to us as

135
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,499
means of shifting our
consciousness. You want to touch

136
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:06,059
upon that a little bit?

137
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,220
Michael Pollan: Yeah, I don't
think I would go that far, or I

138
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,400
haven't had evidence to go that
far, that plants are bearing a

139
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,280
message and trying to get us to
save them or save the planet. It

140
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,440
could be true, but I don't have
evidence of that. But I've, have

141
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,480
written on plant intelligence,
and I'm I'm constantly amazed at

142
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,380
what plants can do and how much
we underestimate them. You know,

143
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,780
we're learning now that plants
have a pretty elaborate

144
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,320
communications network, that the
trees in a forest convey

145
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,920
messages using mycelium, which
are the filaments of mushrooms,

146
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,780
to send messages to trade
nutrients that the trees and

147
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,900
forest can warn each other when
there's a threat, and when they

148
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,660
when they told to that threat,
they'll actually change their

149
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,440
flavor and in their leaves to
make them less appealing to

150
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,360
insects, or they'll start
producing toxins a very. Various

151
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,640
kinds. Plants have memory,
plants, plants are intelligent.

152
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,180
I have no question about that.
It has something to do with how

153
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,680
you define intelligence, of
course, but a basic definition

154
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,980
is a problem solving ability
that their reactions to

155
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,260
situations are not simply
automatic or instinctual, but

156
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,980
that they can deal with novel
threats in novel ways, and that

157
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,960
they can remember things too.
There have been some very

158
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,640
interesting trials. Monica
Gagliano is a botanist who's

159
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,160
who's demonstrated that that
plants can remember and store

160
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,820
information in a way. So I have
enormous respect for them. I

161
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,000
think that they do have we have
to acknowledge they have a kind

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,920
of subjectivity the way we do.
They're conscious, not in the

163
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,120
sense I think we normally mean
by that word, which also folds

164
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,960
in ideas of self consciousness
and a subjective sense of what

165
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,960
it's like to be Chris Bache or
Rick Archer or Michael Pollan, I

166
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,900
don't, I don't. I don't have any
reason to believe they have

167
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,800
that, but they have a point of
view, and they have interests,

168
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,940
and they pursue these in a
different way than we do, and

169
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,920
they're conscious in the sense
of being aware of their

170
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,080
environment and responding
appropriately.

171
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,940
Rick Archer: We may get into
this later, but some say that,

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,300
you know, consciousness is
fundamental, and matter is sort

173
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,640
of an epic phenomenon of
consciousness, rather than the

174
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,240
other way around, and that all
forms of matter reflect or

175
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,360
express consciousness to varying
degrees, even a stone and

176
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,980
obviously way On up the
evolutionary ladder. But let's

177
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,340
table that for for a little bit
later. So you heard, you

178
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,740
overheard this conversation at
the dinner party. And so how did

179
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,520
you proceed? I know you
proceeded in many cases with a

180
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,420
great deal of what every case
with a great deal of caution and

181
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,940
seriousness, reluctance,
trepidations. You were often

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,300
unable to sleep the night before
a session because you were sort

183
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,100
of anxious about what might
happen.

184
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:10,679
Michael Pollan: So, you know,
the idea of even having a

185
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,919
session came, you know, came a
little later. The first thing I

186
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,899
did was reach out to an editor
at the New Yorker and say, I've

187
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,219
got a really cool story I want
to write about these trials,

188
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,519
interview the people who are who
are going on these Psilocybin

189
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,459
journeys, talk to the
scientists, try to understand

190
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,439
the neuroscience of it and the
psychology. And to my delight,

191
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:36,619
they were willing to underwrite
that project. So that was the

192
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:39,739
beginning of my investigation,
and I wrote a piece for The New

193
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:45,879
Yorker, which came out in
February 2015 called the trip

194
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,899
treatment, and it's available
online for free. And if you just

195
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:53,979
search that, and that was a kind
of straight ahead piece of

196
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:57,339
science journalism, there was no
participatory angle to it. I

197
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,179
don't think they would have
published it if there were. It

198
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,659
was all like white coats and
scientists and and patients,

199
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,139
volunteers and but the
interviews were extraordinary,

200
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,099
and the people I met and the
kinds of transformative

201
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:15,419
experiences that a single
psychedelic journey had given

202
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,359
them completely resetting their
attitude toward death, lifting

203
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,399
their fear entirely. In many

204
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,640
Rick Archer: cases, any cancer
patients, I'm sorry, cancer

205
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,240
patients,

206
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,420
Michael Pollan: these are cancer
patients, yeah, with serious

207
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,620
diagnoses. I mean, some were
terminal, some were paralyzed by

208
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,000
fear and anxiety at the threat
of a recurrence. But in all

209
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,720
ways, they were. They had this,
what the doctors call

210
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,700
existential distress and and
they found relief in about 80%

211
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,720
of the cases, which is quite
remarkable, and it's a single

212
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,060
intervention. I mean, we don't
have much like that in

213
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,000
psychiatry, right? Or palliative
care, you know, we have morphine

214
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,060
we give people which dulls their
perception and relieves their

215
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,500
pain but doesn't, doesn't help
them spiritually, deal with the

216
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,460
situation they're in.

217
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,760
Rick Archer: Tell us some more
anecdotes, and give us an

218
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,700
overview of the research that's
taking place. And it's not only

219
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,120
cancer patients, but alcoholics
and depressed people and right?

220
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,140
And so it

221
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Michael Pollan: started with
cancer patients. You know, the

222
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,480
first kind of clinical
applications, and the reason for

223
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,040
that is a couple. One is it's a
sympathetic group. The

224
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,280
regulators are a little less
worried about any potential

225
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,020
toxicity in the case of people
who have terminal diagnoses. In

226
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,960
the same way that you know
people with AIDS, they would,

227
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,540
they were willing to give drugs
that hadn't been thoroughly

228
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,980
vetted yet if people wanted to
take them. So there was a

229
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,980
comfort level, I think, for the
regulators, and a sympathetic

230
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,900
angle for the for the public in
general. I mean, how could you

231
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,080
withhold this from someone who
was dying and had fear, you

232
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,720
know, tremendous fear. And here
was something that promised to

233
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,380
to lift it. But since then.
Since the success of those

234
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,120
trials, there have been several
others looking at different

235
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,960
indications, medical
indications, an important one

236
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,920
that's being worked on now is
depression. And this grew out of

237
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,820
the the cancer trials in that
they saw that depression scores,

238
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,260
as the psychologists measure
them, had dropped significantly,

239
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,820
and so the FDA actually
encouraged the researchers to

240
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,400
Why don't you look at depression
more widely? Because this is a

241
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,880
tremendous problem. The tools we
have to treat it are very poor.

242
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,340
Rates of depression are rising
rapidly. I think a big question

243
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,680
remains is whether depression is
one thing, and if the kind of

244
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,480
depression that a cancer patient
experiences is similar to the

245
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,180
kind of depression of someone
who has a, you know, general

246
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,880
depression or treatment
resistant depression for years

247
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,020
and years and years, the cancer
patients depression is recent,

248
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,280
very often and has a has a
clearly defined cause. And

249
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,360
that's not true for everyone
struggling with depression. So

250
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,540
we'll see. We'll see if it
works. There's some evidence

251
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,020
that it will. There was a trial
at Imperial College in London of

252
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,840
depressive patients treatment
resistant. I believe they were,

253
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,600
and many of them, most of them,
showed significant but short

254
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,300
lived results. They their, their
depression lifted for a couple

255
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,560
months, and then gradually it
returned, not in all cases, but

256
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,520
in most of them. So there's,
there's encouraging reason to

257
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,640
pursue this. And there, there
are two big trials going on

258
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,180
right now for depression are
about to get started. There have

259
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,640
been, as you suggest, trials for
addiction in in alcoholics and

260
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,200
cigarette smokers and cocaine
addicts and those, in a

261
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,900
preliminary way, are showing
very promising results. And I

262
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,600
think that's interesting, and
may turn out to be, I think

263
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,380
behavioral change may be one of
the really big applications of

264
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,400
psychedelics. With that in mind,
they're looking at Johns hop

265
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,480
Johns Hopkins, I think, is going
to look at eating disorders, and

266
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,040
that's very important, because
anorexia is actually the hardest

267
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,500
psychiatric illness to treat,
and has the lowest rates of

268
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,440
success and the highest
mortality of all psychiatric

269
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,740
problems. So I think if we can
make progress on that, it'd be

270
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,940
fantastic. Let's see what else
is being tried. There was a

271
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,780
small trial of obsession,
obsessive compulsive disorder,

272
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,140
and there'll be more work with
that. The drugs have been used

273
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,460
with high functioning autistic
people who have social anxiety

274
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,260
and that that result has been
encouraging also. So there's a

275
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,140
whole range and to people who
think, well, how can psychedelic

276
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,180
be such a panacea? I think it's
important to note that the kinds

277
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:54,160
of problems it works on or seems
to be effective with have a lot

278
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,360
in common. They're all at the
end of the spectrum where

279
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,940
people's thinking becomes too
rigid, too trapped in deep

280
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,440
grooves of habit, whether mental
habit or behavioral habit,

281
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,640
people are in these loops and
they can't break out of them.

282
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,480
And what the psychedelics seem
to do is is a real jolt to the

283
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,920
system, and gives people the
kind of perspective on their

284
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,580
lives that can actually break
mental habit, and it needs to be

285
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,160
accompanied by lots of
therapeutic intervention. These

286
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,740
aren't people going off and
having a Psilocybin trip in the

287
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,340
woods alone. These are guided
trips, and I think it's a really

288
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,660
important distinction. People
are very carefully prepared in

289
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,560
advance, told what to expect,
how to deal with difficulties

290
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,440
that will come up if they you
know, because it can be a very,

291
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,220
very frightening things can
happen, especially if you're if

292
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,360
you're facing your mortality,
and then during the experience,

293
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,680
the guides are with you the
whole time in the university

294
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,120
trials. Are usually two guys, a
man and a woman, and they're not

295
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,600
saying very much. It's very non
interventionist. The idea is to

296
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,680
basically give you a sense of
safety so you can surrender to

297
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,500
what can be a very disturbing
set of mental events. And then

298
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,160
after the session, you come
back, usually the next day, or

299
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,360
in the next couple days, and you
have what's called an

300
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,860
integration session, where you
tell the therapist what you saw,

301
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,340
what happened, what you're
puzzled by, and with the

302
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,360
therapist, you try to kind of
come to some interpretation of

303
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,020
what's happened and figure out
how you can take the lessons,

304
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,820
the insights of That trip and
apply them to the conduct of

305
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,360
your life.

306
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,120
Rick Archer: Have these
therapists usually taken

307
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,840
Psilocybin themselves so that
they have a better idea of what

308
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,400
the person is going through?

309
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,040
Michael Pollan: Well, I can only
guess about that, because none

310
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:01,020
of them will admit it. But, you
know, but I. Can see why it

311
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,020
would put them at reputational
risk for objectivity. People

312
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,300
would challenge the study,
saying, These people are, you

313
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,400
know, aficionados of
psychedelics. You know, I have

314
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,600
reason to believe that some of
them have but none of them would

315
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,420
talk about it on the record. A
couple would talk about it off

316
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,540
the record, and some would just
simply say, No. So it's hard to

317
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,480
believe you wouldn't develop the
kind of curiosity I developed,

318
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,500
because in the course of doing
this research, I it became clear

319
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,220
to me that I couldn't really
understand what these volunteers

320
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,580
were going through without
having a similar experience

321
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,980
myself. And that's and that then
became the more autobiographical

322
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,260
part of the book where I engaged
with several underground guides

323
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,860
because I couldn't get into the
above ground trials and work

324
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,360
with them to have a very similar
experience in a slightly

325
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,320
different context.

326
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,380
Rick Archer: Yeah, your your
answer to that question brings

327
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,460
up a point, which is that,
since, I guess it was the early

328
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,420
70s when Nixon declared Timothy
Leary to be the most dangerous

329
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,460
man in America, and psychedelic
research was clamped down upon,

330
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,480
there hasn't really been much
going on. And now it sounds like

331
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,480
it's kind of burgeoning, but is
it, I mean, can anybody,

332
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,580
anywhere who's qualified study
this, or is it still like a real

333
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,280
trickle compared to what might
be taking place?

334
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,640
Michael Pollan: The only reason
it's trickly at all is that

335
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,400
there's no federal funding. All
the funding is is private money,

336
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,920
charitable donations. And
luckily, there's a lot of

337
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,860
visionary people with a lot of
dough in this country, and

338
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,160
they're supporting the work, but
there's quite a bit of it. There

339
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,700
are many universities around the
country getting interested and

340
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,480
getting involved. There is these
two depression trials, each are

341
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,900
going to have six or eight
sites, each of which is a

342
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,040
medical school or a university.
The FDA is not standing in the

343
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,920
way. They made a decision way
back in 92 because people have

344
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,220
been knocking on the door for a
long time, that they would treat

345
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,740
psychedelics like any other
drug, and if you could persuade

346
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,220
them that there was a good
reason for this experiment, they

347
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,820
would grant permission, and the
DEA would grant a license to use

348
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,300
it. So I haven't heard of
people, you know, I mean serious

349
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,340
researchers, encountering
federal obstacles. The main

350
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,380
obstacle is money, okay,

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,440
Rick Archer: yeah, your comment
about the kind of commonality of

352
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,460
all the types of difficulties
which are being addressed with

353
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,760
psychedelics, being that all
these people are too kind of

354
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,520
rigid or locked down in their
thinking or in their

355
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,300
perspective. I was thinking that
as you were leading up to that

356
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,860
comment, it seems like
Psilocybin and some of these

357
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,580
other drugs they're using are so
different from usual protocols,

358
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,780
because most things tend to dull
you in one way or another, you

359
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,860
know, whereas this is a real
opening up of your awareness and

360
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,320
a radical shift of your
perspective. In fact, I think

361
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,680
you say many times in your book
that a lot of people say, Wow,

362
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,320
that was the most profound
experience I ever had in my

363
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,700
life. And I don't feel like
drinking anymore, taking smoking

364
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,160
cigarettes anymore or something.
So it's interesting that there

365
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,120
could be such a thing that, you
know, with one session would

366
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,480
give you such a radically
different perspective and shift

367
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,040
your behavior permanently.

368
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,560
Michael Pollan: Yeah, and the I
also, you know, other

369
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,180
psychiatric drugs essentially
deal with symptoms, and you take

370
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,200
them every day, perhaps for the
rest of your life, and chemicals

371
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,520
are in your brain all the time.
Here you've got this one shot or

372
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,640
two shot intervention, the
chemical, which is not very

373
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,680
toxic, whether you're talking
about Psilocybin or LSD, is in

374
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,140
your brain for a short amount of
time, and you are dealing with

375
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,800
cures. In many cases, you're
solving the problem because

376
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,640
you're, you're, as you say,
you're not dulling the patient.

377
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,260
You are opening them up, and, I
think relieving them from ego

378
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,660
consciousness for a period of
time. I think that's, that's

379
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,100
probably important way, you
know, mechanism for how this

380
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,480
works. One of the really
interesting findings of the

381
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,620
research that I cover in the
book is, you know, the effort to

382
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,920
figure out what's going on in
the brain when someone's having

383
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,560
a psychedelic experience and the
current thinking is that there's

384
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,200
one particular brain network,
the default mode network, which

385
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,160
is this tightly linked set of
structures in the midline that

386
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,420
connect the prefrontal cortex to
older, deeper areas of memory

387
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,220
and emotion in the posterior
cingulate cortex. And this, this

388
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,360
is kind of the the orchestrator
or conductor of brain activity.

389
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,720
This network you. It is closely
associated with the generation

390
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,580
of the idea of a self and so
it's where self reflection takes

391
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,360
place. It's where time mental
time travel takes place. Theory

392
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,440
of Mind, the ability to impute
mental states to others, and

393
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,020
what's called autobiographical
memory, the faculty by which we

394
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,380
take the events, whatever
happens in our lives, and tie it

395
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,760
into the story we tell ourselves
of who we are. So you know, if

396
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,120
the ego could be said to have an
address, it's probably in this

397
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,660
area, and this area of the brain
is suppressed dramatically. And

398
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,440
this was a big surprise, because
they thought psychedelics in the

399
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,920
brain would just represent a lot
of fireworks, an excitation of

400
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,580
everything. In fact, it's the
opposite for this one particular

401
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,540
network, and you can correlate a
radical down regulation of the

402
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,780
default mode network with
reported experiences of ego

403
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,540
dissolution. When people tell
you, yeah, on that trip, I just

404
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,740
completely my sense of self was
obliterated. They will see on

405
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,880
the FMRI that their default mode
network has been essentially

406
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,060
deactivated. So that's a very
interesting insight into where

407
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,960
that kind of thinking to the
extent it has a material

408
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,200
manifestation, where that's
happening. And it may be that

409
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,480
the relief from ego
consciousness and an overactive

410
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,900
default mode network is
implicated in a lot of these

411
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,040
problems, like depression. You
know, there is research to

412
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,180
suggest that depressed people
have an overactive default mode

413
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:46,240
network that's that is kind of
punishing, and they can't get

414
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,420
out of their heads, because the
default mode network also lights

415
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,560
up when you're when you're mind
wandering, when you don't have

416
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,700
anything in the world getting
your attention. It operates in a

417
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,460
seesaw relationship with the
intentional network, the

418
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,240
attentional networks, and so
giving people a vacation from

419
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,840
that, that of you know, that
kind of regulatory authority

420
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,920
allows lots of other activity to
bloom. And there's an

421
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,440
illustration in my book that
shows it was an attempt to show

422
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,780
people how the brain gets
rewired during the Psilocybin or

423
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:30,380
LSD experience and so and in
this drawing you around this

424
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,960
circle, you get all these
different brain networks, you

425
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,000
know, the visual cortex or the
auditory networks, or the you

426
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,040
Know, the networks that direct
your physical activities, and

427
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,600
suddenly you get all this
communication between networks

428
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,880
that don't ordinarily
communicate with one another,

429
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,300
and that might explain
synesthesia, the phenomenon of

430
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,920
being able to see musical notes
that perhaps your auditory

431
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,040
center is talking directly to
your visual cortex without Going

432
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,060
through the default mode
network, so the brain is

433
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,860
temporarily rewired. And we know
that brain connections, you

434
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,420
know, are new ways of thinking,
and if you have them, even

435
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,580
temporarily, you can exercise
them and make them more salient.

436
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,560
And so it's just a theory, but
that's one of the operative

437
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,460
theories of what might be going
on here that you know, when you

438
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,500
have some profound insight on
psychedelics, it may be that the

439
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,800
product of, you know, connecting
the dots literally in a new way.

440
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,340
Rick Archer: Yeah, a couple of
thoughts on that. One is that if

441
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,020
we think of the brain as a
filter or a lens or a receiver

442
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,500
of consciousness, rather than as
a generator of consciousness,

443
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,800
then you know, what you said
about the default mode network

444
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,060
shutting down or being becoming
more quiet would imply, perhaps

445
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,540
that there's less filtration
taking place, so whatever

446
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,900
consciousness is can shine
through more fully. And you

447
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,920
know, the ancient traditions say
that consciousness is bliss in

448
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,580
one of its attributes. And so,
you know, you can experience

449
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,560
very gratifying, fulfilling
states if that default mode

450
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,260
network is shut down. Somewhat.
Another little point there is

451
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,800
that a lot of the meditation
research has shown that there is

452
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,660
a remarkable degree of coherence
between different parts of the

453
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,140
brain that are ordinary, not
correlated or coherent with one

454
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,920
another, as measured by EEG. So
you know, frequencies will just

455
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,700
sort of line up in synchrony,
whereas before they were

456
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,600
asynchronous.

457
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,840
Michael Pollan: And also, you
know, the meditation research

458
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,960
done by people like Judson
Brewer, who also has taken fMRI

459
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,640
images of experienced meditators
while they're meditating, those

460
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,020
scans look very much like the
psychedelic scans. He saw that

461
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,200
actually, and was quite struck
by the similarities. So that

462
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,700
meditation also down regulates
the default mode network. And I

463
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,460
think that's really significant.
But your point. Too about, you

464
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,840
know, opening up the doors of
perception, as Huxley called it.

465
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,820
You know, when he talked about
the reducing valve, it was

466
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,380
pretty clear he was talking
about the ego. The ego is really

467
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,720
what walls us off from, you
know, whether it's internal,

468
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,900
unconscious material or external
sensory information, and what

469
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,080
seems to be, you know, it is
what defends us from being

470
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,040
overwhelmed by reality, by being
overwhelmed by nature, by being

471
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,920
overwhelmed by what's in our
unconscious and and those walls

472
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,820
come down, I think, during
psychedelic experience, and that

473
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,360
that accounts for the sense of
merging that people have. And so

474
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,300
I think that, you know, I think
we're talking about a lot of

475
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,600
different vocabularies for the
same thing. I'm using ego and

476
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,900
walls, and I know that's very
psychodynamic, and you're using

477
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,260
a more spiritual vocabulary, but
I think we're talking about the

478
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,180
same thing, yeah, I think so,

479
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,200
Rick Archer: Chris, do you have
any questions or comments on

480
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,460
what we've been saying so far?

481
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,720
Chris Bache: I've just been
enjoying Michael's presentation

482
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,920
a great deal. I'm so deeply
appreciative that a person of

483
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,400
your caliber, Michael has done
such an excellent job of

484
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,440
presenting the history and the
issues in the people's lives

485
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,620
being touched in this form of
therapy, you just open up the

486
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,700
conversation to many people who
previously would have just never

487
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,340
been willing to have a
conversation about psychedelics,

488
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,700
and you've done such a good job
with it. You've done it so well,

489
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,320
and you capture the
personalities involved so well.

490
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,380
Just really appreciate what
you've done.

491
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,540
Michael Pollan: Thank you. Well,
I was, you know, I was

492
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,020
approaching it from outside,
obviously, and with a certain,

493
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,580
you know, naivete and skepticism
and, you know, I mean, there are

494
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,140
people with a lot more knowledge
and experience in the

495
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,900
psychedelic world, but they've
tended to be in a conversation

496
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,780
that takes place within the
psychedelic community. And I

497
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,780
wasn't coming from there and,
and I also always write for an

498
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,200
audience that I don't assume has
any interest in the subject. I'm

499
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,400
just much more interested in in
in talking to the general reader

500
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,600
and, and, you know, grabbing
them by the caller and say, Hey,

501
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,940
this is really cool. You should
you should read this stuff,

502
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,880
whether it's about food or
agriculture, all these kind of

503
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:33,380
things. So I think that that
stance was very useful to me in

504
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,460
in bringing people into this
conversation. And it's been very

505
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,380
gratifying to see how many
people and whether they're in

506
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,800
the therapeutic community or the
neuroscience community, have

507
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,360
gotten excited in the last year
about the potential here, and

508
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,360
want to get involved as
researchers and as people

509
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,080
experimenting with psychedelics.
So, you know, look, this

510
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,780
Renaissance was happening. I
mean, I was reporting on saying

511
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:03,420
that was already happening, but
I feel very lucky that I was

512
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,560
able to play some role in
bringing people into the tent,

513
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,700
yeah.

514
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:12,899
Rick Archer: So we can probably
spend an hour going through all

515
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:16,439
the various stages of your
exploration, you know, with

516
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:19,139
psychedelics and different
experiences you had, and all

517
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:22,859
that stuff and all that is
covered very well in your book.

518
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:25,999
So I think what I'd like to do
is just ask you a question which

519
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,759
came in from someone actually
named Susie Parkinson in

520
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:33,619
Carlsbad, California. She asked,
since your original psychedelic

521
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:37,279
journeys, or as a result of
them, perhaps, has your belief

522
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,739
system or perspective changed,
deepened or taken on a meaning

523
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:43,539
which it didn't previously have.

524
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,140
Michael Pollan: Yeah, it's a
great question. Thank you for

525
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,580
posing it. My experiences have
changed me in various ways. I

526
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,960
think for the most part, the
personality changes are pretty

527
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,200
subtle. You know, my wife's not
here right now, but I would drag

528
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,180
her in to say, to tell you that
I've asked her this question

529
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,240
because your partner knows you
better than anybody else and is

530
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,900
very sensitive to any changes.
And she basically feels that I'm

531
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,780
a more open and patient person
than I was, and she was very

532
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,360
apprehensive when I started
getting involved with this, that

533
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,600
I might change for the worse.
She doesn't seem to think I have

534
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:28,340
intellectually, there has been a
change. I think my understanding

535
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,440
of spirituality has changed, and
what that means. Think it's

536
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,140
important to understand you guys
work on these issues all the

537
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,680
time, but I was really kind of
spiritually retarded before I

538
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,560
started this, it's just a part
of my life, my mind, that I

539
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,140
hadn't developed. I mean, some
people look at body and desire,

540
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,300
and I think that's a very
spiritual take, right? I talk

541
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,940
about food in a very spiritual
way, and the importance of

542
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,300
communion, but I really didn't
see myself as spiritual, partly

543
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,260
because my understanding of
spirituality was that it

544
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:05,280
existed. Suggested in opposition
to science skepticism, and that

545
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,360
implied a I'm telling you, I was
retarded, but it implied a

546
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,020
belief in the supernatural
things beyond the scope of

547
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,300
science never to understand. And
so I approached it that way, and

548
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I was very much a pretty
confirmed materialist in my

549
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,960
philosophical outline, that that
the laws of nature could explain

550
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,640
everything. And I realized how
limited this was. And so I had

551
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,480
after my psychedelic journeys,
and after one in particular,

552
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,400
where I had a very profound
experience of transcending my

553
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,140
ego, my usual sense of self, and
I actually beheld myself

554
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,340
dissolving. I'm first bursting
into a little cloud of post it

555
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,820
notes. That was me, and it was,
there was nothing left. And then

556
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,600
another time where I was, I felt
myself kind of spread out on the

557
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,900
ground like a coat of paint or
butter. And but a new

558
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,180
perspective arose for me to
observe this scene, and that was

559
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,360
the spooky part, and it's the
part I still don't understand.

560
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,100
From what new point of view was
I taking in the scene? It was an

561
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,480
eye that wasn't familiar to me.
It was an eye that was

562
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,340
completely fine with what was
happening, unburdened,

563
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:32,000
untroubled, disinterested and
reconciled to whatever there

564
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,600
was. And it was quite profound
and and once that sense of self

565
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,100
was gone, I was totally open or
unprotected, undefended against

566
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,520
anything and and then started
merging. And in this in this

567
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,060
particular instance, I merged
with a piece of music I had had

568
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,160
my guide put on this
unaccompanied Cello Suite by

569
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,600
Bach number two and de Mudra,
which is a very sad, beautiful

570
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,700
piece of music, and I became it.
There was no subject object

571
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,260
duality at all. I was identical
to this music. I could feel yo,

572
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,280
yo, Ma's the horse hair on his
bow going over my skin. And I

573
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,540
was inside this dark well
looking out and the breeze of

574
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,980
the vibrations of the music. I
could physically feel them. It

575
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:27,200
was, it was remarkable. And I
came out of that, you know, the

576
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,280
next day, I went to my guide for
integration, and I said, Well,

577
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,360
I'd have this experience of
complete ego dissolution and the

578
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,000
and she said, What did you learn
from that? I said, well, that

579
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,660
you're not identical to your
ego. You don't have to there's

580
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,480
another ground on which to
stand, but it was a very

581
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,800
mysterious other ground. And she
said, Well, wasn't that worth

582
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,800
the price of admission? And I
said, Yes, but it was really

583
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,280
interesting. But what do you do
with it? You know now my ego is

584
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:00,120
back in uniform, back on patrol,
and so what good was it? And she

585
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,760
said, Well, you'd had a sample
of this way of being, and you

586
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,780
can cultivate it. And I said,
How? And she said, through

587
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,400
meditation, basically. And like,
I'm, like a great many people

588
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,620
and a great many American
Buddhists, this opened a door

589
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,200
into and made it it made me much
more comfortable in the mental

590
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,280
space of meditation, and I could
navigate it better. And

591
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,000
sometimes I do attain that
perspective that I had had

592
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,280
during that that Psilocybin
trip. So did that make me more

593
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,840
spiritual? I am not prepared to
conclude that that new

594
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,740
perspective that opened up, it
was some Transpersonal

595
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,620
perspective or some universal
consciousness. I know that

596
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,500
Aldous Huxley, you know, when it
happened to him, said that was

597
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,200
the mind at large, which was
something that we tune in,

598
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,440
that's outside. I'd be really
here, curious to hear Chris's

599
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,240
take on that. I don't know. It
could just as easily be another

600
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,860
product of my mind that, you
know, I hadn't experienced

601
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:07,380
before, because the damn ego,
you know, overshadowed it, but I

602
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,820
came to see that my my
understanding of spirituality,

603
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,000
was faulty, because the what
spirituality is, for Me is

604
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,820
powerful connection, an
openness, an undefended ability

605
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,060
to connect, whether it's to
nature, which is very important

606
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,880
to me, the natural world. And
during another psychedelic

607
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,840
experience, I had the sense of
nature being very much alive. I

608
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,980
mean, the leaves in my garden
were returning my gaze, in some

609
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,280
sense. And it was a beautiful
experience. It was really

610
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,400
wonderful. So there was the
connection to nature that is

611
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,900
opened up, and then there is
connection to other people, the

612
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,080
feelings of love that so many
people report on psychedelics,

613
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,740
and this powerful connection to
other people and the universe in

614
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,780
some more general way. And so
that's what spirituality. Is now

615
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,440
to me, it's it's opening the
gates so you, you can connect at

616
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,140
a very deep level without any
screen between you and the

617
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,520
other, no subject object. And so
I learned that the opposite of

618
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,340
spiritual, the word spiritual,
should not be material, as I

619
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,300
understood it. It should be
egotistical, because it really

620
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,960
is the ego that stands in the
way of those powerful

621
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,920
connections, and that the Ego is
the Enemy of spiritual

622
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,840
development. So that's kind of
that was my takeaway. It's not

623
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,080
final in any way. I think I have
a lot more to learn from the

624
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,980
experience, and I might come out
in a different place. I'm very

625
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,300
curious about, Well, Chris, I
would be curious to know how you

626
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,180
would interpret that experience
of this new perspective opening

627
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,120
up on your dissolved self.

628
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,240
Chris Bache: Well, you know, as
I listen to you speak, I'm

629
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,380
reminded of Sri Suzuki in his
beautiful little book on

630
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,300
meditation, big mind, little
mind, and you know, it's like

631
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,000
there's little mind which is
very efficient getting things

632
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,720
done, sits at our desk, you
know, answers the phone, and

633
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,500
then there's big mind, which is
really that dimension of mind

634
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,900
which is just so profoundly
larger than other than and

635
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,120
inclusive of little mind. It's
just a different wavelength of

636
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:29,060
consciousness. And so then the
question is, of course, all of

637
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,200
the meditation traditions agree
that there are many, many layers

638
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,900
to ego. So you can kind of get
clear at one level and get

639
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,180
caught in another, and clear at
that level get caught another.

640
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,040
It's a labyrinth kind of thing.
But according to their ways of

641
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,600
thinking, it is possible to
profoundly quiet still allow ego

642
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,840
to become transparent. And when
ego becomes transparent, this

643
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:58,300
this larger background context
surfaces in awareness. So that

644
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,520
rings true. In my experience,
the question then becomes, okay,

645
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,900
if there's little mind and big
mind, what is the nature of

646
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:12,000
mind? Just mind, and that opens
it, then we're then we're off to

647
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,700
the races, because then we get
into a very interesting

648
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,000
discussion of what is the nature
of consciousness, and what is

649
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,980
conscious, and who can have
consciousness, and so on so

650
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,840
forth. So,

651
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,640
Michael Pollan: I mean, what is
the nature of mine? I know

652
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,140
that's a big fat question.

653
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,100
Chris Bache: Yeah, that's a big
one. And it's, it's, it's,

654
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,180
personally, I don't have a
vested interest in specific

655
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,900
definitions of consciousness and
specific definitions of mine.

656
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,980
I'm kind of happy to go where
different people want to go with

657
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,300
under with definitions of
consciousness per se, as long as

658
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,560
the definition is open to a
complete phenomenology of mind,

659
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,500
because my background training
is in philosophy of religion and

660
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,640
phenomenology has been a large
part of that. So I think it's

661
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,860
important for us to critically,
not naively, but critically,

662
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,280
look at the broadest body of
data that we have for what mind

663
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:26,300
is and how mind manifests, and
what it can do. So, can mind

664
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,140
influence the health of the
body? Can mind actually

665
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,420
influence physical objects? The
telekinesis can Is there a mind

666
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,960
can linking between human beings
and plants, so that there can be

667
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,640
a genuine exchange of
information at some level. I

668
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,420
mean, that opens, that gets us
into the deeper question. And

669
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,720
then when we go to Aldous
Huxley, and he goes to mind at

670
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,280
large, that's the assertion of
an encompassing mind that holds

671
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,900
all minds, all sub minds, held
within a master kind of

672
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,940
intelligence of the universe.
I'm comfortable with that

673
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,480
concept, just because I've had
so many experiences of so many

674
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,100
dimensions of that mind that I'm
comfortable I talk about the

675
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,100
creative intelligence of the
universe. I don't know what to

676
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,120
call it on site. I don't know
what name we should give it, and

677
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,420
I'm sometimes I'll talk about it
as the divine, but I'm not a

678
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,120
theist, and I'm not a
supernaturalist. I completely

679
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,720
agree with you on that way, to
me, it's all natural, it's all

680
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,680
nature. It's all part of nature.
And there's nothing about for

681
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,680
me, the study of consciousness,
which should be beyond the range

682
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:42,700
of scientific investigation, but
I've spent so much time over the

683
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,260
many years exploring different
aspects of that mind that

684
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:51,219
Unknown: using what tools,

685
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:57,039
Chris Bache: well, my primary
tool has been LSD. In my

686
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,739
explorations, I also have
experience. With Psilocybin and

687
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:07,859
other in Ayahuasca and salvia
dip and norm and but my primary

688
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:14,039
instrument of exploration was
LSD use in a particular a very

689
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:18,239
specific modality. So I don't
should I describe this Rick?

690
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:19,259
Should we do this now?

691
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,220
Rick Archer: Or let me just wrap
up a point that Michael made

692
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,360
earlier, and then let's do it.
Michael was saying that he used

693
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,600
to have a sort of a version to
the notion of spirituality

694
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,720
because he felt it was anti
scientific. Excuse me, if I

695
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,320
didn't express that quite right,
but there was, you know, some

696
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,200
distrust of it, because it
seemed probably you've heard,

697
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,720
you heard a lot of woo things. I
mean, look at I mean, religion

698
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,600
and science have been at each
other's throats for a long time.

699
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,780
People used to be burned at the
stake for believing that the

700
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:57,940
earth wasn't the center of the
solar system. And I feel that

701
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,400
we've reached a point where
science and spirituality can

702
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,420
complement each other
tremendously. If we take

703
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,320
anything that spirituality or
any religious tradition has ever

704
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,480
proposed or suggested as a
hypothesis, rather than as

705
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,440
something that we ought to
believe in, then it's something

706
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,220
that's potential that might be
open to investigate,

707
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:26,960
experiential investigation. And
I think Chris will comment on a

708
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,040
lot of things he's investigated
experientially, which might seem

709
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,520
extremely hypothetical to the
average person that has some of

710
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,240
these things have very far
reaching implications for

711
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,880
humanity, for religion, for
spirituality, I don't think

712
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,940
there's a heck of a lot of value
in just believing in something

713
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,180
because somebody says you ought
to, or some tradition says you

714
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,600
ought to, or anything. I think
everything should be open to

715
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,040
experiential investigation. So
that's what the scientific

716
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,280
attitude brings to spirituality.
On the other hand, spirituality

717
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,900
can bring something to science,
because science doesn't possess

718
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,040
the tools for investigating the
subtle realms that spirituality

719
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:14,820
has specialized in, has dealt
with. And LSD is such a tool,

720
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,420
although ultimately our own, our
human nervous system, is such a

721
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,740
tool. And throughout the ages, I
think what mystics have been

722
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:26,960
doing is using that tool to and
fine tuning it and learning how

723
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,340
to use it such that they can
explore all sorts of subtle

724
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:38,360
dimensions, and, you know, add
to human knowledge in ways that

725
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,820
modern science Couldn't even
hope to begin to do at its

726
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,820
current stage. So anyway, I just
wanted to get that out. And then

727
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,300
you go ahead, Chris, and segue
from that, well,

728
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,200
Chris Bache: just a footnote.
Add a note on to what you said.

729
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,420
Rick, it's one thing to study
the quantitative qualities of

730
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,140
consciousness, and it's another
thing to study study the

731
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,340
qualitative nature of
consciousness. And I think

732
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,420
science is extraordinarily good
at studying the quantitative

733
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,360
nature of consciousness and
looking at the various

734
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,060
physiological correlations,
various states of awareness, so

735
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,560
on, so forth. But I think we can
study scientifically, if we

736
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,000
broaden our methodology of
science, we can study the

737
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,920
qualitative characteristics of
consciousness. We do so by

738
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,200
controlled experiment. We do so
by getting carefully screened

739
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,900
different people from different
backgrounds, for example,

740
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,440
putting them through the same
exploratory regimen, carefully

741
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,520
recording their experiences
afterwards, comparing their

742
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:49,720
experiences across populations.
I mean, we can't put experience

743
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:54,160
under a microscope, but we can
use all of our critical skills

744
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,360
to study the qualitative nature
of experience, and then we can

745
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,020
start broadening it into cross
cultural and historical

746
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:06,960
analysis. So I think we can be
critical, but being critical is

747
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,920
larger than being neurological

748
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:13,919
Michael Pollan: Well, I mean,
you can't. I mean, the

749
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:16,559
interesting, what's interesting
to me about consciousness as a

750
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,259
subject for scientific
exploration is you can't study

751
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:23,899
it without experience. There's
no other tool, right? I mean,

752
00:49:23,899 --> 00:49:29,119
phenomenology is the only tool
to understand the subjectivity,

753
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:34,519
and at least so far. And so,
yeah, I think I agree. I think

754
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:38,299
you have to, you have to go down
that path, and you can do that

755
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:41,559
path with a lot of rigor. And
it's one of the interesting

756
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:43,479
things about the psychedelic
work. The reports of the

757
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:47,139
volunteers are critically
important, and you car and

758
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:49,479
sometimes you correlate those
reports with what you're seeing

759
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:53,259
on your brain scans and some but
sometimes you don't need to. So

760
00:49:53,319 --> 00:49:57,579
but, but going back to this
question of but, I think a big

761
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:02,519
question is whether you know.
Know whether there's any real

762
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:09,299
evidence to think that brains
don't produce consciousness, or

763
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:12,119
that, you know, that mind
precedes matter? I think that's

764
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,839
a very interesting question. And
I went into my own

765
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:21,019
investigations assuming, because
that's the consensus among

766
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:24,379
scientists is that, well, we
don't know how it happens, but

767
00:50:24,379 --> 00:50:27,859
we assume that these neurons,
these cells, are producing

768
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:32,119
consciousness in some way. Even
though it's it's very hard to

769
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:36,199
get from cells to that
phenomenon. Nobody has a clue

770
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:41,199
how to do it. That seemed to be
the more parsimonious, you know,

771
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:47,439
or starting principle. But a lot
of people, after experience of

772
00:50:47,439 --> 00:50:49,359
psychedelics come out in a
different place.

773
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,240
Rick Archer: Yeah, I interviewed
a guy a few months ago named

774
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,120
Mark Gober who wrote a book
called The End to upside down

775
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,080
thinking, which addresses this
very point. And, you know, it

776
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:03,600
may seem parsimonious initially,
that consciousness is just an

777
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,840
epiphenomenon of brain
functioning, but there are so

778
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,320
many anomalies, when you look at
it that way that keep pecking

779
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,920
away at that materialistic
worldview. And Mark and his book

780
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,180
really goes through these in a
very brilliant way. And what's

781
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,900
the name of the book? It's
called the end, or maybe it's an

782
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,500
end. I think maybe the end to
upside down, thinking, by Mark

783
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,580
Gober, G, O, B, E, R, and he's
he's been on back gap a few

784
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,880
months ago, so you can find him
there. But it's like there's a

785
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,000
new

786
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,060
Michael Pollan: book also by
Jeffrey krapal. Yeah, this book

787
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:42,940
is fascinating. I recommend him
for back on the show. But he's

788
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,640
also looking at a series of
people, some of them scientists,

789
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,280
others philosophers, who
underwent this flip in their

790
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,440
thinking to to believing that
their that you know mind may

791
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,560
well perceive matter and has
these case histories, among

792
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,040
other things.

793
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,340
Rick Archer: Yeah. Oh, go ahead,
Chris, you're gonna say the

794
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,800
Chris Bache: field of study that
shifted my thinking in that

795
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,040
regard. Because I finished
graduate school, even though it

796
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,220
was in philosophy of religion, I
was a pretty atheistically

797
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,880
inclined agnostic. By the time I
finished graduate school, I was

798
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,120
well versed in the rise of
science and human in human

799
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:25,400
values and in enjoyed that and
join that movement fully. I tell

800
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,220
my students, if you haven't
fallen in love with Kant, with

801
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,740
science, you've missed the
great, one of the great romances

802
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,580
of history. I mean, this is just
such a massive, extraordinarily

803
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,020
ground shaking pivot in human
understanding. But one of the

804
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:44,380
areas which shifted my thinking
about the idea that our brain

805
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:49,120
creates consciousness, and of
course, clearly, our brain does

806
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,140
generate consciousness, in a
sense, but it was the

807
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,920
reincarnation research. It was
Ian Stevenson's Research at the

808
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,400
University of Virginia and the
multiple volumes that he had

809
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:05,520
published documenting very
detailed cases of from around

810
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,080
the world, children, very small,
345, years old, who had detailed

811
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,860
memories of what appeared to be
their previous life. And he was

812
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,700
able to extract, get those
memories, consolidate them, and

813
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,140
verify sufficient number of
those memories to build an

814
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:26,720
extremely strong case for the
fact of reincarnation without

815
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,000
knowing the theory of it,
without knowing how it actually

816
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,300
takes place, that there is some
type of continuity of

817
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:36,140
consciousness. Now, there's lots
and lots of levels of issues

818
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:40,480
involved in this one life to
another life. Yeah, it seems to

819
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,940
be. I mean, some people would
say, well, those memories are

820
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,760
actually drawn out of the
collective unconscious. And you

821
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,000
know, that doesn't show
continuity of life to life, but

822
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,020
I think Stevenson's evidence is
really a strong evidence for

823
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,320
some type of continuity of an
awareness from lifetime to

824
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,540
lifetime, especially his last
two book, which is a two volume

825
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,800
book on philosophy and on
reincarnation and biology, in

826
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:10,020
which he studied 170 87 cases of
children who not only had

827
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,340
psychological recall from their
previous lifetime, but actually

828
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:19,560
bore the marks in their body in
the form of birthmarks, which

829
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,560
replicated wounds of death in
the previous incarnation. So

830
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,140
somehow, it was as if
consciousness had been

831
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,200
traumatized in such a way that
it not only imprinted on

832
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,140
subsequent mind, but it
imprinted on the body of

833
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:37,340
subsequent mind. So after
looking at this data a lot, I

834
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:42,460
think what it tells us is we
have information in our mind

835
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:47,320
that predates this body, and if
that's the case, if and if those

836
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,120
can be legitimated, verified
memories, then that indicates

837
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,800
that there is at least in some
way in which our awareness, our

838
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,920
memory, our mind, is not
generated by our.

839
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,120
Rick Archer: Brain. A very
simple metaphor for this, which

840
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,880
I'm sure you've both heard is,
you know, I mean radios and

841
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,820
televisions, they are detectors,
or not transmitters. They're

842
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,840
receivers of fluctuations in the
electromagnetic field, which is

843
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,440
ubiquitous, and if the radio
breaks, the radio transmission

844
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,460
from the, you know, tower 50
miles away or something, doesn't

845
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,820
stop. Other radios can still
pick it up, and we can get a new

846
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:33,800
radio and listen to it again. So
if consciousness is a field, as

847
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:39,140
opposed to just a product of the
brain, then, you know, very

848
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,400
we're all tapped into that
field, and we kind of share it

849
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,800
in common as a foundation. But
then, how do you account for

850
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,060
individuality, and an
individuality moving from life

851
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,760
to life, from from one body to
another? And that leads me into

852
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,460
a question I'd like to ask,
which will get us a little bit

853
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:59,620
back to psychedelics, which is
that, you know, research shows

854
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:04,740
that subjective experiences in
meditation and other spiritual

855
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,260
practices have physiological
effects, which we've been

856
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,560
talking about. And Western
science is only able to measure

857
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,560
the gross physiology, and
traditionally, it's understood

858
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,980
that we also have a subtle
physiology. Chinese and Vedic

859
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,220
systems offer elaborate
explanations of the subtle body

860
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:24,560
using terms such as Qi or Prana
or Sushumna and Ida and Pingala,

861
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,580
nadis, etc, and these traditions
understand that it's necessary

862
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:32,840
to condition and strengthen the
subtle body to sustain the

863
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,900
enormous flows of energy that
accompany spiritual awakening.

864
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,780
Often spiritual aspirants spend
years or decades doing this

865
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:46,720
before awakening occurs. So what
are so this whole subtle body

866
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,300
thing has implications for
reincarnation, because it would

867
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,360
be the subtle body that moves
from one gross body to another

868
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,540
when the gross body wears out.
The Bhagavad Gita says it's like

869
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,980
changing clothes. So, but here's
the question, what are your

870
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,940
thoughts on the fact that anyone
can ingest a psychedelic

871
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,480
substance without having
prepared the subtle body, or can

872
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,400
psychedelics facilitate such
preparation? Either of you can

873
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,000
answer

874
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,160
Michael Pollan: this. Give this
one to Chris.

875
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:16,919
Chris Bache: Thanks, Michael.

876
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,020
Michael Pollan: Now the question
is built on an understanding of

877
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,440
subtle bodies and gross bodies
that i is totally unfamiliar to

878
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,740
Chris Bache: me, in answering,
in responding, I don't want to

879
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:32,900
assume the your observation that
is the subtle body that

880
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:37,280
transfers from incarnation to
incarnation. It may be, I'm just

881
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,040
not sure that we've nailed it
down that close. Let's take its

882
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:47,440
hypothesis and so again,
individuality is the whole

883
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,380
question is, what is
individuality? So is the

884
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,500
individuality of one life
transferring to the

885
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:58,600
individuality or intact in
another life? And I think those

886
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,860
are very subtle and complicated
questions, and I don't mean to

887
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,580
prejudge them at all, so I don't
want to assume a set answer to

888
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:12,480
what is individuality or what is
the subtle body that said my

889
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,600
experience, I have a lot of
convictions around the subtle

890
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,380
body, and specifically the
impact The way psychedelic

891
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,800
experiences can impact the
subtle body. But to explain, I

892
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,280
mean, I can't let me say a
little bit of about my

893
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,580
background, because there are so
many different variations of

894
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:36,680
psychedelic experiences, and I
want to define mine. That's the

895
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:42,160
body of data that I draw from
when I finished graduate school

896
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,360
in 78 I met the work of
Stanislav Grof. Immediately, he

897
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,900
had just published realms of the
human unconscious. He had 100 of

898
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,340
100 essays published by that
time, and I was immediately

899
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:59,320
taken atheistically agnostic as
I was, I was immediately taken

900
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,020
by his research proposal that
through these substances, if

901
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,200
they were used in a careful and
controlled circumstance, that we

902
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,880
could use them to experience
deeper dimensions of our own

903
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,680
mind. And I was particularly
interested in his observation

904
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:21,080
that one can go deeper than
personal consciousness. One can

905
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,560
go deeper than even collective
unconscious. You can go deeper

906
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,860
into the mind of the universe
itself. He didn't say it quite

907
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:32,300
like that, but that was the
implication of what he did. And

908
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,360
I was immediately fascinated by
that, because I was a

909
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,440
philosopher of religion and
exploring the the consciousness

910
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,460
of the universe, if there is a
consciousness of the universe,

911
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,760
could have enormous implications
for a variety of philosophical

912
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:53,740
questions. So this was 1978 and
I wanted to do the psychedelic

913
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:58,060
work. I was just like Michael,
after doing the research and

914
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,600
looking at the literature and
looking at some. Other people's

915
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,440
lives had been changed. I wanted
to participate, and I basically

916
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,880
did what Michael did. I
basically made a choice to have

917
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,080
some underground experiments
with psychedelics. I mean, I

918
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,620
don't like going underground.
I'd much rather be in a legally

919
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,040
sanctioned experimental
protocol, but that wasn't

920
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:24,920
available to me. So I chose to
learn Stan Grof methods for

921
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,160
working with psychedelics and
can and how to have a

922
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,340
psychedelic session, and all the
ins and outs that have now

923
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:35,900
become kind of standardized in
psychedelic protocols, to use

924
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,980
his methods, and then to use
them privately, to explore my

925
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:44,800
own consciousness, and to do it
as rigorously as I could, using

926
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,620
all the philosophical and
phenomenological and

927
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,260
psychological tools I had
gathered in graduate school.

928
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:55,420
Now, Stan differentiates between
two different types of

929
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,480
psychedelic work, low dose
psychedelic work, usually

930
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,540
between 15 200 micrograms and
high dose psychedelic work,

931
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:09,900
which is usually up to maybe 500
micrograms, 600 micrograms, the

932
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:15,000
low dose method generates a sort
of a gradual, slowly peeling

933
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,060
back the layers of consciousness
to this personal unconscious

934
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:21,320
through The perinatal or the
Death-Rebirth dynamics into

935
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:26,660
Transpersonal reality. The high
dose psychedelic work was in the

936
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:30,680
early years, focused on working
with terminally ill patients,

937
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:37,280
cancer patients, and they were
basically trying to not heal the

938
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,300
personal unconscious, but to
kind of blow through all the

939
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:44,320
levels of the personal
unconscious. Trigger a near

940
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,740
death type experience, a trigger
a profound encounter with the

941
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:52,840
universe, and then see let that
encounter with the deeper

942
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,760
structure of the universe, to
see how it might impact their

943
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:03,420
anxiety around their imminent
death. So what I did, after

944
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:09,420
about four three low dose
sessions, I opted to work with a

945
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:15,300
very intense regimen with LSD, I
worked at psychedelic therapy. I

946
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,680
did what turned out to be a 20
year regimen of doing high dose

947
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,300
psychedelic therapy, always
using the same protocol, always

948
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,680
using the same test conditions.
I worked at 500 to 600

949
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:32,240
micrograms, which is not a
protocol that I recommend. I

950
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:37,280
really don't I didn't know as
much then as I don't know. But

951
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:43,960
what I did was to do 73 high
dose, fully internalized,

952
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,560
therapeutically focused
psychedelic sessions with the

953
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:53,140
sitter and my wife, first wife,
Carol, who is a clinical

954
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,680
psychologist, agreed to be my
sitter. And was my sitter for

955
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:03,900
all of my sessions. And I just
press this I worked for four

956
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,580
years, then I stopped for six
years, and then I came back and

957
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:12,660
worked for 10, very aggressive
years. So over the course of 20

958
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:21,320
years, I did 73 sessions. Now I
wouldn't recommend this

959
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,280
protocol. I would really
recommend people work with lower

960
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:30,140
doses. And you know, there is no
research protocol right now

961
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,720
federally sanctioned that is
recommending or looking

962
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:39,800
considering using doses as high.
But I wanted to push the limits.

963
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,880
And I thought that if
psychedelic, high dose

964
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,140
psychedelic work could be done
safely three times in the Spring

965
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,560
Grove project, then it could be
done safely more than three

966
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,940
times. What I found was that it
could be done safely more than

967
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,900
three times. But it's very, very
demanding work, and it's more

968
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,760
demanding than the original
protocols that Spring Grove

969
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,140
envisioned, and it opens up
opportunities that the early

970
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,100
protocol did not envision, but
it also opened up challenges

971
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,880
that the early protocol had not
envisioned, and one of those

972
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,660
challenges has to do with how
these deep states of

973
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:22,820
Consciousness impact our body
and impact our subtle energy

974
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:29,360
system. Because what I found was
that when I would go, when I

975
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,300
went into these states and went
into deeper levels of

976
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,000
consciousness, and then
stabilized my level of

977
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,600
consciousness, my consciousness
at that level, so that my

978
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,340
conscious experience was
coherent and stable at that

979
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,240
level, eventually pushing,
continued to push, I would drop

980
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,960
down later into a deeper level
of consciousness, and then

981
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,840
stabilizing at that level and
then dropping into a deeper

982
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,680
level of consciousness. Each
state into a deeper level of

983
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:01,260
consciousness was a state into a
higher level of. Energy, just

984
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:06,180
extraordinarily, very, very
powerful levels of energy, so

985
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,960
that I had to work very
conscientiously, as all long

986
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,680
term psychedelic journeyers do,
work with the body, work with

987
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,360
the subtle energy system. Work
to detoxify the body. Work to

988
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:23,000
clarify negative emotions. Work
to basically strengthen the

989
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,200
subtle energy body. So
basically, purification, I

990
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,140
think, is essential and is
endemic to working with

991
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:36,140
psychedelics. In Tibetan vadna,
the monks have to do ngondro

992
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,100
before they are allowed to take
into the high teachings capable

993
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:44,260
of generating, you know,
enlightenment. So ninja, with

994
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:47,500
the found ninja are the
foundational practices. They're

995
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:53,500
the five, 100,000 practices that
every monk does in Vajrayana.

996
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,360
One of those practices involves
doing 100,000 prostrations while

997
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,580
reciting mantras and prayers and
doing visualizations. That's a

998
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,300
tremendous transformation,
clarification, strengthening of

999
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,980
your subtle energy system, and
they do this as a preliminary to

1000
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,340
entering to receiving the
teaching that will allow them to

1001
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,100
enter into the very, very deep
states of consciousness that

1002
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:22,160
vara makes possible. If you go
into these deeper states of

1003
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,760
consciousness quickly, like you
tend to do in psychedelic

1004
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:31,820
states, tremendously powerful
purification processes are are

1005
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:35,540
triggered. Physical purification
processes, physical

1006
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:38,960
detoxification, emotional
detoxification, mental

1007
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,600
detoxification, there's a
tremendous kind of catharsis

1008
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,300
that takes place at all of those
levels. And some of those

1009
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:51,340
levels, I think, are well
described in terms of our subtle

1010
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,120
energy system. So we you really
have to work with the subtle

1011
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,240
energy bodies, and I don't think
of them as just one body, but

1012
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,180
multiple bodies, but mesh very
well against the Indian

1013
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:08,100
Ayurvedic system or the Chinese
acupuncture meridian system.

1014
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,460
Rick Archer: Yeah, you're
actually almost downplaying what

1015
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,940
you went through here. If people
were to read your book when they

1016
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,920
do, it's a tribute to your wife
that she was able to sit through

1017
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,060
these sessions as your sitter
watching you go through this

1018
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,400
because you were going into
convulsions, there was

1019
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,700
projectile vomiting, you were
making all kinds of weird

1020
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:33,200
noises. And you know, what you
were experiencing subjectively,

1021
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:38,240
was excruciating. In many cases,
I mean suffering beyond anything

1022
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,460
you could have imagined. And you
chalk it up to deep

1023
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:47,320
purification. You say in your
book, the core of the cycle is

1024
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:51,160
this increased awareness
triggers the surfacing of toxins

1025
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,920
in the system, that in turn
precipitates a crisis of

1026
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,880
disease, followed eventually by
a higher level of health. This

1027
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,540
cycle operates at many levels,
at the physical level, the

1028
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:05,160
psychological level and the soul
level. And very often I'm just

1029
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,980
summarizing here, but very often
in your sessions, the first part

1030
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:11,040
would be one of these horrible
ordeals that you would go

1031
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,380
through, and then the second
part, having cleared that away,

1032
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:16,920
you'd go into an ecstatic realm
and experience all kinds of

1033
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,640
beautiful things.

1034
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:26,360
Chris Bache: Yeah, basically,
again, might. I'm going to

1035
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:31,400
discuss this strictly in terms
of the LSD body of work. After I

1036
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,640
stopped my sessions I had. I've
done Psilocybin a number of

1037
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,880
times. I'm comfortable in that
world. I've done Ayahuasca

1038
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,720
several times. I'm comfortable
in that world, but I really

1039
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,280
would like to restrict myself to
just the LSD work in describing

1040
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:45,640
this,

1041
01:08:54,759 --> 01:09:00,359
when you when you die as a self,
when, when You know when you I

1042
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,319
understand psychedelics
following Stan Grof, and this is

1043
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,259
a description in terms of their
psychoactive properties, not in

1044
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:09,719
their physiological or
neurological properties, but

1045
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:14,939
psychologically. They seem to
activate. They seem to function

1046
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:18,959
as amplifiers and catalyst of
psychological processes. So they

1047
01:09:18,959 --> 01:09:22,399
take what is small and make it
loud, and they take what is

1048
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:27,799
distant and make it close so it
basically hyper it's a hyper

1049
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:32,059
catharsis and a hyper
amplification. We for a number

1050
01:09:32,059 --> 01:09:35,659
of hours, we enter into a
temporarily hyper sensitive

1051
01:09:35,659 --> 01:09:38,719
state of awareness, and what we
do with that awareness

1052
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:42,459
determines what happens in a
session, we can listen to a

1053
01:09:42,459 --> 01:09:45,879
concert and have a good time, we
can have conversations, or we

1054
01:09:45,879 --> 01:09:50,199
can go deep within and use this
hypersensitivity to unearth the

1055
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:53,319
obstacles to healthy
functioning. But then if we go

1056
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:57,819
deeper, we can enter into deeper
levels of existential

1057
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,839
functioning and deeper relations
with the universe. Is, it's

1058
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:04,739
important to remember, I think
that what we are doing in our

1059
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:08,879
laboratories is we are
rediscovering a class of

1060
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:13,499
chemicals that have been used in
cultures for 1000s of years. And

1061
01:10:13,499 --> 01:10:18,059
you know, Ayahuasca is we have
at least 1500 years in

1062
01:10:18,059 --> 01:10:22,039
Psilocybin mushrooms and Peyote
and Mescaline. So there's,

1063
01:10:22,099 --> 01:10:27,199
there's a lot of history between
humanity and these substances.

1064
01:10:27,499 --> 01:10:30,619
Now what we're doing is studying
them in a particular context,

1065
01:10:30,619 --> 01:10:35,119
which is giving us great insight
into these processes. But

1066
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:40,099
there's also a large body of
wisdom held in these cultures

1067
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:42,879
that have been using these
materials for a long time.

1068
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:49,479
According to many of these
systems, their view is that

1069
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:53,739
consciousness is a universal
quality of life. We are

1070
01:10:53,739 --> 01:10:57,759
individually conscious. Other
aspects of the physical world

1071
01:10:57,759 --> 01:11:02,399
are individually conscious, but
the universe is conscious, and

1072
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:09,839
that there there are many tiers
of comprehensive functioning in

1073
01:11:09,839 --> 01:11:15,659
the universe, and when you enter
into deeper states of awareness,

1074
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:20,779
each of these deeper states is a
higher level of energy, which

1075
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:27,799
then requires a stabilization
that requires a purification

1076
01:11:27,799 --> 01:11:31,519
process and stabilization
process to be stay coherent at

1077
01:11:31,519 --> 01:11:35,599
that level. Now here's the
tricky part. When I started this

1078
01:11:35,599 --> 01:11:40,179
work, I was thinking, this is
all about therapy, or this is

1079
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:43,179
about healing my personal
psyche, or it's about

1080
01:11:43,959 --> 01:11:47,379
enlightening Chris, spacious,
poor psyche. You know, it's

1081
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:51,519
about something personal, but
some of the pain that you're

1082
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:57,039
referring to Rick came about
when I went through after two

1083
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:00,719
years of work, went through a
crushing ego death experience

1084
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:06,299
just cracked me wide open, and
then it took me into a new layer

1085
01:12:06,299 --> 01:12:10,259
of work, where, for the next two
years, I went through

1086
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:18,059
excruciating psychological,
psychophysical suffering. So it

1087
01:12:18,059 --> 01:12:22,579
was so large and so broad and so
deep. And it went on for so many

1088
01:12:22,579 --> 01:12:26,359
years that eventually I became
convinced that this was not

1089
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:29,839
about healing Chris Bache his
psyche. It's not about purifying

1090
01:12:29,839 --> 01:12:33,679
something that's somehow
personal to Chris Bache, that

1091
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:39,319
eventually I was forced to draw
the conclusion that somehow

1092
01:12:39,379 --> 01:12:43,359
something had happened in my
sessions, that the universe, or

1093
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:47,559
some functional dynamic of the
universe, was using my sessions

1094
01:12:47,799 --> 01:12:51,219
to bring about some type of
healing at the collective level

1095
01:12:51,219 --> 01:12:54,639
of consciousness, some type of
healing aimed at the personal

1096
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:59,319
psyche that there is. And
eventually, the way I understand

1097
01:12:59,319 --> 01:13:03,479
this is that just as I remember
all Chris spacious experiences,

1098
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:08,279
for better or for worse the
human species, there is a mind

1099
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:11,759
of the human species that
remembers all of the experiences

1100
01:13:11,759 --> 01:13:14,939
of all the members of its
species. So then, if you think

1101
01:13:14,939 --> 01:13:17,579
about all the terrible things
we've done to each other, and

1102
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:20,899
all the wars and all the killing
and all the bloodshed and all

1103
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:25,699
the rape and all those terrible
pains, that somehow the species

1104
01:13:26,059 --> 01:13:29,599
is stuck with those and has to
digest those in the same way

1105
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:34,819
that I am stuck with Crispus
experiences, and that just as

1106
01:13:34,879 --> 01:13:39,199
it's good for crisp Bache, if I
can somehow confront the darkest

1107
01:13:39,259 --> 01:13:43,839
pieces of my shadow and bring
that to rest. The same thing

1108
01:13:43,839 --> 01:13:47,859
happens at the collective level
for the species as a whole.

1109
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:50,979
Usually that type of
confrontation takes place in

1110
01:13:50,979 --> 01:13:56,679
terms of social transformations
or social revolutions. But I

1111
01:13:56,679 --> 01:14:01,319
think in very, very deep
psychedelic work, my experience

1112
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:07,139
was that somehow something was
using my sessions to de effect

1113
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:12,599
some body of pain and suffering
that was stuck or lodged in the

1114
01:14:12,599 --> 01:14:19,139
collective psyche. So to me, I
just had to go to a collective

1115
01:14:19,139 --> 01:14:22,639
model in order to understand the
data. This actually

1116
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,160
Rick Archer: gives new meaning
to the saying that Christ died

1117
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:31,160
for our sins. You know. I mean,
if, if a being is of, you know,

1118
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,760
great enough stature in terms of
his the vastness of his

1119
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,120
awareness, then it's like, you
know, an ocean being able to

1120
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:42,820
dissolve lots of mud and stuff,
as opposed to a glass of water,

1121
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:46,480
which can only take a little bit
of mud without becoming entirely

1122
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,260
overwhelmed by it.

1123
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,740
Chris Bache: We see that also in
the Buddhist traditions, the

1124
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:55,840
Bodhisattva is basically someone
who basically places the good of

1125
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,300
the whole over their individual
good makes that their project. I

1126
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:06,120
don't think this is heavy duty,
spiritual requiring great, great

1127
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,320
beings. I think any mother, any
father, worth their soul, would

1128
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:15,420
do what they can to help end the
suffering of a child that they

1129
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:20,360
solve. This is just part of the
natural case. What it means to

1130
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:24,200
be a human. So if you're given
an opportunity, and in some deep

1131
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,540
psychedelic sessions, you
sometimes are given an

1132
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:29,840
opportunity. If you're given an
opportunity to relieve

1133
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,800
suffering, it's just the most
natural thing in the world to

1134
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,200
try to do that as best you can,
sure,

1135
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,940
Rick Archer: but as best you
can, it's a question of

1136
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:43,720
capacity. You know, Rupert
Sheldrake talks about Morphic

1137
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,720
genetic fields, and you were
just alluding to fields being

1138
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:52,060
able to store the traumas of
humanity. And I've also, I've

1139
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:57,400
heard it said that wars break
out when there's enough stress,

1140
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,200
if you will, accumulated in the
field that it can no longer be

1141
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,900
contained, like the way
lightning strikes when there's

1142
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:09,540
enough static electricity built
up in clouds. And so if we can

1143
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,260
sort of become that field, or
attune ourselves with it, then

1144
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,960
it seems, from what you're
saying in your book, that we can

1145
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:20,280
become an instrument for its
purging, for its purification.

1146
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,180
Yeah.

1147
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,180
Chris Bache: I think the
universe seems to be intensely

1148
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:31,760
interested in us as individuals,
but the universe also seems to

1149
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:36,860
be intensely interested in us as
a species. And when you're

1150
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:41,680
moving into that level of
consciousness where the universe

1151
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,700
is communing with the species.
And you kind of you've gone

1152
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,580
through ego death, and you've
gone through a series of deaths

1153
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,820
where you basically have
dissolved your boundaries and

1154
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:57,280
have basically opened up into
not all that is not mind at

1155
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:01,140
large, but species mind, the
collective mind of the species.

1156
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:08,280
It seems very clear that the
universe is nurturing the well

1157
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:12,360
being of this universe of this
species, just as it nurtures the

1158
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,960
well being of all individuals
within the species and all the

1159
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:20,340
other species on the planet that
there is a there is a tremendous

1160
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:25,880
power that cascades through all
of our lives, individually and

1161
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,600
collectively.

1162
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,740
Rick Archer: Yeah, Michael, have
we lost yet?

1163
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,840
Michael Pollan: No, I'm
fascinated by what I'm hearing.

1164
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,860
I don't know by how to process
it. I'm kind of curious to know,

1165
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:44,380
Chris, what? Where did that turn
come from thinking you were

1166
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:50,320
dealing with your individual
suffering, to realizing that

1167
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,340
this was a collective matter,
that this, this was a

1168
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,720
Transpersonal question, was it?
Was it an insight you had during

1169
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:03,780
one of these, one of these high
dose experiences, or was it in

1170
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:09,000
processing it after the fact?
Because that's a big that's a

1171
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,140
big shift.

1172
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:16,620
Chris Bache: Yeah, it was a big
shift, and it is a both and, but

1173
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:21,260
probably the most important part
of it was after the session, as

1174
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:25,880
I processed and worked it. It
took me years because I kept

1175
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,360
trying to process in terms of
Stan's paradigm, in terms of the

1176
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,300
paradigms that were available,
and all the paradigms

1177
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:36,680
approaching psychedelics were
always about healing the

1178
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:40,040
individual, enlightening the
individual, something like that.

1179
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:44,980
And I kept trying to understand,
and I wrote Dark Knight early

1180
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:49,720
dawn, in large part, to answer
the question, Why did suffering

1181
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:53,200
get as large as it did in my
psychedelic sessions, to try to

1182
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,220
answer this problem. And
eventually, that's where I made

1183
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:02,700
the jump beyond the person
centered model into a collective

1184
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:07,380
model. Now my thinking has gone
further since then, but that was

1185
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:12,120
where I made the jump, and I
wrote that 9596 I started the

1186
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:17,760
work in 79 I wrote that book
when I was about 15 years into

1187
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:24,680
that process. So it took me at
least 10 well after when these

1188
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:32,660
experiences started, it took me
years before I could really say

1189
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:37,100
that idea and then agree to that
idea. And then once I began to

1190
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,160
see it and understand it, then a
whole lot of other things began

1191
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:48,760
to make sense, because the
collective level, yeah, yeah,

1192
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,080
when going after going through
that ocean of suffering, I call

1193
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:58,600
it the ocean of suffering, which
lasted two years, when that came

1194
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,560
to a culmination, when that.
Culminated, and I went through a

1195
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,280
death and rebirth process that
was associated with that level

1196
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,360
of consciousness, and went
deeper into archetypal reality,

1197
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:14,460
high archetypal and low
archetype of reality I had, I

1198
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,940
had many, many experiences that
basically showed me how that

1199
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:24,620
worked. Showed me how the
species mind is alive within all

1200
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:29,360
of our fractally embedded
individual minds, how our

1201
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,020
individual minds feed into the
collective mind, as Rupert

1202
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:37,160
Sheldrake says, and how the
collective mind move feeds into

1203
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:41,680
the individual mind. That this a
constant feedback system in that

1204
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,620
process, and that's
intellectually it was Rupert's

1205
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:49,600
work. When I integrated Rupert's
Morphic field theory into Stan

1206
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,020
Grof paradigm, that's the part
that gave me the intellectual

1207
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:57,880
permission to make this radical
reinterpretation of the

1208
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,500
Michael Pollan: data that's
fascinating. And how do you how

1209
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,960
do you respond to people who
say, Well, you just had a drug

1210
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:08,940
experience. You mess with the
chemistry in your brain, and you

1211
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:13,080
had these delusions that you
were getting some kind of

1212
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,240
insight into something
collective. I mean, that's how a

1213
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,480
lot of a lot of people not
versed in this world or having

1214
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,320
had this experience, would
automatically go like, why

1215
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:24,440
should a molecule afford such
insight?

1216
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:30,080
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, that's
an anthropological question, and

1217
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:35,060
I'd rather leave that one to the
anthropologist. But I understand

1218
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:39,440
the objection. I understand the
cautionary concern. I mean, I

1219
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:43,900
was trained as an analytic
philosopher, and I was trained

1220
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,960
in a highly, kind of, highly
skeptical discipline, so I

1221
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:54,400
really affirm that I value that
skepticism, but I also I think

1222
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,720
it's important that we look at
the history of human beings use

1223
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:02,820
of these substances, and look at
some of the literature and how

1224
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:07,800
these substances have been
regarded in other civilizations.

1225
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:12,060
I think it's important to look
at all the data that is emerging

1226
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:16,320
in the modern study of
psychedelics, so that in dark,

1227
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:21,320
night, early dawn, I have a
chapter on the methodology of

1228
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:25,460
basically taking a philosophical
approach to psychedelic inquiry.

1229
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:29,300
And I list some of the reasons
why we should take these series

1230
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,780
these experiences seriously and
we should not dismiss them. One

1231
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:37,880
of the data is we sometimes get
knowledge in these states of

1232
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,260
consciousness that we did not
have prior and we can reasonably

1233
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,860
exclude that we did not have.
But this knowledge turns out to

1234
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:47,020
be true and valid,

1235
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:50,200
Michael Pollan: like the
perinatal research that stand

1236
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,640
it. For example,

1237
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:54,759
Chris Bache: some people have
will relive aspects of their

1238
01:22:54,759 --> 01:22:57,999
birth that they can later
verify, or, kind of more

1239
01:22:57,999 --> 01:23:02,519
radically, one can have an
experience which teaches you

1240
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:07,799
something about how whales give
birth, or how lions experience

1241
01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:12,479
hunger, which you had never no
idea of before, never crossed

1242
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:15,839
your awareness before, and it
turns out to be physiologically

1243
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:20,279
accurate. Sometimes, in one
case, I remember Stan saying

1244
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:26,539
that in one of his sessions, he
was confronted with a person who

1245
01:23:26,539 --> 01:23:31,819
basically was insisting that
Stan call his mother and father

1246
01:23:31,879 --> 01:23:35,959
gave them a telephone number and
wanted to reassure the parents

1247
01:23:35,959 --> 01:23:39,739
that he was okay. And this was
really, really strange and out

1248
01:23:39,739 --> 01:23:43,779
of left field, but they wrote
down the number, wrote down the

1249
01:23:43,779 --> 01:23:48,279
names, and after the session was
over and everything was stable

1250
01:23:48,279 --> 01:23:54,399
again, Stan very carefully
reached out to this phone number

1251
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:59,199
and found the husband and wife
on the other side end of the

1252
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:02,999
phone, And it turns out that
their son had just died. I don't

1253
01:24:03,419 --> 01:24:06,179
remember whether it was several
days ago or several weeks

1254
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:13,079
before, and they they understood
that their son would wish them

1255
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:16,559
to know that he was okay. So you
get very, very unusual

1256
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:17,939
circumstances like that.

1257
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,040
Rick Archer: So wait a minute,
this wasn't the physical person

1258
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,400
in the room that gave the phone
number. This is something Stan

1259
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:27,140
kind of cognized in some
psychedelic state, and was was

1260
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:31,820
given a phone number by some non
physical entity, and then called

1261
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:35,840
the parents, and it panned out.
It was very fine. Wow. Yeah,

1262
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,680
that's interesting.

1263
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,420
Michael Pollan: So Chris, you
said also though that you

1264
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:43,180
wouldn't recommend this kind of
regime, I have two questions

1265
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:47,620
about that. Why not? And second,
after the agony that you went

1266
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:51,220
through in these sessions, how
did you ever muster the courage

1267
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,640
to do it again, let alone two
more times?

1268
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,160
Rick Archer: Yeah, before you
answer that, Chris, I just want

1269
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:01,380
to add a little related bit. Did
you ever. Feel that maybe you

1270
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:04,140
were frying the circuitry you
know in your action, that all

1271
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:07,080
this suffering was a result of
some damage that you were

1272
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,540
inflicting upon yourself, or
that maybe you were opening

1273
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:14,100
yourself up to some negative
astral level, or something like

1274
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,400
that. How did you have the
confidence to proceed? I'm just

1275
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,840
adding that on to Michael's
question.

1276
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,800
Chris Bache: Well, I really
trusted Stan Grof work. I mean,

1277
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,700
that's why I consider myself in
his lineage. My work is based

1278
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:33,440
upon his scholarship. I trusted
what I saw in Stan's work. I

1279
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:38,540
trusted the methodology. I
trusted his surveying of the

1280
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:41,080
literature. I trusted his
evidence that there was no

1281
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:45,520
physiological, no genetic
damage. I trusted the cases that

1282
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:51,100
he presented. I appreciated the
rigor with which he had digested

1283
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,640
all various bodies of
psychodynamic theory, as he does

1284
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,880
in beyond the brain, and
integrated them into the

1285
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:02,400
phenomenology of psychedelic
discourse, and primarily that

1286
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,560
one of the primary things I got
from Stan's work was an absolute

1287
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:13,020
trust that if you surrender
completely to what arises in

1288
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:18,480
your psychedelic session, it
will you can trust that. And you

1289
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,260
may not understand it going in,
and it may be absolutely

1290
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,680
horrendous and painful going in.
It may take you months or years

1291
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,920
to understand why things are
unfolding the way they are, but

1292
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,700
you can trust it, and it will
always come out good in the end.

1293
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:42,220
And I that was the procedure I
took. I found, why not doing

1294
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:44,920
this work, and then what
happened in the work? Why not

1295
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:49,480
doing this work? I wouldn't work
in doses that high. I mean, it's

1296
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,880
not that I wouldn't recommend
doing doses that high

1297
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:58,600
occasionally, but I wouldn't do
such a pounding, blowing of

1298
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,920
consciousness apart so
aggressively for so many

1299
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,280
sessions and so many years, even
though I was doing it in a very

1300
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:09,180
responsible manner, I was doing
it about five times a year, so I

1301
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:12,180
had a lot of time to recuperate.
I was taking care of my body. I

1302
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:15,000
was doing spiritual practice
during all this time. I was

1303
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,320
keeping detailed notes. I made a
phenomenologically precise

1304
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:23,840
record within 24 hours of every
session. I studied the session,

1305
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,920
so I was really trying to be as
methodical as I could. But

1306
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,060
basically, by the time I was at
the end, time I was finishing

1307
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:35,900
this journey, I had a number of
breakthroughs and a number of

1308
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:42,160
insights we can talk about. But
I came to understand that one

1309
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:46,240
other assumption that I had made
about this work was wrong. The

1310
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,720
assumption was that there is a
certain goal that you can get

1311
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,020
to, that there was an end point
that you could some it could be

1312
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:58,720
oneness with God, or oneness or
the meta cosmic void, or the

1313
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,500
super cosmic void, that there
was an end point that you would

1314
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:09,180
get to. And what I found
eventually, when I had gotten I

1315
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:12,360
had experienced many
permutations of oneness, I found

1316
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,900
that there are variations and
subtleties of oneness, and there

1317
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:21,080
are even variations in the void,
in the domain of formlessness.

1318
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:26,420
And if you if you have a method
which is so powerful it keeps

1319
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:29,240
pushing you to the edge of your
experiential boundaries, it'll

1320
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:33,560
keep taking you through
remorselessly boundary after

1321
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:38,300
boundary after boundary, leading
into deeper, deeper intimacy

1322
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:41,500
with the I call it the creative
intelligence of the universe. I

1323
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:46,000
don't know what else to call it.
It's infinitely vast. It's

1324
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:50,020
infinitely intelligent, it's
infinitely compassionate. I

1325
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:54,820
mean, it's just what it has
taught me, and just the

1326
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:59,080
experience of dissolving into it
without any boundaries. Left

1327
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:05,280
over has been enormous. Has been
deeply life changing. But late

1328
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,360
into the process, about 17 years
into the process, I had an

1329
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:14,700
experience where I was as far
deep into the diamond

1330
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,520
Luminosity, I call it deep into
what the Buddhists call

1331
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,980
Dharmakaya, the clear light of
absolute reality, as far into it

1332
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:27,260
as I had ever gone. I was in
deep state of bliss and clarity,

1333
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:33,020
and all of a sudden, my visual
field pivoted 90 degrees, and I

1334
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:37,640
saw reality Far, Far in the
distance. It looked like

1335
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:42,580
galaxies, and a ray of light
emerged from that reality and

1336
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:48,040
hit me, and it absolutely
shattered me. And in those few

1337
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:52,600
seconds, I realized it's an
infinite progression. You cannot

1338
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,420
get to the end of the universe.
You cannot get to the end of the

1339
01:29:55,420 --> 01:30:00,180
mind of the universe. It's an
infinite progression. And. And

1340
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:05,700
that that's one of the reasons I
would be gentler with myself. I

1341
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:09,960
would be gentler because I think
what we can do with these

1342
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,440
substances, we can open
ourselves up to the infinity,

1343
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,800
and we can take in as much of
the infinity as we can get into

1344
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,660
our system, as much as we can
psychologically digest,

1345
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:25,400
emotionally digest, physically
digest. And I I'm more patient

1346
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,600
now with the slower trajectory
of spiritual and psychological

1347
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,440
development than I was when I
was a young man running into the

1348
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,100
states.

1349
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,220
Rick Archer: What you were just
saying addresses something that

1350
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:41,080
Michael brought up a few minutes
ago, which was, how can some

1351
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:45,520
molecules adjust our brain in
such a way that we actually

1352
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:50,440
begin to have cognitions, deep,
meaningful cognitions about the

1353
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:55,780
meaning of life or the nature of
reality and all that. And I had

1354
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:58,780
written down a question here,
are psychedelic visions merely

1355
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:03,240
projections of our personal
psyche, or do we experience

1356
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,180
things that actually exist but
are originally better,

1357
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:08,940
ordinarily, beyond the range of
our perception? But what you

1358
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:11,820
just said about the creative
intelligence of the universe, or

1359
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:15,300
the mind of the universe,
answers the question, because if

1360
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:18,300
that's the way it is, if there
is a mind of the universe, if,

1361
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,400
if the foundation or the ground
state of of the universe is an

1362
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,040
ocean of creative intelligence
out of which the universe

1363
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:29,180
emerges. Then by whatever means,
psychedelics or meditation, or

1364
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:34,760
whatever, that we manage to
merge with that ocean, then we

1365
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:38,360
sort of realize our ultimate
essential identity with that

1366
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,720
mind of the universe, or with
that creative intelligence,

1367
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:44,320
which is, we can say, the
repository of all the laws of

1368
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,620
nature, the repository of all
knowledge. And although, as a

1369
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:53,320
human being, we can only kind of
express so much of it, we'll

1370
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:57,520
always have our limitations. As
a finite instrument, we can kind

1371
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:04,680
of dip into it in such a way
that that there is that we we

1372
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:08,640
share in a kind of omniscience,
in a way you know what I'm

1373
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:13,620
trying to say and and we absorb
it to some extent. And so all

1374
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:16,860
the great pronouncements of the
mystics throughout the ages have

1375
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:20,540
been their attempts, through the
human form, through human

1376
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:24,980
language to express that merging
that they experienced.

1377
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:32,120
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think when
we have temporary experience of

1378
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:36,560
infinity, it leaves a lasting
impression, even when we are

1379
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,340
back to being a finite being.
And if we have temporary

1380
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:45,460
experience of infinite love, all
embracing, all inclusive, and a

1381
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:50,800
love that transcends species and
reaches out to the molecules of

1382
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,000
existence, the atoms of
existence itself. Then when we

1383
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:00,720
congeal back into our ordinary
time space suit, it has an

1384
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:04,680
effect. It has a profound
effect. And I guess that's one

1385
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:08,820
of the other reasons I would
suggest that we should give

1386
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:13,320
these experiences a measure of
credence. It's not just because

1387
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:16,260
of the empirical assessment,
empirical data and the

1388
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:20,420
correlation between multiple
experiences. And I want to

1389
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:22,640
mention, there's always
deception, there's always

1390
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:26,000
incompleteness, there's always
distortion, we always are going

1391
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,140
to have to deal with. Well, what
if it's just this and not that?

1392
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:33,440
You know, absolutely, that's the
nature of the dialog. That's a

1393
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:36,680
discussion. It's a worthy
question, and it is a word. The

1394
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:37,280
experience

1395
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,320
Michael Pollan: has an enormous
authority. I mean, I think it's

1396
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:43,540
one of the most striking things
about psychedelics is that, you

1397
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:46,600
know what William James called
the Noetic sense. And speaking

1398
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:51,280
of mystical experience, that it
is, these don't seem just kind

1399
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:55,300
of subjective opinions. They
seem like authoritative truths.

1400
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:58,780
And yeah, and that's one, that's
one of the reasons they're so

1401
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:03,720
sticky. I wonder, Chris, whether
you feel that I agree with the

1402
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,960
proper discipline and
commitment, you could get to the

1403
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,340
same place with meditation.

1404
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:16,260
Chris Bache: Absolutely, I think
so, with some qualifications in

1405
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,980
that, since I'm professor of
religious studies, and I've

1406
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:23,600
taught courses in comparative
mysticism, and I studied, I have

1407
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,620
had the luxury of studying some
of the mystical traditions. The

1408
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,880
great masters who do this
through entirely natural means

1409
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:35,000
are and there are masters who do
it with other assisted means as

1410
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,960
well. The great masters have
always been my guiding light in

1411
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,280
this material. And it's always
been. You know, to be able to

1412
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:45,880
sustain these states for a few
hours is great, but to be able

1413
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:51,400
to sustain them for months
years, that's greater still and

1414
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:56,440
to be respected. Now I'll
mention that Carol, my sitter,

1415
01:34:56,620 --> 01:35:01,320
is a serious Vajrayana Buddhist
practitioner. Her always was

1416
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:05,880
during the years we were working
together, and she never did a

1417
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:10,200
psychedelic session, never did a
session with me. She was always

1418
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:15,180
much more contemplative in her
practice. And subsequently,

1419
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,940
after we have separated and
she's remarried and I've

1420
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:22,460
remarried, we're still close,
she has gone on and completed

1421
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:25,820
her three year, three month,
three day retreat under the

1422
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:29,660
supervision of her teacher. So
she's a serious practitioner,

1423
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:38,600
and I'm a modest practitioner by
comparison, but I understand the

1424
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,820
relationship between my
psychedelic experiences, and the

1425
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:47,860
experiences which are preserved
in the meditative traditions

1426
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:51,940
that she has introduced me to,
or that I've introduced been

1427
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:54,940
introduced through her. And I
see a very, very strong

1428
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:57,760
correlation. I don't think the
unit the cosmology that we're

1429
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:02,220
encountering with deep
psychedelic work is original.

1430
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:06,360
It's not new. We see this
cosmology in the great

1431
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:12,960
spiritual, mystical traditions
of history. That said, I think

1432
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:19,140
that all of those traditions in
history are all stage specific.

1433
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:22,100
They all reflect a certain
historical context and

1434
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:26,000
anthropological context and even
an evolutionary context. I don't

1435
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,720
see them as eternal truths. I
see them as approximations of an

1436
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:33,980
ever growing, expanding truth.
So I think that there are

1437
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:37,460
certain ways in which the
cosmology that psychedelics can

1438
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:41,560
introduce us to can push the
edges of those classic

1439
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:46,060
cosmology, and you can push the
edges, and that opens up new

1440
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:50,440
possibilities. I don't think,
for example, a deep immersion

1441
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:56,380
into transtemporal experience is
is a deeply ingrained quality in

1442
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:02,100
mystical experiences, but that
is happened a great deal in my

1443
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:06,180
psychedelic experiences I
mentioned. Let me back up and

1444
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:10,740
say I started this work, you
know, 1979 because I was

1445
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:13,860
interested in spirituality. I
was interested in enlightenment.

1446
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:16,800
I had been meditating for a
number of years. I thought that

1447
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,300
I could, I encountered the kind
of blocks that are pretty

1448
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:23,540
typical in early stages of
meditation, and I thought that

1449
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:27,320
by doing some sessions, I could
deal with those blocks, blast

1450
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:31,760
through them, and I could reach
enlightenment faster. Didn't

1451
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:36,200
work out quite that way. But
what I found was that when I

1452
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:40,280
really went into it, that was
one track, the Enlightenment

1453
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:44,140
track, a second track opened
that was really a very different

1454
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:48,460
track, and that's the track of a
cosmic exploration, to actually

1455
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:52,600
explore the consciousness of the
universe, to explore deeply the

1456
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:56,980
fabric of reality and experience
it all its ins and outs. It's

1457
01:37:56,980 --> 01:38:03,540
not that these are incompatible,
but the cosmological inquiry

1458
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:09,000
came to dominate my sessions. So
I wouldn't want to use the

1459
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:12,900
measure of enlightenment as
meaningful and beautiful and

1460
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:16,560
important as that is as the
criteria for evaluating

1461
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,140
everything that happened in my
sessions. I sort of see their

1462
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:23,900
different projects, and only in
the very late years did it kind

1463
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:27,860
of come back around into the
classical enlightenment kind of

1464
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:28,280
work.

1465
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:31,400
Rick Archer: I think there have
been plenty of Yogis and Siddhas

1466
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:35,180
and so on, who have done plenty
of cosmic exploration. And

1467
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:40,160
they've they've written down
their their findings, you know,

1468
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,120
they've just gone about it
through various other means. Did

1469
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:48,100
you want to add something there?
Michael, no, no, okay, I have a

1470
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:51,460
line of questioning here that'll
shift our gears a little bit.

1471
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:55,360
Chris Bache: Let me just mention
one thing. If psychedelics, if

1472
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:00,120
LSD is only an amplifier of
consciousness, then by

1473
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:03,360
definition, it does nothing that
can't be achieved through other

1474
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,200
methods for exploring
consciousness. Because it's not,

1475
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:10,560
it's psychedelic, which does
this, it's consciousness which

1476
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,580
does this. We're simply
amplifying and focusing it. And

1477
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,580
you, you're focusing
consciousness in meditation. You

1478
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:19,800
can go into these places in
meditation.

1479
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,340
Rick Archer: Yeah, yeah. And
that thing you said about

1480
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:25,340
patience as you get older and,
you know, kind of abandoning the

1481
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:29,960
enlightenment or bust attitude.
I mean, you know, I had done

1482
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:32,900
some psychedelics in the 60s for
about a year, and then I learned

1483
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:36,320
to meditate when I was 18. And
I've been doing it for 51 years,

1484
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:40,420
you know, a couple hours a day.
And it's for many years there

1485
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:43,720
was a sort of a desperate
feeling of, gotta get

1486
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:46,300
enlightened, you know, gotta
break through. After a while

1487
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:49,960
that just sort of dissipated. It
just sort of oozed away. And,

1488
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,720
you know, contentment kind of
dawned. And I just don't think

1489
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,820
that way anymore. I don't know
whether that's due to a, you

1490
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:58,060
know, natural maturation, or
whether it's due to the results

1491
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:02,400
of meditation bringing about. A
kind of an abiding sense of

1492
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:07,260
fulfillment which is not
dependent upon any external

1493
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:10,560
circumstances, but one way or
the other. I think that you

1494
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:16,320
know, whatever one chooses to
do, safety first is a good rule

1495
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:20,780
of thumb, because impatience can
result in some pretty

1496
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:25,460
unfortunate situations. You
know, if one proceeds recklessly

1497
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:26,240
in any sense,

1498
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:30,500
Chris Bache: yeah, absolutely,
yeah, yeah. Okay. So

1499
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,720
Rick Archer: here's a question I
want to ask. I have a good

1500
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,500
friend named Dana Sawyer, who
was, we've been friends since we

1501
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,840
were kids. Practically. He's a
he's been a professor, professor

1502
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,780
of religion and philosophy at
the main College of Art and

1503
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,360
adjunct professor of Asian
Studies at the Bangor

1504
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:49,840
Theological Seminary, and he's
written biographies of Aldous

1505
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,740
Huxley and Huston Smith. And he
had two questions that are

1506
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:58,240
related. One is, what are the
connections? We've kind of

1507
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,840
covered this, so maybe we'll
maybe the answer to this first

1508
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:04,260
bit will be quick. What are the
connections, similarities and

1509
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:07,200
differences between psychedelic
state, psychedelic states and

1510
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,600
mystical states of
consciousness? Have we? Have we

1511
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,220
covered that adequately? Maybe
we have,

1512
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:15,000
Michael Pollan: well, you know,
the researchers that I spent a

1513
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,500
lot of time interviewing see
them lining up very closely, and

1514
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:23,600
sometimes they'll use the term
mystical like experience,

1515
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:28,040
because I think they don't want
to offend anyone on the on the

1516
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:34,280
religion side. But you know,
they, they studied very closely

1517
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:38,060
the the anatomy of mystical
experience, especially as

1518
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:43,300
William James described it. And
they, they feel that it has all

1519
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,240
the six, seven or eight
characteristics.

1520
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,440
Rick Archer: Yeah, actually, I
was reminded, and a question

1521
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:56,200
just came in that Ram Dass gave
some LSD to Neem, Karoli Baba,

1522
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:59,860
and apparently it had no effect
on him. Because presumably, I

1523
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:03,840
guess, the interpretation was
that he was already in some kind

1524
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:08,040
of high abiding state, and LSD
really couldn't add to it in any

1525
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:08,280
way.

1526
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,820
Michael Pollan: I've always,
I've heard that story for a very

1527
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:14,640
long time, and the dose was one
of Chris's doses. It was like

1528
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:19,380
five or 600 micrograms. And I've
always, I have to say, I've

1529
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:22,400
always thought it was
apocryphal. But we have to ask

1530
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,940
Chris Bache: now that you'll
find the story in the book

1531
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,640
miracle of love, which is Ram
Dass, this collection of

1532
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:32,660
anecdotes about dim Karoli Baba.
And according to Ram Dass, he

1533
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:37,940
gave him 600 micrograms the
first time, and then he, you

1534
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:40,960
know, then, basically he wasn't
affected. He came back the

1535
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,140
United States, and he told his
friends, and they said, Oh, he

1536
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:47,080
must have palmed it. Nobody can
take 600 mics and not be

1537
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:51,280
affected. And he went back to
the ashram, and Neem Karoli Baba

1538
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,440
called him over, and he said, Do
you have any more of that

1539
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:58,840
Western medicine? And he brought
everything. He had 1200

1540
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:03,180
micrograms and RAM and neem.
Karoli Baba, according to Ram

1541
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:07,140
Dass, put them on his tongue and
made him see that he was taking

1542
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:10,920
them and swallowed them and and
it didn't affect him.

1543
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:16,080
Rick Archer: Did you ever hear
Bruce Joel Ruben story? No.

1544
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,380
Bruce wrote the screenplay for
the movie Ghost, and he won the

1545
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:23,420
Oscar for that. And he also
wrote the screenplay for, what

1546
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:27,920
is it, Jacob's Ladder and some
other movies. Anyway, he'd been

1547
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,300
on batgap, but he was a teenager
living in New York City in some

1548
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:36,800
apartment, and somebody brought
over like a glass mayonnaise jar

1549
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,860
full of liquid sand dose that
was going to be shipped up to

1550
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:43,300
Millbrook for Timothy Leary's
gang, and asked if they he could

1551
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:46,300
store it in their refrigerator.
So it was in their refrigerator.

1552
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,520
And so they're sitting around.
They think we should try this,

1553
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:51,760
you know. And so his friend was
going to put a drop on his

1554
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,340
tongue using a dropper, and he
squeezed the whole dropper.

1555
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:01,080
Anyway, you can look it up.
It's, it's quite a story.

1556
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:03,660
Chris Bache: Grof says that
there is a natural threshold of

1557
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:07,080
about 500 micrograms. If you
take more than that, you don't

1558
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:10,440
necessarily get higher. So
there's a kind of a cut off

1559
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,140
there, around five to 600
micrograms. That's good to know,

1560
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:14,760
saturation point. So here's the

1561
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:16,920
Rick Archer: important question,
then we should let Michael go.

1562
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,740
This is my second one from Dana.
This I should have asked this

1563
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:23,720
one first, he said that Huston
Smith once argued that traits

1564
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:26,840
matter more than states, and
even if psychedelics can trigger

1565
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,900
trigger religious experiences,
it's less clear they can develop

1566
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:33,680
religious lives. Dana mentioned
that psychedelics can definitely

1567
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:37,640
trigger genuine mystical states
as measured by, you know, eight

1568
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:41,560
of the nine parameters of the
states Pankey typology, but the

1569
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,820
ninth parameter is continued
improvements in behavior. So is

1570
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:48,400
there evidence that psychedelic
experiences lead to more

1571
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,320
compassionate or selfless
behavior?

1572
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:55,180
Michael Pollan: I think it's a
really good, good question. I

1573
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:58,960
don't, I don't think I know the
answer to it. You know, some

1574
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:03,840
people feel that. That the fact
that attaining knowledge through

1575
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:10,080
psychedelics is so rapid, I hate
to use the word easy, especially

1576
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:16,800
after what Chris has told us,
that it is it is less enduring,

1577
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:22,400
has less traction in our lives.
You know the analogy sometimes

1578
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:27,920
used is that if you climb the
mountain and you get to the top,

1579
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,100
and you get that view, and then
someone lands on the mountain in

1580
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:35,660
a helicopter, they get the same
view, but they haven't earned it

1581
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:39,740
in the same way, and therefore
it is less powerful that strikes

1582
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:45,400
me as kind of a Puritan view.
You know that, you know that

1583
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:49,420
that that you need works. You
need good works to justify

1584
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:54,520
faith. So I don't know if it's
true. I think that there are

1585
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:57,160
many people who've had
psychedelic experiences that

1586
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,920
they've carried the insights and
the convictions through to their

1587
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:03,960
lives and change their lives and
become more moral or more

1588
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:06,900
ethical people, and there are
people for whom it hasn't been

1589
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:09,960
sticky, and I think that's part
of the work of integration. I

1590
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:13,260
think that's part of you know,
of approaching it with reverence

1591
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:18,720
and recognition of the power
that that that there is another

1592
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:22,640
big step, which is, how do you
apply what you've seen, and what

1593
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:25,760
do you do with it, and how does
it change your behavior? And I

1594
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,980
don't think there's any. There's
nothing inherent in the

1595
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:32,540
experience that makes you more
or less likely to to do that.

1596
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:37,160
It's it's really up to us. But,
you know, I think it's something

1597
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,380
everyone doing these
explorations should bear in

1598
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:41,800
mind. It's not going to be
automatic. I mean, there are

1599
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,740
people who've done psychedelics
and come out and behave really

1600
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:47,680
badly, and there are people
who've had their ego dissolved

1601
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:50,800
and during psychedelic
experience and then it inflated

1602
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:55,000
enormously after. And so I
think, I think we have to be

1603
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,280
very wary of those pitfalls,

1604
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:59,080
Rick Archer: you know. And I
think the same can be said of

1605
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:02,160
meditation. I know people who've
been meditating for decades that

1606
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:07,140
I wouldn't want to associate
with, they act like real sobs

1607
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:11,400
sometimes, and others who really
underwent a deep transformation

1608
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:14,460
and became much better people.
So maybe there does need to be,

1609
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:17,460
in addition to whatever the
practice for dipping in the

1610
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:20,420
consciousness, maybe there needs
to be a kind of a conscious

1611
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:26,000
attention to ethics and you
know, being being a more

1612
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,440
responsible human being?

1613
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:31,880
Chris Bache: Yeah, I completely
agree with both of you. I agree

1614
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:36,620
with you, Michael, that a
mystical experience does not a

1615
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:41,320
mystic make, to paraphrase
Huston Smith, but also a

1616
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:46,060
mystical experience. Can a
materialist philosophy unmake

1617
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:49,840
and but I think, and so I think
it has philosophical

1618
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:53,380
significance. If we have X
number of people who do X number

1619
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:57,340
of sessions and have an emerging
consensus around what they

1620
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:03,240
envision the cosmics to be like
that's significant, but I think

1621
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:05,940
you're absolutely right to have
an experience does not

1622
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,520
necessarily make you a wiser,
kinder, gentler person, but if,

1623
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,420
if you use those experiences and
work conscientiously in

1624
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:20,040
integrating them, then hopefully
they will there. They don't flip

1625
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,700
a switch. They don't make you
what you are becoming

1626
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:27,500
automatically, but they act as,
I think, a seed catalyst. Yeah,

1627
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:29,300
cultivate those seeds.

1628
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,760
Michael Pollan: Yeah, yeah.
Well, I think that's a great

1629
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:35,720
note for me to leave you on. I'm
very sorry I have to leave but I

1630
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:39,140
have another appointment, and I
thank you very much for a very

1631
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:42,100
stimulating conversation, and I
look forward to continuing

1632
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:42,460
sometime.

1633
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,860
Rick Archer: Yes, thank you so
much. And I should add that

1634
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:47,740
Michael's book will be coming
out in paperback on what did you

1635
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:51,880
say the 14 Tuesday? Well,
Tuesday. Well anyway, by the

1636
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:56,140
interview is up, the book will
be out, and you can get it on

1637
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:59,380
Amazon, and I'll have a link to
it on the page on batgap.com

1638
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:01,020
where I feature this

1639
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:03,120
Michael Pollan: in Chris. I look
forward to your new book, and

1640
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:03,960
I'll be sure to order

1641
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,180
Chris Bache: it. Thank you,
Michael, we have more

1642
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:09,000
conversations. I hope we have
lots more to talk about.

1643
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:12,060
Michael Pollan: We've just
begun. Thank you, absolutely,

1644
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:12,420
pleasure

1645
01:49:12,419 --> 01:49:14,399
Rick Archer: and those who are
listening, hang on, because I'm

1646
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:18,779
going to continue a little
longer with Chris. Let me start

1647
01:49:18,779 --> 01:49:21,679
Chris by asking a few questions
that have come in from the

1648
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:24,439
audience, and I want to save
time before we wrap up to talk

1649
01:49:24,439 --> 01:49:28,579
about your notion of the birth
of the future human, which I

1650
01:49:28,579 --> 01:49:32,419
think is fascinating, and the
and the changes that humanity

1651
01:49:32,419 --> 01:49:36,079
may have to go through as that
birth takes place. Okay, so

1652
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:38,479
let's budget our time. Let me
know when you feel like we

1653
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:42,519
should cut the questions and get
to that. So here's one from Amit

1654
01:49:42,579 --> 01:49:46,179
in New Zealand. He asks after
Ayahuasca sessions, I

1655
01:49:46,179 --> 01:49:49,059
experienced some detrimental
energetic shifts, for lack of

1656
01:49:49,059 --> 01:49:52,539
better words, waking up deeply,
physically tired for months

1657
01:49:52,539 --> 01:49:55,299
afterwards, that became somewhat
worrisome. Are there specific

1658
01:49:55,299 --> 01:49:58,059
methods or practices that you
can personally recommend for the

1659
01:49:58,059 --> 01:50:01,319
most efficient integration and
minimum. Of any potential

1660
01:50:01,319 --> 01:50:05,759
detrimental physical energetic
effect after some deep sessions,

1661
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:14,160
Chris Bache: it's complicated
question, first, because every

1662
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,740
psychedelic is a little
different, and so you have to

1663
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,220
you're talking about Ayahuasca,
it has a different quality than

1664
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:23,960
LSD and a different quality than
Psilocybin mushroom, but

1665
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:28,220
basically, Ayahuasca,
potentially. Let's assume a

1666
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:32,360
rather strong dose of Ayahuasca
has tremendous impact on our

1667
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:39,980
physiology and our psychology,
and when we jar ourselves that

1668
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:44,560
way, when we, when we enter into
these temporary conditions of

1669
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:47,680
awareness which are so radically
different than our ordinary

1670
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:51,400
awareness, it's going to shake
up our system, and it's going to

1671
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:57,220
impact us and it I think we have
to be gentle with ourselves, and

1672
01:50:57,220 --> 01:51:01,740
we should cultivate practices of
contemplation to help us

1673
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:04,980
integrate these experiences. I
don't think there's necessarily

1674
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:10,380
any formula that will ensure
ensure an outcome that doesn't

1675
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:14,160
lead to these periods of
physical exhaustion or sometimes

1676
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:18,660
a psychological kind of
exhaustion that follows. But

1677
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:22,520
basically, I think if we go to
the spiritual literature, and we

1678
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:25,760
look at the literature about
what is it, what does it mean to

1679
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:30,020
take up a spiritual practice, my
belief is the more powerful the

1680
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:33,980
psychedelic experience you want
to cultivate, either by the

1681
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:37,100
nature of the chemical, the
strength of the chemical, or the

1682
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:40,780
frequency with which you're
doing the chemical, The more you

1683
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:44,380
push your system into this new
territory, the more important it

1684
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:48,880
is for you to cultivate
meditation and the classic forms

1685
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,520
of contemplative practice,
taking care of the body,

1686
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,880
stretching the body, taking care
of the subtle energy system,

1687
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:58,600
taking care of your emotional
life, taking care of your of

1688
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:02,280
your mental Life, your spiritual
life. I think those are all

1689
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:06,000
important now, how actually
cashes out to a specific

1690
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,300
regimen? I mean, I know I have
my regimen. I always have had my

1691
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:13,380
regimen that changed through the
years. I just think it's good to

1692
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:18,240
ask the question that he's
asking he's asking, and to to

1693
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:21,260
seek advice and to cultivate the
regimens which will help

1694
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:25,520
stabilize the system when it's
come back from such an extreme

1695
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,560
experience. Good answer.

1696
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:31,100
Rick Archer: And there's other
things, exercise, diet, you

1697
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:35,900
know, I mean obvious stuff that
anybody benefits from if they do

1698
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:40,100
it regularly and properly. So,
you know, all that stuff,

1699
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:44,080
everything is interconnected.
This is a question from Bobby in

1700
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:48,100
Griffin, Georgia. Bobby asks if
psychedelics give a glimpse into

1701
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:51,940
true nature or reality, then
that seems to beg the question

1702
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:55,240
of there being some sort of
sheath or mask covering common

1703
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:59,920
daily experience. Is this sheath
or veil developed during early

1704
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:04,020
childhood, and therefore, would
infancy and early childhood

1705
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:07,200
experience be akin to
psychedelic experience?

1706
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:14,820
Chris Bache: Well, I understand
the logic, and I sort of see

1707
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:18,840
that, and I know a number of
people would say that, and at

1708
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:22,220
the same time, I hope no child
has ever had some of the

1709
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:25,700
experiences that I've had on
psychedelics, not just the

1710
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:31,640
negative ones, but even the
cosmic, ecstatic ones. That's an

1711
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:37,340
extremely powerful experience,
and I hope a child doesn't have

1712
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:41,080
to take that in. But within that
caveat, I think there's a

1713
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:46,000
certain sense in which children
are more naturally receptive to

1714
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,480
some of those sense more
sensitive dimensions of

1715
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:53,440
consciousness, and they lose
that sensitivity as they get

1716
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:56,800
older. And this kind of talked
out of them and conditioned out

1717
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:01,680
of them until later they have to
rediscover it. I think it's,

1718
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:05,340
it's, it's not just like
something that happens in

1719
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:10,740
childhood, you know, there's
again. I don't just study

1720
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:14,220
psychedelics. I study
reincarnation research, near

1721
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:18,780
death episode research, out of
body research. I study lots of

1722
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:24,440
different forms of Non-ordinary
states of consciousness. And I

1723
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:28,820
think the image that's coming
clear is that when we die, we

1724
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:34,160
expand into a larger, subtle,
higher state of consciousness,

1725
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:38,060
and when we incarnate, we
contract into a small,

1726
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:42,640
physically dominant kind of
consciousness. We die. We expand

1727
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:46,420
into great spaciousness. We
incarnate. It gets small. We

1728
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:50,680
keep this up over and over and
over again. The more we do it,

1729
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:55,420
the more over 1000s and 1000s of
years, the more we do it slowly,

1730
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:59,260
we begin to integrate spiritual
dimensions and physical

1731
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:02,520
dimensions. That they're not
really an either or that they

1732
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:07,500
begin to be a both and within
our own lifetime, within our own

1733
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:14,460
body. So I think it's actually
taking up an incarnation at all

1734
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:19,560
has a naturally contractive
effect on consciousness. So I

1735
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:22,340
don't think it's something we're
doing wrong to our children,

1736
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:25,700
though, once you understand that
progression, I think there are

1737
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:28,760
things that we can do that would
help our children adjust to this

1738
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:29,240
world.

1739
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:31,940
Rick Archer: Yeah, that cycle
you just mentioned can be true

1740
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:36,560
of meditation, too. I mean, you
use my teacher used to use the

1741
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,140
example of dying a cloth in
India, where they'd take the

1742
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:41,500
white cloth, dip it in the
colored dye, then bleach it in

1743
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:43,720
the sun, then dip it in the dye,
then bleach it in the sun, go

1744
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:46,240
back and forth and back and
forth until eventually it

1745
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:48,880
becomes color fast, even if you
leave it in the sun. So, you

1746
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,700
know, you dip into Samadhi, and
then you engage in activity, and

1747
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:54,100
you do it again, engage in
activity. Then the nervous

1748
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:59,320
system gets transformed,
thereby, yes, and the Samadhi

1749
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:02,220
becomes stabilized. So you end
up having Nirvikalpa Samadhi all

1750
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:06,060
the time, you know, or whatever
they call the term doesn't have

1751
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,200
to just be with eyes closed.

1752
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:08,580
Unknown: Yeah.

1753
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:11,100
Rick Archer: Okay, one more
question from the audience, and

1754
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:14,100
then I want to get into the
birth of the future human. So

1755
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:18,420
David from Cambridge, England,
asks if Psilocybin, or similar

1756
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:21,620
substances were made widely
available to the public. Do you

1757
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:24,080
think there would be a negative
side effect to consciousness

1758
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:27,500
andor society? Are these
substances restricted, perhaps

1759
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:30,800
due to society not being ready
for them? And I'll add that

1760
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:33,500
Michael Poland wrote an op ed in
the New York Times just the

1761
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:38,780
other day commenting on the
recent permissiveness in

1762
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:42,880
Colorado for the use of
psychedelic mushrooms, and he

1763
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:46,360
cautioned they decriminalized
mushrooms, right? So he

1764
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:49,420
cautioned, you know, take it
easy. You know, we shouldn't go

1765
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:51,760
too fast here, because, you
know, there could be negative

1766
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:52,540
consequences.

1767
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:56,380
Chris Bache: Yeah, we should
have gotten Michael to comment

1768
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:58,120
on that. Since that just came
out today,

1769
01:56:58,119 --> 01:57:00,959
Rick Archer: ran out of time,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1770
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:05,640
Chris Bache: Okay, focus on the
Cambridge question again.

1771
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:10,380
Rick Archer: Oh, just, you know,
is it perhaps prudent that

1772
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:14,520
psychedelics are restricted to
the extent they are, or at least

1773
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:18,120
to some extent? Because, you
know, all hell might break loose

1774
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:21,140
if they just became like the
Libertarians you know, want to

1775
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:23,900
want to legalize all drugs. I
don't know if that would be

1776
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:24,620
advisable.

1777
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:27,440
Chris Bache: One of the points
that Michael makes in his

1778
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,860
article, if I can just invoke
something he said there, which I

1779
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:35,000
completely agree with, is that
when you look at cultures who

1780
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,320
have a long term relationship
with psychoactive substances,

1781
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:44,800
you do not find them being used
recreationally. You find them

1782
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:50,560
being used under very careful
ritual spiritual conditions. You

1783
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:53,920
find them being used in
collective circumstances that

1784
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:57,820
you don't just go trip out by
yourself. We have a great deal

1785
01:57:57,820 --> 01:58:01,320
to learn from cultures who have
a living history with these

1786
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:05,100
substances. Our culture has very
little living history with these

1787
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:08,160
substances except recreational
or in the underground movement.

1788
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:14,460
So we are given our naivete.
Maybe it is good to be cautious

1789
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:18,540
for bringing these into our
culture. But I absolutely agree

1790
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:21,380
with something else Michael
says, is that nobody should be

1791
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:26,120
put in jail for possessing some
psychoactive mushrooms. I mean,

1792
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:31,160
it's just, I don't think they're
they're toxicology they're very

1793
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:34,700
safe, psychologically, extremely
safe. They're not habit forming.

1794
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:37,520
You want to use them carefully.
You want to use them under

1795
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,500
guidance, but, but there's,
they're much less destructive

1796
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:43,960
than cigarettes or alcohol, and
we've learned how to live with

1797
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,820
cigarettes and alcohol. So I
think, I hope that we will

1798
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:53,020
decriminalize. I hope that we,
more importantly, we will learn

1799
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:56,440
how to work respectfully with
these very positive, powerful

1800
01:58:56,440 --> 01:59:00,900
substances. They can be life
transforming, but we have to be

1801
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,760
careful as we approach them.

1802
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:08,220
Rick Archer: Good. So well said,
you have a section in your book

1803
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:11,100
towards the end that's entitled
The birth of the future, human

1804
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:14,460
global awakening and its impact
on society. I just want to read

1805
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:17,100
a couple little bits from it.
You say I believe that the

1806
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:21,440
global systems crisis taking
place in the world outside us is

1807
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:24,020
deeply connected to the
evolutionary metamorphosis

1808
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:28,820
taking place inside us. You say,
humanity is coming into a time

1809
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:31,940
of great awakening, a profound
shift in the fundamental

1810
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:35,660
condition of the human psyche.
But for there to be a great

1811
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:40,040
awakening, there must first take
place a great death. This global

1812
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:43,360
crisis will be so severe that it
will impact not only

1813
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,320
individuals, but the collective
unconsciousness, unconscious of

1814
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:51,460
humanity itself. And I'm just
going to read a little bit more,

1815
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:55,540
because when you had that
session in which you kind of

1816
01:59:55,540 --> 02:00:00,180
cogs that you wrote, or you
wrote recently, it took me. More

1817
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:03,720
than a year to recover from this
session. For months, I walked

1818
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:06,480
around the city where I live,
feeling like someone walking

1819
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:09,660
around Hiroshima a week before
the bomb was dropped, with

1820
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:13,200
unbidden knowledge of what lies
ahead and profound respect for

1821
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:16,080
all the participants. It was
terrible to experience

1822
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:19,140
humanity's Coming Collapse, but
redemptive to experience the

1823
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:22,100
rebirth that followed. Since
that session, I have never

1824
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:25,940
doubted the larger arc of our
evolutionary journey, even as I

1825
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:30,140
mourn its casualties, without a
vision of where nature is taking

1826
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:33,320
us, without understanding the
higher good that our collective

1827
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:36,740
suffering is bringing forward in
history, we might drown in the

1828
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:40,840
sorrow that lies ahead, and we
must not drown. I believe the

1829
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:44,500
form that the future human will
take will be the diamond soul.

1830
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:47,260
So that gives you a springboard.

1831
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:56,380
Chris Bache: Let me just back up
just a second when you work with

1832
02:00:56,380 --> 02:01:00,360
high doses of LSD, when you're
doing it in a totally

1833
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:04,560
internalized, compacted for and
you intensify it with music and

1834
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:09,540
eye shades and all that usual
good stuff. You basically just

1835
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:13,140
explode your consciousness. You
just shatter your consciousness,

1836
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:18,420
and you explode it. And for six
hours or eight hours at a time,

1837
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:21,860
you become a different kind of
being. You become a you're not a

1838
02:01:21,860 --> 02:01:30,320
human being. You open yourself
up into unprecedented intimacy

1839
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:34,280
with the universe, and the
universe is in the role of

1840
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:37,520
teacher and in the role of
instructor. And the universe

1841
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:40,840
decides where you go and what
you learn. It seems to be a

1842
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:44,140
balance between what you're
capable of taking in and what

1843
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:49,600
the universe wants you to take
in. So as as my journey

1844
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:54,280
continued, and I was doing this
systematically over the years,

1845
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:59,680
one of the things that began to
happen about oh, 23 sessions in

1846
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:03,720
started then, is that I began to
have a series of visionary

1847
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:09,720
experiences of where the
universe was taking. The human

1848
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:12,840
race, the human species,
basically about the the

1849
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:17,400
evolutionary dynamics of the
species, once consciousness

1850
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:21,560
became such a powerful factor in
human evolution where we're not

1851
02:02:21,860 --> 02:02:25,700
right now fundamentally changing
our body very fast, but we are

1852
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:29,240
changing consciousness
relatively fast. And so I had

1853
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:33,800
many experiences of the
evolutionary dynamics of where

1854
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:42,100
humanity is and where it's
going, and the vision that came

1855
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:45,820
through over and over again was
that humanity was poised on the

1856
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:49,180
edge of an enormous
breakthrough, just a tremendous

1857
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:52,840
breakthrough that would forever
change the foundation of life on

1858
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:58,360
this planet. And it wasn't
simply a civilizational

1859
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:01,620
breakthrough or an economic
breakthrough or technological

1860
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:04,620
breakthrough, or an industrial
production breakthrough. It was

1861
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:07,500
a breakthrough in the
fundamental platform of

1862
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:13,020
consciousness, the fundamental
baseline of human consciousness,

1863
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:17,700
and that we were that there was
a tremendous pressure building

1864
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:21,900
up, and there was a tremendous
kind of acceleration of our

1865
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:25,160
content. Conscious dynamics. And
there was a tremendous

1866
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:29,900
detoxification taking place in
the reincarnation of generation

1867
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:33,020
after generation. So this was
not simply influencing

1868
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:36,260
individuals, it was influencing
the entire human species. There

1869
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:42,400
was a collective dynamic. So it
basically, it showed me the

1870
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:46,240
vision that we are coming to a
great awakening, just an

1871
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:50,500
exponential increase in our
psychological and psychophysical

1872
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:54,640
capacity. But it didn't give me
any indication of how it was

1873
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:57,700
going to accomplish this. I had
no idea, after years of vision,

1874
02:03:57,700 --> 02:04:02,280
how it was going to accomplish
this. And then in 1995 the

1875
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:06,480
universe took me deep into deep
time. It was a grueling

1876
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:09,780
experience to get there, but
eventually blew me out into a

1877
02:04:09,780 --> 02:04:15,180
radical, expanded time framework
and took me into the heart of

1878
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:20,480
the death and rebirth of
humanity. It the state of

1879
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:24,080
consciousness that I was in when
I went through this process was

1880
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:28,460
not Chris Bache having a
collective experience. I

1881
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:31,640
dissolved completely, and I
experienced this, a coming

1882
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:36,320
crisis. Ask the species
experiences it. It's like being

1883
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:39,080
able to experience a
thunderstorm where you can

1884
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:42,400
experience the storm. It's a
totality, and each individual

1885
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:50,800
drop simultaneously. And what it
showed me was that this

1886
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:54,160
tremendous global systems crisis
that we are entering, which

1887
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:58,780
seems to be driven by an
ecological crisis this world

1888
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:05,340
climate change. Change ego
crisis leading to would lead to

1889
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:11,400
a tremendous global crisis of a
fundamental institutions, major

1890
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:15,720
die off around the planet,
tremendous pain and suffering,

1891
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:22,220
but that this pain was actually
transformative, that this pain

1892
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:26,180
was actually part of a process
of confronting our past and

1893
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:30,500
confronting the legacy of that
past, essentially confronting

1894
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:35,660
karma and going through a death
and rebirth process that would

1895
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:40,220
basically carry us beyond our
standard level of functioning

1896
02:05:40,220 --> 02:05:44,560
before this point in time. So
there was a sense in which in

1897
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:49,120
this event, it's not a single
event, it's a evolutionary

1898
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:51,940
process. I don't know how many
generations it will take. I'm

1899
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:54,640
assuming it would take multiple
generations for this to be

1900
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:58,780
enacted, but that we actually
will be brought to our knees. We

1901
02:05:58,780 --> 02:06:03,900
will lose control. We will
basically suffer terribly. Our

1902
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:07,320
children and grandchildren will
suffer terribly. But that this

1903
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:12,780
suffering was actually labor. It
wasn't simply a destructive

1904
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:16,440
process. It wasn't simply an
extinction process, or it may

1905
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:21,200
feel like that at the time, but
it was a labor process that when

1906
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:26,660
this process reached its
absolute peak, and it looked

1907
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:32,540
like we would all die, the storm
passed, and there were

1908
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:35,900
survivors, and as the survivors
began to pull their life

1909
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:41,500
together, they began to connect
with each other in new and

1910
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:44,620
unprecedented ways. That was a
time of new values, new

1911
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:50,200
insights, new technology, new
social relationships, new a new

1912
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:53,980
internalization of deep
spiritual values, fundamentally,

1913
02:06:54,460 --> 02:07:00,720
a new experience of oneness in
our daily lives, that we really,

1914
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:05,040
truly experience that we are all
one in this process, and we have

1915
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:09,240
deep responsibilities to all
life forms, not only to each

1916
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:12,960
other and human life forms, but
to all life forms on the planet

1917
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:21,200
and elsewhere. Now that's sort
of one kind of that's the part

1918
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:24,560
that you quoted, there's another
part of the sessions which

1919
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:29,360
basically took reincarnation,
which is, I wrote my first book

1920
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:32,720
on reincarnation. I've spent a
lot of time thinking in terms of

1921
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:39,920
reincarnation, but it took me
deep and I began. It took me

1922
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:43,360
into an experience where I began
to integrate all my former

1923
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:46,600
lives. They began to come in to
be very fast and furious, and

1924
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:52,480
they they began to it was like
winding light a kite string made

1925
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:56,440
of light around a school. And
when I had integrated so many

1926
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:59,740
lives, eventually, there was a
fusion of all of their learning

1927
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:03,780
and all of their experience
fused into one, and when there

1928
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:08,760
was a fusion, my consciousness
exploded into a diamond, like a

1929
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:15,120
diamond light consciousness, and
I became an individual, but in

1930
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:19,140
an order of individuality which
I had never experienced before.

1931
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:24,980
It was the sum total of all of
my lives that had cascaded and

1932
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:30,680
lifted me into a state of
consciousness that was more than

1933
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:33,320
just the sum of all their
experiences, there was a

1934
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:38,300
catalyst into a deeper
functioning of conscious

1935
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:41,380
awareness, with respect to
myself, With respect to other

1936
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:44,920
people and with respect to the
universe, that's what I came to

1937
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:48,460
call the birth of the diamond
soul. That when we reincarnate

1938
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:51,940
over and over and over and over
again, we are not simply making

1939
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,360
incremental improvements on our
quality of life, more

1940
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:59,440
compassion, more knowledge, so
on so forth, but in an

1941
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:04,020
evolutionary sense, there comes
a time when, sooner or later,

1942
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:10,200
the soul wakes up inside our
physical incarnation. So all of

1943
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:14,100
our former lives, all of our
learning, all of the experiences

1944
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:19,080
we have, kind of fuse and reach
a crescendo, and we wake up.

1945
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:23,060
It's like the bubble pops and we
wake up and we know we are not

1946
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:27,140
just this body, we know we are
not just this ego. We know we

1947
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:31,100
are not just this incarnation
that we have relationships with

1948
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:34,580
everyone around us that's been
going on for 1000s of years, and

1949
02:09:34,580 --> 02:09:38,480
it opens up new possibilities
for a deeper communion with the

1950
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:44,620
creative intelligence of the
universe itself. I think what my

1951
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:49,720
visionary experience has been is
that this is a transition which

1952
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:54,580
we are making as a species. We
are growing into the birth of

1953
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:59,620
the diamond soul. We are also
obviously going into a cascading

1954
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:03,540
series. Of crises at the global
level. So as we are trying to

1955
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:06,900
become one planet in the
outside, I think there is a

1956
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:11,460
synergistic coupling to the fact
that we are trying to become one

1957
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:15,000
being internally, we are
integrating all of our farmer

1958
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:19,140
lives into our self as we are
trying to transcend the

1959
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:20,960
limitations of our past

1960
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:26,240
engineering and ecological
industrial practices. We're

1961
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:29,780
trying to become one planet,
geophysically, geopolitically,

1962
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:32,000
we're trying to take
responsibility for the healthy

1963
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,320
functioning of a planet, the
same that reinforces and is

1964
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:39,920
fueled by this intra psychic
process where we're trying to

1965
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:43,480
grow up. We're trying to come to
terms with who and what we

1966
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:47,200
actually are. This is what I
call the birth of the future

1967
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:51,400
human I think this crisis that
we are entering and that we that

1968
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:54,700
will dominate the 21st Century
will continue, probably on to

1969
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:58,840
the 22nd this crisis is not
simply an economic crisis. It's

1970
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:02,340
not simply an industrial
production crisis. It's a crisis

1971
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:05,580
of consciousness. It's an
evolutionary crisis, and it's

1972
02:11:05,580 --> 02:11:11,340
giving birth to a future human.
Late in my sessions, at the

1973
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:16,380
very, very end, at one the last
great vision that the universe

1974
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:20,600
gave me in one of my sessions,
it took me deep into deep time.

1975
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:25,040
It took me deep into the future,
and it gave me my last

1976
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:29,420
experience of the future human.
It was as if it took me into the

1977
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:34,760
future and allowed me to try on
for size, the fundamental

1978
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:39,560
blueprint of the human psyche at
that point in the future. This

1979
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:44,680
was the most extraordinary
being, just I can't describe to

1980
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:50,200
you quickly what an extra
ordinary being This being is.

1981
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:55,180
Just picture the highest, finest
qualities we've imagined.

1982
02:11:55,180 --> 02:11:58,780
Picture the highest spiritual
capacities we can imagine, a

1983
02:11:58,780 --> 02:12:02,340
mind completely open to the
universe, a heart completely

1984
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:07,260
open to each other, just
extraordinarily magnificent

1985
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:11,580
being. That's what's at stake
here. That's what we're trying

1986
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:13,740
to become. That's where I think
we're going.

1987
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:19,560
Rick Archer: Beautiful. So
eloquently put, can't really add

1988
02:12:19,620 --> 02:12:23,300
anything to it. And we're almost
out of time. And I'll just say

1989
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:26,060
that if anybody finds what you
just said frightening in terms

1990
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:30,260
of what the world may go through
in transition to this beautiful

1991
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:34,700
future, you know, I mean, there
are people who are sort of

1992
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:37,820
stocking up food and stocking up
guns and doing all kinds of

1993
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:41,560
things, you know, in preparation
for the chaos they feel will be

1994
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:45,280
coming. I'd say that what you
really want to stock up on is

1995
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,280
consciousness. You know,
spiritual evolution, as much of

1996
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:51,700
it as you can get under your
belt, through whatever means

1997
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:55,840
works for you, that will be the
best form of preparation for

1998
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:57,340
whatever life may bring.

1999
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:02,940
Chris Bache: I absolutely agree,
the old, the kind of survivalist

2000
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:07,320
is basically trying to take care
and hold on to ego, but what we

2001
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:11,640
really need is cultivation of
service, transformation,

2002
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:15,660
generosity, compassion. Those
are the qualities that will

2003
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:17,820
carry us into this future.

2004
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:21,200
Rick Archer: Yeah. All right,
well, I've really enjoyed this

2005
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:23,720
conversation. I really enjoyed
reading your book. I want to

2006
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:28,340
close with an endorsement from
our friend Anne barring, who's

2007
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:32,660
been on batgap about your book.
She said, once or twice in a

2008
02:13:32,660 --> 02:13:35,600
century, a book appears that has
the explosive force of a

2009
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:39,020
supernova breaking through the
limitations of religion, science

2010
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:42,820
and culture. LSD, in the mind of
the universe, is such a book, a

2011
02:13:42,820 --> 02:13:45,820
gripping account of an utterly
unique and extraordinary hero's

2012
02:13:45,820 --> 02:13:49,120
journey that opens our minds and
hearts to a new vision of our

2013
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:52,060
universe and ourselves as
inseparable from the ineffable

2014
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:55,780
being we have called God. All
beliefs fade before the

2015
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:59,080
incandescent revelations
contained in this book a deeply

2016
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:02,700
moving template of our
evolutionary journey, I think,

2017
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:06,660
beautifully written, and it was
a marvelous book. So the book,

2018
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:09,360
as you said, won't be out until
when November, or something like

2019
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:13,800
Chris Bache: that, November 26
Amazon has it on pre order, but

2020
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:15,300
it'll be out then, yeah,

2021
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:18,360
Rick Archer: and I have a link
for it prepared so people can

2022
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:23,300
order it now and it'll come for
in time for Christmas, there you

2023
02:14:23,300 --> 02:14:25,520
go. Yeah. So I did

2024
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:28,520
Chris Bache: this work for 20
years, and then I waited to

2025
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:32,780
publish this book for another 20
years. It took a long time to

2026
02:14:32,780 --> 02:14:36,560
digest everything that happened
in those first 20 years before I

2027
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:40,840
was really ready to share them
with with other people.

2028
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:46,180
Rick Archer: Yeah, and it's been
a great conversation there. Yes,

2029
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:49,660
conversations like this could go
on for many more hours, but

2030
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:53,560
interviews are meant to be a
sort of a sampling. So this is

2031
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:55,900
Chris Bache: a sampling
wonderful Rick, and the work

2032
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:59,620
you're doing here, the number of
minds that you're opening, the

2033
02:14:59,620 --> 02:15:02,220
number. Number of conversations
you're having, bringing people

2034
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:05,820
together talk about a catalyst
for positive change in our

2035
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:07,440
future. Way to go, Really,

2036
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:09,600
Rick Archer: thank you very
much. Really, hope to meet you

2037
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:10,560
in person one of these

2038
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:13,380
Chris Bache: days. Yes, let's do
that. Yeah,

2039
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:16,380
Rick Archer: okay, so let me
just close by thanking those

2040
02:15:16,380 --> 02:15:19,920
who've been listening or
watching. I encourage you to go

2041
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:23,360

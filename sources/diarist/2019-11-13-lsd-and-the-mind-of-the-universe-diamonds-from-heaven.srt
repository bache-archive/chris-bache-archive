17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,540
Up until the 1700s humans
believed that the edge of our

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,520
universe ended at the planet
Saturn, the last visible planet

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,420
that we can see with the unaided
eye. With the invention of the

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,900
telescope, we turned it to the
heavens, and to our great

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,640
surprise, we discovered the
planet Uranus, twice as far out

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,520
as the planet Saturn. Our
universe doubled in size. Then

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,420
in the 1800s with the discovery
of Neptune, our universe once

24
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,660
again doubled in size. Then in
1931 with the discovery of Pluto

25
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,940
our universe then again doubled
in size, and now less than 400

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,520
years later, from the discovery
of Uranus, we have the Deep

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,760
Space Hubble Telescope, which
shows us that there are

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,340
trillions upon trillions of
galaxies in our universe. For

29
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,900
me, this is analogous to the
work that Chris has done in his

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,500
deep exploration of
consciousness, radically

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,780
breaking open and through our
cosmology and our philosophy and

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,000
our metaphysics, through the 73
high dose LSD sessions that he

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,140
did over 20 years and began to
share with us in his work, dark

34
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,820
night, early dawn, Steps to a
deep ecology of mind now with

35
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,000
LSD And the mind of the
universe, Chris takes us further

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,020
into diamond Luminosity and
brings back the diamonds from

37
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,920
heaven that he so graciously
shares with all of us here

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,200
today. There couldn't be a more
important time for Chris to

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,620
share his work with all of us,
both in the greater

40
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,840
understanding and acceptance of
psychedelics today, but also

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,280
because of the psycho spiritual
death and rebirth that our

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,180
collective human species seems
to be going through right now.

43
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,640
So please help me give a very
warm and loving Welcome to our

44
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,300
beloved friend, Chris Bache, and
when Chris is done speaking, you

45
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,660
each have an opportunity to ask
your questions, so please have

46
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,600
those ready, as that is our
favorite and most special part

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,900
of these live streams. Thank you
so much for being with us here

48
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,380
today.

49
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,780
Chris Bache: Hi everyone. Thank
you Jessica and Travis. Thank

50
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,840
you for this opportunity to
share my work with the

51
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,280
participants in trust.
Psyche.com. Is truly an honor to

52
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,680
do. So it's also an overwhelming
task, because this book covers

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,400
so many dimensions of
consciousness. It covers so many

54
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,560
years of work, and when I talk
about it, I have a tendency to

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,520
get absorbed naturally into the
experiences I'm describing, and

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,300
that makes compressing 20 years
of work and 20 years of thinking

57
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,440
and writing into a very short
presentation really challenging.

58
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,900
So to me, a talk is the most
effective way to get to question

59
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,120
and answers. So I'll try to keep
this contained and as brief as I

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,580
can, and then save a good half
hour at the end for Q and A, and

61
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,400
we'll see where that goes, maybe
even more than a half an hour.

62
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,780
So I'm going to start with,
well, a little bit of

63
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,680
background. First of all, those
of you who know me, someone who

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,760
don't know me, I'm the last
person you would expect to have

65
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,540
written a book on psychedelics.
I was raised in the Deep South,

66
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,680
in Mississippi. I was raised in
a middle class Catholic

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,160
background. I wanted to be a
seminar priest early in my life.

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,700
Was in the seminary for three
years in high school, I studied

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,900
theology at Notre Dame, New
Testament. Criticism at

70
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,380
Cambridge, and then philosophy
of religion at Brown. By the

71
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,920
time I had finished graduate
school, I was an atheistically

72
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,420
inclined agnostic, and the 60s
had completely passed me by. I

73
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,000
was not psychedelic involved in
in my college or graduate school

74
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,000
at all, so I was naive,
psychedelically, and I was

75
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,080
atheistically inclined,
agnostic, philosophically. And

76
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,360
then came LSD. Shortly after
beginning my career, I met the

77
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,240
work of Stan Grof, and that set
my life on the course that I'm

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,740
still harvesting today. So
first, let me start a PowerPoint

79
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,440
that I'll be using, and then I'm
going to keep this on only for

80
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,340
about 10 minutes, and then I'll
shift in and out of it again.

81
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,520
Later, let me see if I can get
this started here. This is what

82
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,740
the book will look like, and
I'll tell you a secret about

83
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,660
this book. This is the
publisher's title, LSD in the

84
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,320
mind of the universe. My title
is diamonds from heaven, because

85
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,480
diamonds from Heaven is a story
of a journey. But they wanted a

86
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,540
more marketable title, and
that's LSD in the mind of the

87
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,500
universe. The beginning of this
book goes back 40 years, over 40

88
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,840
years, when I had begun graduate
school in 78 right then I met

89
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,440
the work of Stanislav Grof, his
book realms of the human

90
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,820
unconscious, turned my life
around, followed quickly by LSD

91
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,660
psychotherapy, he gave me the
method and the confidence to

92
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,500
pursue the method of exploring
my consciousness, and through

93
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,000
that exploration to come to know
the deep psyche, the deep

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,500
universe better. I want to
emphasize that I did this work

95
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,860
as a philosopher. I was not a
therapist. I was not primarily

96
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,880
seeking healing, though healing
did come, but I was seeking to

97
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,360
understand our universe as
deeply as I could by exploring

98
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,180
my consciousness as deeply as I
could so a few observations on

99
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,060
method, and then we'll kind of
go right into the content

100
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,600
everyone is aware I think of the
distinction between low dose

101
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,800
psychely therapy, that Stan
develops, and high dose

102
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,200
psychedelic therapy. Low dose
psychedelic therapy peels the

103
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,400
mind gradually, layer by layer
in very intense therapeutic

104
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,840
encounters. Psychedelic therapy
is a very different protocol.

105
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,900
It's a protocol trying to
trigger, in the early days,

106
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,320
we're trying to trigger a
Near-Death Experience for people

107
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,380
who had terminal cancer, they
weren't trying to heal them, but

108
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,480
to trigger an encounter with the
universe that would open them to

109
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,560
the world that they were about
to enter. When I began my own

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,040
work, I chose to work with high
doses of LSD, primarily because

111
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,240
it was simply difficult to get
time to arrange a day of inner

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,900
journey with a dual career
marriage, and I wanted to make

113
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,300
the most out of every day that I
could put into this. I thought

114
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,020
of myself as basically doing an
extended regimen of psychedelic

115
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,920
therapy, doing just psychedelic
therapy, but for a longer period

116
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,760
of time. Originally, psychedelic
therapy was limited to a maximum

117
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,720
of three sessions. And I
thought, well, if you could do

118
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,260
three sessions with this work
safely, you could do it more

119
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,700
sessions and do it safely. When
I got to the end of this

120
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,580
journey, and was looking back
over its length, I began to

121
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,080
appreciate that what happened in
my work was different than what

122
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,120
I saw being recorded reported in
psychedelic therapy, so

123
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,200
different that I thought it
needed a new kind of language to

124
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,940
describe it. So I've chosen the
term psychedelic exploration.

125
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,980
Psychedelic exploration is the
method of psychedelic therapy,

126
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,440
isolation, earphones, head
headphones, music, total

127
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,300
protection with a sitter. The
difference is the number of

128
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,120
sessions involved. In my case,
73 high dose sessions between

129
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:17,880
1979 and 1999 I worked for four
years. I stopped for six years

130
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,740
for reasons that I described in
the book, and then I resumed for

131
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,360
a very intense 10 year process.
I did this work between when I

132
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,640
was 30 and 50 years old. I'm now
70 years old, so I've taken a

133
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,960
long time to present this work
completely candidly to the

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,620
world, partly for legal reasons
and partly because it simply

135
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,600
takes a long time. It took me a
long time to map and understand

136
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,480
all the dynamics of the sessions
that unfolded during these

137
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,080
years.

138
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,320
I want to say at the outset that
this is not a methodology that I

139
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,900
would recommend today if I were
doing it over. Again, I would be

140
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,400
gentler on myself. I would take
a slower process of engaging the

141
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,780
great expanse of the mind of the
universe. I would balance high

142
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,500
dose work with low dose
sessions. I would also balance

143
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,400
working with LSD, with working
with Psilocybin and Ayahuasca,

144
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,040
more body grounded psychedelics
for a variety of reasons, all of

145
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,520
which I discuss in the book.
Don't have time to go into here.

146
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,960
I tried to do this work as
systematically and rigorously as

147
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,940
I can. Working as a philosopher,
I made it of high priority to

148
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,900
make a complete and
phenomenologically accurate

149
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,600
record of my sessions within 24
hours, and then studied the

150
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,500
sessions and the dynamics arcing
across sessions and comparing my

151
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,340
experiences to those who were
that had been had by other

152
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,860
psychedelic journeyers. This is
a snapshot of my journal, about

153
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,240
400 pages my psychedelic notes
that for me, are my personal

154
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,660
Bible. They are the record of my
deepest experiences of the

155
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,800
universe, and therefore, in my
life, they come before all other

156
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,340
discursive thinking and analytic
analysis. Kept detailed records

157
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,580
of my sessions all the way
through I looked at and studied

158
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,980
the astrological transits of my
sessions, trying I was aware of

159
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,000
Rick and Stan's thinking about
the relationship between the

160
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
outer transits, the outer
planets, and the global

161
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,820
transits, and how they affect
one's work in deep, Non-ordinary

162
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,960
states. So I wanted to study
this hypothesis myself, and look

163
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,400
at how my sessions projected
against the rhythms of the solar

164
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,460
system during the years I was
doing this work. I want to

165
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,540
emphasize that the story I'm
telling in LSD, in the mind of

166
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,820
the universe is not primarily a
personal story. I mean, it is a

167
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,480
personal story at one level, but
in another sense, it's not

168
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,100
primarily a personal story. This
series of curves represents a

169
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,860
series of LSD sessions, and I
found that after the first 15

170
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,520
sessions or so, when I was
working insights and help in my

171
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,120
personal life tended to come at
the beginning and end of my

172
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,120
sessions, as I was leaving and
returning to time, space,

173
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,620
reality that's reflected in
these small circles when the

174
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,180
session was in its peak hours,
represented by the large circles

175
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,840
I was usually operating beyond
PERS my personal reality beyond

176
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,120
Crispus reality, not entirely,
but largely. And so the story

177
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,900
I'm telling in LSD in the mind
of the universe, is the story of

178
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,540
what unfolded in those large
circles at the peak hours of my

179
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,460
psychedelic sessions. This is
primarily a cosmological

180
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,360
narrative. It's not primarily a
therapeutic narrative. The

181
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,140
details, the personal details,
are important in a therapeutic

182
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:17,160
narrative, not so much in a
cosmological narrative. I found

183
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,600
when I did this work that what
unfolded in my work was a

184
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,060
series, a multiple series of
experiences of death and rebirth

185
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,660
that eventually kind of
concretized into this picture.

186
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,980
The drop below the line. That
line is, kind of represents the

187
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,260
border of time space. The drop
below the line is egoic reality,

188
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,620
our individual space, time
consciousness, and the first

189
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,980
death and rebirth, which is the
one most frequently talked about

190
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,300
in the literature, is ego death,
which takes place in that first

191
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,360
level when we make the
transition from ordinary

192
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,260
consciousness into early
Transpersonal consciousness. But

193
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,860
if you continue to work and
press the limits of your

194
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,580
experience, I found that there
are other deaths which take

195
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,960
place at other levels of
consciousness. Now I follow Stan

196
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,940
Grof in using the vocabulary of
psychic, subtle and causal

197
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,180
reality to describe some of
these deeper levels of

198
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,460
consciousness. I don't have a
vested interest in how many

199
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,600
levels of reality there might
be, or how many times a circle

200
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,660
of death and rebirth may turn.
What's important is the

201
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,160
principle that if s1 pushes
deeper and deeper and deeper, if

202
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,280
you do this work systematically,
there are a series of deaths and

203
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,960
rebirths that open in the
process. As I have looked back

204
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,660
and mapped them, these circles
oversimplify, of course. These

205
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,500
are a number of sessions, and
what is shown here is the sort

206
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,540
of circles within circles, the
deaths within deaths, the. Mark

207
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,860
a deepening of progressive
deepening into causal level

208
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:13,860
reality. So yeah, circles within
circles. When I looked over the

209
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,180
entirety of all of my
psychedelic work, I identified

210
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,000
five fundamental Death-Rebirth
processes, or levels of

211
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,120
consciousness where death and
rebirth were operating. These

212
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,160
are the five levels. First, the
death of self, by which I mean

213
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:37,100
the death of our time space,
identity as our individual,

214
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,920
identity as our sense of who and
what we are moving into

215
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,880
collective mind. There are three
chapters in the book dealing

216
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,780
with the dynamics of collective
mind, the ocean of suffering

217
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:56,020
deep time, then archetypal mind.
Experiences at the high

218
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,960
archetypal level, experience at
the lower archetypal level,

219
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,320
followed by immersion in causal
oneness. Oneness services, of

220
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,020
course, much earlier in the
sequence. But there is something

221
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:16,680
quite distinctive about causal
level oneness and finally, the

222
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,240
diamond Luminosity work after
everything that had taken place

223
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,840
before emerging into the diamond
light that Buddhism calls

224
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,740
Dharmakaya. I call the diamond
Luminosity. So let me before

225
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,820
turning off the PowerPoint, let
me simply take you through a

226
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:44,080
list of the chapters of LSD in
the mind of the universe, there

227
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,280
is a methodology chapter chapter
one, but then in terms of the

228
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,660
content of the experiences,
crossing the boundary of birth

229
00:16:52,660 --> 00:17:00,300
and Death, the ocean of
suffering, deep time in the

230
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:09,240
soul, initiation into the
universe, the greater real of

231
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:17,340
archetypal reality, a
benediction of blessings, the

232
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:26,120
birth of the future human
diamond, Luminosity and final

233
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,520
vision. And then there is the
last chapter coming off the

234
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,320
mountain. It took me actually a
year just to write that last

235
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,100
chapter. That is a chapter in
which I reflect on what has been

236
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,380
happening in my life in the 20
years after I stopped my

237
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,700
psychedelic work, what I'll do
is go through each of these

238
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,720
chapters and simply mention a
few points on each of the

239
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,800
chapters. Work through the list
as quickly as I can, and then

240
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,980
we'll open it up for questions
and answers. Let me keep track

241
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,380
of my time. Okay, first crossing
the boundary of life and death

242
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,320
is the one that's easiest,
because it's most familiar. It's

243
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,060
so thoroughly described in Stan
Grof literature. When I entered

244
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,660
this domain, which took about
two and a half years to navigate

245
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,480
and 10 sessions, my work began
saturated. Became saturated with

246
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,160
confrontations with death, fetal
sensations, all sorts of severe

247
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,140
perinatal seizures, a purging of
the body, eventually culminating

248
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,720
in ego death. My ego death
basically involved a complete

249
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,760
reversal of everything that I
knew myself to be at the time. I

250
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,040
was an academic, a white male
academic, a philosopher,

251
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,580
passionately concerned with the
meaning of life. I became the

252
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,420
complete opposite of that. I
became women, women of color,

253
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,320
women who were not interested in
philosophical reflection at all.

254
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,060
I became it was a frightening
experience, a terrifying

255
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,860
experience, but when I let go,
when I let go and allowed myself

256
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,760
to become all these women who
were so different from me, I

257
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,360
entered the world of women and
was given the experience of

258
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,600
hundreds and hundreds of women
under the arm of the Great

259
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,700
Mother, it was a truly life
changing experience for me, and

260
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,940
I wish every man could have that
experience. When I went into,

261
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,200
when I went through that death
and rebirth process and went

262
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,520
into continue to work, I entered
into a

263
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,680
domain of suffering and pain and
agony, collective pain and

264
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,460
suffering that was so severe I
came to call it the ocean of

265
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,600
suffering. So let me back up
just for a second, working at

266
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,440
these levels as I did it, every
session basically had two

267
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,900
phases, a first phase, which was
a purification phase. Phase, and

268
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,500
the second phase, which was the
ecstatic phase, the purification

269
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,800
phase, would be some type of
very profound, cathartic

270
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,320
purification engagement. And if
that was allowed to continue to

271
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,100
its culmination, there was some
type of crescendo, a

272
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,960
breakthrough, and then the
recession pivoted to an ecstatic

273
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,060
portion for the remainder of the
session, when I'm describing the

274
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,600
ocean of suffering, I'm
describing the purification

275
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,980
phase of the next two years of
work, tremendous suffering. At

276
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,060
first, I thought this was a
deepening of ego death. I

277
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,140
thought somehow that pieces of
my ego were still in play, and

278
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,680
that this collective suffering
represented a deepening of ego

279
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,400
death. But eventually this
continued for so long and it was

280
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,240
so severe that I came to a
different conclusion. The

281
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,440
conclusion I came to is that
somewhere along the line,

282
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,080
something had happened in my
sessions, that these ordeals

283
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,940
were not really aimed at my
personal transformation at all,

284
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,720
that somewhere along the line,
the focus of my work, at this

285
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,220
point, became actually the
purification and healing of some

286
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,560
aspect of the collective psyche,
some aspect of the collective

287
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,900
unconscious, that somehow I was
tapping into pain and suffering

288
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,440
which was lodged in the
collective psyche, and by

289
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,480
engaging this pain and suffering
consciously, it was in some way

290
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,800
being lifted out of the
collective psyche and Therefore

291
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,480
lightening the kind of karmic
burden that our species was

292
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:50,860
holding. Well, I wrote dark,
night, early dawn, primarily to

293
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:56,140
understand this whole dynamic,
primarily to understand how my

294
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,920
sessions, how death could become
as large as it became in my

295
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,360
sessions, and by integrating
Rupert Sheldrake concept of

296
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,740
Morphic fields into Stan Grof
paradigm, the way open to

297
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,100
viewing these experiences as
part of a larger

298
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:18,060
transformational practice aimed
at the collective psyche in the

299
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,780
ecstatic portion of these next
these two years of sessions in

300
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:29,300
the ecstatic portion, I entered
into what I call deep time in

301
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,340
the soul I and I began to have
experiences of my life as a

302
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,060
completed whole, from start to
finish, with all the time

303
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,020
moments of my life, with all the
themes and all the people and

304
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,460
circumstances of my life
simultaneously present and I was

305
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,720
basically taken into this
territory consistently for one

306
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,260
year, over and over again, seven
sessions, went deeper and

307
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,420
deeper, and was basically given
a profound crash course in Chris

308
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,820
Bache his life, what It was
about who the people were that I

309
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:09,600
was involved in my life was
taken into a kind of a spiritual

310
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,960
distillation of what my life was
about and what it was going to

311
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,300
be about when I first entered
this reality and came out of it

312
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,740
after the Session, it had been
the most powerful and

313
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,280
transformative experience of my
life, and yet I couldn't

314
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,960
remember it. After the session
was over, I could not hold on to

315
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,440
transtemporal experiences of
this magnitude, because there

316
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,980
simply was no reference point in
my ordinary consciousness to

317
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,980
anchor them. But when I went
back again and again and again,

318
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,340
I found that I was able to hold
on to these experiences more

319
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,700
effectively. I was able to
remember them. I was able to

320
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,640
bring more and more of them
back. And this is an important

321
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,600
point. If you want to enter into
these states and cultivate

322
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,380
systematic recall of the
experiences in these states, you

323
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,060
have to really work with a lot
of discipline. You have to

324
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,200
engage them very
conscientiously, record them

325
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,800
conscientiously. And if you hold
this position well, you

326
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,180
literally learn how to become,
how to be, stay conscious in

327
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,540
states of consciousness that
previously you were not able to

328
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,580
hold conscious awareness in. And
this pattern repeated every time

329
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,760
I would break through to a new
level, there was always a period

330
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,080
of disorientation, a period of
loss of memory. But then when I

331
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,100
would keep going back over and
over and over again to that new

332
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,560
level, my cognition improved, my
perception improved, my ability

333
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:48,100
to understand and record all the
experiences improved. Now the

334
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,900
ocean of suffering. Work, I
said, lasted two years and 14

335
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,520
sessions, but this was actually
divided into one year of work

336
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,420
and then I took my six year
break. Then I started my

337
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,760
psychedelic work again. When I
started after my six year break,

338
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,920
the ocean of suffering began
exactly where it had been in the

339
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,160
first year of work. So six years
later, completely different

340
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,860
circumstances in my life,
completely different

341
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,340
expectations and different
astrological conditions.

342
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,180
Nevertheless, my sessions began
exactly where they had stopped,

343
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,980
which is an indication of the
the intentionality of the

344
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,380
intelligence that's guiding our
work. When I started this after

345
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,920
the break, the ecstatic portion
of the sessions began at a

346
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,540
completely different place. The
ecstatic portion of the sessions

347
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:48,040
began in what I came to call
initiation into the universe. I

348
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,820
was taken systematically by some
intelligence that never adopted

349
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,660
any form, but I always felt an
intelligence that seemed to be

350
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,500
intent on teaching me how the
universe functions, how it

351
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:07,920
operates. I was given a crash
course in cosmology, 101 in this

352
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,960
material, the initiation of the
universe. I should mention. I

353
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,440
give names to my sessions. I
give every session a name. The

354
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,680
name reflects the pith content
of the session, and I break the

355
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,960
session down in bullet points
the names of the sessions that I

356
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,740
gave this chapter on initiation
of the universe. These are the

357
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:33,980
sessions that are discussed in
that chapter. You and I creating

358
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,360
was really a crash course in
cosmology. The cosmic tour was

359
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,220
an extraordinary tour of the
universe. Then there was a

360
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,520
training session that I called
the Council of Elders, a session

361
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,060
which was training me on how to
maintain coherent consciousness

362
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,800
as these deeper levels of
awareness were opening. Dying

363
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,100
into oneness was an
extraordinary immersion into

364
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:04,320
oneness. The master plan was the
beginning of a series of visions

365
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,440
that I'm going to come back to
later. It was a series of

366
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,020
initiations into what appeared
to be the plan that the creative

367
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,280
intelligence had for the
evolution of the human species

368
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,200
at this point in its history. I
know it sounds monstrously

369
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,040
arrogant to talk like that, but
this is simply what happened in

370
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,580
the sessions and then healing
the collective wound. Healing

371
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,820
the collective wound was the
ocean of suffering, came into a

372
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:38,540
culmination. It came into an
extraordinary hard to describe.

373
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,160
I lay it out of the book as best
as I can, hard to describe the

374
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,440
magnitudes of suffering that one
can enter into in this work, and

375
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,420
when that work came to its
crescendo, I was spun from there

376
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,220
into archetype of reality, and
the ocean of suffering never

377
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,020
returned in future sessions.
There was a lot of work. There

378
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,100
was suffering, but it was never
this collective suffering that

379
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,400
seemed to reflect the history of
the human species.

380
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,160
After the initiation of the
universe, I entered archetypal

381
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,260
reality. This lasted about one
and a half years and 11

382
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,600
sessions. When I entered
archetypal reality, I entered a

383
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,220
reality that immediately was
recognized as more real than

384
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,780
physical reality. Every time I
entered this level of work, I

385
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:37,640
had the sensation that I was
entering a reality that was more

386
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,120
real, more existentially real
than time and space. In fact, it

387
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,380
became very disorienting to
realize how diluted and watered

388
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:52,600
down reality is inside time and
space. Reality. When I entered

389
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,240
this work, my human identity
began to fall away from me. I

390
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,360
found that we have a sense of
being human that is deeper than

391
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,160
our sense of being any
individual human, an ego death

392
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,780
is a death of our individual
experience of being human, but

393
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,400
entering archetypal reality
required that I somehow let go

394
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,280
of human experience at a deeper
level, and eventually, I could

395
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,240
no longer fit myself back into
any cognitive frame of reference

396
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,040
related to Homo sapiens. I
entered a level of consciousness

397
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,540
that I experienced as being
above and beyond human

398
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,920
consciousness, and there I was
systematically worked with and

399
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,800
given lessons on how reality
operated. There these

400
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,340
experiences kind of broke down
at two different levels, at the

401
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,660
high platonic level, at the high
subtle level, I encountered

402
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,540
beings that were completely
beyond my ability to

403
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:01,300
conceptualize and understand my
mind image them. Like galaxies.

404
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,980
They were just vast beings that
were the creators of time and

405
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,240
space. They were the creators of
life on this planet. They were

406
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,980
the guardians of existence. They
were the massive constitutional

407
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,660
forces that actually create
everything that we know as time

408
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:25,280
and space in this magnificent
universe at a lower archetypal

409
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,000
level, at more of a Jungian
level, I was taken and given

410
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,320
many experiences of the
collective consciousness, our

411
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,920
collective psyche, our
collective unconscious, and even

412
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,340
kind of a collective body that
all of our bodies are cells in I

413
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,300
was given many experiences on
how the collective psyche works,

414
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,200
on how reality functions at this
level. These all took place

415
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,320
primarily at subtle level
reality. So I was given

416
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,640
exercises in the nuts and bolts
of how reality works, how our

417
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,220
individual minds ourselves
within a larger mind, and even

418
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,300
how our individual bodies are
cells within some kind of

419
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,580
fundamental core archetype of
the human body, and that when we

420
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,140
engage and heal diseases in our
individual body, we

421
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,020
simultaneously are impacting the
health of the human family's

422
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:30,920
larger body. The list of the
sessions that I address in this

423
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,580
chapter,

424
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,040
the 28th session was an
extraordinarily positive

425
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,680
session, ecstatic session in
which I broke through and

426
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,820
touched causal level reality for
the first time, an extremely

427
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:57,520
clear, lucid, hard to describe,
state of hyper clarity. And then

428
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,220
I was quite surprised to go
through three sessions of just

429
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:09,360
gut wrenching cleansing, just an
ordeal of physical psychological

430
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,500
cleansing that had absolutely no
cognitive content associated

431
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,120
with it at all. It's just a just
a gut wrenching cleansing. In

432
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,980
time, to make a very long story
short, I began to realize that

433
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,760
what there is a cycle that I
came to call the cycle of

434
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,000
purification. Cycle of
purification is that every step

435
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:36,200
into a deeper level of
consciousness is a step into a

436
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,100
higher level of energy. So that
when we, when I first broke into

437
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,360
causal level reality in the 28th
session, I touched a reality

438
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,320
that was so pure that it
triggered a purification process

439
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,760
in my being that lasted three
sessions, extending over six

440
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,900
months. And I found that this
pattern repeated itself over and

441
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,480
over again as I continued to go
deeper every time I broke into a

442
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,260
new level of conscious and had
that ecstatic experience of

443
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,180
waking up in a deeper level of
reality, the following sessions

444
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,460
were very, very difficult, very
much involved in cleansing,

445
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,500
carrying out the garbage, so
much so that I began to dread

446
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,460
the sessions that immediately
followed the major breakthrough

447
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,480
sessions. I should mention here
that one of the things that

448
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,880
opened up at this level is I
began to experience

449
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,060
reincarnation as a collective
phenomenon previously. And those

450
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,500
of you who know my book on
reincarnation life cycles. Now

451
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,140
that the story of the soul of
the story I'm telling of

452
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,340
reincarnation, there is a story
of our individual evolution,

453
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,900
directing our individual
evolution over many lifetimes,

454
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,320
reflecting our individual
choices and our individual

455
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,360
learning. But now I began to
have experiences of the entire

456
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,640
planet entering into a
reincarnation process. And I

457
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,740
experienced millions of people
over time, century after

458
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:15,240
century, millions of people
incarnating in a way that was

459
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,860
integrated, that was not
uniform, but that was integrated

460
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,600
so that all of our individual
karma, our individual soul

461
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,680
aspirations, our individual
challenges, were all part of the

462
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,460
collective karma, collective
challenges and our collective

463
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,140
development as a species. It was
magnificently beautiful to

464
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,800
witness this interplay between
individual and collective

465
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,780
reincarnation again, all of
these taking place at the subtle

466
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,740
level of reality when one is
gaging the deeper architecture

467
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:59,020
of the universe. After spending
about 11 months exploring

468
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,860
archetypal reality. Reality. And
at going through this 11

469
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,820
sessions, going through this
very quickly, I entered what I

470
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:12,060
came to call the benediction of
blessings. It was a period of

471
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,940
extraordinary blessings, just
given one massive blessing after

472
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,700
another. These are the names of
the four sessions that I address

473
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:29,420
in this chapter, the forest was
an experience of Shunyata,

474
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,220
emptiness of self, no self in
me, no self anywhere around me,

475
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,960
an experience of radical and
profound transparency, the birth

476
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,380
of the diamond soul. I'll
mention in a second, singing the

477
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,180
universe away was an experience
of primal void, an experience

478
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,420
that culminated in the
experience of Satchitananda

479
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:57,640
consciousness, being and bliss,
eventually moving into a

480
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,640
complete void, the fertile void
that subsumes and is the origin

481
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,260
out of which the physical
universe emerged. Jesus blood

482
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,860
was an experience of
extraordinary, cosmic love, love

483
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:16,800
like I've never known it before,
just super saturated soul,

484
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,360
saturated, engaging of love, the
birth of diamond soul. I want to

485
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:29,900
mention because it'll come up
later in the work. In that

486
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,600
experience, in the birth of the
diamond soul session, which was

487
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:39,260
really a deeply moving, long
lasting session for me, I began

488
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,420
to experience all of my former
lives coming into me very fast,

489
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:48,400
very quickly, 11 years before, I
had experienced my entire life

490
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,620
from beginning to end. Now, I
began to experience all my lives

491
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,120
coming in, and it was like we
were wrapping kite string around

492
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,500
a spool. And at some point this
spool ignited. It was as if we

493
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,120
hit critical mass and all of
these lives fused into a

494
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,280
singularity. And when they fuse,
an extraordinary light broke out

495
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,000
of my chest. It was my first
contact with what I later call

496
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,760
diamond light. And I think what
I was being given in this

497
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,700
session was an experience of how
reincarnation works and where

498
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,360
reincarnation is taking
humanity. This process of

499
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,840
accumulating more and more
experience more and more lives,

500
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,180
is not simply improving us and
making us better beings, one

501
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,600
life at a time, adding a little
bit here, a little bit there.

502
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,200
But eventually we're collecting
experience. And I think

503
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,180
eventually, in the entire human
saga, all of us are coming into

504
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,500
a stage where eventually all of
our knowledge, all of our

505
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,180
experience, everything we've
ever done, everyone we've ever

506
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,900
known through these lives, there
is a fusion of that knowledge,

507
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:09,120
and when that knowledge fuses,
we are catapulted into a higher

508
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,440
operational status, a different
relationship to the universe, a

509
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,220
greater transparency to the
universe, and also a different

510
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,480
relationship with everyone
around us, because we have been

511
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,600
connected to each other for so
many lifetimes. We have been

512
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,380
fathers, mothers, enemies,
friends, partners in so many

513
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,880
lifetimes, when we become whole
within ourselves, it opens up a

514
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,900
depth of compassion to all
beings we experience around us,

515
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,340
and not just human beings, all
beings on our planet.

516
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:40,999
Jessica DiRuzza: You

517
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,120
Unknown: after

518
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,640
Chris Bache: the benediction of
blessings, where the work went

519
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,660
next was into the diamond
Luminosity work. I was

520
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,440
completely existentially
satisfied after the the

521
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:03,480
benediction of blessings work, I
had given something that I had

522
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,480
been asked to give in the ocean
of suffering, and I had been

523
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,100
repaid and given more in return
that I could possibly have

524
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,180
imagined. But then we went into
the diamond Luminosity work. But

525
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,480
before I begin to tell you about
that, I want to back step a

526
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,040
little bit and talk about the
birth of the future human

527
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,880
because it's been a reoccurring
theme in my session, starting

528
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,840
all the way back the 22nd
session, all the way through to

529
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,680
the end of the sessions, a
reoccurring theme is what is

530
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,280
happening to the human race.
Where are we in our evolutionary

531
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,300
journey? Now I tell this story
in the book, I brought together

532
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:51,280
in one place all of the session
material related to the birth of

533
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,960
the future human in this one
chapter. So in the starting with

534
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,740
experiences that first appeared
in chapter six, the initiation

535
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,840
and. Universe running all the
way through, I gathered them all

536
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,840
together and collected them into
two segments. First is a segment

537
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,840
that I call the visions of
awakening, which are visions

538
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,680
that I had been given in
different piecemeal fashion

539
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:24,200
about where we are and where we
are going. I break this down

540
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,720
into six visions. These are the
six themes of our awakening.

541
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,080
What was most striking to me
about this was first, how

542
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,560
dramatic this process was and
how the experience was that we

543
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,000
were poised to move into an
evolutionary to make an

544
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,560
evolutionary jump that would
completely propel us into a

545
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,940
higher order of functioning, not
only as individuals, but as a

546
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,440
species. We are poised on the
edge of a profound, great

547
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,140
awakening, but in all of these
visions, and I'm going so fast,

548
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,840
I hate to go so fast through
them, but in all of these

549
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,040
visions, I and which kept
pointing to an awakening taking

550
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,840
place on the planet of the human
species, of the entire species,

551
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,080
the consciousness of our
universe was actually Trying to

552
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,440
awaken the entire human species.
I was not shown how this was

553
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,860
going to take place. I was not
shown how this was even

554
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,480
possible. And then, about a year
and a half after the last of the

555
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,800
visions of awakening, I was
given a session right in the

556
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,860
middle of the diamond Luminosity
work. I had entered the diamond

557
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:45,340
Luminosity in sessions 45 and 50
I would enter it again later in

558
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:53,080
sessions 60 and 66 right in the
middle, I was taken into the

559
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,220
deep time of our species. I was
given an experience of tape

560
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,380
being taken right into the
center of the Great Awakening

561
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,060
that we are coming into. And
there I experience this

562
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,800
transformation, not as an
individual human being. My

563
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,120
boundaries had been blown open
so many times in the years

564
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:20,400
preceding that I experienced the
Great Awakening as our species.

565
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,380
I was taken inside the
collective psyche and was given

566
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,340
an experience of what will be
happening from the perspective

567
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:35,660
of the collective unconscious.
My experience there was that for

568
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,380
there to be a great awakening of
this magnitude, there must first

569
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,200
take place, a great death, a
great surrender. We must be

570
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,940
purged and emptied of all our
old ways of thinking and feeling

571
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:54,100
before the space is created to
allow awakening of a higher

572
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,840
order of knowing, so that the
time of Great Awakening was

573
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,840
preceded by a time of great
breakdown, loss of control,

574
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,920
literally, an unraveling of life
as we know it. Just as in a

575
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,400
psychedelic session, one must
let go of everything and

576
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,420
experience a profound death
before great visions open.

577
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,560
Likewise for our species, we
must let go of everything that

578
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,880
has dominated our past, all the
constrictions of our thinking,

579
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,760
the constrictions of our mind
and the constrictions of our

580
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,740
heart, in order to open to this
new future which is coming.

581
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,340
There is a third segment on the
birth of the future human, and

582
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:43,900
that came later in the chapter
on the final vision. I want to

583
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,980
say that my visions didn't tell
me how this was going to take

584
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,740
place. It didn't tell me when it
was going to take place. It

585
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,100
didn't give me any information
about the details. It took me

586
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,000
inside the collective psyche and
gave me an experience of the

587
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,800
collective psyches, experience
of this and it also gave me an

588
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,580
understanding and experience of
some of the mechanisms that are

589
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:10,560
involved at the collective level
that will help us make this huge

590
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,160
transition we are trying to make
in the little time that we have

591
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,560
to make it. I discussed this, I
present this. I discussed it in

592
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,320
dark net early dawn, and I lay
it out again in LSD, in the mind

593
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:35,480
of the universe, the diamond
Luminosity material, as I said

594
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,320
before, after the benediction of
blessings, I had no idea where

595
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,580
the work was going to go. I was
completely existentially

596
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:46,540
satisfied. I felt I had been
drawn deep into the cosmic

597
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,500
process. I had been overwhelmed
with cosmic love. I had been

598
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,460
taken into the fertile void
underneath all physical

599
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,780
existence. I had no idea where
things would go, but there were

600
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,760
still five years. Ahead on the
journey and the diamond

601
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,240
Luminosity gathers four years of
the work and 26 sessions. It, by

602
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,960
far, covers more sessions than
any other chapter in the book in

603
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,940
a longer period of time. What
happened was, after going

604
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,680
through yet one more very
intense death and rebirth

605
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,240
process. I was taken into a
reality, a level of

606
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:34,040
consciousness that was well
Buddhism, calls it Dharmakaya,

607
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:39,020
the clear light of absolute of
absolute reality. I was taken in

608
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:46,600
a domain of consciousness it was
absolute, pure light. The most

609
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,560
striking thing about the
experience was how clear, clear,

610
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,940
clear, beyond imagination, this
domain was just to touch this

611
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,140
for a few minutes. Was life
transforming, in and of itself?

612
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,900
Absolute? Clear, clear, beyond
the species mind, beyond

613
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,100
archetypal reality, beyond
physical, any derivative of

614
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,580
physical consciousness, into
this hyper, clear, celestial

615
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:17,700
state. Over the next four years,
I entered this reality four

616
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,880
times, and only four times out
of 26 sessions, only four of

617
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,080
them took me deep into this
reality. Here are the names of

618
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:32,960
the sessions, death state,
diamond, Luminosity, the

619
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,200
universal field of light in the
nature of mind. In between these

620
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,660
sessions, as you might imagine,
there were many sessions of

621
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,520
continuing, intense
purification, because this was a

622
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,840
deeper level of reality, a much
more pure level of reality, and

623
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,860
that required the purification
of my physical and psychological

624
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,840
system in order to stabilize
consciousness at this reality,

625
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,280
they also scattered in these
sessions, there was a great deal

626
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,940
of personal healing that took
place, which is kind of curious

627
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,460
to me, because I would have
thought that personal healing

628
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,180
would have taken place much
earlier in the journey, but it

629
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:20,840
took place here, and I
discussed, I came to understand

630
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:25,340
why things were unfolding in
that order. The first two of

631
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,180
these sessions were taking me
deeper and deeper into diamond

632
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:34,040
Luminosity, which really peaked
then in the 50th session. The

633
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,780
second two sessions, 60 and 66
the diamond Luminosity was

634
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:43,000
crunching itself deeper and
deeper into my physical system,

635
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:50,260
into my psychological system,
into my physical body. As I

636
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,820
said, talking about these
sessions, they're very powerful.

637
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:00,160
They draw me into them just to
try to describe that the time is

638
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,600
short. So I want to move through
and we'll keep going, and we can

639
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,940
come back to mend the question
and answers. Let me mention one

640
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,940
thing midway through this
process, in the 50th session,

641
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:20,180
when I went into the deepest
transcendent experience I ever

642
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,660
had in any of the sessions, into
the deepest level of diamond

643
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:30,200
Luminosity. I was as far into
the crystalline body of God as I

644
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,060
had ever been and would ever be.

645
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,460
And right in the middle of this
session, I had an experience

646
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:41,620
that completely changed my
understanding of existence. In

647
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:46,060
the middle of this session, my
visual field pivoted 90 degrees,

648
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,220
and I saw reality that was far
beyond the reality that I was in

649
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,020
inside diamond Luminosity, and a
ray of light came out of that

650
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,720
distant reality and hit me, and
it completely shattered me. It

651
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,760
just I just absolutely shattered
me. And in that experience, I

652
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,540
realized that there is no end to
this journey. There is no

653
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,320
destiny point and end point that
one eventually reaches, that the

654
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,320
Divine is infinite and will
never, ever, I will never, ever

655
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,800
be able to reach, even using
this powerful method, to the

656
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,800
absolute ends of that reality.
Now this is important because I

657
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,040
had absorbed, and many of us
have absorbed, the idea that

658
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,160
there is an end point to this
journey. You become one with

659
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,080
God, or you enter into the meta,
cosmic void that there is an end

660
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,780
point, and you keep pushing
until you reach that end point.

661
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,440
And I had experienced oneness
with God, but I discovered that

662
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,500
there are many permutations of
oneness. There are levels and

663
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,880
levels of oneness. And I had
experienced the formless void,

664
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,600
but I had learned that there are
actually dimensions of

665
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:04,560
formlessness. There. Depths of
formlessness. When I when the

666
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,840
diamond Luminosity work opened,
I thought it came with such a

667
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,160
profound sense of Homecoming. It
was so deeply satisfying. I

668
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,540
thought I finally found my
destination. I finally found my

669
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,640
stopping point. I had found the
end of the journey. And this

670
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,960
session, session 50, showed me
that there are dimensions beyond

671
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,980
even that, and I would never,
ever reach some final

672
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,460
standpoint. The reason that
death kept returning over and

673
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,520
over again in this work is if
you keep driving yourself and

674
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,540
you have a method that's
sufficiently powerful to keep

675
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,680
taking you past your then limits
the universe will keep taking

676
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,300
you deeper and deeper and deeper
into yourself, into itself, and

677
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,080
will never be able to reach the
very end of it. And that's why I

678
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,320
would be gentler with myself if
I were doing this work over

679
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,120
again, because now I understand
that the goal was not to get to

680
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:06,180
some end state or some ultimate
dimension. The goal is to open

681
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,200
ourselves to the transcendent
realities and let us much of

682
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,980
that spiritual reality into our
hearts and into our minds, to

683
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,520
let it change us down to the
heart and soul, and incorporate

684
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:23,420
as much of it as we possibly can
and bring as much of divinity

685
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,580
into time and space as we
possibly can and be patient with

686
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,480
the rest. I'm a little more
patient now than I was when I

687
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,640
was a young man doing this work.
And then this brings me to the

688
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:43,540
final vision chapter, the
chapter where I'm going to take

689
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,560
a shortcut here, I'll simply say
that I was put through a

690
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:52,240
horrendously powerful, stripped
down process, and was taken

691
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,400
deeper into deep time than I had
ever been taken before, And I

692
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:04,740
was given an extraordinarily
powerful series of visions about

693
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,380
human evolution, and was allowed
to experience again the future

694
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,580
human that we are in the process
of becoming, to experience the

695
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,280
architecture, the inner
architecture of the Deep psyche

696
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,840
of the future human. And this is
a magnificent being. Just to

697
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,880
just to think about this being,
just to remember the magnitude

698
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,740
of this being, brings tears to
my eyes. It's so important for

699
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:42,160
us to hold on to the vision of
what we are going and what is

700
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,120
happening in the deep structure
of history, because as the

701
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,140
shadows of our travail deepen,
as we enter the great time of

702
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,680
unraveling, as we enter the
purification that we are coming

703
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,480
into. Now, it's going to be very
tempting, and there'll be all

704
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,300
sorts of voices talking about
Armageddon and Apocalypse and

705
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,980
the extinction and the end of
times. And this is not the end

706
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,420
of anything. This is the process
of giving birth to a new and

707
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:20,220
finer version of humanity after
this, the consciousness guiding

708
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,260
my sessions. Wrapped it up. I
didn't know we were stopping,

709
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,400
but it wrapped it up and took me
through two experiences, which I

710
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,960
call the goodbye sessions. It
basically wrapped up all of our

711
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,520
work. And at the end of the 73rd
session, I knew that it was time

712
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,940
for me to stop. I want to talk
about very briefly, coming off

713
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:47,980
the mountain overall, I think I
did a good job integrating my

714
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:51,940
sessions as I went. I paid a lot
of attention to my body. I took

715
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,600
good care of my body. I did a
lot of spiritual practice. I

716
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,300
wrote my sessions down
carefully. I tried to

717
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:03,780
internalize them as deeply as I
could session by session, I

718
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:07,020
think I did a good job of
integrating my sessions. And

719
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:11,100
because I had been given so many
gifts and so many blessings in

720
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,400
the course of my 20 years of
work, I thought that I could

721
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,540
simply stop my sessions and step
back, and I would continue to be

722
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,600
nourished by those experiences.
And I was and that did happen.

723
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,740
But that's not all that's
happened. In the years following

724
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,140
the ending of my work in 1999 I
found myself gradually entering

725
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:37,040
into a period of what I call the
deep sadness, a profound

726
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:46,900
existential sadness. I Yes, what
I was suffering from was a loss

727
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,820
of communion with the divine. I
had entered so deeply into the

728
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:55,780
divine, so deeply into the
luminous reality of such

729
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:02,040
supreme, super, cosmic reality,
that I. Knew I would never enter

730
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:06,420
that deeply into reality, into
the Divinity again. Before I

731
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,500
died, I knew I was going away. I
was setting it aside and coming

732
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,340
back in it for variety of
reasons too much to go into

733
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,240
here. I had to stop my sessions.
It was important for me to stop

734
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,260
them, but I knew I would never
experience the divine this

735
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,180
deeply again until I died, and I
would experience it again when I

736
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:33,440
die, but not being able to
return this deeply into divinity

737
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:40,360
became an open heartache for me,
once you have been have known

738
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:44,260
the joy of dissolving into the
Divine Light. Once you have

739
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,900
dissolved completely into the
boundaryless condition

740
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,580
transcending time and space,
life on Earth can tend to feel

741
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:56,500
kind of dried up. And basically,
I was losing interest in

742
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,380
continuing to live inside time
and space. Eventually I realized

743
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:06,180
I was just waiting to die. I was
taking care of my children, I

744
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,780
was taking care of my students
and teaching writing, but in my

745
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:15,120
heart of hearts, I was waiting
to die so that I could return to

746
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:20,400
my beloved, to the divine. And
then years passed, I realized,

747
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,360
this is not right. This is not
the way it's supposed to be.

748
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,800
Everything about my life was
screaming failure to integrate.

749
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,480
But because I had tried to
integrate each of my sessions so

750
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,240
carefully and so
conscientiously, I did not

751
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:40,040
understand where the failure
could lie, but I had no choice

752
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,060
but to recognize that somewhere
along the line, something had

753
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:48,160
gone wrong that it would leave
me feeling so existentially

754
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:54,940
adrift in its wake. So I turned
and studied my work further to

755
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,980
try to figure out what had gone
wrong, and what I learned was

756
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,080
integrating an entire journey is
different than integrating

757
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,860
individual sessions that
basically

758
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,740
hard to talk about in a matter
of seconds and a half a minute.

759
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:38,360
It's hard to describe the
process of, in a sense, having

760
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,040
too much God. It almost sounds
like a contradiction in terms.

761
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,900
Surely, more of God is always
better. Now this entire physical

762
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,440
universe is the body of God. I
knew that. I know that I'm

763
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,700
standing here and surrounded and
part of the body of the

764
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,180
Divinity, but even that
knowledge which had been given

765
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:02,160
me in my sessions did not save
me from the consequences of

766
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:08,280
having entered into full divine
presence so many times in time,

767
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,660
I began to realize that I had
lost a balance in my sessions,

768
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,640
and the balance was between
Transcendence and imminence. I

769
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:22,340
had entered so deeply into
transcendent reality that I had

770
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:28,760
lost my foothold in space, time
reality. Transcendence is a

771
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,580
magnificent thing. It's very
healing to experience

772
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,360
Transcendence. It's very it's
very sane making it's very It

773
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,960
teaches us what and why we're
here. But too much Transcendence

774
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,160
can be disorienting too much.
Transcendence can actually make

775
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,580
you lose contact with another
great truth, and that is the

776
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:56,080
truth of our embodied existence.
I made a completely strong

777
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:02,820
commitment to re establishing my
presence inside time and space.

778
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,380
It took me about 10 years. I did
it through conscious exercises,

779
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,120
and I did it through a sheer
commitment to live as I was

780
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:17,220
where I was for the my remaining
years in this earth. And it took

781
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:22,100
me about about 10 years to
really get solidly grounded and

782
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:29,600
operational on the earth. I will
say at the same time that I've

783
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:34,760
learned to manage my memories of
Transcendence, my memories of

784
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,200
communion. But they are always
there in the back of my mind.

785
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,020
They always guide me in in the
larger trajectory of my life.

786
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:53,260
Unknown: Yes, hello. Thank you
very much for sharing this

787
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,360
amazing experience that you
have. I'm from Israel. I wanted

788
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:03,480
to ask two questions. First. Of
all the about the when you say a

789
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,100
high dose, what is, what is?
What are the doses that you're

790
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:16,260
talking about? Yeah? So, yeah,
okay, sorry. Go ahead and the

791
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,860
second question I wanted to ask
about all this, all the

792
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,640
settings, you know, what was the
setting? Because, you know, I

793
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:29,480
consume. I do a lot work with
with the with plants, and I was

794
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,540
very interesting to know about
the setting. How was the setting

795
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,880
of the of the of it, of the of
the journeys, how you did it,

796
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,360
how you prepared yourself, how
you did what was in the moment,

797
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,420
if you're sitting, if you're
lying, your eyes closed. Music,

798
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:47,860
no. Music, nature, all of these
things, and they would like to

799
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:52,120
know about this and about the
also about how you were in the

800
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:56,680
daily life, what kind of things
helped you to stay here in a

801
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,100
good way, like what spiritual
practices or exercise or food or

802
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,180
something that was, thank you
very much.

803
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,320
Chris Bache: Yeah, good
questions. Thank you. I worked

804
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:14,940
at 500 to 600 micrograms, which
is very high doses of LSD, and I

805
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,560
mean low dose psychedelic. Work
may be one 200 micrograms. This

806
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:24,440
was very high levels. My
setting, I was always working in

807
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:29,420
complete privacy and inside, I
was either in my own house or at

808
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:35,360
my wife's professional office. I
was always lying down. I was

809
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,840
basically, if you, if you look
at Stan's book, LSD

810
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,580
psychotherapy, you'll get the
protocol laid out in great

811
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:47,860
detail. Music was very carefully
curated to pace the stages of

812
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,160
the opening and closing of the
session, always wearing

813
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:55,660
eyeshades, not really the only
way my sitter would be in

814
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:59,440
communication with me was
primarily through the music. She

815
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,860
took care of my body and took
care of the music and so I was

816
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:11,220
not in nature. What was the
other part of your Oh, the

817
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:17,100
grounding practices really
important. You have to maintain

818
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:23,540
grounding is a dynamic balance.
My life was very kind of

819
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:27,260
grounded in a schedule. In
reality, first of all, was

820
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:31,640
grounded in relationships. It
was grounded in a long marriage,

821
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:37,280
my first wife, 24 year marriage.
It was grounded in my roles and

822
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,020
responsibility as a father, I
have three children, so wherever

823
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:46,360
I was on Monday, I was on
Saturday, I was back in the

824
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,860
classroom on Monday, and I was
taking care of my children on

825
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:58,480
Sunday morning. In my teaching,
I had a rhythmic, a constant set

826
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,120
of responsibilities that kept me
always on track, always kind of

827
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,800
I always grounded in my
responsibilities of teaching my

828
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:13,920
students. I was always doing
spiritual practice. I was always

829
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,520
doing a form of meditation. I
coordinate different types of

830
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,740
meditation over the years, but I
was always meditating. Took care

831
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:26,540
of my body, doing yoga, various
physical practices, it's really

832
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:31,820
important to stay in lively
contact with one's physical

833
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:35,600
world while doing this work. So
basically we're just blowing

834
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,180
consciousness out to its
farthest limits, and then it

835
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:45,580
spontaneously recongeals. And I
found that myself, I had a

836
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:52,420
seemingly a natural capacity, an
easy capacity, Jessica can no

837
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:57,940
doubt explain in my chart the
markers of that, a capacity to

838
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:02,280
let loose and let go of
boundaries and then to recongeal

839
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:09,060
back into my time, space,
reality. Yeah. Does that cover

840
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:09,720
your questions?

841
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:15,179
Unknown: Enough? Yes, that yes.
Thank you very much. So I just

842
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:18,179
the last question, just to
consume this. You always made

843
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:22,039
sure, let's say there will be
someone like in a distance, on a

844
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:25,579
house or somewhere that if you
need, you need assistance, or,

845
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:30,979
yeah, like you always you make
sure that they nobody will be

846
01:04:30,979 --> 01:04:31,159
there.

847
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:37,400
Chris Bache: Yes, in my is my
mic on, yes, okay, yes. I was

848
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:42,700
never left alone. I was always
taken care of. My wife was my

849
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:46,480
sitter. She's a clinical
psychologist. My first wife,

850
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,520
Carol, she was my sitter. How
she never left me alone and she

851
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,720
she had complete responsibility
for taking care of our world. We

852
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,200
were always isolated. We were in
private. There were no

853
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,240
interruptions. My work, when I
basically closed the door and we

854
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,140
entered this world, there was
absolutely nothing that was

855
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:10,380
going to intrude from the
outside world. I think that's

856
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,860
really important. It's important
to have an absolute clear

857
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:18,180
container. I call it entering
the Kiva. Just as in the

858
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,900
southwestern United States, when
they would do spiritual

859
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:24,140
practice, they crawl into the
Kiva, a hole in the ground, they

860
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,960
pull up the ladder, and you're
isolated completely from the

861
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,440
world while you're doing this
work. If you're going to go deep

862
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,200
into the universe, it's very,
very important to have a

863
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,700
completely grounded, isolated,
protected environment, so that

864
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:41,140
you know that whatever you're
confronting, and I've confronted

865
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:45,580
some pretty horrendously
difficult experiences. But

866
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:48,460
whatever you're confronting, you
know that it's not coming from

867
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,360
outside you. It's coming from,
in a sense, from inside you or

868
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,380
from in it's coming from the
universe, but purely through

869
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,900
your own consciousness. So no
outside complications. I did not

870
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,480
try to stay in contact with the
outside world at all.

871
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:07,079
Unknown: Let's hear from Carrie.
Go ahead. Carrie,

872
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,880
hi everybody. Chris. I just want
to say thank you so much for all

873
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,080
your work. I've heard you speak
years ago through PCC and CIS,

874
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:20,480
and I've enjoyed your writings
and and many bits, but I loved

875
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,480
this presentation that you did
today, so coherent, and walking

876
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,820
through each of the stages and
sessions and the way you

877
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:29,780
organized the arc of the journey
is really impressive and super

878
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:34,880
rich. So thank you so much for
that. Thank you. Three

879
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,940
questions. You can pick one if
you want, if it seems too long,

880
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:43,300
but the astrological integration
I'm really curious about, you

881
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:47,500
know, your individual chart,
your transits, how the

882
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,680
individual chart kind of
functioned as a lens for you to

883
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:56,260
entering these, you know, either
subconscious parts of yourself

884
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,660
to be able to see them, or the,
you know, the collective

885
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:03,240
unconscious as well, all of the
parts there. And you know, how

886
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,140
much of the of the chart Do you
think remained as you entered

887
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:11,640
these less individuated states?
Yeah, the one, the individual

888
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:15,180
part to the transits, and, you
know, just any little head bits

889
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,180
that stick out, I guess. And
then the third one, I'm really

890
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:20,900
curious, particularly it came up
for me when you were talking

891
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:25,520
about being in the ocean of
suffering and the the healing

892
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:33,200
that can come about from
processing that internally and

893
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,760
individually. And I'm curious if
you if those effects you felt

894
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,200
them in your I'm just going to
call it your waking life, your

895
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,740
normal states of consciousness
in if it kind of came back from

896
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:49,540
people around you, or in world
events or, yeah, any potent

897
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:52,000
moments where that, where that
you really felt, that reflection

898
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,400
of your internal experience from
the external world?

899
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:58,480
Chris Bache: Yeah, let's start
on your last question and then

900
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:05,160
work forward into the earlier
ones. Yeah, it did manifest.

901
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:09,240
There were manifestations that
emerged in the outer world. And

902
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:14,820
so let me mention my book, The
living classroom, and there's a

903
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:18,960
chapter on teaching in dark net
early dawn. What my I never

904
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,920
talked to my students about my
work, right? I just made a

905
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:27,560
firewall between my professional
life and my inner shamanic work,

906
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,460
and yet I found over time that
various students were being

907
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:39,620
activated by my inner work, that
the deeper I went, the more

908
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:44,320
powerful the activation became,
and it became such a prominent

909
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,560
part of my teaching that I found
that I had to I had to

910
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,200
understand what was going on. I
had to learn how to work with

911
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,700
these forces. So for me,
integration doesn't mean simply

912
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:59,200
personal integration into my
personal life, but it also means

913
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:04,380
helping take care of all the
derivative social fallout of

914
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:08,460
one's own experiences. I found,
for example, that while I was

915
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,520
teaching and I would just be
reaching to give examples of

916
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,820
something I was trying to
explain, that the examples that

917
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:19,740
I would reach for would without
my even being aware of it.

918
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,160
Students were coming up after
class, and they say, you know,

919
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,560
it's interesting that you use
that example, because that's

920
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,340
exactly what happened to me this
week. And this happened over and

921
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:32,240
over again, that there was some
kind of boundary which had come

922
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,860
down between my mind and my
students mind. It was and not

923
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:40,360
only, not only were these things
kind of like triggering, sort of

924
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:45,100
an aha moment for my students.
Isn't that curious, but the

925
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:50,560
deeper I went, the more the
synchronistic touches began to

926
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,820
trigger very, very deep healing
experiences in the students. It

927
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:59,140
was as if their souls were in
communication with my soul, and

928
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:03,240
they were giving me. Bits and
pieces of insights into where

929
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,060
they were, what they needed,
where they were suffering, where

930
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:09,780
they were hurting. And this was
happening without me being

931
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:14,880
consciously aware of the process
at all. And so I really had to

932
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,880
study this. I really had to
understand what was, what was

933
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,940
driving these processes. And
eventually I wrote, after dark,

934
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,640
night, early dawn, I wrote an
entire book on the living

935
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,060
classroom, on the collective
dynamics in the classroom. And I

936
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:32,000
don't mention psychedelics
there, because this is not a

937
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,420
psychedelic phenomenon. This is
simply about the nature of

938
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:39,860
consciousness. At one level, we
have private mind, but just

939
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:43,900
beneath our private mind. Mind
does not have privacy. There are

940
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,680
collective dimensions of mind.
It's like throwing a rock into a

941
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,760
lake, the ripples spread out
when you do deep, deep work, the

942
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,060
ripples of that work spread out
and touch the lives of people

943
01:10:55,060 --> 01:11:00,580
around you. The place where I
experienced this most profoundly

944
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:04,260
was in my classroom because I
was working in a collective

945
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,200
context, I could see these
ripples coming back at me all

946
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:16,500
the time. The first the issue of
astrology and individual and

947
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,300
global transits, this is a
complicated question, and I'm

948
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:24,680
not an astrologer, so I want to
be very careful about this. I

949
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,280
tracked my sessions. I used
astrology to plan my sessions

950
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,880
after I learned from Rick Tarnas
about the correlations between

951
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:35,600
outer planets and inner
experience in psychedelic days.

952
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:42,280
So I planned my sessions by
transits, and I also tracked the

953
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:47,140
patterns of my breakthroughs
projected against the pattern of

954
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:52,420
the planets, and I found it to
be a very complicated

955
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:58,180
correlation. While there were
correlations between my

956
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:03,840
individual transits and global
transits with the unfolding of

957
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,780
my psychedelic experience, there
were also differences that I

958
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:14,400
wasn't expecting. There was a
kind of a failure to find

959
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,820
correspondence. For example, my
breakthroughs were not always

960
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:23,240
paired with with Uranus, all
right, my my really, really

961
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:28,580
intense up against the wall,
death in your face. Experiences

962
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:32,660
were not accompanied. We're not
marked by Saturn transits or

963
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:37,520
Saturn global transits or even
Pluto transits. And so it was a

964
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:44,740
complicated process when, when
my work began to go off the edge

965
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:49,060
of time and space, when I began
to enter deeper and deeper into

966
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:53,680
archetype of reality, and then
beyond archetype of reality into

967
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:59,080
Dharmakaya or the diamond
Luminosity, I found what I felt

968
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:04,200
was a kind of a roll off of
astrological variables that the

969
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:08,760
astrology did not seem my my
psychedelic dance did not seem

970
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:15,660
to map very easily into the
astrological dance, and I began

971
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:19,560
to think that there actually
might be a roll off effect of

972
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:26,540
one's solar dance and one's
session experiences. And this

973
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:30,260
continues to be an area of
active dialog. For me, it's an

974
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:34,160
active consideration. There is
an appendix in the book. The

975
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:39,500
last appendix is called pushing
the limits of astrological

976
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:44,260
correspondence. And in that
chapter, in that appendix, I

977
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:48,940
give the dates of all of my
sessions. So if one wanted to,

978
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:52,720
one can look at my natal chart.
One can look at the sessions,

979
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,880
when you look at the
correlations or lack of

980
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,880
correlations, and so forth. Now
I know that that's not a there's

981
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:01,620
not enough sessions given in the
book to really give a definitive

982
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:05,220
answer, but I wanted to support
the discussion of the

983
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:09,660
relationship between astrology,
astrological transits and global

984
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:13,860
transits and one's own
psychedelic work. To me, that's

985
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,500
an open question at this point.
I know that there are

986
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,860
correlations, particularly in
the early stages of one work,

987
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,080
whether those correlations
continue to be as strong in the

988
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:30,560
late stages of one's work. I'm
not as convinced of okay, and in

989
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,040
terms of my own chart, that's
that gets too complicated. I

990
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:37,940
mean, I I have a lot of Neptune
in my chart. I have a lot of

991
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,380
water in my chart. I have a sun
square Neptune with Neptune in

992
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:46,060
the first house. So there are a
lot of I have some other

993
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:51,700
dynamics that I was destined to
do this type of work, you know.

994
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,360
And I want to mention the ocean
of suffering. This was not

995
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,540
something that was forced on me.
I didn't understand it at the

996
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:02,640
time. But this and. I don't
think the universe forces any of

997
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:09,300
us into this type of work. This
was too too hard, too demanding,

998
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,860
too difficult for to have it be
forced on me. What I learned

999
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:17,640
over time again is that this is
something that I voluntarily

1000
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:22,160
took on in this incarnation. It
was part of the plan of my

1001
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,820
incarnation to do this work and
to do the ocean of suffering

1002
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:31,400
work in particular. So I'm a
volunteer, and I think we're all

1003
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,480
when we get into this deep, deep
muck that we get into, we're

1004
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,340
volunteers for this work.

1005
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,360
Unknown: Awesome. Thank you so
much. Thank you, Kerry, Hi,

1006
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:46,360
Chris.

1007
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:51,760
This is Paul and amber in
Poland, and we are so happy to

1008
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:57,580
finally see you live and thank
you. Wanted to say how much we

1009
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:05,100
appreciated your call. I have a
few questions, but let's start.

1010
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,700
Let's continue the theme of the
ocean of suffering where we

1011
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,820
live, in Poland, of course, was
the site of one of the most

1012
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:18,420
horrific events that happened, I
would say, for centuries. Which

1013
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:23,600
by which? I mean, of course, the
Holocaust when you had your

1014
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,940
experience of the ocean of
suffering, did you experience

1015
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,240
anything specific, or was the
specific information or visions

1016
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:39,320
that you had that might have
related to something like this?

1017
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:43,360
The reason I'm asking this
question is because the event,

1018
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:49,780
which happened 80 years ago, is
so palpable that it's still in

1019
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:53,080
the atmosphere. It's still in
the collective. You can feel it

1020
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:58,180
here in the land and you know,
it's it's there in the

1021
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:02,100
collective, whether we like it
or not, and I was just

1022
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:07,920
interested in whether in any of
your sessions, you actually had

1023
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,860
a sense of what happened then,
yeah,

1024
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:18,120
Chris Bache: I did not go into
specifically identifiable

1025
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:26,600
historical traumas like the
Holocaust, what happened was, I

1026
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:33,680
basically was taken into deeper
and deeper and deeper into pain

1027
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:39,440
and fury and chaos and
extraordinary suffering That

1028
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,600
kept getting larger and larger.
It wasn't narrowly focused in

1029
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,580
any century or any country or
any place. It expanded to

1030
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:52,840
include hundreds of 1000s,
millions of people, and it

1031
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,340
expanded to include hundreds of
years, 1000s of years, until

1032
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:01,560
eventually, my subjective
experience was that it included

1033
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,580
all the human beings and all the
conflicts that emerged in the

1034
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:10,200
history of humanity. I mean
something of that scope. So I

1035
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,860
have no doubt that trauma like
the Holocaust, or trauma like

1036
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,220
the extinction of Native
Americans and other tribal

1037
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:21,680
conflicts and so on. I have no
doubt that those were implicitly

1038
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:27,140
present in what I was working
with, but it wasn't explicitly

1039
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:31,460
present. It was like to me, you
know, Stan has this concept of a

1040
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,880
Coex system, a system of
condensed experience. I think

1041
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:39,440
the collective psyche also has
these massive aggregate, these

1042
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:45,820
balls of collective experience.
I call them the meta matrices.

1043
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,020
They are. They are the meta Code
Systems, the COEX systems of the

1044
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:54,160
collective psyche that fuse
multiple historical periods and

1045
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:58,000
multiple cultures and multiple
people's experience. Late in

1046
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,400
this whole series, it became
very clear to me was that what I

1047
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:07,200
was engaging was memory, the
living memory of trauma that was

1048
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:10,980
embedded in the collective
psyche. I should mention that

1049
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:15,120
where I live in Youngstown,
Youngstown, Ohio, we haven't had

1050
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:21,080
a holocaust here, but we have a
long history of violence. It

1051
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,900
goes back to the Native
Americans, and there were some

1052
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:27,980
massacres that took place here.
There is a tremendous influx of

1053
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:33,620
Eastern European This is a town
that made steel. There's there's

1054
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:37,760
a lot of old world patriarchy, a
lot of violence against women, a

1055
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:43,360
lot of old institutional
violence and the mafia took over

1056
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,340
our town. For decades, there
were gang land shootings in

1057
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:54,400
neighborhood parking lots. My
sense is that because the ocean

1058
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,140
of suffering was on the agenda
in my work, that I was actually

1059
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:03,900
brought to a place. Place where
these poisons run close to the

1060
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:08,160
surface in the collective
psyche. And I'm sure that if I

1061
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:13,860
were working in Poland or in a
place that it would have been

1062
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:17,100
more explicit the historical
trauma that you're referring to.

1063
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,920
Unknown: Thank you. Thank you.

1064
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,860
First of all, Chris, thanks so
much for all your work over the

1065
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:31,820
decades. Been a huge fan forever
and ever and ever and just so

1066
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:35,780
wonderful and on this ocean of
suffering issue that's been

1067
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:38,480
brought up and touched on,
because that's kind of like the

1068
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,040
next stop on the journey for a
lot of the people out there

1069
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:47,260
working your book dark night,
early dawn was extremely helpful

1070
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:51,820
to Petra and I. We don't work
with LSD. We work with

1071
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:55,900
Holotropic Breathwork, which is
just another technique in order

1072
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:59,680
to connect with these things.
And what we had noticed over the

1073
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:06,180
years was that there were
individuals who, under not

1074
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:10,200
predictable circumstances, began
to contact what seemed to be

1075
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,400
this ocean of suffering. It
wasn't a past life, which

1076
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,700
happens often enough, but there
was something big about it. And

1077
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:22,160
then we realized, my goodness,
people need some clarity that

1078
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,860
this is not just their personal
stuff that they're saddled with

1079
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:28,220
and have to carry around
forever. They are, in a sense,

1080
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:32,960
volunteers. Yes. And so this was
extremely useful, and some

1081
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,500
people in spiritual emergency
that come to us began to

1082
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:41,080
realize, oh, so I was trying to
solve the basic problem between

1083
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,680
men and women for the last 5000
years. Okay, well, you know,

1084
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:49,600
I've got other things I've got
to do today, and so that I want

1085
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,920
to thank you very much for that,
and it's clear now how this work

1086
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,360
will make more available to many
more people, whatever techniques

1087
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,560
they work in, even with
spontaneous experiences. And

1088
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,740
what we developed was using
systemic constellation work,

1089
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,520
then to do a constellation for
the individual that is caught in

1090
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,760
this that would say, Okay,
here's the representative for

1091
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:15,480
the part of the man woman story,
that's mine, and here's a

1092
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,540
representative for the part of
the man woman story that, hmm,

1093
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:24,140
you know, that's a great big
thing, and then to let this,

1094
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,580
this clarity, simply, let them
settle into wow, I do have work

1095
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:32,360
to do. We all have work to do.
And there's something else going

1096
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,720
on that we're all involved in,
but I don't have to have it done

1097
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:40,480
by tomorrow afternoon. Yeah, and
so I just want to thank you for

1098
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:46,240
the earlier work. I'm so glad to
see this. Thank all the powers

1099
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:50,140
in me that brought you living,
breathing, laughing and loving

1100
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:55,720
into this especially tense time
that we have now. So I'm looking

1101
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,140
forward to see if we get to the
stage in our workshops in which

1102
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:05,640
the the the the comments about
the other other stages of the

1103
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,700
past become similarly useful.

1104
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:14,760
Chris Bache: Thank you. I
completely agree. And I think as

1105
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,760
we go deeper into this
historical crisis that we've

1106
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,840
entered, I think we're entering
into a collective dark night of

1107
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:26,900
the soul. It seems like there's
a profound detoxification taking

1108
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:30,320
place, that the poisons of
history are coming out of our

1109
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,800
collective pores. I mean, we see
it if we look around us and

1110
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,340
embody politic, but it's coming
out of our pores, and it's

1111
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:40,540
coming up underneath us and
flooding so that if we're

1112
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:43,540
interested in doing purifying
work, if we're interested in

1113
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:47,800
doing transformational work,
when we open we open it. If we

1114
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,680
have a technique that's powerful
enough, like Holotropic

1115
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,580
Breathwork, we open at an
individual level, and then we

1116
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,960
open at these deeper levels. Now
I'm not a therapist, but if I

1117
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,980
were a therapist, and if I were
working with people entering

1118
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,740
these states, I think just what
you're describing,

1119
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:08,820
differentiating different levels
of the work that emerges,

1120
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:13,320
recognizing kind of what is mine
personally, and what is not mine

1121
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,920
personally, but mine
collectively. It's important to

1122
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,920
have closure and to be able to
close these collective levels,

1123
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,860
and there would be, I would
think, an importance of kind of

1124
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:29,660
winding those sessions down and
kind of concretizing the

1125
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:34,820
collective work in contrast and
separate from one's individual

1126
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:44,620
work. Now I will say that I went
into this work voluntarily. I

1127
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:50,620
stayed into it voluntarily, and
I'm infinitely glad for just

1128
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:54,340
personal reasons, let alone the
collective reasons. I am

1129
01:24:54,700 --> 01:25:00,300
personally very glad to have
done this work because. The

1130
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,320
rewards that came were not
simply a karmic paying back, but

1131
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:10,320
when one opens and embraces
one's life as a member of the

1132
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,880
species, when one open to the
species and takes responsibility

1133
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,320
for the pain and suffering of
the species, it sets in motion,

1134
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:22,580
not only a healing of that
species, but there is a

1135
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:26,960
tremendous infusion of light
that enters into the collective

1136
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,100
psyche and into your psyche as
it enters into the collective

1137
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:37,940
psyche. And so I have been so
deeply rewarded, more than amply

1138
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,980
compensated, for the work that I
did in the ocean of suffering

1139
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:45,100
and other levels. And I think
that this is true for other

1140
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:49,120
people too, that when we give
deeply and generously to those

1141
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:53,320
around us, sooner or later, we
don't know when, how or where,

1142
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,980
but sooner or later, there is a
deep fruition that comes up

1143
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:01,800
underneath us, that carries us
individually where the universe

1144
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:06,360
is intent on carrying the human
species as a collective, and

1145
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:11,220
that is into this birth of this
profoundly new quality of

1146
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:14,940
consciousness that I'm calling
the diamond soul, or the future

1147
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:15,360
human.

1148
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,220
Jessica DiRuzza: Thank you so
much. Chris, as Carrie said,

1149
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:27,620
that was such a beautifully laid
out coherent arc. And I'm so

1150
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,740
grateful for the time that you
have spent with us today, and

1151
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,880
for all of you here connecting
from all around the world. Thank

1152
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,980
you so much for uniting today in
both our hearts and our minds,

1153
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:45,880
and we send each of you so much
love and infinite blessings on

1154
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:49,660
your journey as you deepen into
your own explorations and the

1155
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:53,080
healings that we're all here
doing right now, today in this

1156
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:57,280
world. Thank you so much. Be
well, and we will see you next

1157
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,580
time you.

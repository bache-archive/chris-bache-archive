1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Jeffrey Mishlove: Allowed is
presented by the California

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,060
Institute for Human science,
okay? And then I'll shut that

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,820
Emmy Vadnais: and then I'm going
to go ahead and share my screen.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,240
Minimizing.

5
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:16,439
Jeffrey Mishlove: There we go.
And so as of this moment,

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,539
announcements are being sent out
to one of our followers, and

7
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,419
they'll be logging in, and so
they'll be able to hear

8
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:30,079
everything we say, and their
screen will sort of look like

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,919
this. They'll see little
thumbnails of our images. So in

10
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:34,339
just

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,920
Emmy Vadnais: a minute, I'll
start the countdown clock timer,

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,420
and then for those listening and
joining, welcome and thank you

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,940
for being with us. If you want
to chat in where you're joining

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,660
from in the world, from your
neck of the word, neck of the

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,120
woods. In the world, we'd love
to hear where you're from. And

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,220
then in just a minute, I'll
start the timer.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,340
Jeffrey Mishlove: I might
mention for people who are

18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,200
watching the archival video, and
they're wondering, why do they

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,300
have to sit through 10 minutes
of our conversation beforehand,

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,940
before we begin the program? And
it's because, once we start the

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,620
timer and go live, YouTube
automatically makes it this

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:27,380
archival recording, which
YouTube then takes public. So I

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:36,980
suppose the option would be for
us to capture a recording on on

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,380
our hard drive and then edit it
before we let it go public. So

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,940
in theory, we could edit out the
first 10 minutes because I I got

26
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,580
a complaint from a viewer who
was unhappy that they had to

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,240
least they didn't understand.
They could fast forward, I

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,900
suppose, to the beginning of the
video. So for viewers who who

29
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,860
don't want to sit through our
preliminary conversation? Fast

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,420
forward at 10 minutes,

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,060
Emmy Vadnais: right? That's why
there's a timer. It says nine

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,340
minutes until livestream, but
this is yeah, to give a

33
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,700
notification so that our
subscribers will be notified

34
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,220
that we're going live in a few
minutes and if we were to take

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,860
it down and re upload it, the
only thing is, is that we've

36
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,400
already shared this particular
URL all over the internet, so

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,620
then we would lose this
particular

38
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,040
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah, would
have to have a new URL. I kind

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,540
of like keeping things the way
they are, because I if I were to

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,780
start downloading the and we're
on Zoom. It's a Zoom video,

41
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,680
which is not the highest quality
from the Zoom recorder, to be

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,940
honest. And then I would want
to, anytime you mention another

43
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,720
person, I would want to insert a
book cover or something the way

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,100
we normally do for our
interviews, which would create

45
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,980
additional delays, but this way,
the archival video goes up as

46
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,600
soon as we finish talking,

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,820
Emmy Vadnais: yeah, it's pretty
easy just to fast forward a

48
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,580
YouTube video to when it
actually begins, and

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,820
Jeffrey Mishlove: typically by
the time the day is over, there

50
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,160
are three or four times as many
people who watch the archival

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,500
video is who were with us live.

52
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,340
Chris Bache: How many years have
you been doing this? Jeffrey,

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,440
Jeffrey Mishlove: I started in
1972 doing interviews, but a

54
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,680
YouTube channel. This is our
10th year on YouTube. Okay? I

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,780
began KPFA radio, Pacifica
radio, nonprofit station in

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,160
Berkeley back in 1972

57
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,320
Chris Bache: that's a lot of
good information streamed out to

58
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,460
a lot of people.

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,700
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah, really,
and I was guided to do it by a

60
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,540
dream, really, yes, yeah, at a
time in my life when I didn't

61
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,600
own a radio or a television and
I was a long haired Berkeley

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,380
hippie. I didn't believe in
radio or television. I thought

63
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,920
they were all phony baloney, but
I had this dream, and I acted on

64
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:31,580
it and changed my mind, and for
most of the last half century,

65
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,560
I've been doing interviews.

66
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,880
Chris Bache: Wow, that's
fascinating. Another example of

67
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,440
the wisdom of the deep
consciousness of the world,

68
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,360
communicating and giving us
directions in our private lives,

69
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,000
our so called Private Lives.
Yeah,

70
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,320
Jeffrey Mishlove: and I'm very
interested in people who have

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,100
had what I would call life
changing dreams. Yes, because

72
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,960
that, that dream that I had, was
a life changer. I mean, here I

73
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,480
am, half a century later, still
acting on that information.

74
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:21,740
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, yeah. And
live streams have been on

75
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,220
YouTube. Have been, what, three,
four years, Jeff, you've been

76
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,060
doing these,

77
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,940
Jeffrey Mishlove: yeah, maybe
even,

78
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,999
Emmy Vadnais: I think maybe five
years.

79
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,760
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah. In fact,
yes, five years.

80
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,380
Emmy Vadnais: Emmy, like,
usually every two to three

81
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,440
weeks, we have fabulous guests
on like you, Chris

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,420
Chris Bache: and how did you get
into this particular role? Emmy,

83
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,800
what drew you here?

84
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,120
Emmy Vadnais: Well, Jeff was a
guest on my podcast back in 2018

85
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,100
and I originally learned about
him and thinking aloud on public

86
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:12,780
television back in 1987 when I
was probably 13 years old, and

87
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,980
he was, yeah, interviewing
wonderful people. But even even

88
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,620
then, on public television from
1986 to 2002 although my

89
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,180
understanding was is that it was
sent out to on the satellite in

90
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,140
1987 so I began watching it, and
was just fascinated and very

91
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,140
intrigued with the information.
I didn't understand all of it at

92
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,500
the time because I was 13, but I
understood enough that I wanted

93
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,160
to learn more. And in
retrospect, I think it really

94
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,040
did help set the tone for my
career in understanding more

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,940
about holistic health,
intuition, spirituality,

96
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,840
consciousness, and even back
then, Jeff you, were talking

97
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,740
about UFOs and interviewing
people like Jacques valet and

98
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,600
John Mack and and I thought,
well, this man is really

99
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,660
intelligent. There must be
something to all of this. And

100
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,640
then I was researching for a
book I wrote and about

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,060
intuition, and Jeff's name kept
coming up. And then I realized,

102
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,600
oh, Jeffrey Mishlove, he was the
host of that program. And then I

103
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,680
realized he had a doctorate in
parapsychology, which was very

104
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,840
downplayed on that original
program and and then I thought,

105
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,020
well, I'd love to talk to him,
and I'll invite him on my

106
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:34,580
podcast. And he said, Yes. And
then in 2020 Jeff, you put out a

107
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,480
call for volunteers, and then I
started volunteering with you.

108
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,480
And then he won the Bigelow
essay competition for the best

109
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,540
evidence for the continuation of
consciousness in the afterlife

110
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,240
in 2021 so he invited me to be a
guest host, and then shortly

111
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,180
thereafter, I became the co
host. And then now he's invited

112
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,480
other guest hosts, and yeah, I'm
just grateful to be here and

113
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,480
help share this information and
learn from one of the best, best

114
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,980
people in the field, doing this

115
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Chris Bache: in such in such a
way, our lives are all

116
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,000
intertwined around each other,
aren't they?

117
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,459
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, yeah. Very
true. And Chris, I know we're

118
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,139
going to learn more about you in
a few minutes. When did you

119
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,959
start? I know you bet you were a
professor for many, many years.

120
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,979
When did you start public
speaking or getting interested

121
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,599
in these kind of topics?

122
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,560
Chris Bache: Well, you know,
when I started the LSD work in

123
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,880
79 I had to keep it pretty under
tight wraps. I mean, I just

124
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,860
couldn't bring it out publicly
at all. And it wasn't until I

125
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,040
wrote dark night, early dawn,
which was my first book on

126
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,280
psychedelic work, which which
came out in 2000 that I began

127
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,200
going to conferences and began
to teach at CIS in that area.

128
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,480
But I really didn't go public
until I retired from the

129
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:09,360
University in 2013 and then I,
you know, I was working on LSD

130
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,360
in the mind of the universe for
five years during that period.

131
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,460
And when it finally came out in
2019 I became, I was more

132
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,960
public, just increasingly
public. So I was out of the

133
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,100
psychedelic closet, formally,
kind of when that book came out.

134
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,900
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, and it's a
wonderful book, LSD and the mind

135
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,560
of the universe. I really
enjoyed reading it. And I like

136
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,860
how you also put many of your
session notes in there, which

137
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,620
was you bring the reader. I felt
like I was sometimes along on

138
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,580
the trip with you.

139
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,180
Chris Bache: Yeah, that's what I
wanted to do. My sense was that

140
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,500
in order to have the
philosophical conversation about

141
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,880
the potential of psychedelics,
first people have to understand

142
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,440
what happens in deep sessions.
So the first task was

143
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,340
descriptive, and then later the
second or third round would be

144
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,900
more evaluative and analytic. So
I really tried to bring the

145
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,140
reader along with me into those
sessions. So I had to learn a

146
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,600
whole new way of writing. I had
to lose my academic voice and

147
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,040
develop a different voice.

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,360
Emmy Vadnais: Well, you did it
beautifully, I would say, you

149
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,960
nailed it.

150
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,760
Unknown: Thank you. Yeah, so

151
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,540
Emmy Vadnais: we just got about
a minute before we officially

152
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,920
begin the program.

153
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:44,860
Jeffrey Mishlove: In retrospect
that the the impulse that I had

154
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,960
to act on that dream and to be
alert to it and so on, I was

155
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,960
primed for that from having had
LSD a number of times prior.

156
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,720
Chris Bache: Yeah, and with the
depth of our interweaving

157
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,640
continues to go, Yeah,

158
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,020
Jeffrey Mishlove: all right,
welcome everybody. I'm Jeffrey

159
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:35,000
Mishlove. I'm with my co host
Emmy Vadnais and our honored

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,020
guest Chris Bache and Emmy. Will
you introduce Chris?

161
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,100
Emmy Vadnais: Yes, hello and
welcome everybody. We're so

162
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,720
grateful to have Chris Bache

studies at Youngstown State
University in Ohio, where he

165
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,060
taught for 33 years. He is also

collective consciousness and LSD
and the mind of the universe,

172
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,240
diamonds from heaven, and his
website is Chris bache.com with

173
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,340
an E at the end. Welcome Chris.
We're so happy to have you here

174
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,480
today to get us started. Do you
want to just go ahead and share

175
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,020
a little bit about your
background, and we also want to

176
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,700
let people know that Chris has
been a guest on new thinking,

177
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,520
allowed with a recorded
interview talking about

178
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,220
psychedelics and the Cosmic
Mind.

179
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,560
Chris Bache: Well, I'm actually
the last person you would have

180
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,240
thought from the beginning of my
life to end up writing a book on

181
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,340
describing what happens on the
long series of high dose LSD

182
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,540
sessions. I was raised in the
Deep South, in Mississippi. I

183
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,020
was a seminarian in the early
days. I was studying to be a

184
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,960
Catholic priest, but eventually
I left that because celibacy and

185
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,960
I didn't get along very well.
Got degrees in theology and New

186
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,140
Testament criticism and
eventually philosophy of

187
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,920
religion from Brown University.
So I had a very classical, very

188
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,840
traditional upbringing. The
psychedelic 60s passed me by

189
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,160
entirely, and it wasn't until I
got to graduate school. I mean,

190
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,340
I got to teaching in 1978 and I
was looking around for where to

191
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,100
take my research that I
encountered the work of

192
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,360
Stanislav Grof and his book,
realms of the human unconscious

193
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,020
was a life changer for me,
because I saw immediately the

194
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,320
philosophical significance of
his work. If what he was saying

195
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,420
was true, it had profound
implications for how we could do

196
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,020
philosophy in the future, not
just healing, but actually

197
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,380
explore the metaphysical
structure underlying structure

198
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,080
of reality. So uncomfortable, I
made the decision to knew I

199
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,140
needed to do this work. I knew I
had to begin my own psychedelic

200
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,860
work, and I was uncomfortable
breaking the law, but I chose to

201
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,440
begin very private,
circumscribed work in this

202
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,180
modality using Stan Grof
protocol. So I divided my life

203
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,380
into two parts. During my day
job, I was a traditional member

204
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,140
of the Department of Philosophy
and Religious Studies at young

205
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,960
sound state and kind of my night
job was doing working with

206
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,280
psychedelics, exploring the I
was healing my own psyche,

207
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,760
working and exploring the deep
structure of the collective

208
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,760
psyche, and then what lies
beyond the collective psyche.

209
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,600
And I worked for four years. I
stopped for six years for

210
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,020
reasons that I give in the book,
and then I resume for another 10

211
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,700
years. So basically. Basically
between the time when I was 30

212
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,520
and 50 years old, I did 73 high
dose LSD sessions using a tight

213
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,100
therapeutic protocol, and then I
took another 20 years to digest

214
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,940
and assimilate those experiences
and to kind of connect the dots

215
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,520
in those experiences before
publishing LSD in the mind of

216
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,320
the universe in 2019 so
actually, it was after I

217
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,040
finished my sessions in one of
my meditations, I heard this

218
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,620
voice say, 20 years in 20 years
out, which I took to mean that

219
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,220
it would take me at least 20
years to integrate and digest

220
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,140
all the experiences I had
collected in those 20 years.

221
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,220
Now, I think that might have
been an overly optimistic

222
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,400
assessment, because I don't
think I have nearly integrated

223
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,880
all the experiences that I had
collected in those first 20

224
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,180
years. Wow.

225
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,020
Emmy Vadnais: So you feel like
you're still integrating the

226
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,460
experiences Very

227
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,939
Chris Bache: much so. In fact,
it raises, it has raised

228
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:12,419
substantial kind of intellectual
questions, how do you possibly

229
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:16,739
integrate experiences which so
radically transcend the

230
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:21,139
conditions of time and space and
our consciousness inside time

231
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:25,399
and space. If you have temporary
experiences which go radically

232
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,479
beyond spatial consciousness,
radically on temporal

233
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:33,199
consciousness and linear time,
how do you what does it mean

234
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,139
even to integrate those
experiences? I mean, it really

235
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:40,039
comes down. The things I'm
thinking about these days is,

236
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:43,719
what does integration even look
like? What does it mean when

237
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:48,459
you're dealing with such radical
experiences, if you're dealing

238
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:52,299
with lower dose work or gentler
psychedelics, where the

239
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:57,699
experiences come closer to your
world inside time and space,

240
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,699
integration is less demanding,
but if you really open up to the

241
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:07,139
very deep waters of the deep
psyche, integration becomes a

242
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:08,519
more substantive issue.

243
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,680
Emmy Vadnais: All right? Well,
we're getting lots of questions

244
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,180
coming in, and I think this
question from Robert Bushman

245
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,440
might be a good place to start,
perhaps, is, what is

246
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,860
consciousness? Is there an
ultimate reality, or is it

247
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,460
infinitely fractal? I guess
there's a few questions in here.

248
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,220
How can an individual's
conscious awareness expand

249
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,760
without psychedelics? How can
one remember past lives, which

250
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,760
actually is a maybe a separate
question, but maybe starting out

251
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,380
with, what is consciousness?

252
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:44,079
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, you
know, I'm happy to let the

253
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,739
psychologists and philosophers
tear their hair out on that one.

254
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:51,459
I'm willing to sort of go with
whatever definition they come up

255
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,799
with, as long as it's
sufficiently broad to

256
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,219
incorporate the total
phenomenology of consciousness.

257
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:01,319
I mean, sort of simply,
consciousness comes from calm

258
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,099
shield to know. With
consciousness is that with which

259
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:09,359
we know? So it is the knowing
function. It is the awareness of

260
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,399
our cognitive capacity through
which we know anything else. And

261
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:19,019
so again, then we ask the
question, well, how big is

262
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:21,139
consciousness? We have a
tendency to think that

263
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:24,799
consciousness kind of fits
inside our skull, but now

264
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,159
increasingly, we realize that's
not an adequate understanding

265
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,799
because of all sorts of
empirical, para psychological,

266
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,639
parapsychological research. So I
think of it more as

267
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,599
consciousness is a field that
our brain allows us to

268
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:45,819
consolidate and structure inside
our physical existence. But

269
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:50,019
consciousness in its own right,
is an field. And being a field,

270
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:53,859
it's open ended, and it's then,
if you ask, how big is that

271
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:59,319
field? Then we get into the real
cosmological adventure, because

272
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:05,219
we find, at least, I found that
in if you really go deep into

273
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:09,299
your psyche, you drop first into
the personal unconscious, into

274
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,899
your personal psyche. If you
keep pushing deeper, you drop

275
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:17,579
into the collective psyche, the
territory Jung described. But

276
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:21,979
you can go deeper than that and
drop below the entire psyche of

277
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:25,219
the human species. You can
transcend the species psyche,

278
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:29,419
and then you're in a you're in
dimensions of consciousness that

279
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:35,899
truly, I think of it as the
either the mind of God or I

280
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:38,959
prefer to think of it as the
mind of the universe, that as

281
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:42,099
vast as the universe is, you
know, and we know who have a

282
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,059
rough approximation of how many
billions of galaxies are in the

283
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,259
universe, and how huge it is,
how old it is, that

284
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:54,339
consciousness, that this
universe has a mind, and the

285
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:59,319
mind is as deep and broad and
old as the universe's body is

286
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:04,259
so. So that my individual
experience of consciousness is a

287
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,419
simple drop, a fractal aspect of
the totality of consciousness

288
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,619
that flows. And that's why I
gave the book the title LSD in

289
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:17,159
the mind of the universe.
Because when you go very deep

290
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,439
using a very powerful and
circumscribed protocol, you drop

291
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:25,159
into deeper and deeper layers,
and you're given the opportunity

292
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:31,699
to explore the very nature of of
physical reality

293
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,820
Emmy Vadnais: itself. I think we
just lost your video. Chris, I

294
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,740
Chris Bache: lost the video
here. Let's see what's the

295
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,480
audio. Okay, let me see if I can

296
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,120
Jeffrey Mishlove: guess if the
camera is pointing somewhere

297
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,600
else.

298
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,840
Chris Bache: Yeah, let me see if
I don't know why it dropped, but

299
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,100
I can shift to a different

300
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,620
Emmy Vadnais: There we go. Okay,
there's we've got you. We've got

301
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,700
a view of you now here. So,
Okay, wonderful. Okay, good.

302
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,640
Jeffrey Mishlove: You are back.
Well, I think it's important to

303
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,220
emphasize early on in our
discussion, or to repeat what

304
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,480
you said in your earlier
interview with Emmy, that you

305
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,860
are not recommending that other
people do what you did, take

306
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,820
many high doses of LSD that way,
and I know one of our Viewers

307
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,480
has raised the question about
what kind of people, or what

308
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,620
populations of people should not
use psychedelics

309
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,520
Chris Bache: first, I absolutely
agree. I mean, I really do not

310
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,360
recommend that people adopt the
protocol that I adopted, knowing

311
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,900
what I know at the end of this
journey. I if I were starting it

312
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,880
from scratch, I would be much
gentler on myself. I would work

313
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,100
with much lower doses. I would
balance the organic psychedelics

314
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,640
with the synthetic psychedelics.
I just would take a much gentler

315
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,700
approach in but I was young when
I did this work. I had a number

316
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,300
of assumptions that I was making
that turned out not to be

317
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,940
accurate, and I would just be
much gentler and much more

318
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,900
circumscribed in the project.
And there are many, many people,

319
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,960
types of people, who shouldn't
be working with psychedelics

320
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,020
there for either physiological
reasons or psychological reasons

321
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,400
to work with the amplifying
quality means psychedelics are

322
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,660
amplifiers of consciousness.
They take what is far away and

323
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,840
make it available to you, and
they take what is low volume and

324
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,720
make it higher volume. So it's a
tremendous kind of inversion, an

325
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,900
explosion of awareness. And if
you are prepared for it, if you

326
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,600
have the discipline for it, and
if you have the training to

327
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,660
navigate those transitions, and
if you're working with

328
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,600
professionals who can help you
navigate okay, but there are a

329
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,560
lot of people, I think, our best
base, and probably the majority

330
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,620
of people, are Best kind of
working in gentler techniques,

331
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,760
yoga and meditation or trans
dancing, a number of things

332
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,900
which have the same amplifying
effect in a more gentle fashion,

333
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,220
which do in which we can do a
great deal of very good work

334
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,660
without taking psychedelics at
all. In fact, in the mail that

335
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,120
I've gotten from my writing on
psychedelics. Many of the people

336
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,300
who have written me have never
taken psychedelics, or they've

337
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,840
taken psychedelics once or twice
early in their life, but they've

338
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,120
been a meditator for 50 or 50
years, and they are engaging the

339
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,240
cosmology that emerges in my
story and comparing it to the

340
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,480
cosmology that has emerged for
them in their meditative

341
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,820
experience and finding strong
parallels. And so the deepest

342
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,180
level, the issue is not
psychedelics. The issue is

343
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,640
consciousness, the boundaries
and the functions of

344
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,680
consciousness itself. So but
some people should kind of stay

345
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,800
away from these powerful
amplifiers.

346
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,200
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, and how many
micrograms? What was the dose

347
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,780
that you were usually working
at? Because I know after we did

348
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,900
that interview, people were some
people were chatting in and

349
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:18,180
asking what those levels were.
And I think you, like you said,

350
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,720
you would go lower if you were
to do it over again.

351
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,900
Chris Bache: After the first
three sessions, which are medium

352
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,100
dose sessions, I worked at 500
to 600 micrograms, which is

353
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,080
right at the body's maximum
capacity to absorb. Meaning, if

354
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,080
you took more, you don't
necessarily go deeper more or

355
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,260
less. So I was working at very
high levels that basically have

356
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,480
the potential to just shatter,
you know, the structures of

357
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,420
consciousness and take you
temporarily beyond your

358
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,860
traditional ways of knowing
yourself and knowing the world

359
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,320
and again, I would be much
gentler in the early days.

360
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,880
Stanislav. Differentiates
between those psychedelic B

361
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,620
really launched later, over up
to maybe reasons. But at Spring

362
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,480
Grove, they experimented with
working with the population of

363
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,300
clients who were dying of
cancer. They were they were

364
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,500
terminal patients, and they were
trying to address death anxiety,

365
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,360
and they worked with high dose
LSD sessions, essentially trying

366
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,480
to trigger a Near-Death
Experience, so these people

367
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,720
could have an insight into where
they were going, and therefore

368
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,680
relieve the anxiety of death.
And it was quite successful. But

369
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,140
the protocol limited high dose
work to three sessions. And I

370
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,060
came along after years later,
and I thought, well, if you

371
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,800
could work successfully three
times, you could do it more than

372
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,720
three times. And so I adopted
that protocol. I eventually, in

373
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,580
time, I learned I had a capacity
in an aptitude for working at

374
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:03,240
those levels. I could, I could
let go and expand into the deep

375
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,080
psyche comfortably enough. And I
also did not have problems

376
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,440
consolidating. I tended to
consolidate comfortably and

377
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,860
strongly. And it's just, it's,
it is an unusual, an unusually

378
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,040
intense protocol. I wouldn't do
it again. I'd do it differently.

379
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,920
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, in fact, you
have shared, I believe in your

380
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,460
book, and when we had our
previous conversation that near

381
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:34,220
death experiencers are the group
of people you often relate to

382
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,840
with your own experiences with

383
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,720
Chris Bache: LSD, is that right?
Yeah, I feel the closest, in

384
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,680
some ways, to people who have
near death experiences of any

385
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,300
population, because by when
their body almost dies, they are

386
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,140
catapulted into very deep states
of consciousness. They get

387
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,700
glimpses of the world. They
engage the world. And I think

388
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,560
there's a strong overlap between
what happens in a deep

389
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,600
Near-Death Experience and what
happens in a deep psychedelic,

390
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,080
therapeutically structured
experience. The difference is

391
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,880
that primarily near death,
people get only one take on that

392
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,520
reality. And if you work with
psychedelics like I have, you

393
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,440
get multiple immersions,
multiple initiations into that

394
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,420
reality so that what becomes a
flashing one time exposure

395
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,820
becomes a journey and becomes a
communion that is repeated and

396
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,260
deepened over time.

397
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:39,800
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah. Okay. We
have a question from a viewer

398
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,560
whose YouTube name is greasy,
slick, who would like to know if

399
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,640
you've ever experimented with
DMT, which is considered, I

400
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,760
believe, the most powerful
psychedelic

401
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,600
Chris Bache: I have experience
with other psychedelics other

402
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,140
than LSD, though I consider my
LSD work to be my primary body

403
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,360
of work, I have had some
experiences with DMT, Wilson, of

404
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,500
course, and MDMA and salvia,
Durham and San Pedro. I've had

405
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,940
experiences with five Meo, DMT,
which is an extremely powerful

406
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,460
short acting psychedelic. I
don't have a lot of experiences

407
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,560
with five Meo DMT, I feel like
I'm just beginning to nibble on

408
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,520
that after a long period of not
working with psychedelics,

409
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,620
because I stopped my work
primarily in 1999 and much of my

410
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,760
work with these other
psychedelics came after 1999

411
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,400
when I wasn't so much concerned
with pushing new boundaries, I

412
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,060
was concerned with helping me
integrate the work that I had

413
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:54,400
already done. But yeah, five Meo
DMT is an extraordinarily

414
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,740
powerful and provocative
psychedelic, and I've had

415
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,640
limited experience with
ketamine, the high dose ketamine

416
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,360
sessions.

417
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,440
Jeffrey Mishlove: Are you able
to draw any meaningful

418
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,480
comparisons between those
entheogens and LSD?

419
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,660
Chris Bache: Well, that's a
conversation we'd have to go

420
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:21,500
into very carefully, and I don't
think I have enough experience

421
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,520
to really and I don't have
enough knowledge of other

422
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,960
people's experiences to be able
to make a fair comparison at

423
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,500
this time. I do think that there
is a certain advantage to

424
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,500
psychedelics that open a long
window, a window that stays open

425
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,920
for a long period of time, like
LSD, or maybe a little less

426
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,240
Psilocybin, where, if you're
dealing with something like five

427
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,800
Meo DMT, it's a very, very
intense immersion, but it's a

428
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,060
very short acting, a very short
window, and you don't have as

429
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,220
much time for. The infinite
consciousness that you're

430
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,380
accessing or entering into
communion with to impact you and

431
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,340
to clean you and to transform
your life. And I think this is

432
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,480
what Rick Strassman found in his
book on DMT, the spirit

433
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,620
molecule, where he took people
with DMT into very intense

434
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,420
experiences, and some of them
had very deep experiences, but

435
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,080
in the end, he found that they
did not change their lives very

436
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,280
much. These experiences were not
deeply transformative. And I

437
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,760
personally think that part of
the reason is because it is so

438
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,360
short acting versus a long
acting large window. But then

439
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,500
again, even a psychedelic like
LSD, relatively speaking, is

440
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,820
relatively short acting in terms
of compared to other

441
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,600
meditational practices, for
example, where the window is

442
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,800
open for a much longer period of
time. So if we combine

443
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,800
meditation and contemplative and
yogic disciplines, with the

444
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,660
psychedelic practices which give
you a window to experience, then

445
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,700
you have, I think maybe the
optimal conditions for balancing

446
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,600
the virtues of one and the
virtues of the other and

447
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,960
amplifying the transformative
effect.

448
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,320
Jeffrey Mishlove: Wonder off
hand. How many people who do

449
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,240
take LSD, and it's been widely
used in our culture, how many of

450
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,840
those people really have had
their lives transformed the way

451
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,280
you have, and I think I have to
say the way I have, but I'm

452
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,480
under the impression that many,
many people of our generation

453
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,980
took LSD and they weren't even
trying to transform their lives.

454
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,280
It was more a question of
partying.

455
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,240
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think
that's the case. And nothing

456
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,280
wrong with that. You know, I
have no criticism of that, but

457
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,900
it is, to me, a kind of a wasted
opportunity. It so much. Ha,

458
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,260
hinges the to me, the
productivity of these really,

459
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:15,300
for philosophical exploration or
therapeutic applications,

460
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,500
depends on how you handle these
stories of band aware, if you

461
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,640
kind of stay in touch with the
world, and you're having a time,

462
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,920
you're at a concert, or you're
in nature, or you're with some

463
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,960
friends, then that lends itself
to a certain kind of milieu, a

464
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,820
certain level of encounter. But
if you isolate yourself, if you

465
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,080
adopt kind of a zazen
atmosphere, if you create a Kiva

466
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,160
of practice where you're
isolated from the world. You're

467
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,620
wearing eyeshades. So you know
that whatever you're

468
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,460
experiencing is coming only from
within yourself, and if you

469
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,300
engage that with you know
conscious intention, singular

470
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,680
intent, and allow it to take you
where it wants to take you,

471
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,240
which is often not where you
would like to go. It takes you

472
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,840
into the places that you hurt
the most, and then it takes you

473
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,280
into places that you don't even
understand why it hurts so much

474
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,920
when you're going into it,
because you're going beyond the

475
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,880
edge of the maps of the personal
psyche. But if you focus it with

476
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,420
that intent, then something very
exciting opens up as a

477
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,800
possibility, because you not
only have the opportunity to

478
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,760
heal all these knots that are
kind of locked in your heart

479
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,620
from however many incarnations
you've had, but you also, as

480
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:39,380
these kind of are healed and are
unlocked your receptivity To the

481
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,900
larger fields of consciousness,
which are always there, always

482
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,260
bringing their energy to us,
increases and that really, that

483
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,960
I think is worth a hell of a lot
of concerts.

484
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,000
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, Chris, can
you expand a little bit more

485
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,260
about what your session
structures were like, because

486
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,640
somebody commented in the
conversation that we had, they

487
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,720
asked, Why didn't he just go out
and hang out in the mountains

488
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,580
and nature and and how you had
somebody there with you as well.

489
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:20,600
And I think you look to
Stanislav Grof for how to go

490
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,800
about that, is that, right?

491
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,640
Chris Bache: Yeah, I, you know,
I was Stan's work is so

492
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:30,380
formidable, and his intellectual
synthesis of so many traditions

493
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:35,480
is so important that he became
my kind of foundation for doing

494
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,420
this work. And again, remember,
I was, I was doing this work in

495
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,340
Ohio. I was a long way from San
Francisco. I was not part of a

496
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,300
psychedelic community. I was not
part of an Ayahuasca group that

497
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,860
going down to Peru regularly to
work with indigenous shamans

498
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,160
there. I was really working
alone, and I adopted the

499
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,440
protocol that Stan had outlined
in his book LSD psychotherapy,

500
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,660
published. 1980 right in the
very early years of my work. And

501
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,520
so my protocol, and first, I
think it's it's wonderful to go

502
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,600
sit in nature and do a lower,
moderate dose of psychedelics

503
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,200
and enter into that kind of
communion that can open. It's

504
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,440
just not what I did. So my days
would always start early in the

505
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,600
morning. I would have everything
set up. I would be either at a

506
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,680
third floor of our home or later
when we started having children.

507
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,100
I worked in my wife's office.
Carol was a clinical

508
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,940
psychologist, and she was my
sitter for all of my sessions.

509
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,340
So we would start in the early
morning, I would do meditation,

510
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,120
yoga, body stretching and
whatnot, and then we would begin

511
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:51,100
the session. They were all
guided with very carefully

512
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,600
selected music. So that Carol
had a library of music available

513
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,280
to her, because you want to pace
the rhythm of the shopping the

514
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,780
full peak and the decline of the
section. Different types of

515
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,720
music are appropriate for
different stages of that

516
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,200
process. And you can get lots of
examples of this music from

517
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,220
Holotropic Breathwork sites,
which often catalog extensive

518
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,420
libraries for this type of work.
So basically, I would spend all

519
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,820
day lying down with eyeshades,
and the only way my sitter

520
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,560
primarily related to me was
through the music. One time I

521
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,220
took, we took a movie camera and
set it up to see if it would be

522
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,520
interesting. But actually, it
was frightfully boring, because

523
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,480
it's all the action is taking
place inside. It doesn't show

524
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,860
much on the outside, except
periodically throwing up, which

525
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,600
is, you know, not that great to
watch, but sorry, all day, and

526
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:52,780
then usually by mid late
afternoon sessions wrapping up.

527
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,860
But even after the session, the
formal session wraps up, the

528
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,420
tail is still very long, and I
learned that you have to give a

529
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:06,000
lot of space, a lot of time,
because that you're it's the

530
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,920
long tail is a good opportunity
to reflect upon and to integrate

531
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,920
the insights that's emerged.
Because these insights can come

532
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,760
and they can be very powerful,
but like a dream, you can lose

533
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,820
them, and it's important to hold
on to them as well as you can.

534
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:28,880
And so my custom was the day
after session, the next morning,

535
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,560
I would spend that morning as
long as it took to write out an

536
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,820
complete as thorough and account
of each session. And I found

537
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:43,900
that I had to develop a strategy
for sort of maximizing recall. I

538
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,340
began I would take the playlist
that was used in the session in

539
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,460
exactly the order in which the
music was played, because my

540
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,000
sitter had kept a record, and
then I would play the music

541
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,240
while I was writing, and I would
play each piece of music over

542
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,220
and over till I felt I had
captured as best I could what

543
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,700
happened during that part of the
Muse session. And then I went on

544
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,880
to the next base of music and
the next piece of music, so that

545
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,220
by the time I was finished, I
had as reliable an account as I

546
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:19,080
could create of the session. And
once it's in, like that, once

547
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,020
it's locked in, I don't change
it, it's it's locked. And I

548
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,260
found that if I attempted to
make improvements on the text

549
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,000
later, my improvements often
diluted aspects or they took the

550
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,940
sharp edge off of the focus. So
I basically respected the text,

551
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,220
the sessions, as my primary
text, and that's why, in my

552
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:47,860
book, all the sessions are
produced in a italic text to

553
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,880
separate them from the
commentation. Commentator that

554
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,680
commentator that I put after the
session.

555
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,120
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, well, that's
fascinating. I believe in

556
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,360
psychological terms. It's called
state dependent memory, where

557
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,060
you so you were using your music
that you were listening to

558
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,100
during the session to help reach

559
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,680
Chris Bache: because day after
and you're still sort of one

560
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,880
foot in, one foot out, you know,
you're and it's what I call kind

561
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,240
of standing at the edge of the
well, you're you're one foot in

562
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,740
and one foot out. And by playing
the music while you have your

563
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:27,140
cognitive capacities back, you
can let your mind go back into

564
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,720
that territory and capture it.

565
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Jeffrey Mishlove: Question here
a couple of people have raised

566
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,960
it in different ways, and it has
to do with the way we titled

567
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,760
this program using your phrase
diamond Luminosity. So one of

568
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,680
our viewers, Celia funk, who is
also one of our volunteers and

569
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,080
just had a baby recently,
congratulations. She says, this

570
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,320
may be a silly question, but
does the title diamond

571
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:04,020
Luminosity. Luminosity refer to
actual diamonds. And then a

572
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,300
different viewer asked, Well, is
it related to the Diamond Sutra?

573
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,900
Chris Bache: Yeah, that's not a
silly question at all. Maybe a

574
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,480
little bit of background, the
phrase diamond Luminosity points

575
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,920
to states of consciousness that
I entered in the last five years

576
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,480
of my work. So I had already
gone through kind of what Stan

577
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,600
Grof calls the perinatal
process, and gone through a

578
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,120
really solid ego death. I'd gone
into what I came to call, later

579
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,260
the ocean of suffering, working
at the collective psyche level.

580
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,040
Had gone into archetypal
reality. I'd gone into causal

581
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,020
level reality, many adventures
in that process, and I was

582
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,340
feeling absolutely
philosophically satiated and

583
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,340
complete by that time, because I
had been I was having

584
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,640
experiences of profound oneness
with existence and even touching

585
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:08,280
the meta, cosmic void and having
standing under the waterfall of

586
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,780
cosmic love. So I was
existentially very satisfied.

587
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,860
But in the last five years and
26 sessions, I was catapulted

588
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,280
after one more series of death
and rebirth experiences into a

589
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:31,040
state of consciousness that was
light, but exceptionally pure,

590
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:36,080
exceptionally clear, light,
clear beyond imagination. Now I

591
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,600
had access light many times
before when you have a an ego

592
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,020
death experience, or you have
other deep experiences. Many

593
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,220
people encounter the light this,
and it's the light is kind of

594
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,060
the signature of these radically
expanded divine states of

595
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,620
consciousness. But when I talk
about diamond Luminosity, I'm

596
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,540
trying to describe a particular
state of consciousness, a hyper,

597
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,860
hyper, clear, clear state of
consciousness. And because I

598
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,400
know the Buddhist literature
better than other spiritual

599
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,420
traditions, at least the
mystical side of it, I correlate

600
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,320
it with what the Buddhists call
Dharmakaya, the clear light of

601
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,760
absolute reality. It is the
foundational metaphysical

602
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,880
structure. It is the light out
of which the Big Bang emerges

603
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,260
and gives birth to the entire
physical universe. So it was

604
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,940
hyper clear, and so it doesn't
have anything to do with

605
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,660
physical diamonds, but it does
have something to do with what

606
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,940
the Diamond Sutra is talking
about, and Vajrayana Buddhism is

607
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,020
vadra diamond. So it's a
diamond, it's a diamond V and

608
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,040
there is a cool at least, other
structures also talk about this

609
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,080
diamond esque Luminosity. But I
know it best from reading the

610
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:01,920
Buddhist sources about this
reality. And it seems to me that

611
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,380
it correlates with what are
described in the Tantras in the

612
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,460
Vadnais Sutras of the
Dharmakaya. Beautiful.

613
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,560
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, there's a
question here from Megan Salar,

614
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,300
who you've mentioned this a few
times about meditation, and she

615
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,940
says he talks about the
importance of meditation and

616
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,420
work outside of this psychedelic
work, what does his daily

617
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,060
practice look like? Or what
would he recommend?

618
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,620
Chris Bache: Well, the longer
that I worked with psychedelics,

619
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,340
the more I appreciated how
important it is to have a daily

620
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,880
spiritual practice. Because when
you go into psychedelics

621
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,380
conscientiously, you open your
system up to a vast field of

622
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,940
consciousness progressively
deeper and deeper, larger and

623
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,820
larger and and you open yourself
up to enormous flows of energy,

624
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,720
because I found that each step
into a deeper state of

625
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,340
consciousness was a step into a
higher level of energy. And to

626
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,880
stabilize consciousness at that
higher level, you have to

627
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,420
acclimate to the high level of
energy that's involved, which

628
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,080
requires intense, hard to
describe, but very intense

629
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:30,020
purification processes, which
often have the form of fire and

630
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,360
solar flares and volcanic just
tremendous fire energy to

631
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,180
transform your being, so that
you can become a being who can

632
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,260
live for hours at a time, at
that very, very deep level of

633
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,520
consciousness where the world
works at this level and causal

634
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,720
level reality, where it's a it's
a different physics. It's a

635
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,140
different landscape of
consciousness than lower levels

636
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,920
of consciousness, where you
have, you still have individual.

637
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,300
Beings doing individual things
and having individual

638
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,940
experiences. So when you open up
to these deep levels, and then

639
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,520
after it's over, you come back
into your ordinary

640
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,200
consciousness, I find that it's
really important to have a daily

641
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,920
spiritual practice to anchor
you, to help keep your feet

642
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:26,480
solid on the ground, and also
because the skills that are

643
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,440
acquired in a meditative
practice, in Vipassana practice

644
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,400
or zazen practice, are precisely
the kind of skills of

645
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,720
observations and non attachment,
which you also use in a

646
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,640
psychedelic session, so they
reinforce each other

647
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,020
structurally. But meditation
gives you an environment to

648
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,520
assess some of the content, the
cognitive content of your

649
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,560
temporary sessions, but also it
gives you an environment to

650
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:02,160
process the energy which is
ignited and set loose in your

651
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,480
psychedelic sessions. So that in
the chapter on Diamond

652
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,120
Luminosity, I talk about my work
on integrating Vajrayana

653
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,560
practice with my psychedelic
practice. And I actually didn't

654
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,540
begin the Vajrayana practice
until about the same time I was

655
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,560
entering the diamond Luminosity,
and it was Carol who brought me

656
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:30,500
into the vadrayana tradition,
because she did a vadna practice

657
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:36,020
Chud for me on before one of my
psychedelic sessions. And the

658
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,440
window that opened in that
session, this is the 45th

659
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,720
session. So I was had a lot of
history by that time, but the

660
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,160
window that opened was wider,
deeper, and it stayed open

661
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,540
longer that then had been the
case in earlier sessions. So I

662
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,660
immediately learned that
practice and began to do that

663
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,500
practice before any psychedelic
session. I would never go into

664
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,300
psychedelic space without doing
Chud, which is a cleansing it

665
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:09,300
means cutting. It's a cleansing
practice. And I found that when

666
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,560
I was working at these very,
very high energetic levels, it

667
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,160
sometimes set in motion
processes which are very

668
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,100
difficult to integrate processes
in my subtle energy system. If

669
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,640
you know Alex Gray's work, and
you you see how beautiful he

670
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,500
depicts the powerful energies
that are triggered in deep

671
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,220
psychedelic work. After the
session is over, they can leave

672
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:39,440
your system feeling quite achy
and sort of stretched. And I

673
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,880
found that doing Vajrayana
practice, doing the Guru Yoga

674
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,900
practices, or deity yoga
practices, gave that energy a

675
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,700
place to run when I was back in
my ordinary consciousness, back

676
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,540
in my ordinary body. So for lots
of reasons, both for

677
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,440
clarification of cognitive
content, for practicing the

678
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,060
teachings that are given to you
in your psychedelic sessions,

679
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,960
for managing the energetic
consequences of entering into

680
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,920
those states. I think a daily
spiritual practice is really

681
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,060
important. And I would mention
that before I go, would go into

682
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:23,180
a psychedelic space, I would
always you. I would change my

683
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:27,020
psychic my spiritual practice
for days and weeks before going

684
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,860
into the session, and then I
would do different practices

685
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,440
coming out of the session. I
would be doing kind of soul

686
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,000
integration practices after a
session, and more cutting

687
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,860
clearing practices before the
session. So there's a lot of

688
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,880
subtlety in in practices. And I
would do yoga, I would

689
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,020
basically, because I would want
my body to be as clear and as

690
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,960
possible for would come to these
states. And I would also, for

691
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,260
example, make sure I get a cut
right if I needed to. Because if

692
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,860
you're if your body is
misaligned structurally or

693
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:04,500
muscularly or emotionally,
that's and you amp your energy

694
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,800
up, then those blocks are going
to be amplified and become

695
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:14,460
problematic. So good personal
hygiene, good care of your body,

696
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:20,900
care of your of yoga, care of
your mind, meditation, before

697
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:26,780
and after. I think these are all
just good hygiene practices, and

698
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:32,000
so my what I do for my daily
practice has changed over time.

699
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,680
I've been a meditator for a long
time, worked in the Vajrayana

700
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:42,160
tradition for a long time.
Though, I do find that one of

701
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,640
the places, because I'm a
talker, because I'm an academic,

702
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,960
and because I like to explain
things I find teaching is

703
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,760
actually has become a spiritual
art form for me, because to

704
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,240
enter, to try to bring these
ideas, spiritual ideas. Make

705
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,480
them available to enter into
dialog with students day after

706
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:10,320
day, week after week. That
requires, or it invites, a kind

707
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:15,840
of a existential posture, a
spiritual posture. It's very

708
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,040
demanding kind of work if you're
really going to engage students

709
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,040
at this very deep, existential
level. So for me, teaching is is

710
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,900
its own form, a very demanding
form of spiritual practice.

711
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,200
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, thank you
for teaching and sharing with

712
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,500
all of us here. I may have asked
you in the interview we did,

713
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,680
Chris, I don't see any questions
at the moment coming through

714
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,020
quite the same way. And I know
this could be a long answer, but

715
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:47,740
if what, what is it that you
felt you learned from these

716
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:52,120
sessions? What is it that yeah,
that is so important that you

717
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,500
think our viewers and listeners
might benefit from Yeah?

718
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,840
Chris Bache: You know that that
is a large topic. And the

719
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:10,620
challenge of trying to answer
that question is doing justice

720
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,100
to how many layers of
consciousness I went through

721
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,660
over this 20 year journey. Many
of our important books on

722
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:24,620
psychedelics are based on a much
smaller number of sessions, and

723
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,560
that tends to create
expectations, which shrinks the

724
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:32,480
metaphysical window. So that
Aldous Huxley's book, The Doors

725
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,520
of Perception, he wrote after
only one session, one Mescaline

726
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,380
session, and Huston Smith's
book, cleansing the doors of

727
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,380
perception, where he gathered a
lifetime of writing on

728
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:49,240
psychedelics, he had only done
LSD six times. And after that,

729
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,360
he said the bombers increased,
and he decided to take Alan

730
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,320
Watts's advice, once you get the
message, hang up the phone. But

731
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,380
that suggests that the only kind
of one or small number of

732
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,240
messages that might show up,
which may be the case in a

733
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,920
couple of sessions. The
challenging trying to describe

734
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,520
what I learned from it is first
trying to describe the many

735
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,600
stages of initiation that took
place, going from personal to

736
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:25,700
collective, to increase to
subtler and causal levels of

737
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:32,900
reality and Non-duality. So a
reporter asked me that question

738
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,880
one time, and I I made a list of
the things which were the

739
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,520
highlighted, and I included it
in the in the last chapter of

740
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,640
the book. And I can't remember
all the things now, so I'll just

741
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:53,860
try to approximate my memory. I
discovered that underlying all

742
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:58,900
existence is a singular
intelligence of unbelievable

743
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:06,060
magnitude, of genius
unbelievable intelligence, and

744
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,200
that the physical universe is
the manifest body of this

745
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,880
genius, of this creative
intelligence, so that the world

746
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,660
that we're living in is the
physical body of the Divine. And

747
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:22,880
nothing I'm going to say here is
new. It's the cosmology that

748
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,420
emerges in psychedelics is
essentially the same cosmology

749
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,500
that emerges in the great
mystical traditions of classical

750
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,280
contemplative cultures. So
there's nothing new. It's just a

751
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,200
different technique, a different
trigger protocol for accessing

752
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,640
some of these dimensions of
consciousness, so that all

753
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,960
existence is unified in a
fundamental one. Oneness is kind

754
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,920
of the one of the core teachings
that emerges over and over

755
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,620
again. You can enter into
oneness so deeply that you enter

756
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,480
into a condition that the
Buddhas call Shunyata emptiness

757
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,240
of self, or anata Nirvana, the
self is blown out. And when you

758
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,280
are empty of self deeply, you
experience the entire world is

759
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,360
also empty of cells. And if you
experience the world as

760
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:20,900
completely empty of separate
individual existences, then

761
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:25,760
within a differentiation of a
physical universe, the entire

762
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,380
universe lives and breathes us,
one, as Plotinus said, so just

763
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:34,280
and you can enter the
opportunity to enter into

764
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,300
intimacy with this
consciousness, to meet it on

765
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,340
these special days, and to be
engaged by this consciousness

766
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,720
and go deeper and deeper and
deeper into this consciousness.

767
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,260
And so I'll mention, in this
context, I knit, I didn't have

768
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:54,580
much contact with individual
spirit guides or individual

769
00:54:54,580 --> 00:55:00,900
deities or individual forms. My
it's. Not that I don't think

770
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,160
these things exist. It's just
hasn't been my experience, and I

771
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,100
think it's partly because of the
protocol I used, and because of

772
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,660
the qualities of LSD as the
psychedelic that it was grinding

773
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:18,000
me up so fine and spreading my
dust so deeply into these layers

774
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:26,360
of reality that transcend
individual life beings, so that

775
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,460
I had many experiences of being
at different levels, but not

776
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:36,740
many experiences of individual
beings. So part of it is just

777
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,100
the loving, the communion that
this intelligence is just

778
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:49,120
extraordinary and also this
oneness, this being is loving

779
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:54,220
beyond measure. When I have been
tapped into the love that this

780
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,300
being that brought this being to
create and share its existence

781
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:02,040
in this form, the love is
overwhelming, and that really

782
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:06,000
surprised me, because I was
okay. I was expecting, you know,

783
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,800
the creative intelligence to be
intelligent, but I was surprised

784
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,320
by how much love was present.
And so when people talk about

785
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,960
love is the primary virtue, I
mean, I understand that. I mean

786
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,220
that really does. I all learned
that our participation in

787
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:30,080
creation is taking place over
hundreds of 1000s of years,

788
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,040
hundreds of 1000s of years. We
that reincarnation is a simple

789
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:38,840
fact of life, and that because
reincarnation is a fact of life,

790
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,820
we are not time limited in our
development, we have to have an

791
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,860
understanding. Our spiritual
understanding should recognize

792
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,400
that it's not what happens in
any one particular life which is

793
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,480
paramount, and it's not over at
the end of any one life, but

794
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,320
it's an ongoing progression that
takes us back and forth between

795
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,560
spirit and matter over and over
again, over and over again, in

796
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,460
an evolutionary exercise that
isn't, I don't think it doesn't

797
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,180
culminate in enlightenment. Even
the classic vision is you get

798
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,660
better and better and clearer
and clearer until eventually you

799
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,900
achieve realization, you achieve
enlightenment. And once you

800
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:23,300
achieve enlightenment, you can
leave, you transcend Samsara,

801
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,780
the cycles of existence, you can
permanently go to some off

802
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:31,700
planet, spiritual paradise. But
I don't think that's my least

803
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:37,820
what I've been shown and told is
that's not really the project at

804
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,780
that's an understandable
interpretation from our early

805
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,980
experience, when we first made
contact, several 1000 years ago,

806
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,760
with this profound mother
universe, with the spiritual

807
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,720
mother universe. It's an
understandable Kant In

808
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,700
conclusion, because this
universe is so beautiful and so

809
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,800
ecstatic and and it feels so
much like home. Naturally. We

810
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,160
think that we want to be there.
We belong there. We came from

811
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,920
there, and it leads to the
religions of return, so that

812
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,760
it's all about transcending the
limits of human condition and

813
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,240
returning to where we came from,
where we belong, which generates

814
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,720
up and out cosmology. And I
think that's a reflection not of

815
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,140
the way the world is, but of our
early understanding of the

816
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,140
world, which is now deepening.
Now that we have a better

817
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,340
understanding of how huge the
universe is and how long it's

818
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,940
been in existence, then we if
you really want to understand

819
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:42,700
life, you have to begin to think
like God. You have to think like

820
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,420
a galaxy and understand that the
creative intelligence thinks in

821
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,900
terms of billions and billions
of years. It doesn't think in

822
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,920
terms of individuals so much as
it thinks of whole species,

823
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,660
whole planetary systems,
galactic systems. And we have to

824
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:03,360
allow ourselves to expand to
understand what is our role in

825
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,140
such a universe, and
reincarnation allows us to do

826
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,460
that. Reincarnation helps us
understand not only the tensions

827
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,760
that are woven into the body
that we have and the mind that

828
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,960
we have, but it also weaves us.
It gives us an invitation to

829
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,320
participate more fully into the
divine project, so that the goal

830
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,580
becomes to achieve realization,
to achieve some deep

831
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:33,860
experiential grounding of our of
understanding, our experience of

832
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:38,780
our true essential nature, which
is underneath our personality

833
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:43,960
nature. But then once we have
that, once we understand that,

834
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:48,220
once we understand that every
living thing is grounded in that

835
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:52,600
same reality, that the essence
of my individuality is the same

836
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,020
as the essence of everybody
else's individuality, we're all

837
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:00,840
in this together. Then the goal
becomes, I think. To

838
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:05,280
progressively integrate more and
more and more spiritual reality

839
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,960
into our physical incarnation,
so that we can truly bring

840
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,620
heaven to earth, that we can
truly transform our physical

841
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:18,660
world into a paradise, and not
in a metaphorical sense, but I

842
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:23,840
mean in a literal sense, that we
eventually will become a species

843
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,980
of awakened beings, a species of
enlightened beings, a species of

844
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:33,140
saved beings, and a species of
enlightened beings creates a

845
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:38,960
different earth than a species
of unenlightened beings. So the

846
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,700
size of the project, the
communion, the opportunity to

847
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,900
enter into communion with the
project. Reincarnation is true.

848
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,820
Reincarnation leads to a
different story, a different

849
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:55,360
anthropology, if you will, of
the whole creative endeavor.

850
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:00,780
Those are, I guess, some of the
highlights of the large ideas

851
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:06,960
that stand out. And as I said,
they're not new. These are all

852
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,660
well established in our classic
mystical

853
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:13,260
Emmy Vadnais: traditions, and
yet we seem to need to continue

854
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,860
to hear them over and over and
over again. We do. Some of us,

855
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,000
apparently need to.

856
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,080
Jeffrey Mishlove: I think it may
feel like I need to

857
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,880
Chris Bache: me too, you know?
And I think one of the

858
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,660
differences, it's sometimes said
that the age of individual

859
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,740
enlightenment is over now, it's
collective enlightenment that is

860
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,520
a challenge we face because and
I think that's really true. And

861
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,400
the 2000 or so years of
individual enlightenment or

862
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:47,680
individual salvation, perfectly
well understandable. But now, if

863
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,580
we don't, if the whole species
doesn't awaken, we likely won't

864
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:55,060
be able to survive on this
planet. We have to grow up. We

865
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:58,660
have to stop being egoic
children, and we have to grow up

866
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:03,000
into our soul consciousness in
our deeper spiritual nature,

867
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,340
otherwise we're going to lose
the planet.

868
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,260
Jeffrey Mishlove: I have a
question from Pablo geralda,

869
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:16,740
who's one of our volunteers.
Pablo is in Argentina, and he

870
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:20,420
asks you, Chris, if you have
advice for somebody who wants to

871
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:25,640
try psychedelics for the first
time, and what are are there

872
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:30,200
legal ways to do it? He's
asking. And another viewer,

873
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:34,820
Gracie slick, raises the
question, how do you acquire

874
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:39,980
LSD? To my knowledge, it's
illegal everywhere in the United

875
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:44,560
States. And so then there's a
question of, obviously, there is

876
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:49,720
a market for it, but the
question is, how do you know

877
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,860
what you're getting

878
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:55,420
Chris Bache: absolutely first,
and I do not want to encourage

879
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:59,320
people to break the law. I mean,
it's just a speaks, be careful

880
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,820
here. This is, that I would not
want anyone to break the law and

881
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:07,380
get in trouble doing something
like this. There are people who

882
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,280
want to work with Ayahuasca, and
they will go to Peru or to

883
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,500
Brazil to work with in Ayahuasca
communities and sante Daime or

884
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,320
union de vegetal, there are
Ayahuasca communities in the

885
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:27,260
United States now which have won
the right to use Ayahuasca in

886
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,560
spiritual context. They've won
the right from the Supreme Court

887
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:35,780
to do this. They are not
plentiful, but they are here

888
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:42,880
among the psychedelics. Ketamine
is the only one that's legal

889
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:49,120
right now. The MDMA, which is an
empathogen, more than a strict

890
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,140
psychedelic, but it's important
therapeutic instrument, got

891
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:58,600
turned down just last year, but
it'll be here. It'll be coming

892
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,280
back. It will be made legal,
probably within three years,

893
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:09,180
Psilocybin won't be far behind.
So what's legal now and what's

894
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,540
legal in 10 years will be very
different even five years. So

895
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,540
the number of psychedelics that
one might be able to use is

896
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:20,540
increasing in the years to come.
How do you know whether what

897
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:24,080
you've gotten is pure, and
that's really an important

898
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,280
issue, because you do not want
street drugs are filled with all

899
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,100
sorts of contaminants that you
do not want to put into your

900
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:36,260
system. And you can send these
to labs sponsored by the federal

901
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:40,400
government. You can send them
anonymously to be tested, and

902
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,500
you'll be told what's in them.
And so you can check and verify

903
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,560
at the state level or the
federal level what it is that

904
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:52,240
you've got here, what you're
taking and how strong it is. So

905
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,000
yeah, and

906
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,760
Emmy Vadnais: as far as
procuring it, no comment or

907
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,260
that's up to each person to you.
Find a path themselves.

908
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:06,780
Chris Bache: Maybe, yeah, no
comment, because there you can

909
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:09,960
grow mushrooms. You can learn
how to grow mushrooms. I mean,

910
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:15,900
you can create your own
Psilocybin mushrooms. And there

911
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,380
is, of course, a clear
underground throughout the

912
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:24,680
country, which some of them is
some of many, much of it is very

913
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,280
irresponsible in terms of
impurities, and some of the

914
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:34,460
people are very conscientious
about this. But still, you have

915
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,780
to proceed with caution and
always test what you have. Yeah,

916
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:39,020
great.

917
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:47,200
Emmy Vadnais: Here's a question
from first Deacon Gemini. They

918
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,900
ask, what is the difference
between ego death and

919
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:55,060
disassociation or de realization
both entail detachment and

920
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:58,420
depending on the person, it can
feel good, bad or neutral?

921
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,780
Chris Bache: Yeah. Well, I'm not
a psychologist, so take what I

922
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:08,940
say, de realization with a grain
of salt here. I understand that

923
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:14,520
to be a psychological experience
or condition in which you feel

924
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:21,260
yourself to be dissolving or not
grounded in your real or

925
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:27,320
conventional identity, and it is
some it's often associated with

926
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,980
various forms of
psychopathology, because if it

927
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:35,420
becomes endemic, it undermines
your capacity to function as a

928
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:40,660
strong individual within the
World. Ego Death is sort of

929
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:47,980
similar to that, but different.
It's sometimes said you have to

930
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:52,300
have a strong ego for to go
through ego death to have a good

931
01:06:52,300 --> 01:07:02,940
ego death. Ego Death is
basically, let me back up, if

932
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:06,840
you are grounded in the way most
people are, in our bodily

933
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,420
consciousness, and a
consciousness which basically

934
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:14,520
reflects the history of this
body in this time reality, if

935
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:20,300
you begin to open up into deeper
spiritual realities, then sooner

936
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:25,160
or later, you have to let go of
your egoic identity, your body

937
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:29,120
mind identity, to begin to have
access to these deeper, broader

938
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:34,340
states where the ego doesn't
have a function. In mystical

939
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:37,700
traditions, in classic
contemplative traditions, the

940
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:41,560
death of self is well known and
recognized. It's usually

941
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:47,200
achieved through a lifestyle of
compassion, lifestyle of

942
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,480
service, a lifestyle of
generosity, prayer, practicing,

943
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:57,280
spiritual practice,
contemplative practice. It's a

944
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,620
slow, gradual softening of the
heart and then opening up to

945
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:07,020
kind of an infusion of divine
flux, which is always there.

946
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:11,220
It's always pressing it upon us.
We just the ego keeps it out. So

947
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,400
if you kind of sacrifice the ego
and take it apart through

948
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:20,480
generosity, selflessness, acts
of prayer, you're making a

949
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,740
transition from a consciousness
which is time, space, grounded,

950
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,920
bodily, grounded into a
consciousness which is more

951
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:32,000
mystical, more open. What
happens in a psychedelic session

952
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:37,700
is the same process, but it's
accelerated and intensified. If

953
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,380
I'm thinking now, I'm a
professor of religious studies,

954
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,740
so I've always held the
spiritual traditions in the back

955
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:49,000
of my mind while I'm doing
psychedelic work. And to me,

956
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:53,800
I've always approached
psychedelic work as a spiritual

957
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:57,220
practice, even though the goal
of my work was kind of

958
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:01,200
different. It wasn't awakening
so much as it was cosmological

959
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,920
exploration, but basically
taking the lessons that we've

960
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:09,360
learned about how to become a
more spiritually attuned person

961
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:12,900
from the spiritual traditions,
and taking that into the

962
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:17,160
psychedelic context. And in the
psychedelic context where you

963
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:21,860
are very powerfully activating
deeper levels of awareness,

964
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:26,420
which open up the floodgates, in
a way, to this deeper spiritual

965
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:34,160
reality. You reach a point where
the ego is put under pressure

966
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:39,980
and it just it just ruptures.
You can't contain consciousness

967
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:43,660
within the structure of your
ego. And when you get a lot of

968
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:48,520
people, a lot of psychologists,
a lot of exercise, a lot of ink

969
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:52,000
and sweat over the complexity
and strength and durability of

970
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,420
the ego, but from a spiritual
perspective, when you get right

971
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:59,740
down to it, it's not that hard
to take it apart. You really

972
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:04,140
can. Just break it apart, and
when I went through my major ego

973
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:08,400
death experience, the universe
just snapped me like a twig. It

974
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,720
didn't involve de realization,
but it involved a frightening

975
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:18,120
confrontation, because I was
turned into something which was

976
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,620
the exact opposite of everything
I had always known myself to be.

977
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:27,260
I had always known myself to be
a man, to be an intellectual, to

978
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:31,160
be white, to be passionately
concerned with the meaning of

979
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,820
existence. In this critical
session, I was turned into the

980
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,060
opposite of this. I was turned
into women. I was turned into

981
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:42,280
women of color, women who had no
philosophical expectations or

982
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:46,900
interests at all, and it was the
perfect health for male academic

983
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:52,000
philosopher. It scared the
bajibas out of me. And then when

984
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,960
I let go and I allowed myself to
become these women, then first,

985
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:03,120
I was immediately relaxed, and I
was taken under the arm of the

986
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,860
Great Mother and taken into an
extraordinary journey into the

987
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:12,420
lives of women, into hundreds
and hundreds of women. And then

988
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:15,480
after the session was over, as I
was coming back, my male

989
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,800
identity reasserted itself, and
because I like being a man, but

990
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:24,860
I knew that my masculinity and
my whiteness and my intellectual

991
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,480
would never confine me the way
it had confined me before. The

992
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:34,040
problem wasn't of women, of
course, or the anti the non

993
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:40,300
intellectual issues. The problem
was the tight fit that my social

994
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:43,300
identity had on my
consciousness, and that had to

995
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:46,660
be broken. It was as if the
universe was saying to me,

996
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:51,520
listen, where you're going.
Gender does not exist. Let go.

997
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:55,720
And that's when I let go, and I
went into states of

998
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,540
consciousness that don't
differentiate between male and

999
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,500
female, and then eventually
going into states of

1000
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,140
consciousness which don't
differentiate between human and

1001
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,500
non human, right? And then going
into states of consciousness

1002
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,960
which go beyond space and time
entirely. So ego death is just

1003
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,760
that, that kind of rupture which
can be slow or fast, depending

1004
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:24,800
on what method you're using to
let go of your preoccupation

1005
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,740
with self, you know. The
Tibetans call it self clinging,

1006
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,860
you know. And we can see self
clinging when you look at a

1007
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:35,360
picture, the group picture, like
a class picture, and where does

1008
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:39,140
your eye go? Your eye kind of
goes quick to where you are in

1009
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:43,000
the picture. That's a symptom of
self clinging. It's that

1010
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,980
constant self referencing into
your own life experience, which

1011
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:52,240
is understandable from one
perspective, but so sad from

1012
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:58,780
another perspective, right? So
it's like if, if you take it, if

1013
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:02,340
you think of the ego like an ice
cube, and you put an ice cube

1014
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:07,140
next to a candle, it melts very
slowly, it drips and melts down.

1015
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,020
And I think this is like what
happens in contemplative

1016
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:14,040
practice, where you melt this
ego slowly. But if you take the

1017
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,520
same ice cube and you throw it
on a hot iron, cast iron

1018
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,560
skillet, it jumps around and it
melts faster, but it explodes

1019
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,160
and bounces all over the place,
and I think that's kind of like

1020
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:29,960
how Ego Death manifests itself
in psychedelic sessions. So

1021
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:34,220
there's not a right way or a
wrong way, but the pattern is

1022
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:40,960
that we'd have to let go of the
confines of these bars that keep

1023
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,560
us imprisoned in our self
referential existence.

1024
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:52,060
Emmy Vadnais: And do you feel
that the ego serves any purpose,

1025
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:56,380
since we all seem to have it, or
is it just something to be

1026
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,440
dissolved or eliminated or
accepted and then transformed,

1027
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,300
or however, Yeah, that happens.

1028
01:14:03,299 --> 01:14:06,719
Chris Bache: No, I think ego
gets a bad rap in many spiritual

1029
01:14:06,959 --> 01:14:11,159
traditions. And I think the ego,
and by that, I mean our

1030
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:16,319
individual identity, our
individual body, mind identity.

1031
01:14:17,339 --> 01:14:21,139
It's a beautiful thing. It's
really It's magnificent. And I

1032
01:14:21,139 --> 01:14:24,319
think it's a cosmologically
important thing. I think it's

1033
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:28,219
one of the major gifts that we
are given by entering into time

1034
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:33,379
space. Now, a number of
spiritual traditions, again, in

1035
01:14:33,379 --> 01:14:36,979
the kind of the classic schools,
they say, well, the goal is to

1036
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:41,439
destroy ego, lose ego, and to
return to God. So it's like a

1037
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:44,859
drop of water that returns to
the ocean. When the drop goes

1038
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:49,059
back to the ocean, it doesn't
exist anymore. And that's the

1039
01:14:49,059 --> 01:14:53,799
Vedanta picture, is you
basically eliminate ego so that

1040
01:14:53,799 --> 01:14:57,279
you can live the life divine,
but you just live the life

1041
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:00,479
divine, no longer as an
individual. You just. Surrender

1042
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,559
completely and become the
divine. And I don't think that's

1043
01:15:04,559 --> 01:15:11,999
an adequate cosmology. I think
that, I think that the creative

1044
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:16,019
intelligence has created a
system which, first of all, we

1045
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:21,259
have a life as individual, as an
individual, and we we explore

1046
01:15:21,259 --> 01:15:25,219
and deepen and expand this
individual experience lifetime

1047
01:15:25,219 --> 01:15:29,239
after lifetime after lifetime.
And the goal is not to

1048
01:15:29,839 --> 01:15:34,819
completely abandon our
individuality, but the goal is

1049
01:15:34,879 --> 01:15:42,579
to is to engage what is left out
of the individual ego's

1050
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:46,299
experience to engage the
tremendous power of

1051
01:15:46,299 --> 01:15:49,119
consciousness, the love that
runs through existence, the

1052
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,899
intelligence that runs through
existence, so that you are both

1053
01:15:52,899 --> 01:15:57,699
an individual, but you are all
now transparent to The Divine

1054
01:15:57,699 --> 01:16:03,119
condition. I don't think
individuality is destroyed when

1055
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:07,319
you go deeper and deeper. I
think it's actually transformed.

1056
01:16:07,799 --> 01:16:11,339
And I think individuality is
truly one of the great gifts of

1057
01:16:11,339 --> 01:16:14,579
the mother. It's one of the
great gifts of time, space,

1058
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:19,979
existence. And I think if you
study the biographies of the

1059
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:23,479
autobiographies are biographies
of great spiritual adepts, of

1060
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:26,239
great masters. You find that
they are individual. You know

1061
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,359
they're they're quite
distinctive individual. So

1062
01:16:29,599 --> 01:16:35,359
enlightenment is about anata, no
self, but it doesn't mean that

1063
01:16:35,419 --> 01:16:39,199
your individuality is shattered
irrevocably and doesn't come

1064
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:42,459
back. If that's happening, then
that's a kind of a form of

1065
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:47,019
psychopathology, even spiritual
pathology. I think healthy

1066
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:51,519
spiritual maturity is you have
individual experience. You have

1067
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:55,299
your individual reference point,
but you're not imprisoned within

1068
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:58,719
that reference point. You build
bridges, you you connect and

1069
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:03,479
receive this. You you you care
about more than just yourself,

1070
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:06,119
you care about more than just
your species. You care about

1071
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:10,319
more than just your generation,
and you live large. You're an

1072
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:13,379
individual, but you're living a
much larger life.

1073
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,660
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, you know,
you recognize the

1074
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:20,040
interconnectedness, and perhaps
can merge with that, and that

1075
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,960
really seems to be a definition
of yoga is union with the

1076
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:24,980
divine, perhaps,

1077
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,400
Chris Bache: yes, yeah, union
with the Divine and not

1078
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,900
dissolving irrevocably so that
you don't have an individual

1079
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,640
awareness or individuality.

1080
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:39,140
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah. Thank you
for all of these answers. Chris

1081
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,680
and we just want to let our
viewers and listeners know that

1082
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:46,840
we are over 60 minutes in. We've
got about 25 minutes left of the

1083
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,680
live stream.

1084
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,700
Jeffrey Mishlove: Here's a
question from a viewer whose

1085
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:57,880
YouTube name is Fabius, who
says, How can we reconcile the

1086
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:04,440
ideal of transforming Earth into
a paradise with the spiritual

1087
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:08,400
necessity of contrast and
suffering as essential

1088
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,900
conditions for learning and
growth in the human experience.

1089
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:16,140
Chris Bache: Great question,
good question. Now that the

1090
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:20,100
question of suffering is a
profound question, and that we

1091
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:24,020
could take the whole program
just to explore that particular

1092
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:28,640
topic. I mean, if there is, if
the creative intelligence is an

1093
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,600
intelligence and it's loving,
how could we, how could it

1094
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:36,500
possibly have tolerated, let
alone manifested, a world which

1095
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:41,140
is so painful, which which is,
which terrible things happen at

1096
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:47,920
a very organic level, let alone
a social level. And I think in

1097
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,240
order, in order to really
understand and to even have an

1098
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:58,540
attempt to comprehend suffering,
we have to develop a very long

1099
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:03,300
time horizon. We have to look
deep into the workings of the

1100
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:08,400
universe, and we have to sort of
adopt a galactic perspective.

1101
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:13,860
And I think this is important to
understand that the human

1102
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:18,480
species is a radically
unfinished species. It's a very

1103
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,640
incomplete species. And so if
you think of all, how young are

1104
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:29,660
we? I mean, are we kind of like
one to 100 are we 95% finished?

1105
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:34,220
Are we 5% finished? You know?
And I think we're maybe more

1106
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:38,900
like five or 10% finished. We
just woke up. I mean, 5000 4000

1107
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:42,160
years ago, we just woke up to
this underlying level of

1108
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,980
consciousness that we've begun
to recognize in the true

1109
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:49,180
religious traditions. This
universe has been building this

1110
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:54,160
world for 3.7 billion years, and
we're just waking up in this

1111
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,360
universe and just coming to
understand and to engage in it

1112
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,980
consciously, rather than un.
Unconsciously, and the

1113
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:06,720
capacities that we see in the
highest, most spiritually

1114
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:11,700
realized individuals, the
capacity of not only compassion,

1115
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:16,200
but the capacity to have control
over their own physical process,

1116
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:21,140
and even the capacity to have to
change matter around them to

1117
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:24,140
manipulate matter, as some of
the great mahasiddhas have the

1118
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:29,000
capacity to do. We see in those
beings, the symptoms or the

1119
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,340
qualities that are emerging are
emergent qualities in spirit in

1120
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:38,960
beings who are integrating more
and more spiritual capacity

1121
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,480
inside this physical body. So if
we look to the future and we

1122
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,280
ask, what is what are we
becoming? What is the project?

1123
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:52,060
The project is not human beings
as they exist in the 21st

1124
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,600
Century. The project is how
human beings will exist in the

1125
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:01,740
23rd 25th 3/30, century, 40th
century. And in that context,

1126
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:12,480
suffering? Yeah, I don't want
to. I don't want to. A lot of

1127
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,820
people who are listening, who
are watching, have suffered

1128
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:18,600
greatly in their life. We've all
suffered, and some of us have

1129
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,860
suffered deeply and profoundly
in our life, and I do not mean

1130
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:25,460
to make light of that in any
way, in anything that I would

1131
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:31,460
say, but suffering is part of
the crucible within which we are

1132
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:37,700
learning and on this planet. And
suffering has individual roots,

1133
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:41,800
sometimes in our individual
karma. Of the past, bad choices

1134
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,940
we've made. But suffering also
has collective roots. Sometimes

1135
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:49,420
the suffering that we engage in
this life is not because of

1136
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:52,660
anything that we've done
personally, but it's because of

1137
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:55,900
where the collective is, where
the herd is. It's a suffering

1138
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:59,740
which is generated by a common
denominator of the of the

1139
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:06,540
learning of the human species.
We are just in the early stages

1140
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:12,060
of really understanding the full
power of our nature, of our true

1141
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:17,400
and essential nature. And the
goal of this access to this deep

1142
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,920
nature is not simply to be happy
and to be relaxed and to be

1143
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:27,200
comfortable, but it's literally
to transform our experience of

1144
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:32,060
being an incarnation of
spiritual being, so that the

1145
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:36,920
goal is to increasingly change
the conditions of our life, so

1146
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:42,880
that we are literally living not
only a spiritually relaxed and

1147
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:48,280
comfortable and good existence,
but that we are able we are

1148
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,220
gradually changing the
conditions of our physical

1149
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:57,220
existence. I think they'll in
the future, we will see we will

1150
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:01,680
have more control over our
body's diseases and more ability

1151
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,460
to intervene in the diseases of
the body and to produce a

1152
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:09,840
healthier and healthier body. I
think we'll be seeing all sorts

1153
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,620
of traits that we consider
miraculous becoming increasingly

1154
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:19,560
natural and manifest. And I
think when we come to this

1155
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,400
pivot, when we go through the
pivot that I think we're coming

1156
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,760
into. You know, I have a chapter
in the book on the birth of the

1157
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,900
future human I think we have
entered a really critical pivot

1158
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:34,460
point in the human story. We are
being taken into the next level

1159
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:41,620
of our human evolution. I think
we will see a significant

1160
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:46,540
amelioration of our collective
suffering. As we make this

1161
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:52,060
transition, I think we are going
towards a period where

1162
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:58,540
individually and collectively, a
world of less suffering, a world

1163
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:03,420
of greater joy, a world of
greater spiritual empowerment

1164
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:08,580
and physical ease as we go
forward and as we go through

1165
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:12,780
this transition, this is just
the next iteration of an

1166
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:16,380
evolutionary story which has
been going on for hundreds,

1167
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,920
millions of years, millions of
years, and will continue to go

1168
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,380
on for millions, billions of
years, four. So in order to

1169
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:28,400
understand why we suffer, we
have to, if we really want to

1170
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,180
understand, we have to go very,
very deep. We have to go deep

1171
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:35,780
into the divine intention. We
have to go deep and open up a

1172
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:39,200
very, very large vision of
history, even if we're going to

1173
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,780
begin to have a chance of
understanding why existence is

1174
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,260
so hard.

1175
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:49,900
Jeffrey Mishlove: Well, if I
could follow up with a related

1176
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:54,520
question, the previous question
was sort of the paradox of the

1177
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:59,920
necessity of suffering and as
compared to the goal of a.

1178
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,220
Establishing more of a paradise
on earth. Another paradox, to me

1179
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:09,780
seems to be the idea that you've
expressed, that consciousness is

1180
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:15,120
fundamental, it's primary, it's
it's the foundation of all

1181
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:22,040
existence, yeah, and yet it's
through a chemical substance

1182
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:26,120
that you got there, which would
lead a lot of materialists to

1183
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:31,760
say, see, it's consciousness is
nothing more than a product of

1184
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,740
chemistry. Yeah.

1185
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,620
Chris Bache: And the same thing
happens if you just sit on a

1186
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:40,460
meditation cushion for long
periods of time and become an

1187
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:45,340
increasingly proficient, and in
that form, we can now monitor

1188
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,920
the brain wave patterns, and we
can even explore the

1189
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,860
biochemistry of meditative
states of consciousness. And we

1190
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,340
can say the same thing. See,
it's biochemistry and

1191
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:58,000
electrical, you know, wave forms
in the brain which are actually

1192
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,180
inducing this. But that really
kind of doesn't really solve the

1193
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:08,520
problem, does it? Because it
that that is the application of

1194
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,300
a particular metaphysical
worldview of materialism. And

1195
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:16,560
there, if we want to probe that
worldview, we can find lots of

1196
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,680
counter evidence that will
demonstrate that that's an

1197
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,360
inadequate worldview. It was an
adequate worldview in the 18th,

1198
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,320
19th century, when we got into
it. But it's not an adequate

1199
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,620
worldview to handle the wide
range of experiences that occur

1200
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:33,800
in lots of different contexts.
Parapsychological research,

1201
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,620
psychedelic research, different
you know, near death, Episode

1202
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:40,460
research, reincarnation
research, all of that undermine

1203
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,100
if you're really paying
attention the the plausibility

1204
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:48,940
of the Metaphysic of the
metaphysics of materialism. So

1205
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:53,260
but it is an ironic thing that
we have this chemical substance

1206
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:58,840
which interacts with our body in
a way that seems to open us to

1207
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:04,140
it opens the floodgates of our
Well, see, I tend to think of

1208
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:08,280
the mind as kind of more like a
transceiver. It is a gate

1209
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:14,040
controller, and so it changes
the gate structure. It kind of

1210
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:19,500
puts our default mode network
and allow into quiescence, and

1211
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:23,300
it allows us to temporarily have
states of awareness that go

1212
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:32,480
beyond the default mode network.
But it we that kind of mechanism

1213
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:36,860
is subject to different
interpretations, if we apply a

1214
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:43,540
materialist interpretation, or
if we bring to it a non

1215
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:47,800
materialist, spiritual
perspective in which we can

1216
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:51,280
understand human existence. The
way I understand the human being

1217
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,340
is that we are living at a
synthesis. We are a synthesis of

1218
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:58,960
two different systems to be very
simply, between a spiritual

1219
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,960
reality and a physical reality.
They are always intertwined. We

1220
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,640
are. We are living them
continuously. If we survive the

1221
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:11,700
destruction of our body, it's
not because of something that

1222
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,760
happens to us when we die. It's
because of something that we

1223
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:19,440
already are. We already are
living with one foot in two

1224
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,780
worlds, and we know that if we
shift the balance, we can open

1225
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:27,560
ourselves to that spiritual
dimension without leaving our

1226
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:31,580
physical body. And we can do it
through any number of different

1227
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:35,540
contemplative practices and
yogic practices. We can also do

1228
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:41,500
it using Soma, using some of the
ancient sacred medicines in the

1229
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:45,340
tradition that doesn't prove
materialism, it just proves,

1230
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:49,360
again, if we start with a model
that we are a synthesis of two

1231
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:53,860
metaphysical systems, then we
can explain all the phenomena

1232
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,820
and more of the phenomena than
materialism can explain.

1233
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:03,540
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, here's a
question from my husband,

1234
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:08,160
Xander, and as humans, we have a
sensory system and a motor

1235
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,560
system through which you
mentioned it with the brain,

1236
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,560
that's the central nervous
system, and some refer to that

1237
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,280
as being a filter of
consciousness. And he asks, If

1238
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,680
you had synesthetic experiences,
what sense our senses were most

1239
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:26,960
active, so synesthesia, where
maybe you like hear smells, or,

1240
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:29,240
yeah, based vision, or

1241
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,140
Chris Bache: no, I'm not in a
good position to answer that

1242
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:38,300
question. I'm afraid Xander, I
just because those kind of

1243
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:42,580
experiences are not, are not, do
not figure largely in my

1244
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:45,640
experience. So I haven't thought
about them a lot. I haven't

1245
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:51,940
studied them very much. I don't
when I've taken psychedelics, I

1246
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:55,240
don't hallucinate on them. I
mean, I'm always wrapped up with

1247
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:58,480
eye shades and whatnot. But even
when I've taken the eye shades

1248
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:03,000
off, I don't. Have visual
distortions in my world around

1249
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,140
me. If I had stayed in touch
with physical reality, I'm sure

1250
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,840
I would have, and then I might
have had some of the experiences

1251
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:14,760
you're referring to. But if you
internalize your experience

1252
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:20,660
completely, you engage conscious
reality, and then you're on a

1253
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:25,400
conscious experience. And I see
many things, and I experience

1254
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,120
many things, but I don't
experience them as kind of a

1255
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:34,580
permutation or distortion of my
physical sensation. It's kind of

1256
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:39,620
like I just let go of physical
sensation and I just plunge into

1257
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:45,460
the conscious, the tunnel of
consciousness, and go there. Now

1258
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:48,760
I'm sure there's a good answer
to your question, and I'm sure

1259
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:52,600
people, maybe even people on
this podcast right now, who

1260
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,600
would be able to give you a good
answer to that question. I'm

1261
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,100
just afraid I'm not one of them.

1262
01:30:57,519 --> 01:31:00,359
Emmy Vadnais: Well, I think he's
had those experiences, and

1263
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:03,899
that's why he was curious if
that's something you you had

1264
01:31:03,899 --> 01:31:05,159
also experienced.

1265
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:10,020
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah. The
permeability between our senses

1266
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,140
shows up in several different
contexts. I know it shows up in

1267
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:19,200
shamanic drumming, for example.
The different fluidity there we

1268
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,720
are such a complex being this
blending of spirit and matter,

1269
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:27,800
it shows up at very broad
levels, and it shows up at very

1270
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,720
micro levels in our sensation.

1271
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,240
Jeffrey Mishlove: Here's a
question from a viewer named

1272
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:40,340
Corey Burdick, who asks, what
are some of the most powerful or

1273
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:45,400
inspiring examples of the
emergence of the new human.

1274
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:56,800
Chris Bache: Well, I think when
we see somebody who's willing to

1275
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,440
lay down his life for others,
that's an extraordinary example

1276
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:06,480
when we see people who spend
their entire life working to

1277
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:11,820
help other people, and they they
they bypass putting their energy

1278
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:15,600
towards enhancing their life,
and they invest all their energy

1279
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:20,220
in helping other people live a
full, enriched life. Those are

1280
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:24,500
symptoms of the of the future
human, the way I understand the

1281
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:28,580
future human, I'll step aside
for just a second and come back

1282
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:34,520
to the focus. We've been
incarnating for 1000s and 1000s,

1283
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:39,140
hundreds of 1000s of years.
We've been incarnating and the

1284
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:42,220
pattern in our religious
structures have sort of seen a

1285
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:45,400
linear development in our
reincarnation. We go backwards,

1286
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,360
you go forward. But basically
making a linear development, it

1287
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,600
in so that we become eventually
more compassionate, more

1288
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:57,940
intelligent, more creative, so
on so forth. But I think at

1289
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:01,920
least as it's as it's been shown
to me, and as I've been taken

1290
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:06,660
into it, I think we are coming
to a time of history in general,

1291
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:12,420
and people individually where,
well, let me just say how it

1292
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,360
happened to me. I reached a
point in one of my sessions when

1293
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:19,800
all of my former lives started
coming into me, and I had done

1294
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,760
years of past life, therapy
work, so I was familiar with

1295
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:26,000
some of my former lives, but
they began to come into me. I

1296
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,780
could feel them entering me. And
it was like wrapping a filament

1297
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:35,060
of white light around a kite
spool. And after a certain

1298
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:40,900
period, they seemed to fuse. And
when they fuse, there was a

1299
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:45,580
tremendous explosion of energy,
and I was catapulted into a

1300
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:50,680
state of consciousness in which
I was an individual, but I was

1301
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,500
an individual beyond any frame
of reference that I had known

1302
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:58,300
before. And this is what I came
to call the birth of the diamond

1303
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:03,000
soul, or the birth of the soul.
And then I was given a series of

1304
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,060
teachings that was explaining
what happened, what was

1305
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:10,020
happening. And I think I was
being shown that this is what

1306
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:14,160
happens to a species that
reincarnates. As we reincarnate,

1307
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:19,020
we come to a point where there's
a long period of individual

1308
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,980
development, of linear
development, but there comes a

1309
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:25,880
point where it's just natural
that all of our former lives

1310
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:32,420
achieve a synthesis of the soul.
Now this synthesis exists in

1311
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:36,140
spiritual reality. When we die,
we return to soul consciousness.

1312
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:39,020
We return to the consciousness
that holds all of our former

1313
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:43,060
lives. And then we incarnate, we
get narrow, we die, we get

1314
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:46,360
large, we incarnate, we get
lateral. And if we keep this up

1315
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:50,620
for a few 1000s of years, sooner
or later, doesn't it make sense

1316
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:55,300
that the soul, the whole soul,
the 100,000 year old being,

1317
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:59,920
incarnates in a physical
incarnation, so that the kind.

1318
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,440
Consciousness that lives in that
body is not a consciousness that

1319
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:08,100
ever is tempted to think of him
or herself as 100 year old

1320
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:14,040
being, but it's it's natural
consciousness as aware that is

1321
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:17,940
an ancient being, and it has
ancient relationships with all

1322
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:22,160
these beings. It has been male,
female, rich, poor, black,

1323
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:25,520
white, every possible
permutation, all of those live

1324
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,380
within us, but when they achieve
a synthesis, when they become

1325
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:36,620
one, then there is this
explosion of identity. And I

1326
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:39,320
think that this is what is
happening to the planet right

1327
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:45,160
now. We are undergoing a
spiritual process, where we are

1328
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:49,660
transitioning from egoic
identity to soul identity. We

1329
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:54,880
are growing up out of our
childish, egoic past into a

1330
01:35:54,880 --> 01:36:03,840
mature self where we are we are
learning to we are basically

1331
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,660
becoming incarnate diamond
souls. And I think we can see

1332
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:10,380
this in some of the great
spiritual masters of history,

1333
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,280
that they are different from
ordinary people and but the

1334
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:18,600
difference is that they are
bigger, older, deeper. They are

1335
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,340
distillations of the soul. So
what are the, what are the

1336
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:26,360
symptoms of, I think, the soul
emerging in history. It doesn't

1337
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,600
happen like all at once, or
something dramatic. It happens

1338
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,180
gradually and slowly in
different all sorts of different

1339
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:36,560
ways. And so the symptoms are
when you see people who take the

1340
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:41,440
long view, who really see the
seven generations. Consider the

1341
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,920
seven generations of impact of
one's actions when you have the

1342
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:48,640
wide view, when they are
naturally their compassion

1343
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,840
expands, extends to whole
classes of people. When we see

1344
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,540
the Gandhi's of the world, or
the Martin Luther Kings of the

1345
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:58,780
world, people who live their
lives in service of other

1346
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:02,640
people, trying to lift other
people, help other people along.

1347
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:07,680
You see it in the in the music
teacher who's teaching fifth

1348
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:12,240
graders, year after year after
year, sharing his or her musical

1349
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:15,360
knowledge to give that musical
knowledge to others so that they

1350
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:19,140
can reach their life and go
forward. So I think we see the

1351
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:25,400
symptoms of an older soul or the
new human, when we see symptoms

1352
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:29,840
of great compassion, great
vision, great service,

1353
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:35,000
selflessness and we can see, we
can recognize those around us

1354
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:37,880
without necessarily
understanding what we are, what

1355
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:44,140
We were seeing, what we're
seeing is the soul emerging in

1356
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:47,980
that in that life form, in that
life being, and I think that we

1357
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:52,180
are coming to a time in history
where we have to grow up into

1358
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:56,260
the soul's consciousness, and
just there's a synergistic

1359
01:37:56,260 --> 01:38:00,040
relationship as the world is
trying to become one To solve

1360
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:03,900
the problems which has generated
the soul is trying to become

1361
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:08,280
one, and because we have the
history of the world inside our

1362
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:13,320
soul as the World Challenge
basically deals with all the

1363
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,340
ways it's divided life into bits
and pieces and preferring some

1364
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:21,140
people and discouraging other
people, we have all these

1365
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,920
tensions inside of us, and so
that there's a synergistic

1366
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:28,640
relationship between us trying
to become one and whole within

1367
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:32,780
ourselves and the world trying
to become one and whole. And I

1368
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:36,500
think we are being guided into
the transformation, which will

1369
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:39,920
not be easy. I think it's going
to be very painful where we're

1370
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:44,680
going, but we are coming into
labor. We've been gestating the

1371
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:48,760
future human for hundreds of
1000s of years. Gestation is

1372
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:52,780
long, labor is short. And I
think we're coming into labor.

1373
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:58,780
We have to deliver the soul into
history. We have to grow up. And

1374
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:02,580
I think we will. I mean, I think
we will make this transition. A

1375
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:06,240
lot of serious people think that
we won't, that it's we're in a

1376
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:09,780
we are an extinct species. We're
just living on borrowed time.

1377
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:13,920
But my experience is that we do
make this transition, we will

1378
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,060
make it. It will be very
painful, but we will give birth

1379
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:23,660
to the soul in history. I Well,

1380
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:26,300
Jeffrey Mishlove: that's
beautifully put, and it's

1381
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:32,660
probably a good note to close
our live stream on Chris, it's

1382
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:36,740
been a real joy to be with you.
Emmy. Do you have any concluding

1383
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:37,520
thoughts?

1384
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,140
Emmy Vadnais: I just want to say
thank you for the hope and

1385
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:48,760
inspiration, and it sounds like
you possibly were given

1386
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:53,440
precognitive information in your
LSD sessions, and that you have

1387
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,840
some type of wisdom or
knowledge, not only for

1388
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,780
yourself, but also for the
collective and because you're

1389
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:00,840
right, there are a lot of
people. Who feel like we might

1390
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:04,380
be devolving and things are
going really south. I'm not

1391
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:09,600
thrilled to hear about the pain
coming up, but hopefully we can

1392
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,840
take some of these spiritual
practices and maybe ameliorate

1393
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,100
some of that.

1394
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,700
Chris Bache: I think we can. I
think we can either go through

1395
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,840
this kicking and screaming and
hurting a lot, or we can go

1396
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:26,300
through it being more proactive,
with more foresight, and in a

1397
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:30,200
cooperative relationship with
what's coming. And what I've

1398
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:34,460
been describing is nothing
unique to me. It's these ideas

1399
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:38,540
about the transition comes up in
indigenous peoples tradition. It

1400
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:43,300
comes up in the lives of mystics
and meditators. So, you know, it

1401
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:47,740
comes up in those who work in
deep Jungian, you know, type of

1402
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:52,180
psychotherapy, there's nothing
unique to my perception. There's

1403
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,760
nothing really unique to
psychedelics about it. It's just

1404
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:59,680
that I think there are
precognitive aspects to this

1405
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:02,820
type of work, which is when you
let go of your personal

1406
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:07,200
identity, you open to the life
of your species. And just as you

1407
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,740
can have insights into your
personal trajectory, you can

1408
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:15,060
also have true insights into
this trajectory of your species.

1409
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:18,900
It's just a very natural thing.
And many people have had these

1410
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:22,940
insights. Many people see we're
coming into and I think we will

1411
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:26,960
make it. I think my concern is
how many of our children will

1412
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,440
die before we make it well.

1413
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:33,620
Emmy Vadnais: And it's nice to
hear more people such as

1414
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:38,780
yourself bring these insights.
So the more spiritually evolved

1415
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:43,240
people we have it sounds like
the better, which is perhaps one

1416
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:46,060
of the main reasons we continue
to do these programs on new

1417

essence of the Bodhisattva. And

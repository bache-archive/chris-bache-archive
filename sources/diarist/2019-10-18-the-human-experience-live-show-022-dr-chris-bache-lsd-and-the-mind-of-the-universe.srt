18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,300
Christopher Bache. Dr Bache is a
professor, researcher and author

19
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,820
who has been teaching and
writing about consciousness,

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,200
philosophy and religion for more
than 30 years Christopher

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,220
received his PhD in philosophy
and religion from Brown

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,460
University and went on to be a

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,960
at young style, young Youngstown
State University. Christopher

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
has written a number of books,
life cycles, reincarnation, the

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,240
web of life, and his latest is
the is LSD and the mind. Of the

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,680
universe, diamonds from heaven,
for the most part, which we'll

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,920
be covering this evening. Chris,
thank you so much for making

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,880
time. Welcome to hxp.

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,020
Chris Bache: Thank you, Xavier,
thank you for this conversation.

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,160
It's a pleasure to be here.

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,960
Unknown: So Chris, I mean, let's
just, let's start this off with,

32
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,320
you know, how you got into this
work? If, if you want to kind of

33
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,620
get into a little bit of your
background, it's, it's an, I

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,200
mean, would you say that's an
unusual field to be in?

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,380
Chris Bache: It certainly is. I
was, I come from a very

36
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,380
classical, mainstream
background. I was raised in the

37
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,660
Deep South. I went to Notre Dame
and Cambridge and Brown

38
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,160
University. I was a very
standard classical mainstream

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,740
education in religious studies.
And shortly after, I started my

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,500
teaching career, right? This is
back now. This is in 1978 I just

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,340
I was publishing some articles
out of my dissertation, I was

42
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,400
looking for where to take my
research now that my

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,700
dissertation was done and I
encountered the work of

44
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,740
Stanislav Grof. Was the foremost
authority on psych integrating

45
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,780
psychedelics into psychotherapy.
His book, realms of the human

46
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,880
unconscious was an eye opener
for me, and in one reading, I

47
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,720
felt like I had found my life's
work. I thought that this work

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,100
was extraordinarily important,
not only for psychology, but

49
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,420
very important for philosophy,
understanding that psychedelics,

50
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,140
in this case, LSD, but in
general, psychedelics function

51
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,080
as amplifiers of consciousness.
So they increase the sensitivity

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,000
of our mind many times over for
a short period of time, for an

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,960
LSD session that's about eight
hours. And by amplifying

54
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,960
consciousness, it gives us an
opportunity to explore

55
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,180
systematically the deeper
dimensions of consciousness and

56
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,680
what we So I saw this, I
thought, this is tremendous.

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,640
I've got to, I want to do this.
But of course, psychedelics had

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,680
been made illegal in 1970 in
this country, and so I had to

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,280
make a difficult choice. What I
decided to do was divide my

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,440
life. And so I had what you
might call a daytime job and a

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,600
nighttime job. My daytime job, I
was a professor of religious

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,660
studies at Jung sound State
University. I did the things

63
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,040
that professors do. I lecture
and go to committee meetings and

64
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,680
publish. And then I and I my
private life. I went into a very

65
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,820
inner, hidden side of my life,
and I began a rigorous process

66
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,860
of using LSD, following
Stanislav Grof protocols, to

67
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,820
explore my own consciousness.
And then when the bottom dropped

68
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,380
out of my own consciousness, I
moved right into a larger field

69
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,120
of conscious. So large. I think
of it as the mind of the

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,840
universe,

71
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,480
Unknown: okay? And that's, you
know, that's where we get into,

72
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,960
sort of the subtitle of your
book, The primary focus of your

73
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,940
book, you know, I really want to
know, did you at any point when

74
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,020
you were beginning the research?
Did you feel as if you know

75
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,760
that? I mean, this is, this is
very much taboo in our society.

76
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,820
And did you feel at any point
that your tenure would be

77
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,700
threatened? Did you feel that
your job would be threatened?

78
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,660
Did you feel like coming out
with this information would risk

79
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,800
your career in any way?

80
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,860
Chris Bache: Absolutely, I think
that was a reasonable assertion.

81
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,700
I knew that I was breaking the
law in order to do this work. I

82
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,640
knew that they would come a
time, as there is now, that we

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,000
would reclaim these important
substances. But my entire Well,

84
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,880
I knew that we would come back
around to these substances, but

85
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,820
I couldn't wait until we did. I
knew that if I if this became

86
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,400
public knowledge, if I was too
public about this, I would

87
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,940
probably lose my job. And I love
teaching. I love being with the

88
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,680
students in the classroom. I
love being an academic, and so I

89
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,900
just kept this work private. My
you know, close colleagues in

90
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,740
the department knew, but I kept
it private. I'd never talked to

91
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,240
my students about it. I did not
become in any way a public

92
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,440
figure. I mean, this was between
I did 73 high dose LSD sessions,

93
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,440
following Stanislav Grof
protocol for high dose

94
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:43,780
psychedelic sessions between
1979 and 1999 Okay, so this is,

95
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,500
this is a between when I was 30
and 50, and I'm 70 now. So this

96
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,940
book, I've spent 20 years
integrating and digesting these

97
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,360
experiences before producing
this book.

98
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,440
Unknown: Okay, I mean, that's,
that's quite a range of time and

99
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,040
a tremendous amount of sessions
to to have with this compound.

100
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,520
Was there a reason that you
selected LSD, you know, namely,

101
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,180
specifically, why not another
substance? Why not DMT,

102
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,100
Psilocybin? Why not Ayahuasca?

103
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,920
Chris Bache: Well, you have to
go back to 1978 and think about

104
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,340
the landscape then Ayahuasca was
this was before the era of

105
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,180
Ayahuasca. Psilocybin mushrooms
were around. It was really

106
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,840
before the era of DMT. But more
importantly, my work really was

107
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,780
founded on Stanislav Grof work
and most of Stan's work, his

108
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,520
early work, was basically done
with LSD, and I trusted what I

109
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,740
saw in his, in his research. So
basically, I chose to work with

110
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,880
the with his, with this
substance, LSD. After I stopped

111
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,300
my sessions, I've had
experiences with other

112
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,320
psychedelics, you know,
Psilocybin, DMT and Ayahuasca.

113
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,660
But my prime, what I consider my
primary work, the core work,

114
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,260
that's the subject of my
philosophical reflections, are

115
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,540
these 73 LSD sessions.

116
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,680
Unknown: Okay, I mean, I find it
intriguing, because I think

117
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,140
Congress passed, you know, into
law that, you know, banning LSD,

118
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,460
I think that went into effect
1967 right? Yeah.

119
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,460
Chris Bache: Well, there were a
series of laws, basically, 67

120
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,020
6970 basically, is a nice,
convenient, easy date for that

121
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,740
was the control Substances Act
that was passed, okay?

122
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,220
Unknown: And I mean, there in
your book, you talk about

123
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,880
certain synchronicities that
started to happen in your world.

124
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,480
Can you talk a little bit about
that that encouraged you to

125
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,600
carry out these experiments?
Because even though you did them

126
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,020
in secret, I mean, did you do
you have, did you have a plan

127
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,720
that you were going to release
this sort of book later?

128
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,820
Chris Bache: I always assume
that there would come a time,

129
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,760
and this became a stronger
conviction, if the work

130
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,180
continued, that there would come
a time when I would bring this

131
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,840
work forward to the world. But I
knew that it could not be while

132
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,280
I was an academic, and I it
could not be while I was still

133
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,620
subject to the statute of
limitations for this work. So it

134
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,400
was only after I retired from
the university and after I was

135
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,060
past the statute of limit of
limitations that I felt

136
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,020
comfortable speaking about this
makes sense. But in the work

137
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,960
itself, I always sort of saw
myself one way or another sooner

138
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,940
or later, finding a way to bring
the core content of these

139
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,360
sessions to others. Because I'm
a philosopher. I was trained to

140
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,560
ask large questions. I was
trained I really wanted to

141
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
answer the type ask the type of
questions that you know we.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
Keeps us up late at night when
we're thinking about the meaning

143
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,400
of existence, the purpose of
things, and whether there is a

144
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,700
purpose of things, and is there
an intelligence operating deep

145
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,820
in this superstructure and
substructure of the universe?

146
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,020
And this was an opportunity to
explore those questions on an

147
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,780
experiential basis, and I became
quickly convinced in this work,

148
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,380
that the most important
contributions to my field in the

149
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,920
near future, which is philosophy
of religion, would be done by

150
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,000
people who are working not out
of a theoretical basis, but they

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,520
would be working out of an
experiential basis.

152
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,600
Unknown: Sure. So I'm not sure
if you you answered my question

153
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,080
regarding the synchronicities,
if you could just touch on that.

154
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,260
Chris Bache: Kind of jumps ahead
in the storyline a bit. Okay, it

155
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,060
wasn't. I did not. I was not
aware of any particular

156
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,500
synchronicities going into the
work. But if I, I'll just tag

157
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,120
this and maybe we'll come back
around to it later. Okay, as my

158
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,920
work deepened over the course of
those 20 years. Even though my

159
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,500
students never knew I was doing
this work, I found that some of

160
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,960
my students were being activated
in their own personal lives by

161
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,900
my psychedelic work. There was a
spillover of consciousness

162
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,880
transformation that began in my
sessions, but because

163
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,460
consciousness is not a private
phenomenon, because

164
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,960
consciousness is in essentially
the deeper levels of

165
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,660
consciousness are
boundarylessness. They're

166
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:41,200
boundaryless. The impact of my
sessions began to unroll beyond

167
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,020
my personal life, and that's
that led me to do some serious

168
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,420
thinking and research on how to
continue to do my work, while

169
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,620
also taking care of my students
and continuing my work as a

170
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,260
professor writing the heavy
normal life. And that led to

171
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,980
writing the book The living
classroom, which is about fields

172
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,540
of consciousness in group
settings. And in that book, I

173
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,380
don't even mention psychedelics,
because the issue is not

174
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,400
psychedelics. The issue is the
nature of consciousness and what

175
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,480
happens when people come
together and focus their

176
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,740
intention and sustained
exercises for periods of months

177
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,400
and years.

178
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,640
Unknown: I love that. I love
that I'm feeling this resonance

179
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,280
in your words, which I'm really
enjoying. So I mean, we

180
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,540
mentioned that these compounds
amplify consciousness in a way

181
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,560
you said your words. So, you
know, I want to know what were

182
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,100
the some of the questions that
you were asking yourself, what

183
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,500
were the questions that you
wanted answers to?

184
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,240
Chris Bache: Well, I got into
this again. We're thinking late

185
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,840
70s, because I was interested in
enlightenment, and I had been

186
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,600
meditating for a number of
years, and I had encountered the

187
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,800
kind of blocks that people
typically encounter in the early

188
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,120
years of sitting practice, and I
thought that if I could do some

189
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,140
sessions and engage my
unconscious and confront

190
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,920
whatever blocks were waiting for
me in my unconscious, it would

191
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,540
basically speed the process of
my own spiritual realization

192
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,660
that model of individual
transformation is a model that

193
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,460
was shattered along the way in
this work, because within three

194
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:37,700
years, I was getting drawn into
vast, intense purification

195
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,400
processes that involved 1000s,
10s of 1000s, hundreds of 1000s

196
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,900
of people. I got into a whole
series of experiences for years

197
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,640
that were just far too large and
far too intense to understand

198
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,600
them in terms of some type of
healing or clarification or

199
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
realization of one's personal
transformation. I began to

200
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,540
understand that in these deep,
deep, highly, highly energized

201
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,180
states of consciousness, if you
focus in them in a very specific

202
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:15,300
way, you actually can begin to
impact or heal some portion of

203
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,800
the collective unconscious.

204
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,980
Unknown: Okay, okay, please
continue.

205
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,520
Chris Bache: Well, let me back
up and a little bit about

206
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,980
method. Stan Grof clearly
distinguishes between low dose

207
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,080
psycholytic therapy and high
dose psychedelic therapy. Low

208
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,800
dose psyche lytic therapy,
usually 5200 micrograms, is a

209
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,280
process of peeling the
unconscious layer by layer,

210
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,700
multiple sessions gradually
unfolding the unconscious and

211
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,380
helping heal whatever issues are
lurking in the unconscious.

212
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,560
Psychedelic high dose therapy is
very different. And it in the

213
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,940
early years in the Spring Grove
Hospital, the agenda was to try

214
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,540
working with a patient
population of people who had

215
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,500
cancer or had terminal illness.
They were not they were not

216
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,320
trying to heal them. These
people were going to die. They

217
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,040
basically were trying to blast
through all the layers of the

218
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,220
personal unconscious and trigger
an experience of an encounter

219
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,520
with the universe that would
give them some kind of glimpse

220
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,700
of where they were going when
they died. They basically were

221
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,760
trying to trigger a near death
episode experience in these

222
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,460
subjects. It was a very
interesting and a very

223
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,500
successful project. So I came
along later and I thought, well,

224
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,000
it's like if LSD can be used in
high Oh, their protocol was

225
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,360
limited to three sessions, no
more than three sessions. Okay,

226
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,800
so I thought, if you can do it
safely three times, and you can

227
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,820
do it safely more times. So I
chose, partly for matters of

228
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,120
efficiency, a number of
different things I discussed in

229
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,260
the book, but I chose to work
after about three sessions, to

230
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,700
work with very high doses of
LSD. And I worked at 500 to 600

231
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,940
micrograms consistently for
those 20 years now, the state of

232
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,700
arousal, the state of
amplification, when you're

233
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,760
working with doses of LSD that
high, plus when you completely

234
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,060
internalize the experience. So
let me back up for a minute.

235
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,000
We're talking about sessions.
We're not talking about

236
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,260
tripping. Never gone to a
concert on acid, never stayed up

237
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,260
all night talking with my
friends. Okay, the days when I

238
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,260
did these sessions, I was
totally isolated from the world.

239
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,420
I was working with the sitter
who kept took care of me. I was

240
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,160
lying down with eye shades and
earphones, a very, very

241
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,200
carefully curated playlist. And
what you do is, when you're when

242
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,860
your consciousness becomes
hyper, amplified like this, if

243
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,780
you focus it internally, if you
really create conditions where

244
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,640
you do not engage the world, but
you engage just your mind. A

245
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,940
series of things began to
percolate, and you confront

246
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,040
deeper and deeper levels of your
consciousness when you are

247
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,260
working with very high doses of
LSD like this eventually, in a

248
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,380
relatively short period of time,
after 10 or 15 sessions, you're

249
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:31,100
just blowing your consciousness
far, far out into the universe

250
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,820
and then slowly gathering it
back in at the end of the day,

251
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,260
and then making a detailed
record of your experience within

252
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,480
24 hours. That's the method to
open up consciousness experience

253
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,960
the universe as cleanly, or
experience whatever it is as

254
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,400
cleanly and clearly as you can,
with no distortions and no

255
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,020
complications. Come back and
then write it down and then

256
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,920
analyze your experience. Keep
track of your experience. And if

257
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,920
you do this, basically, there is
a conversation that takes place

258
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,280
with the universe, or a
deepening communion that takes

259
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,200
place with the universe. You are
initiated, systematically, step

260
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,280
by step, into a deeper
experience, not only of your own

261
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,700
mind, but into this larger mind,
which is the context and

262
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,940
surround mind which underpins
your mind.

263
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,940
Unknown: Okay, okay, so this was
just to, just to restate what

264
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,020
you just mentioned, was you
established this protocol for

265
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,040
yourself with a therapeutic
protocol to engage high,

266
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,900
extremely high doses of LSD, and
you purposely set up ways where

267
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,620
you would disconnect as much as
possible from contact with the

268
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,960
outside world civilization to
better understand these

269
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,020
questions you were asking, or
better understand The

270
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,220
information that you were
receiving. Studying the universe

271
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,560
Chris Bache: understand, wanted
to understand my own

272
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,240
consciousness, and through that,
to understand the nature of

273
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,740
reality itself. Stan's early
work gave me evidence that one

274
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,380
could have not only knowledge of
one's own unconscious, but you

275
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,940
can have knowledge of the mind
of the universe, or the mind of

276
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,480
the cosmos, or, some would say,
the mind of God. So I was

277
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,620
interested in learning as much
about the universe as I could,

278
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,180
and I also wanted to know the
truth about my own being. What

279
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,440
was my being? Because I was a
professor of religious studies,

280
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,120
and because I taught courses in
comparative mysticism. I knew

281
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,660
about the spiritual traditions
of the world. I knew what the

282
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,780
cosmology were of our deepest
mystical traditions, and I sort

283
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,340
of I kept that all on the maybe
table, and I just set out to see

284
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,620
what I could learn using this
protocol.

285
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,860
Unknown: Yeah, so I mean, what
was it? What did you find?

286
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,880
Chris Bache: Well, that's not an
easy, sure question to answer,

287
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,580
because these experiences are
extremely complicated. They have

288
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,760
many layers and layers to them,
and it takes years literally to

289
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,000
you mean you understand them
when you have them, but it takes

290
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,020
years to really unpack the
deeper themes and the

291
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:38,660
correlations that emerge over
this course of time, how to,

292
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
where to what did I learn? I
hmm,

293
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,980
Unknown: was there something
that you know sparked some sort

294
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,640
of realization for you, as far
as why we're here? You know,

295
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,600
what our purpose is, our
connection to this reality, what

296
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,260
happens when we die? I mean,
what was, what was the lesson

297
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,500
you

298
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,660
Chris Bache: think, yes to all
of those things you basically, I

299
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,400
mean, it's, this is one of those
things where, I mean, I'm a

300
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,300
professor, and I like to do
things in an organized fashion,

301
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,660
and that means starting in the
beginning and laying it down,

302
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,740
phase by phase by phase. If I
jump into the end stages or the

303
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,120
later stages without covering
the earlier stages, it'll sound

304
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,740
very ungrounded. It'll sound
very, you know, druggie, you

305
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,220
know, psychedelic kind of
conversation. And that wasn't

306
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,460
the nature of my experience. And
so I'm kind of hesitant to sort

307
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,840
of get to the conclusions too
fast, basically,

308
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,000
methodologically, here's how I
understand it. When you go into

309
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,700
these hyper states, if you were
willing to confront Honestly,

310
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,480
even courageously, whatever
emerges, you'll go through a

311
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,180
series of death and rebirth
processes, as I have looked back

312
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,500
over all of my accessions, over
the over the 20 years that I did

313
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,580
them, I basically identified
five layers, or five cycles of

314
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,960
the Death-Rebirth process. It
took me into different levels of

315
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,740
consciousness. The first layer
is the death of self, where you

316
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,320
basically go through ego death,
and you go through the death of

317
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,460
your time, space, identity, the
identity that we all walk around

318
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,200
in, the identity that basically
emerges from birth to death.

319
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,120
After that, I entered into a
level where the dynamics were

320
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,880
all larger than private self.
The dynamics for the dynamics of

321
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,020
the collective mind. I entered
into a domain that I call the

322
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,680
ocean of suffering. Entered into
an experience, a year's worth of

323
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,820
experiences, where I experienced
my entire life, from start to

324
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,120
finish, beginning to end as a
complete now, all past, present

325
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,680
and future collapsed into it.
Now I went from there into a

326
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,620
series of deep, systematic kind
of instruction. I was given a

327
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:20,280
course in cosmology. 101, I You
can't control these experiences.

328
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,820
I mean, I could set my
intentions, but when you're

329
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,540
working with doses this high,
it's impossible to control these

330
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,320
experiences. The best thing to
do is completely surrender, let

331
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,740
it take you wherever it wants to
take you, and where it will take

332
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,820
you is into these deeper, deeper
levels, where you have to allow

333
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,800
yourself to surrender, over and
over again, and eventually to go

334
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,500
through the series of
Death-Rebirth processes. So

335
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,280
after death of self, two years
of work at the collective mind.

336
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,660
Another two years working at
what I called archetypal mind,

337
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,120
the greater real of archetypal
reality, beyond that, the level

338
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,440
of causal oneness, where you
enter into a completely

339
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,060
different experiential reality
where all the dualities that we

340
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,900
conventionally recognize as part
of time and space are dissolved.

341
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,280
And then after that, the last
five years of my work, I entered

342
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,440
into a domain that I call the
diamond Luminosity work. This is

343
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,020
what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya,
the clear light of absolute

344
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,520
reality, an extra ordinary,
subtle, subtle, refined, clear,

345
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,380
clear dimensions of
consciousness. In the process of

346
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:40,480
going through all of these
levels, the sessions gave me

347
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:49,180
many, many experiences, of many
experiences when I hesitate to

348
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,260
use language of the Divine
because the language of God or

349
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,820
the divine has so many
culturally imported limitations

350
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,620
that I understand I'm. Not
comfortable with, but it is the

351
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,220
closest we have in our culture
to really speak about these

352
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,580
things. I talk about the
creative intelligence of the

353
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,240
universe. One is, I mean, you're
basically taken deep into,

354
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,260
dissolved into the intelligence
of the universe. So naturally,

355
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,980
you have, I had many sessions,
many teachings around what we're

356
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,460
here for, what's going on, what
is our relationship to the

357
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,560
universe, and very importantly,
lots of experiences having to do

358
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,140
with human evolution, and
particularly the phase of

359
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,600
evolutionary challenge that
humanity is facing right here,

360
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,100
right now, what is happening in
our time in history? This came

361
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,420
to be one of the most consistent
and dominant and recurring

362
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,660
themes of the book. And there's
a chapter in the book called The

363
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:01,860
Birth of the future human. So
lots and lots of levels, what

364
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,660
happens to us when we die?
Certainly, one can go into the

365
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,700
realms of what the Tibetan
tradition, Buddhism tradition

366
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,660
would call the Bardo dimensions
you go when you die. And you can

367
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,140
also, if you work really hard
and consistently, go into what

368
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:26,600
the Bush called extra Samsara
reality, or reality beyond all

369
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,560
the cycles of reincarnation, all
the cycles of existence, going

370
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,020
into that reality that lies well
beyond the incarnated domains.

371
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,040
So there's lots of insights that
emerged in this work. And what

372
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,800
I've done in this book is I
simply have taken the reader in

373
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,040
as efficiently as I can,
starting in the beginning of the

374
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,960
work, breaking it down, chapter
by chapter, year by year, where

375
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,200
I went, what happened, what what
emerged, and I really well, I

376
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,640
just lay it out like that as
transparently as I can.

377
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,960
Unknown: I mean, it sounds
phenomenal, right? I mean, and

378
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,920
you seem to have the language
very clear, which, which I find

379
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,160
incredibly important when
discussing these types of

380
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,680
experiences, it seems like
you're very cautious with your

381
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,560
verbiage, which I respect very
much. You know? What I'm curious

382
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,960
about is to know how you worked,
the integration aspect of it.

383
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,400
You talk about something called
psychic inflation in the book. I

384
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,900
mean, how did you maintain
because it is important to have

385
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,420
this sort of critical
discernment that you used, and I

386
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,120
think it would encourage others
to when they're in these

387
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,420
experiences, to also have that
as well, because sometimes I

388
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,060
hear about people that
experience a sort of

389
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,240
depersonalization when they
experience something so

390
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,900
Transcendence, so profound, it's
difficult to integrate, it's

391
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,080
difficult to come back and and
apply that In a practical way to

392
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,140
your understanding of of life,
reality?

393
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:08,159
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah, it is.
And I think integration is it

394
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,999
isn't a topic that's being given
more attention now. I don't

395
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:15,959
think it's been given nearly
enough attention. There is an

396
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:22,699
anthology out in England later
this year, 2020, devoted

397
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:28,279
specifically just to
integration. First, first, the

398
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,779
most important danger of working
in these states is psychic

399
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:37,099
inflation. We can have this
experience. We can have dramatic

400
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:41,259
experiences, extra ordinarily
deep experiences. And we can

401
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:44,379
think sometimes that by having
these experiences, we become a

402
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:48,159
deep person, but that's really a
fool's delusion. You have to

403
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,699
really, really keep yourself
grounded. You go into these

404
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:55,899
states for a few hours, you come
back, you write them down, then

405
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:59,319
you get back to your nine to
five job, you get back to your

406
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,299
children, you get back to your
world response responsibilities,

407
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:07,859
and you first, you remember your
experiences, and then you think

408
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:10,559
about them, and you try to
understand them, and you put

409
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,159
into practice, because you put
into practice the teachings and

410
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,839
the values that you were given
You were shown to me, the two

411
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:26,359
critical features for using
these states of consciousness in

412
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:30,679
a productive way that leads to
deep transformation is one,

413
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:35,479
courage, willingness to confront
the hard experiences that rise

414
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:38,599
in these experiences,
confronting the shadow and more

415
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,459
And more than that. And
secondly, grounding, really,

416
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:46,179
really grounding, and that means
grounding them in other sets of

417
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:49,299
spiritual practices, grounding
them in a daily meditation

418
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:53,979
practice, grounding them in care
for the body. And that's really

419
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:58,479
important, because usually we
describe these states as states

420
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:02,219
of consciousness, but. They are
also states of body. They have

421
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:06,659
profound effects on your body,
both your physical system and

422
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,379
your subtle energy system. And
so it's really important to take

423
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:14,039
care of your body, take care of
your diet, to take care of your

424
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,579
lifestyle. Because if these
states are opening you into

425
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:22,399
increasingly deep states of
oneness, and if your lifestyle

426
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,939
is violating oneness, you know,
if it's not a lifestyle of

427
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:29,779
compassion, if it's not a
lifestyle of service, and you're

428
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:33,019
living in one way in your daily
life and in your sessions,

429
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:36,439
you're going into a different
way. And you know you're either

430
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:39,859
going to neutralize your
sessions by your daily life, or

431
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:44,139
you're going to kind of tear
yourself apart and become as a

432
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:48,039
kind of spiritual schizophrenia
that can sometimes result so

433
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:51,519
really staying very, very
grounded in the world. And to

434
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,739
me, this was really strongly
from two things for me, my

435
00:30:56,739 --> 00:31:00,419
teaching, because wherever I was
on Saturday, on Monday, I was

436
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,659
back in my classroom, doing my
teaching. And the second thing

437
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:09,899
was my family by marriage and my
children really, really keeping

438
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:10,499
me grounded.

439
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,820
Unknown: I mean, were there
certain protocols that you use

440
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:20,960
for grounding specifically? I
mean, was there, you know, a set

441
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,860
sort of amount of things that
you did every day after your

442
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,760
sessions. What I mean? How did
you ground yourself better,

443
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,760
other than just kind of a
cursory look at, you know,

444
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,600
maintain your relationships and
and accountability to yourself,

445
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,660
how did you like? Were there
some practical things that you

446
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,180
did as far as grounding well?

447
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,900
Chris Bache: Once again, because
I because of what I do for a

448
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,260
living, I knew a fair amount
about Shamanism. I knew about

449
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,540
mystical spiritual tradition, so
I understood the practices that

450
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,420
come out of that tradition. I
had a good grounding in Western

451
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,020
religious thought, and I did a
lot of teaching in Eastern

452
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,460
religious thought, so I had that
background to draw upon. But

453
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,520
basically, you know, it's not
that dissimilar from what

454
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,960
happens if you go on a two week
retreat, you know, meditation

455
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,120
retreat, you're with the
teacher, and you go out in the

456
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,780
woods, or, you know, you're in a
retreat center for two weeks,

457
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,660
you move into a state of
consciousness, and then when you

458
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:28,040
come back, it's often grinding
to come back and engage traffic

459
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,840
jams and you know, the regular
physical world. It's the same

460
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,800
thing that happens in the LSD
session. It's just that you get

461
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,200
into it deeper and faster, and
you come back faster. But the

462
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,500
basic process of holding still,
absorbing these experiences,

463
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:53,200
taking them deeply into your
mind and into your body, you

464
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,200
know that's that's kind of
shared by all spiritual

465
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,960
practices. So practically, I
think that the deeper you want

466
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,260
to go in Non-ordinary states of
consciousness using

467
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,160
psychedelics, the more important
it is to have a daily spiritual

468
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,260
practice. And for me, this meant
a meditation practice, also a

469
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,860
light yoga practice to helping
take care of the body. I was

470
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,320
helped in this in that my sitter
was my wife. She is a clinical

471
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,140
psychologist, Carl, and she was,
she is a very serious spiritual

472
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,640
practitioner, Kuhn, whose
practice I respect a great deal.

473
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,260
She never did a psychedelic
session. She was a sitter for

474
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,320
all of my sessions. Never did
one herself, because they did

475
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,600
not call to her. They you know,
she was basically a meditating

476
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,840
person, and she found what she
needed on the meditation

477
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:52,900
cushion. And she really helped
kept keep me grounded during all

478
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,440
these years when I was jumping
out and exploring different

479
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,680
dimensions of the Universe, she
really kept reminding me What's

480
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,900
important is not what happens on
the day of a session. What's

481
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,720
important is what you can do the
day after a session. So that

482
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,920
really is that really calls it.
You really have to integrate

483
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,320
these experiences into your
daily lifestyle. And that takes

484
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,420
practice. I mean, it takes self
clarification, critical self

485
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:28,100
examination. It takes. There's a
social dimension, a moral

486
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:34,220
dimension of compassion and
equality, you know, but these

487
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,060
are traditionally recognized in
all traditional spiritual

488
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,620
practices, yeah, and it's
essentially the same.

489
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,380
Unknown: I think it's so
important, because when you're

490
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,340
unraveling the aspects of the
psyche in this way, can be very

491
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,520
dangerous. I mean, as you said
that, you know, there was never

492
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,600
a time where you kind of you
dosed and then hung out with

493
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,300
friends. There was never a time
where you dosed and went out to

494
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,540
a concert. So you. Know, for
you, it was a very deliberate

495
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,000
intention to connect with
yourself and explore

496
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,480
consciousness, to ask these,
these larger questions, but you

497
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,820
know, specifically, keep it into
in this controlled environment,

498
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,720
controlled setting,

499
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,520
Chris Bache: yeah, and in that
controlled setting, of course,

500
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,280
the most important thing is you
have to ask yourself at the

501
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,300
beginning of every day every
session, are you ready to die?

502
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,980
Are you ready to give it all up?
And because you confront, you go

503
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,360
through many, many deaths in
this process. You know you don't

504
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,100
die physically, but you go
through death processes that are

505
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,060
so deep you think you're dying
physically. And then you go

506
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:53,020
through processes where to put
this on again. I don't want to

507
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,280
jump in too deep, too fast, but
you go through processes where

508
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,280
the death agonies are not
personal. The death agonies

509
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,720
really are species wide, and you
go through processes when you're

510
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,860
moving into archetypal reality
and then moving out of

511
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:16,560
archetypal reality, you're
dealing with orders of magnitude

512
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,000
that are really hard to relate
to anything on earth.

513
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Unknown: Let's do so. Let's
define archetypal reality. Sorry

514
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,780
to interrupt you.

515
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,860
Chris Bache: Yeah, well,
archetype of reality that the

516
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,600
two figures that come to mind
most are Plato and Carl Jung in

517
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,660
his work on the collective
unconscious. And so Plato's

518
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,820
ideas that basically there is a
reality behind the physical

519
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,720
world which informs and
organizes the fundamental

520
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,200
structures of the physical
world. It's a it's an order

521
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,640
beyond that, beyond physical
reality. And Carl Jung, of

522
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,580
course, in talking about
archetypes and the collective

523
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,500
unconscious, he's talking about
the way, the idea that there is

524
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,180
a collective mind, which is the
soup within which our individual

525
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,160
mind floats, so that all of our
thinking and feeling and

526
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:17,220
processing is contextualized
within a species mind, within a

527
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:25,520
collective unconscious of the
species. When I went into

528
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,620
archetype of reality, I had
experiences on both levels, on

529
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,880
both the high levels, kind of a
quasi platonic level, where I

530
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,260
encountered beings of such
magnitude I could not wrap my

531
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,800
mind around them. I mean,
there's just vast beings that I

532
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:52,660
knew were the beings responsible
for creating space time and for

533
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,980
in sort of infusing or growing
the order that's emerging in

534
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,260
space time. But they were so
vast and in such a different

535
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,120
order of reality, I could not
give them firm description. I

536
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,880
describe what I what I
experienced in the book, but

537
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,080
they don't lend themselves. And
I describe this as a quasi

538
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,740
platonic sense, because the
archetypes that I experienced

539
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,560
were not Plato's eternal ideas
in the minds of an unchanging,

540
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,560
infinite consciousness. My
experience was that the

541
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,980
archetypes, these deep, deep
archetypes, were living

542
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,460
structures. They were living
entities. They were, they were,

543
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,820
I hesitated to call them
entities, because they're like

544
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,360
Galaxy size. I mean, they're
vast dimensions, but they're

545
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,560
living. They're dynamic. They
change very slowly, relative to

546
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,280
us, inside time and space. But
they still change. They evolve,

547
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,740
they grow. Likewise, when I went
into sort of a lower level of

548
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,980
archetype of reality, the
collective unconscious of

549
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,660
humanity, the more quasi Jung
Ian level, as I didn't

550
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,540
experience archetypes, the way
Jung describes it, but I

551
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,700
experienced over and over again,
the mind of the human species as

552
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,580
a living, integrated whole. And
I had many experiences where I

553
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,660
experienced all of our
individual minds as nodes, as

554
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,120
fractal nodes within the larger
landscape of consciousness, and

555
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,220
I was shown how our individual
consciousness interacts in

556
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:36,500
complex ways with this larger
species mind. Now, when you

557
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,440
here's another little, just a
footnote, or in a way, every

558
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,760
level deeper into a deeper level
of consciousness is a step into

559
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,140
a higher level of energy. So
when you shift from one level of

560
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,800
consciousness into a deeper
level of consciousness, you have

561
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,660
to learn how to manage a much,
much higher level of energy. And

562
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,760
so every time you go. Go into a
deeper level, and you know, I'm

563
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,480
just describing five or six
different levels, you go through

564
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,120
intense purification processes.
Otherwise, if you go into these

565
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,880
levels and you're not
acclimated, you haven't done

566
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,240
your homework and you haven't
been able to acclimate your

567
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,700
energy to this very, very, very
intense energy levels, then your

568
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,160
experiences there will be
fragmented. They'll be

569
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,100
incoherent. You won't be they
won't make as much sense to you,

570
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,460
and you won't be able to bring
them back clearly. But if you go

571
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,180
back to these levels again and
again and again, and you submit

572
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,660
to the purification processes
and the Death-Rebirth processes,

573
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,980
then you basically acclimate so
that when you go into these

574
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,700
states, you learn how to stay
conscious in levels of

575
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,480
consciousness that previously
just swallowed you whole. Okay,

576
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,020
wow. And you do it in a
consistent fashion. You then

577
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,180
break through into deeper and
deeper levels. But every time

578
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,900
you break through, you have to
go through more purification

579
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,580
processes, more Death-Rebirth
processes, just in order to stay

580
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,420
clear, to establish clarity at
these levels.

581
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,500
Unknown: Okay, so I'm really
enjoying everything that you're

582
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,980
saying, Chris. So you know, I
want to, I want to inject a

583
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,580
little bit of my own personal
experience. I, you know, I've

584
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,080
only had a handful of LSD
sessions, but Ayahuasca, for me,

585
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,900
is a big part of my life. I take
it in a highly controlled

586
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,660
setting with instructed shamans
and the the state in which

587
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:41,560
you're describing, and I do my
best to, you know, regard it in

588
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,540
as skeptically as I can and as
critically as I can, and I've

589
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,940
definitely had that experience
of encountering an intelligence

590
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,120
that I can't explain or I mean,
and it's very difficult to

591
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,640
understand kind of what it's
trying to show me, but when,

592
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,460
when I look at at it in the
perspective that you just

593
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,220
mentioned, that it's a
purification protocol, that it's

594
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,980
it's a it's a refining of your
yourself, of your own

595
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,880
consciousness, to bring you to a
point in which you can sort of

596
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,640
understand the larger reality
that fits into a puzzle piece

597
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,140
for me?

598
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,640
Chris Bache: Yeah, absolutely.
Ayahuasca is a beautiful

599
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,540
medicine, an extra ordinary
medicine. If I were starting

600
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,620
this whole sequence over again,
first of all, I would not do it

601
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,600
the way I did it. I would not
work so consistently in the

602
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,440
sustained fashion in high dose
LSD sessions, I just wouldn't do

603
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,560
it. I'd do it differently. I'd
balance low and high dose

604
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:52,300
sessions. I'd also balance LSD
with Ayahuasca sessions and

605
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,140
Psilocybin sessions. Because
Psilocybin and Ayahuasca are

606
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,480
more kind of body grounded
psychedelic experiences. LSD

607
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,380
tends to be a high ceiling. It
tends to push the high cosmic,

608
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,100
logical ceiling. And so
balancing those, I think, give

609
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,540
you overall, a better trajectory
in your experiences. But

610
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,340
Ayahuasca is an extra ordinary
teacher. And you know people who

611
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,500
do Ayahuasca sessions seriously,
conscientiously, you don't have

612
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,520
to be convinced that there is an
intelligence communicating to

613
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,720
you in these sessions, because
it's just so clearly that you

614
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,520
engage levels of intelligence
that know you, that look at you,

615
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:39,020
that see you, and that help you
unearth those things which are

616
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:44,140
holding you back and showing you
truths of existence that lie

617
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,240
outside your normal state of
consciousness. But once you see

618
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,080
them, then things begin to make
sense to you. Make more sense,

619
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,100
and you begin to understand what
some of the great spiritual

620
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,540
teachers have been saying and
the great saints of our

621
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,840
different traditions have been
saying for hundreds of years,

622
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,880
it's a living intelligence. You
know, that's really that's why,

623
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:16,860
in our universe, we now have an
approximate idea of just how

624
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,920
vast our universe is. Okay? So
let's just temporarily imagine

625
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:28,460
that the unit the universe has a
mind, that there is a mind of

626
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:34,760
the universe. And then imagine
if you were going to become one

627
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:40,360
with that mind. You really want
to do that. I mean, that's an

628
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,680
extra ordinary. Imagine being
one with every life form, just

629
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,880
on our planet, let alone our
galaxy. It's just vast, vast,

630
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,920
huge energy dimensions here. And
so what these substances do is

631
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,660
open us up and allow these
larger layers of mind with

632
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,040
beings that are part. Part of
that allow them into our

633
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,940
awareness and begin to interact
with them, have a communion with

634
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,220
them, to have a conversation
with them, to have an

635
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,360
interaction with them. And if we
do this in a sustained fashion,

636
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,960
if we do it a little at a
certain level, then we have a

637
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,980
little bit of a communion. Can
teach us some very important

638
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,380
things about ourselves and
about, you know, it can give us

639
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,800
an understanding of what happens
to us when we die. But if we go

640
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,200
deeper and go deeper and go
deeper, we engage this

641
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,860
consciousness, these this
infinite consciousness at deeper

642
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,260
and deeper levels, until
eventually, you know, all form

643
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,920
is left behind. One moves into
domains of what traditionally

644
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,280
call the primal void or
formlessness, and then into the

645
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,440
domain of light, this absolute,
crystalline, clear light.

646
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,620
Unknown: I have so many
questions. Okay, so, Chris,

647
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,480
we're running out of time. So,
you know, I want to know, Chris,

648
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,780
let's many of the people that
are gonna be listening to the

649
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,200
show. I know already that. You
know perhaps they're not gonna

650
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,480
have access to LSD or Ayahuasca
or any of these compounds. Is it

651
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,220
possible to reach these states
through meditation, through

652
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,360
inner work?

653
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,640
Chris Bache: Absolutely,
absolutely. I mean, the

654
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,540
cosmology that emerges, I think,
on this work is not a new

655
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,800
cosmology. It's the same
cosmology we see emerging in the

656
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,920
very deepest. And of course,
there are many levels of

657
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,980
mystical tradition, but in the
very deepest, the highest levels

658
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,380
of teaching, the cosmology that
emerges in psychedelic states is

659
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,060
the same cosmic these are, this
is simply an amplifier of

660
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,580
consciousness. So it's
consciousness that does the

661
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,640
work. It's not that psychedelics
are giving you experiences.

662
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,000
Psychedelics amplify your
consciousness. So naturally,

663
00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:00,700
anything that you experience in
that state will find corollaries

664
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:06,660
to experiences that emerge with
just meditative experiences.

665
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:13,560
Having said that these
experiences can become so deep

666
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:19,440
and so profound, I mean, you
don't usually transcend time

667
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,120
when you're even if you have a
regular and consistent

668
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,680
meditation practice, and you
don't transcend time to go into

669
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,820
the future, into future time,
and you don't necessarily go

670
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:36,920
back to the beginning before the
Big Bang to experience the

671
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,720
context out of which the Big
Bang emerged. I mean, so on the

672
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,860
one hand, yes, you can
experience these things with

673
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:50,800
just meditation, absolutely. On
the other hand, some of these

674
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,360
experiences are so radical that
they only show up in the very,

675
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:00,840
very most subtle spiritual
traditions where they become

676
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,900
comfortable with the things that
I'm saying, talking about

677
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,800
experiencing future time, so on
and so forth.

678
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,780
Unknown: Okay, okay, fair
enough. So I want to move back

679
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,560
into gear of where we were going
with, with where you stopped,

680
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,780
diamond, Luminosity. Let's
address that. I mean, this is,

681
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,380
this is a part of your book that
you, you talk about, and I'm

682
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,100
very curious to sort of hear
your, your first hand account of

683
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,140
what is diamond Luminosity. How
did you engage this? How did you

684
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,680
get to this point? Would you
call it the final point? Would

685
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,540
you call it reaching this state
of oneness with source?

686
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:46,180
Chris Bache: Or, yeah, when this
came earlier than diamond

687
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:56,560
Luminosity, okay, this is, this
is, you know, hard to put this

688
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:04,620
in short, succinct form. When I
did this work. I was, I was 15

689
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,440
years in the work. First, let me
mention, I did four years of the

690
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,920
work. I stopped for six years
for reasons that are in the

691
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,420
book, and then I resumed and did
a very intense 10 years. So even

692
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,140
though it spread over 20 years,
it was actually 14 years of

693
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,140
intense work. So I'm about
halfway through the second

694
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:29,060
that's 10 year period. And I
had, you know, gone through ego

695
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,820
death. I'd gone through the
ocean of suffering, done a lot

696
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,060
of work at the collective level.
I had gone through archetype of

697
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:40,120
reality, and then I went came
into a year of just jaw

698
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,020
dropping, extra ordinary
spiritual experiences of

699
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:49,840
Shunyata, emptiness, the oneness
of existence, primordial void, a

700
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,140
variety of experiences that I
talk about in a book called the

701
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:57,880
benediction of blessings. By the
time I was done with that, I

702
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,580
felt absolutely incomplete.
Completely existentially

703
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,120
satisfied. You know, there was
work that I had been asked to do

704
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:11,100
on behalf of others, and I had
done it voluntarily, and the

705
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,060
universe had rewarded me with
just extra ordinary blessings of

706
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,200
experience. I felt completely
content, but there was still

707
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,920
five years of work to go when
you go through this series of

708
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,220
Death-Rebirth experiences, many
people experience it. When they

709
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,980
come through a Death-Rebirth
experience, they encounter

710
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,420
light. It's very common. One
experiences different orders of

711
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:40,720
light. And this happened for me
too. There were many experiences

712
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,960
of light. Through those years
that I talked about what

713
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,720
happened after the experiences
of oneness, of permutations of

714
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,760
oneness and the primal void, I
went through yet another series

715
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:02,520
of Death-Rebirth experiences,
which brought me into a quality

716
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:08,220
of consciousness that was beyond
individual consciousness, beyond

717
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:14,460
the species mind, beyond even
ONENESS consciousness. It was

718
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:22,640
basically to be a hyper, hyper,
clear, incredibly. It was light,

719
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,060
but but a particular quality of
light. When I use the word

720
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,080
diamond Luminosity, I'm not
using simply a colorful metaphor

721
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,500
to describe the light. I'm
trying to describe a particular

722
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:38,540
quality of light, hyper, hyper
clear. It's just the Buddhist to

723
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:44,620
write to touch it once undoes
1000s of years of wandering lost

724
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:52,600
in Samsara. It's just so clear,
so pure. And in the last five

725
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,880
years of my work, over 26
sessions, I made contact with

726
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,660
this diamond Luminosity four
times and only four times. All

727
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:09,960
right. So for me, the recession
is 45 5060, and 66 very specific

728
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,980
days in between those four
times, tremendous kind of

729
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,520
purification, tremendous
detoxification in order to be

730
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:25,220
able to come back into this
territory. This light how to

731
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:32,960
describe it. Once I touched it
in the 45th session, then it

732
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,240
became the sole agenda of my
work to return to it. There was

733
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,200
nothing that I had touched in
any of the other levels of

734
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,640
consciousness interested me at
all compared to returning to

735
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,140
this light. I think it's very
similar to the light that some

736
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,960
people when they have near death
experiences, when they enter the

737
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,220
light. It's something like that.
It's on the order of that kind

738
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:03,780
of experience. It's in many ways
contentless in lower levels of

739
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,900
consciousness. I had many
experiences of being taken on a

740
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,020
tour of the universe and being
shown this, and being shown

741
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,560
that, how this works and that
works. But when you move into

742
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,340
the diamond Luminosity, or
again, what Buddhism calls

743
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,400
Dharmakaya, the domain of
Dharmakaya. It's, it's

744
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,640
absolutely contentless. It's not
about it's not about content.

745
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,480
It's not about things. It's not
about the dynamics. It's, it's

746
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,680
the quality of consciousness
itself. It's, it's the matrix

747
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,260
within which time and space
emerges. It's the light that

748
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:46,480
infuses all time, space reality
and receives all time. Space

749
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,940
reality at the end of our
lifetime.

750
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:57,280
Unknown: I mean, it's such a
profound state of being. And you

751
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,320
know, like I said, I've said
many times, I truly, sincerely

752
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:08,100
appreciate the way in which
you're explaining it, and it

753
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,600
really does sound you know that
it was resounding for you and

754
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,160
changed you. You know, forever
was there? You know, was there

755
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:23,420
something that you felt, that
you left behind or that you

756
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,880
should have done, because I know
there was a point that you

757
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,840
decided to stop. And yeah, I'm
wondering, you know, what pushed

758
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,420
you up against that decision to
stop? Yeah? And if there was a

759
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,060
sort of catalyst, yeah?

760
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:46,840
Chris Bache: Well, I stopped for
two reasons, as I explained in

761
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:52,420
the book, I stopped because of
pain and because of heartache.

762
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:59,380
The pain was when you move into
the states of consciousness this

763
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,680
large. And this intense, it
activates very, very powerful

764
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,060
waves of energy that move
through your body. And my subtle

765
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,480
energy system, you know, what
the Indians call Prana, and the

766
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,180
Chinese would call Qi, my subtle
energy system, basically, was so

767
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,400
hyper stimulated, was so hyper
aroused that even though I had

768
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,300
done lots and lots of spiritual
practice specifically to work

769
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,680
with my subtle energy system, I
was basically plunging myself

770
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,300
into the furnace of creation so
many times and so deeply that my

771
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:40,780
subtle energy system was having
trouble managing the flows of

772
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:44,320
energy. I mean, I could manage
it all fine on a day to day,

773
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,920
month to month basis, but
cumulatively, I was in a state

774
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,080
of chronic uncomfortableness. I
was uncomfortable in my body,

775
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,120
and I knew that it was time for
me to stop, to let my body cool

776
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:02,280
down, to really focus on
integrating experiences that I

777
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,560
had had, rather than plunging
into still deeper experiences.

778
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,840
Remind me to come back to it's
an infinite progression. Just

779
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,960
remembering, I wanted to say
this, you don't get to an end

780
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,200
point. It's an infinite
progression. But the second

781
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,520
reason I stopped, and the
primary reason was heartache.

782
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:32,420
Basically, when you when, I'll
just keep it personal, going

783
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:37,100
into such hyper, clear, hyper
Transcendence states where you

784
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:42,760
were dissolved into light, you
are light. You are dissolved

785
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,200
into the crystalline body of the
Divine coming back into time

786
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:53,440
space became just too painful
for me. It became I was

787
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:59,200
basically it became too painful
for me to keep going back and

788
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,320
forth and back and forth, I
eventually decided. I realized

789
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,860
it was time for me to stop. It
was time for me to finish

790
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:12,960
digesting everything that I had
had been given, and I just

791
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,440
couldn't take the heartache of
going into the Luminosity

792
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:16,920
anymore

793
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,740
Unknown: because you were
leaving or,

794
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,080
Chris Bache: well, no, I mean, I
knew I was leaving, yeah, at the

795
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,960
end. I mean, at the very end, I
knew I was leaving. I knew that

796
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,220
I would not that there would be
no time in the rest of my life

797
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,200
when I would ever be this
absorbed so intimately into the

798
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,360
universe, because I could not
take a massive dose of LSD and

799
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,480
get into that space today, it
takes years and years of

800
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,440
sustained work to build up the
momentum, to build up the energy

801
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,040
to crack into these states of
consciousness so that I knew

802
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:54,580
when I was leaving. I knew I was
leaving for the rest of my life,

803
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:00,480
and I basically made a deal with
the universe. Should Never bring

804
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,940
me back until I can stay and
that's when I really that's when

805
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:11,700
my sessions really did end. Wow.
Now the thing about it open

806
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:15,300
ended when I was deep in the
diamond diamond Luminosity work.

807
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,620
I was halfway through that five
year period, and I got as deep

808
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,420
into the Luminosity as I ever
went. It was the 50th session,

809
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:29,240
so I was in an extremely clear,
really, really special place.

810
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,940
Right when I was in it, my
visual field pivoted 90 degrees,

811
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:40,360
and I saw reality Far, Far in
the distance. And the light of

812
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:45,580
that reality hit me, and it hit
me like a lightning bolt, and it

813
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:52,060
just shattered me. It just
completely transfixed me. And so

814
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,120
I called it the absolute light,
just to give it a name, but I

815
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,200
knew that there was a reality as
far beyond the diamond

816
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,640
Luminosity as the diamond
Luminosity was beyond space

817
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:08,460
time, and that's when I came to
understand that it's an infinite

818
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,060
progression. Because, like many
people, I had assumed that there

819
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:15,900
was an end to this journey. You
become one with God, or you

820
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,440
enter into the primal, meta,
cosmic void. And I had

821
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,040
experienced oneness with God.
And I learned that there were

822
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,820
many degrees and levels and
permutations of oneness. And I

823
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,640
experienced, had experienced the
void, and I learned there were

824
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,340
even permutations of the void.
But I always assume that there

825
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,400
was an end point. You would
reach a point, and it would be

826
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,080
absolutely you had reached your
destination. Right now for me

827
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,500
personally, the diamond
Luminosity was my end point. It

828
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:49,960
was my destination. It filled as
many experiences had been with

829
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:54,280
an absolute sense of Homecoming,
Homecoming, and just when I was

830
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,280
at this point, the universe
showed me that there are

831
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,080
dimensions of reality beyond any
that I. Be able to touch in this

832
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,800
lifetime, even using this
powerful method, and that's when

833
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,700
I understood it's an infinite
progression. You don't get to an

834
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,600
end point. That's one of the
reasons why I would be gentler

835
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,320
with myself if I were doing it
again, and why I would recommend

836
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,920
that other people be gentle with
themselves. Because the goal, I

837
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,200
think, is not to get to some
state of being or some state of

838
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,340
consciousness which the which is
an end point. The goal, I think,

839
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,360
is to open us to the universe,
and to let us much of the energy

840
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,140
of the creative intelligence of
the universe into our being, to

841
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:39,740
purify ourselves and to engage
it, and to enter into dialog

842
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:44,800
with it, and then basically, let
nature take its course and let

843
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,840
us grow. I'm more patient with a
slower transformational process

844
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,000
than I than I was when I was a
young man.

845
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,260
Unknown: Chris, I mean, I've
thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed

846
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:02,280
this, this conversation, quite
surprised by the preciseness in

847
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,280
your verbiage and the way that
you're discussing and talking

848
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,420
about this, if you could, you
know, somehow bring this all

849
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,040
together and perhaps include a
warning for explorers, people

850
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:19,620
who are, I mean, we've seen this
surgence resurgence In the usage

851
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,960
of psychedelics. Many people use
them without caution, you know,

852
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,700
they're doing them at concerts.
And so if people are going to do

853
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,320
them, you know, and and they're
aiming for connected states,

854
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,560
such as the ones that you
describe, you know, maybe a

855
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,980
warning for those explorers and
those travelers. And then, if

856
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:45,280
you could wrap this together in
being a bow tie, because even

857
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,940
though your journey didn't have,
you know, a specific end point,

858
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,860
this conversation does have an
end point.

859
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:55,540
Chris Bache: So yeah, yes, yes.
The more experience I've

860
01:01:55,540 --> 01:02:00,400
collected using psychedelics,
the more cautions I am and the

861
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,220
more uncomfortable Ian with
people taking psychedelics in

862
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,400
less than controlled
circumstances. Now, many people

863
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,000
have had very deep life changing
experiences tripping, and I

864
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:16,020
wouldn't want to, I don't mean
to criticize that, but when you

865
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,500
are taking a substance that has
the potential to open up all the

866
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,060
sluice gates in your mind and
open up into these deep, deep

867
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:29,420
levels of reality. If you do
this in a complicated or a

868
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,600
socially complicated or
sensitive, sensational,

869
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,020
complicated sensation,
complicated setting. It can be

870
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:41,320
really complicated, and you you
can get over your head quickly,

871
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:47,140
and you can, well, you can get
over your head. You can really

872
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:52,180
have experiences that can leave
you traumatized. And in order to

873
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,380
go where I went, you have to be
willing to enter into

874
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,180
unthinkable places, but you also
have to see all of your

875
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:04,680
experiences all the way through
to the very end. If you stop

876
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,880
midway, if you enter into some
of the intense purification or

877
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:15,240
threatening death of self
spaces, and you try to stop

878
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,600
that, then it's like you leave
the spring coiled in your

879
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,420
consciousness that just always
trying to finish the job. So I

880
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:26,840
really encourage be very, very
cautious. I would hate for

881
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:32,900
anyone to take my book and and
use it as a guide book to try to

882
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,260
have similar experiences and
injure themselves. It would just

883
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,360
be terrible. And it is possible
to injure yourself using these

884
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:46,660
amplifiers, I recommend extreme
caution. And very to note, get

885
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,660
the literature, do your
research. There's lots of good

886
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,840
literature out there, lots of
good books on methodology.

887
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,980
There's more coming out every
year. And if there were a

888
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:03,300
takeaway, if there were one
thing, I wish that I could lift

889
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:09,060
from people's lives, it would be
the fear of death. I mean to me,

890
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:13,740
not only am I not afraid of
dying, I'm honestly and truly

891
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:17,400
looking forward to it. I'm not
looking forward to the dying

892
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,560
itself, but I'm looking forward
to being dead because my

893
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,380
experience of the universe, of
the intelligence of the

894
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:27,620
universe, and the compassion of
the universe and the wisdom of

895
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:32,360
the universe, is such that I
have a sense that I have I have

896
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,680
touched where I'm going when I
die. And it's a magnificent

897
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,620
reality, layers and layers of
reality. And to be afraid of

898
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:46,780
death is to have the whole world
upside down. Time space is where

899
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,840
the hard work is done. Time
space is where we're here and

900
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,660
we're working and we're trying
to regain our consciousness. And

901
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,200
there's lots of important work
to do here. Death is like

902
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:01,080
graduation. Death is like
homecoming. Death is. A return

903
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:07,380
to source and essence. Now, if
you die before you die, you know

904
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,640
there's a monk who said, Those
who die before they die do not

905
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,780
die when they die. It is
possible to enter into the

906
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:20,240
reality that one enters into
after you die, but to enter into

907
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:26,000
that while your body is
physically alive. That is, I

908
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,040
think classically, I wouldn't
say that's what the

909
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,100
enlightenment experience is, but
that's we're going in that

910
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:35,240
direction where you can stand in
the physical world, be

911
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:40,780
completely transparent to
spiritual reality and live

912
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:45,520
consciously in the physical
world and in spiritual reality

913
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,000
at the same time. And there are
many, many permutations of that

914
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,080
kind of experience. But to be
apt, to be afraid of death,

915
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,320
that's such a heartache, because
that's that's to not understand

916
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,480
how the universe works and how
it's organized. That's why my

917
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,780
first book, of the ones you
mentioned, my first one, was a

918
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:10,740
book on reincarnation, because I
think we have a great deal of

919
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:14,160
empirical evidence that
reincarnation is simply true.

920
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,220
And if you don't understand
reincarnation, then you don't

921
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,500
understand your relationship to
the universe.

922
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,360
Unknown: I love it, Chris, this
was such a phenomenal

923
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,140
conversation. If, if you could
just remind me how I say your

924
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:32,540
last name, and also where people
can go your website, URL, yeah,

925
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:32,840
book,

926
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:40,960
Chris Bache: my last name is
pronounced Bache. There people

927
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:47,320
can contact me at this email
address, C, M, Bache, my

928
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:53,620
initials, and Bache at y, s,
u.edu, but within a month,

929
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,040
around the time the book comes
out, around Thanksgiving, I'll

930
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:03,360
have a website complete, and it
will be Chris bache.com and that

931
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,740
will be the easiest way to reach
me.

932
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:10,800
Unknown: Okay, wow, guys, that's
gonna do it for us here at hxp.

933
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:15,120
What a phenomenal conversation.
I hope you guys enjoyed it as

934
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:20,420
much as I did. My guest, Dr,
Christopher Bache, and the book

935
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:25,520
is called LSD and the mind of
the universe, and I guess you

936
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,000
guys have his email address for
those of you that had questions

937
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,960
in the chat that I didn't get to
I apologize if you're listening

943
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,960

944
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,960
discovered the show yet. So one
of the biggest compliments you

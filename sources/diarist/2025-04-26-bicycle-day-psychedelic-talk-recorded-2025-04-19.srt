1
00:00:00,384 --> 00:00:04,164
Ehren Cruz: Before I welcome on
our first wonderful, esteemed

2
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:09,024
keynote presenter, I want to
leave a little quote from Albert

3
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:14,484
Hoffman after he had his great
first psychedelic experience,

4
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:19,464
the psychedelics gave me an
inner joy, an open mindedness, a

5
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:23,000
gratefulness, open eyes and an
internal sensitivity for the

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,780
miracles of creation. I think
that in human evolution has

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,620
never been as necessary to have
the substance of LSD, it is just

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,460
a tool to turn us into what
we're always supposed to be. Now

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,060
with that, I want to welcome
onto the stage here in just a

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,480
moment.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,960
Dr Christopher Bache, who is

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,460
a professor emeritus in the
Department of Philosophy and

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,400
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University where he taught

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,460
for 33 years. He's also an
adjunct professor at the

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,700
California Institute of integral
studies, an emeritus fellow at

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,160
the Institute of Noetic
Sciences, is on the advisory

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,840
board of the Grof legacy
training. Chris's work explores

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,420
the philosophical implications
of Non-ordinary states of

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,240
consciousness, especially
psychedelic states. He's an

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,820
award winning teacher and
international speaker. Chris has

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,880
written four books, life cycles,
a study of reincarnation and

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,580
light of contemporary
consciousness, research dark

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,060
night, early dawn, a pioneering
work in psychedelic philosophy

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,780
and collective consciousness,
the living classroom, an

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,600
exploration of collective fields
of consciousness and teaching.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,300
And of course, what many of you
might be familiar with today,

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,420
LSD, in the mind of the
universe, the story of his 20

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,560
year journey with LSD, everyone,
please welcome Dr Christopher

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:33,860
Bache, you

30
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,160
Chris Bache: what an honor to be
here with you today, to

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,020
celebrate bicycle with you
Today, an opportunity for the

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,760
psychedelic community to come
together, to see each other, to

33
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,740
reunite, make plans for the
future. Now, I know what you're

34
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,220
probably thinking. You look at
me and you think he doesn't look

35
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,040
like he's done a whole lot of
LSD, I think the divine designed

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,340
me as an undercover agent for
the psychedelic revolution. It's

37
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,280
amazing what you can get away
with at a university classroom.

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,740
If you look like an accountant,
I tell my students sometimes, if

39
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,700
I look like on the outside, like
I think on the inside, I would

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:46,240
probably look like Jerry Garcia.
So 82 years since bicycle day,

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,120
82 years, we've come a long way.
We've come up this Think of how

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,080
many people are doing
psychedelics regularly, 82 years

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,380
after Albert Hoffman's first
famous bicycle ride, and the

44
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,280
reasons we use psychedelics,
what draws us into psychedelics

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,700
and how we use them vary
enormously. I mean, if we were

46
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,300
to do an inventory of everyone
in this room, we would find so

47
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,600
many different approaches to
psychedelics, so many different

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,960
methodologies in using
psychedelics, and so many

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,640
different results coming out of
that, and the psychedelic

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,560
testimony of the community
together is always more

51
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,400
important than the psychedelic
testimony of any one individual,

52
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,480
because it's just so many
medicines, so many ways in which

53
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,680
it impacts human consciousness,
so many ways in which we can use

54
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,120
them to draw out the deeper
reserves of human consciousness

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,640
that always the collective is
more important than the work of

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,440
an individual. But what I like
to do, to sort of help seed our

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,860
awareness is sort of talk about
my work some and talk about some

58
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,160
of the potentials that lie, I
think, untapped so far in the

59
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,420
current psychedelic Renaissance.
The current psychedelic

60
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,960
Renaissance is focused
primarily, first on healing.

61
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,880
That's how we're getting
psychedelics back into the

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,880
academic discussion, back into
the intellectual discussion,

63
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,780
back into the mainstream is
demonstrating psychedelics

64
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,220
capacity to heal the wounds of
broken heart, to heal the wounds

65
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,300
of life, even to heal the wounds
of the soul, if it goes deeper.

66
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,360
And this is critically
important, and I understand all

67
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,260
the scientific brethren who are
working hard to document and

68
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,480
legitimate and to verify the
psychedelic the healing that

69
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,720
psychedelics can facilitate and
to refine our ability to

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,240
integrate them into our
psychedelic into our clinical

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,720
practice. Really, really, very
important. But for me, this is

72
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,160
kind of just like the first
stage, the first step into the

73
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,600
deep waters that psychedelics
make available. So. If you think

74
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,040
of the ocean of consciousness,
of consciousness as an ocean to

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,240
me healing or maybe using
psychedelics to augment

76
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,060
creativity, another separate
function, or to sort of generate

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,900
insights to go to psychedelic
states in order to gather

78
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,120
insights that one might use to
apply to one's life for changing

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,480
circumstances. When you have a
choice, I mean every time I have

80
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,740
an important choice, I mean a
big, important choice. I'm not

81
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,100
going to address that only in my
ordinary state of consciousness.

82
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,300
I will go into psychedelic space
to get to that little larger

83
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,140
expansion, a little more
dilation, a little more

84
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,820
communion, little more intake,
and bring my questions there and

85
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,680
then seek the guidance that I'm
asking for. And I follow the

86
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,160
advice I get there. I follow
that advice in terms of what

87
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,240
books I write next, where the
people are, where to go with the

88
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,820
research, healing, creativity,
enhancing creativity. I think of

89
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,060
my friend Alex gray and all the
psychedelic artists in the

90
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,700
movement insight, but these, to
me, collectively, are still only

91
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:20,720
in the shallow waters of the
ocean, near the shore, near

92
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,560
where we live in the personal
world. But then there is, what

93
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,280
if we go deeper? What if we use
our psychedelic protocols to go

94
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,880
deeper into the ocean of
consciousness, and we begin to

95
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,220
get into the area of spiritual
awakening? And I'm thinking, for

96
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,780
example, of the dialog between
the Zen Buddhist, between the

97
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,960
Buddhist community and the
psychedelic community that was

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,860
published years ago zig zag Zen,
which is the question of, are

99
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,180
psychedelics useful in the
facilitation of genuine

100
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,780
enlightenment, or are they a
hindrance, as classical

101
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,300
Buddhists would hold, Spiritual
Awakening, is different than

102
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,560
healing. It's different than
creativity, because here we're

103
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,960
using psychedelics to break into
the deeper universal themes of

104
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,320
human existence. Enlightenment
is not about personal healing.

105
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,740
You may go through personal
healing, of course, to move

106
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,360
there, but enlightenment is
talking is really grappling with

107
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,160
the fundamental human condition
at its core. What is the core

108
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,980
struggle that we are working
with here? What are the core

109
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,220
issues we're dealing with? What
is the nature of my identity

110
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,300
underneath, all the social
conditioning, all the all the

111
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,380
psychological conditioning
underneath, we feel that there's

112
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,800
something more authentic
underneath. What is that deeper

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,600
identity? Until eventually we
come to some type of realization

114
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,380
that the Hindus described as
Atman, the essence of the

115
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,700
individual, is Brahman, the
essence of the totality, the

116
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:04,652
essence of God Atman is Brahman,
awakening to just immersing

117
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:08,852
ourselves into seeing first and
then entering into communion

118
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:12,152
with the creative intelligence
of the universe that permeates

119
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:20,192
all things different than
healing, right, broad, deep,

120
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:23,300
Something which we share with
all of the human beings. Our

121
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,080
personal problems we may not
share with all human beings, but

122
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,380
the deep spiritual questions,
the deep seeking at that

123
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,740
underneath level we share with
all human beings. To me, though

124
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,520
healing, creativity, insight,
spiritual awakening, however you

125
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,820
conceptualize that, wherever you
imagine that is still only into

126
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,200
the sort of mid waters of the
ocean of consciousness. And what

127
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,620
I'd like to talk to you about
today is what I call

128
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,320
cosmological exploration, using
psychedelics in a manner, to

129
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,800
probe the deep structure of
reality at the deepest levels

130
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,420
possible, to see experience,
understand what is the

131
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,220
underlying structure of human
existence? What are the layers

132
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,460
of human existence? What is the
source of creativity, the

133
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,140
creativity that gave birth to
our universe, 13 point 7,

134
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,380
billion years ago, my
psychedelic journey began 45

135
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,860
years ago, when I was a brand
new academic, freshly minted out

136
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,900
of graduate school, beginning my
academic work, and I was a

137
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,260
pretty much an atheistically
inclined agnostic at the time.

138
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,080
That's what seven years of
graduate school in religious

139
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:46,240
studies made me and then I met
Stan Grof work. I met two

140
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
people's work my first year, Ian
Stevenson, whose work in

141
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,440
reincarnation, convinced me, in
one reading, that reincarnation

142
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,380
was a fact of life, just a
simple empirical fact of life.

143
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,360
Deal with it, you know. And
that's an academic that. Wasn't

144
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,480
part of my worldview at all in
all of my training. But then

145
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,480
secondly, more importantly, with
Stan Grof, I read his book

146
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,840
realms of the human unconscious,
which turned my life. It was a

147
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,000
major pivot point. And so I
began the psych of psychedelic,

148
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,100
therapeutically oriented work
that I knew would be required

149
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,980
for me to have access to the
kind of experiences that would

150
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,920
allow me to hopefully make some
kind of contribution to my

151
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,200
discipline, which is philosophy
of religion. So I started a

152
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,740
psychedelic practice, which,
after three medium dose sessions

153
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,500
ended up I ended up developing a
facility for working with high

154
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,100
doses of LSD and developing a
protocol following Stan Grof

155
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,220
protocol. And you know that you
know the drill, right? Total

156
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,540
isolation is not group therapy,
group work. Total isolation,

157
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,860
private, protected with a
sitter, carefully curated

158
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,240
playlist all day, engagement,
start to finish, long day, and I

159
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:11,160
chose to work with 500 to 600
micrograms of LSD. And I don't

160
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:18,540
recommend that protocol, truly
knowing what I know now, at the

161
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,440
end of that journey, I would do
it differently if I were

162
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,680
starting over again. I would
work with lower doses. I would

163
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,540
balance periodically, maybe
working with high doses of LSD,

164
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,680
with maybe intermediate sessions
of Psilocybin or Ayahuasca. And

165
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,340
I have experience with all those
psychedelics that I mentioned,

166
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,600
but my primary work has been
with LSD, so it may be it's

167
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,520
appropriate to speak to that on
bicycle Day, which we honor

168
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:45,880
here,

169
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,980
I chose to work in a Stan Grof
kind of paradigm protocol,

170
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,640
always in isolation, and take
these massive doses of

171
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,440
psychedelics I was taking about
doing it about on average five

172
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,400
times a year when I stepped back
and looked at it all. And it

173
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,480
ended up lasting 20 years. I
worked for four years, I stopped

174
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,080
for six years, and then I
resumed again for very intense

175
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,300
10 years. And over that 20 year
period was between when I was 30

176
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,040
and when I was 50 years old. So
I was kind of in the just

177
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,580
started my Saturn Return at 2930
my whole Saturn, second Saturn

178
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,280
cycle was all under my
psychedelic work. And then I

179
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,720
stopped when I was 50 years old,
and I didn't publish LSD in the

180
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,300
mind of the universe for another
20 years for a couple of

181
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,400
reasons. One is, if I published
that book as an academic, I

182
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,120
probably would have been fired,
because the good people of Ohio

183
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,760
where I was teaching don't like
their university professors

184
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,160
doing massive doses of LSD on
the weekend. So I had to kind of

185
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,420
all my work was secret. None of
my students ever knew what I was

186
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,200
doing. My faculty, my close
friends on the campus, knew what

187
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,780
I was doing, but they didn't
really know. They didn't

188
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,460
understand it. We didn't go into
those conversations. It would

189
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,760
usually start, yeah, I remember
I did some psychedelics back in

190
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,180
the day. Yeah, good. Good for
you. But when you're doing 506

191
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,560
100 micrograms, amplified by the
intensification of the most

192
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,980
powerful music that I could pull
down from the world stage of

193
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,580
music, and just drive it
completely hard, you just

194
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,020
Shatter your mind. You shatter
consciousness. You just blow it

195
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:45,280
all apart, which is a dangerous
undertaking unless you're really

196
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,640
prepared and you really have
your seat belt fastened tight,

197
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,940
and you have a strong support
system and good clinical

198
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,740
grounding, and you have a pretty
solid sense of self, it's not

199
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:02,220
wise to blow yourself apart that
often. But I found I had a

200
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,400
capacity. And astrologically,
it's in my chart. I have a

201
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,980
capacity to get open, spacious,
Neptune, opening up into deep

202
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,720
states. And then I have a I
congeal, easily. I congeal,

203
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,600
well, so the opening and the
expanding, I could manage. And

204
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:27,680
then I found, over the first few
years that I had the capacity to

205
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,020
navigate this domain, and I
developed an interest in working

206
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,260
this hard, because what
interested me was not the

207
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,180
clinical applications. It wasn't
the creative applications. What

208
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,680
interested me was the capacity
of LSD to take me into states

209
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,640
where I could truly enter into
the communion with the

210
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,900
intelligence of the universe,
and then that intelligence would

211
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,220
teach me, just like we all have
that experience, right? You open

212
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,780
up, you go deep, you open into
this larger field. So you clean

213
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,360
up your house working, and you
gotta clean up this and clean up

214
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,540
that. But when you're clean,
when you get out and you take in

215
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,540
this larger it speaks to you. It
teaches you. I've often wished

216
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:18,840
that I had advanced degrees in
quantum physics and astronomy,

217
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,420
quantum astronomy, because if I
had, I would have been able to

218
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,740
understand so much more of what
it was teaching to me. But I had

219
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,280
my background was in Philosophy
and Religious Studies, so it

220
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,660
took me into those areas that I
was most interested in, which is

221
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,900
to understand the paradoxes of
the human condition. Why is it

222
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:46,000
so hard here? Why is human
existence so hard? Why is there

223
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,160
so much suffering? Why are we so
estranged from our deepest

224
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:59,920
connection to the universe?
What? Where is reincarnation?

225
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,280
Since I took that into my
psychedelic Where is

226
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,240
reincarnation taking humanity?
Where are we going? Because

227
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,520
reincarnation lifts time off of
our restricted does time ceases

228
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,100
to be a restriction once you
understand that we're

229
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,020
reincarnating. When
reincarnating, we're

230
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,900
reincarnating. There's no place
to go after you leave here, you

231
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,820
come back, you leave here, you
come back and you begin to open

232
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,700
up a time horizon which is
beginning to understand, perhaps

233
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,540
the time horizon that the divine
thinks in. Because the divine

234
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,840
does not think in small term
projects, and the divine does

235
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,240
not think in personal projects
itself. It thinks in large

236
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,440
projects and species projects
and planetary projects. It

237
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,620
thinks in galactic size
projects. So the challenge

238
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,500
becomes, how do we let ourselves
begin to think experience in

239
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:00,100
galactic size projects? And if
you and the first is to unlock

240
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,680
the barrier of linear time, to
let yourself go beyond the

241
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,100
confines of this process, this
particular moment, as

242
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,820
magnificent as it is, as
beautiful as it is. And this, of

243
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,880
course, is where the divine
lives is in the present moment.

244
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,420
So a lot of spiritual practices
focus on deepening, deepening

245
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,380
experience of the present. But
in psychedelic work, there is a

246
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,380
potential to transcend the
limits of the present, and when

247
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,240
you step outside of linear time
and enter into what I call deep

248
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,840
time, that there are many
dimensions of time in the

249
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,480
universe. There are many levels
of time. There are many

250
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,000
different modalities in which
the universe experiences itself

251
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,380
through the medium of time, and
it will take you into these

252
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:54,160
deep, vast expanses where you
can experience 100,000 years. In

253
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,480
the course of an hour, you can
experience an acceleration of

254
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,420
time that takes you beyond your
personal story into humanity's

255
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,460
story, beyond your personal
growth into humanity's growth,

256
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,580
into the larger evolution that
the divine intent is working to

257
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,180
seed and nourish and bring
forward in the human community.

258
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,000
Where are we going as a
collective? Sri Aurobindo, the

259
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,180
great Hindu sage, Oxford
educated Hindu sage, I always

260
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:38,300
think that's interesting. That's
a story. He had said, humanity

261
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,860
is a transitional species. We're
not stable. We're transitioning

262
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,000
from what we were before Homo
sapiens to what's coming. Yet

263
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,700
everything's in motion. Galaxies
are in motion. Earth systems are

264
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,360
in motion. Humanity is in
motion. Where are we going?

265
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,140
What's it going to look like?
The I have to watch my time

266
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,500
here.

267
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:23,960
I want to inject a cautionary
note. I'm so happy that we're

268
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,840
really spending a lot of time.
We're doing a lot of writing,

269
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,820
and books are being authored on
integration, the importance of

270
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,120
integration, because breaking
out now we have these powerful

271
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,380
chemicals. We can break out of
time, our time space suit,

272
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,600
increasingly easily. But to do
it in a way which is valuable,

273
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,420
to do it the way which we can
bring back something that we can

274
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,940
keep that's actually a harder
part of the work, isn't it, to

275
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,000
bring it in first, to remember
it, because we can go so deep we

276
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,180
can't remember what we
experienced. You have to train

277
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,800
yourself to remember the. Deep
experience is if you go into the

278
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,700
deep waters, into the deep
waters of the ocean, if you go

279
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,380
far beyond personal identity,
even far beyond human identity,

280
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,960
into archetypal reality, into
causal levels of reality, and

281
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,720
into what I call the diamond
Luminosity reality, or what

282
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,220
Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the
clear light of absolute reality.

283
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,740
You go deep into that, you come
back, it's hard to remember what

284
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,580
your experience was. You have to
train yourself to remember those

285
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,960
experiences. The first step of
integration is to remember. But

286
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,880
my experience was that if you go
back systematically in a cleanly

287
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,900
defined, clearly defined
therapeutic context, the first

288
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,800
time you touch a new level of
reality, I would not always be

289
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,820
able to bring it all back, but
if I went back again and again

290
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,860
and again to that level of
reality, I would begin to be

291
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,940
able to see it more, understand
more. There were fewer gaps in

292
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,540
my session notes, it became
clear. I learned how to bring it

293
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,320
back, and I found that this
pattern repeated itself every

294
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,340
time, when I would break into a
yet another deeper level of

295
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,480
reality. First, there would be
the kind of chaos and the

296
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,660
uncertainty and but then with
repetition, I could hold on to

297
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:32,240
more of it. I would bring it
back. I would bring it in. The

298
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,840
second reason I took so long to
write diamonds from Heaven is

299
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,020
not just because I was afraid of
losing my job. And I like

300
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,300
teaching. I like my job. I like
being with students. The second

301
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,800
reason is it took a long time.
It takes a long time to digest

302
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,580
and understand what our
experiences are, because a long

303
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,780
history of psychedelic
experiences, a long journey of

304
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,620
psychedelic work, is very
different than just having one

305
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,300
or two or three interesting
sessions on a Saturday

306
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,800
afternoon. And I think some of
our expectations of psychedelics

307
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:15,000
have been shaped by a literary
tradition around it, which is

308
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,680
based upon very few psychedelic
experiences. Aldous Huxley wrote

309
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,060
his wonderful book, The Doors of
Perception, after only one

310
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,540
experience and you wrote a
beautiful book on one

311
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,220
experience. When Huston Smith,
the great don of Religious

312
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,460
Studies, wrote his book,
cleansing the doors of

313
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,520
perception, where he collected
all of his essays on

314
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,840
psychedelics he had taken LSD
only six times. He stopped, then

315
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,800
he said, because the bummer
seemed to increase and it wasn't

316
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,920
as useful to him and to me,
that's when it starts to get

317
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,500
interesting. When the bummers
increase, that means there's

318
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,260
some deep purification taking
place. Something's coming

319
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,380
forward that's going to be hard
for you to deal with. That's

320
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,400
when it gets interesting. Or
Michael Pollan, when he wrote

321
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,420
his very important book on very
important contribution to

322
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,020
psychedelic community, he had
only taken psychedelics a

323
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,180
handful of times. And this tends
to create a set of expectations,

324
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,140
and I think a very short sighted
set of expectations about what

325
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,760
can happen in a psychedelic
journey and a psychedelic

326
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,680
regimen. But if you go through a
long journey, at least in my

327
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,860
experience, it's not just you're
always starting from the same

328
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,480
spot and getting to the same
level and having experiences at

329
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,380
that level. To me, one goes
through a series of death and

330
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,500
rebirth processes, and the death
of rebirth is a cycle as you go

331
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,880
deeper and deeper and deeper
into the universe, as deep as

332
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,500
one your medicine has the
capacity to carry you. Not all

333
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,920
medicines have the same capacity
to carry you as deeply. Okay,

334
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,360
that's fine. Your capacity to
withstand the chaos that's

335
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,800
inherent in deep psychedelic
exploration and the tightness of

336
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,160
your protocol, whether your
protocol is really designed to

337
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:17,520
holding you in a very carefully
contained container, a Kiva to

338
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,760
support you while you go deep in
and then come back out,

339
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,400
integrate and then internalize.
When I was at the end of my

340
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,940
journey and working up my notes
in order to write the book, I

341
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,860
identified five basic levels at
which I had worked over the

342
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,200
course of time. The first is
personal mind, the level of

343
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,820
personal mind, psychodynamic
territory. The second is the

344
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,780
level of collective mind, the
collective psyche, Carl Jung's

345
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:55,060
territory, but more than Carl
Jung's territory. Third Level

346
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,744
archetypal mind, which is, in my
context, a. That platonic sense

347
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:04,624
of archetypes, not the Jungian
sense of archetypes, but the

348
00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:09,004
Platonic sense of archetypes, is
a domain of reality that lies

349
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:15,724
beyond human species, beyond the
species mind, in a way, just as

350
00:25:15,844 --> 00:25:20,540
in the personal level, your
egoic mind has to fall away for

351
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,200
you to open up into the deeper,
richer experience in the

352
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,180
collective mind, to get into
archetypal reality, the entire

353
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,900
collective mind of humanity has
to fall away from you. You

354
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:38,660
literally lose all of your human
roots. You lose all of the

355
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,060
background, subtle textures of
human consciousness, all the

356
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,000
assumptions of human history, of
the assumptions of human

357
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,240
cognition, drop away and you
enter into a reality of

358
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,500
archetypes, into the reality of
the living beings who are

359
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,020
responsible for creating space
and time, who are responsible

360
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,860
creating some of the four
fundamental core themes of space

361
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:10,440
and time. But beyond archetypal
reality, more cycles of death

362
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,100
and rebirth, entering into
causal reality, where the

363
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,900
signature feature of causal
reality is permeating oneness,

364
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,240
total total oneness. Oneness has
so many permutations, so many

365
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,400
iterations, but in deep causal
reality, the experiencing of

366
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,760
life, free of all dualities,
radical transparency, radical

367
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,260
selflessness, no self here, no
self. There, no self anywhere in

368
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,900
nature, the entire world, as
Plotinus says, lives and

369
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:51,700
breathes as one, us, ants,
archetypes, all of us living and

370
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,780
breathing as one, to sink into
that oneness, to the

371
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,920
intelligence which is the
intelligence underneath it all,

372
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,740
the intelligence that is shaping
us, driving us, teaching us,

373
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,700
expanding us, holding us
accountable in our rigorous

374
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,180
learning that time and space
does, and taking us somewhere,

375
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,880
somewhere deeper, somewhere
richer, somewhere more

376
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,660
satisfying and then beyond,
calls a love reality. For me,

377
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,980
the last five years of my work
were spent exploring what I came

378
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:31,520
to call the diamond Luminosity,
more death and rebirth, entering

379
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,700
into states of luminous clarity,
hyper, hyper, hyper, hyper,

380
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,000
Clear, clear, clear, clear,
beyond imagination, I began to

381
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,820
understand better what the
Buddhist meant when they say

382
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,820
touching it once undos 1000s of
years of karma, because the

383
00:27:51,820 --> 00:28:00,460
hyper clarity is just once I
touched that I wasn't interested

384
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,660
in Anything else that I had been
exploring I'd been 15 years

385
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,560
exploring all these other levels
I talked about, but that reality

386
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,140
is so profound and so rich, it's
the only thing I was interested

387
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,680
in was getting back to that
reality. And I got to that

388
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,720
reality in the last five years
of my work and 26 sessions,

389
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,500
which is an entire third of my
journey. I got to that reality

390
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:31,100
only four four times, four times
out of 26 sessions. A lot of

391
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,980
work being done in those 26
sessions and other things, but

392
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,480
only touching that reality four
times. And they are, for me, the

393
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,740
true diamonds from heaven.
Subtitle of the book,

394
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:53,500
caution, you can go deeper in
the universe, and is wise for

395
00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:00,720
you to go. You can go. You can
have too much God. That seems

396
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,720
like an oxymoron, right? Because
you all it's better to have more

397
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,760
of God, but at least in this
temporary this method which

398
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,200
gives us temporary access and
then brings us back temporary

399
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,560
access and bring us back, I
think at least it's been my

400
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,500
experience, and even though I
paid a lot of attention to

401
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,540
integration, all the way through
physical integration, subtle

402
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,440
energy integration, emotional
integration, social integration.

403
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,820
Even though I had taken all
those precautions, I found in

404
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,920
the end that I had gone so deep
into Transcendence, I had gone

405
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:43,540
so deep into the subtle,
luminous body of the Divine that

406
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,920
I lost my interest in living
inside time and space. Time and

407
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:53,440
space just began to feel kind of
like paper mache when you know

408
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,900
that this reality is not as real
as that reality that is more

409
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,860
real. Than this reality I lost.
I didn't lose my bearings. I was

410
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,340
doing my job, taking care of my
family, and doing all the stuff

411
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,740
that I ordinarily do, but I
found that I was just in my

412
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,760
heart. I was waiting to die so I
could go back, because I reached

413
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,140
a point in my work where I knew
I had to stop for reasons I

414
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,040
talked about in the book, 73
sessions. If you're not cooked

415
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,800
by 73 sessions, forget it. 74 is
not going to give it to you. I

416
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:38,180
was cooked. I was overcooked. I
was waiting to die. I knew that

417
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,160
I would not do any more deep,
deep work. And to go deep, it

418
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,460
takes years and years. It's like
training an Olympic athlete. You

419
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,240
don't run out and break the
takes years to develop the

420
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,600
momentum, the psychic momentum,
to be able to get back into this

421
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,820
territory. I could not get back
into the territory today, now

422
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,500
that I've stopped this work 20
plus years, I could not get back

423
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,680
into the territory I was
exploring at the end, no matter

424
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,660
how heavy a dose of LSD I took
today, it takes time to be able

425
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,360
to develop the momentum to move
there. So I reached a point

426
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,500
where I knew I had to stop. It
was time to stop, and I knew I

427
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,640
would not get back into this
reality until I died. This is

428
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,420
one of the differences, maybe,
between using psychedelics for

429
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:32,840
spiritual awakening, where the
goal is to be a goal is to

430
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,200
consume all one's karmic
fixations and all one's blocks

431
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,920
until one can enter into the
transparent condition and enter

432
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,800
into the deep communion with the
eternal dimension of existence

433
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,260
as it courses through this
present moment right here, a

434
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,920
noble goal and the spiritual
masters have always been my

435
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:00,660
guides on my journey. This is
seven different to enter into so

436
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,640
deep into deep time where you're
dealing with the evolutionary

437
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,980
story of humanity, so deep into
the light which is the source

438
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:20,120
from which the Big Bang
exploded. When I stopped my

439
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,840
sessions after I stopped my
sessions to took me about 10

440
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,860
years to sort of reground myself
in being committed to living out

441
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,160
the rest of my life inside time
and space. And when I say that,

442
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,940
I don't mean that I was, I was
totally functional in the world.

443
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,680
I was doing all the things I
would have to do, but in terms

444
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,080
of recommitting myself to living
in the imminent divine, instead

445
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,000
of immersing myself in the
transcendent divine, it took me

446
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,480
10 years to kind of recommit
myself until I could be

447
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,480
comfortable living in the
imminent divine, and That's why

448
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,800
a word of caution, you can't go
too deep. You can't go deeper

449
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,980
than is good for you. You can go
deeper than is good for your

450
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,720
family, the people who depend on
you. Where is reincarnation

451
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,560
taking us? I've talked about the
sort of large trajectory. Where

452
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:27,500
is reincarnation taking us.
There was a point in my sessions

453
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,900
where, and again, I haven't had,
you know, I've always envious of

454
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,140
people who have teachers, lots
of teachers. I mean, I think

455
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,440
that's great. That's really
important. I don't have lots of

456
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,000
teachers. I've only had one
teacher, and that's the

457
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,220
universe. That's the
consciousness of the universe

458
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,720
itself, that's been my only
teacher, and it's been rigorous

459
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,880
teacher. I mean, beat me up,
break me down, crush me, love

460
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,900
me, bring me back to life
multiple times, only one

461
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,880
teacher. And so there was this
one particular day where the

462
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
teacher seemed to be interested
in showing me where

463
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,220
reincarnation was taking us. And
I experienced all of my former

464
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,400
lives beginning to come back
into me, fast and furious. I

465
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,400
mean, I had done past life
therapy, had a sense of my

466
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,720
history, but this was larger.
They were all coming back very

467
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,860
quickly. And there was like
wrapping kite string around a

468
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,580
kite spool. His lives were
coming back. And eventually

469
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:34,460
there reached a time where they
fused. They seemed to fuse into

470
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,240
one. And with that fusion, there
was an explosion of energy that

471
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,720
just exploded inside my chest,
and it was my first deep contact

472
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:51,100
with diamond light, and I call
this, I was catapulted into a

473
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,840
state of consciousness where I
was an individual. It wasn't

474
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,080
like losing all boundaries and
entering into oneness. I was an

475
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,400
individual. But I was an
individual beyond any frame of

476
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,840
reference I'd ever known before,
and I came to understand that

477
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,980
this is where reincarnation is
taking all of us, every one of

478
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:20,600
us, we reincarnate, we die, we
come back. We die, we get big

479
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,380
into the soul, we come back into
our incarnate life. We die. We

480
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,080
get big into the soul. We come
back. And if we keep this up, if

481
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,200
we keep this rhythm up of
expansion, contraction,

482
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:39,320
expansion and contraction, and
keep it up hundreds of 1000s of

483
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,380
years, we keep it up, expanding,
contracting, dying, being born,

484
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,300
dying and being born sooner or
later. Doesn't it make sense,

485
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,940
sooner or later, that the entire
totality of our lives, which we

486
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,600
meet, when we die, when we
return to our total soul, that

487
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,280
that totality of integrated
historical experience would

488
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,160
incarnate eventually inside time
and space. And that's what's

489
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,160
happening, I think, with the
birth of the diamond soul, we

490
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,200
are giving birth to the next
form of human consciousness. And

491
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,680
the next form of human
consciousness is a human being

492
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,860
whose mind is the repository and
the integrated into a

493
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,900
singularity of all the
experiences he or she they have

494
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,720
ever had in all of their lives.
And now they look at the world

495
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,220
and they know they're not this.
They know they're not 100 year

496
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,720
old being they know that their
relationships are steeped in age

497
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,680
and steeped in time. They know
that their life projects are

498
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:01,980
steeped in 1000s of years of
practice, not 100 years. I don't

499
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,480
think we can continue to run
this planet on the basis of

500
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,220
egoic consciousness, the egoic
consciousness, and I think ego

501
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,520
is a beautiful thing. I'm not
going to bad mouth ego,

502
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,480
individual consciousness is a
magnificent, beautiful,

503
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,080
potentiating, empowering thing.
But left to its own devices,

504
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,920
it's also tends to be cut off
from each other, cut off from

505
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,060
the earth. We've created a
civilization based upon the

506
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,780
psychological limitations and
assets of egoic consciousness,

507
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,960
and right now this civilization
is generating problems of a

508
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,940
magnitude which I don't think
can be solved operating out of

509
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,680
egoic consciousness. We
literally can no longer afford

510
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,420
the luxury of being children on
this planet. We have to grow up.

511
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,980
And growing up, I think, means
owning ourselves, owning our

512
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,380
histories, owning our former
lives, owning the Destiny that's

513
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,880
carrying us through time,
arching through time, taking us

514
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,480
into not our plan for the human
future,

515
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,880
but some I call it the divine.
I'm not always comfortable with

516
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,680
that word, because, you know,
it's been sullied by our world's

517
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,460
religions. But the creative
intelligence the universe, the

518
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,760
creative intelligence that's
taking us into billions and

519
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,500
billions and billions of years
more still to come, which we

520
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,700
have not seen. Personally, I
think we are entering a time of

521
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:42,880
history of profound challenges.
The challenges we're facing are

522
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,000
not simply political and social
challenges. So they're there.

523
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,900
They're not simply ecological
challenges. So that's going to

524
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,600
be coming more and more and more
and more powerful as we move

525
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,940
forward deeper into the 21st
century. At core, all of these

526
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,440
simple all of these challenges,
I think, are symptoms of a

527
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,880
challenge of consciousness, we
literally do not know who we

528
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,740
are. We don't know what we are.
All we have to do is look at the

529
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,100
White House to see that we do
not know who we are. We do not

530
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:19,140
know what we are, and we cannot
afford to run on this incomplete

531
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,840
knowledge any longer. The
universe is taking us into a

532
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,900
profound death and rebirth
process, which in many ways will

533
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,080
be very similar to the death and
rebirth process that we have

534
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,160
seen mystics go through when
they enter the dark night of the

535
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,840
soul, a time of intense
purification, purification,

536
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,860
purification until their
natural, spontaneous, spiritual

537
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:50,680
nature shines free, just as
happens in psychedelic sessions

538
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,920
when we go through those very
dark sessions, which are just

539
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,400
turgid and they're painful and
they're difficult, but you

540
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,840
embrace it and you just take it
down to the bottom. Into you go

541
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,340
through the death process, and
then you're spun into clarity,

542
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,600
kindness, compassion,
understanding, wisdom. I think

543
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,580
the entire planet is going into
a Death-Rebirth process, and

544
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,960
that's why, ever since my book
dark night, early dawn, I talk

545
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,500
about the dark night of our
collective soul, the

546
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,460
purification of our collective
psyche, purification of our

547
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,860
collective institutions. We are
going into a period which, just

548
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:38,660
as in a psychedelic session, we
lose control. We're losing

549
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,260
control of all the things we
could have thought we could

550
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,040
assume about culture and
civilization. We're losing

551
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,520
control of the ordinary
assumptions of life. We're going

552
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,500
to be facing challenges
unprecedented. The oceans are

553
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,020
rising. You know that? You know
the scenarios you don't I don't

554
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,120
have to repeat them, just coming
at us very fast. Cities going

555
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:12,480
underwater, mass migrations. Eco
ego, migrant migrants, not that

556
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,740
eco migrants.

557
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:26,600
We're entering into the time of
the great undoing, just as in a

558
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,960
psychedelic session or on a
meditation cushion, you have to

559
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,080
face the deepest fears, the
deepest anger, the deepest

560
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:46,480
terrors, in order to melt into
the truer condition, into the

561
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,800
lasting condition, into the true
peace that satisfies the inner

562
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,260
longing. Our culture is going to
do that. I have no idea how it's

563
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,800
going to do it, but in my
sessions, I have seen it. I've

564
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,820
experienced it in deep time, a
period of profound trauma, of

565
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,480
profound uncertainty and a deep
unraveling of the human

566
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,140
community. And yet my
experience, at least, is that we

567
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,220
make it through this. We come
through it. We don't survive it.

568
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,880
We die and we come through a
change transformed that in this

569
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,700
international crisis, we go
through a process and experience

570
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:37,280
that just breaks open the human
heart and oneness is born in the

571
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,440
human family, concentrated in
some individuals subtly

572
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,760
pervasive for the collective as
a whole, the theme of oneness,

573
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,300
the theme of compassion, the
theme that makes all our

574
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,620
intelligence and all our
discoveries safe. We will stop

575
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,360
using them for war. We will stop
using them for destruction. We

576
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,800
will start using all of our
talents to serve the common

577
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:09,660
good. I think the global crisis
that we're going into is

578
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,800
synergistically coupled to the
psycho spiritual process that we

579
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,280
are going through in the birth
of the diamond soul and as we

580
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,740
experience our perpetual
transformation taking place in

581
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,860
our psychedelic sessions. That
is, the world is trying to

582
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,720
become one. We cannot solve our
problems within the world of

583
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,340
nation states. Just as the world
is trying to become one, the

584
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:38,420
soul is trying to become one.
There's an inner wholeness here.

585
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,660
We are trying to become our
deepest self, our deep soul

586
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,960
self, just as the world is
trying to become one, and

587
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,160
there's a synergistic coupling
that I think that as the world

588
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,220
transitions into and through
this crisis, the world is

589
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:03,240
composed of souls. And souls are
not 100 year old things. Souls

590
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,040
are 100,000 year old things. And
the means that the humanity

591
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,600
that's going into this crisis is
a humanity of 100,000 year old

592
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,680
beings. And personally, I'd
rather go into a global crisis

593
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,480
with 100,000 year old beings
than I would with 100 year old

594
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,480
beings, because we have the
knowledge, we have all the

595
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:30,560
knowledge, we have the capacity,
it's within us. This is one of

596
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,760
the most exciting centuries you
could possibly be alive in. I

597
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,020
think the changes by the end of
the 21st century and beyond, we

598
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,320
will be living in a very
different world than the world

599
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,280
we're living in now, I don't
know how long it will take us to

600
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,680
make this, navigate this, I
think at least three

601
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,060
generations, maybe more. This is
not something which is going to

602
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:59,920
be accomplished quickly and
easily. And I'd like to end the.

603
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,040
By reminding ourselves of the
power of psychedelics to

604
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,480
profoundly impact one of the
scariest things that human

605
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:22,460
beings go through in this life
is dying. My wife of 25 years,

606
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:30,080
Christina, died a month ago, six
weeks ago. She had cancer. She,

607
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,640
like me, was a Psychonaut. She
had extensive experience of

608
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,020
spiritual reality, and this
completely changed her death and

609
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:47,860
my experience of her death, she
was not afraid of dying. She

610
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,760
knew where she was going. She
had had first hand experience

611
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:56,560
where she was going. And that
changes death from a sort of

612
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:02,820
crushing experience of defeat or
fear and uncertainty into a

613
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:07,860
celebration of a life well
lived, a life that was brought

614
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:14,520
to rich fruition conclusion, and
therefore, knowing that she was

615
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,020
returning home into the arms of
the Beloved, she was returning

616
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,240
home to The Great Mother which
had given birth to her. There's

617
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:29,420
no fear here. There's joy and
celebration. And this is the way

618
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,960
it's supposed to be. This is
what the Center for conscious,

619
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,620
living and dying is helping
bring about in the community

620
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:42,400
here. This is what death really
is. Death is the celebration.

621
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,980
Death, you should mourn children
who are being born, they're

622
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:53,440
beginning the hard work. Death,
you're graduating, you're going

623
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:00,360
back home, right? Psychedelics.
Christina had a lot of

624
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,380
psychedelic experience, it did
not psychedelics were not part

625
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,120
of her active dying process. It
was already done beforehand. She

626
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,760
took what she had learned into
her dying and therefore engaged

627
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,560
death differently than other
people might engage death. If

628
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,220
there were one thing I wish I
could take out of all the

629
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,860
psychedelic work I'd done for
all those years, if there were

630
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,860
one thing I wish I could just
reach into my heart and give it

631
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:34,340
to people, it would be, please
lose your fear of death. If

632
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,760
you're afraid of dying, you have
your cosmology all upside down.

633
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,860
Death is returning to the world
of plenty, the world of

634
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,160
fullness, the world of light,
the world of super intelligence,

635
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,340
the world of understanding, the
world of infinite compassion.

636
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,460
Being born in Asheville, maybe
not so much. We have to work

637
00:47:54,460 --> 00:48:00,040
hard here. We have to work hard
there. We receive the rewards of

638
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:06,180
the work that we've done, what a
revolution, 82 years since that

639
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,080
bicycle ride, and we're just
getting started. Aaron said,

640
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,980
we're just getting started. We
are just in baby steps. If we

641
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,940
look forward to 15 years, if we
look forward to 50 years, if we

642
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,760
look forward to 100 years, just
imagine, if we handle this

643
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,440
transition well, if we harness
the energy of psychedelics,

644
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,740
conscientiously, responsibly,
wisely, then we can affect, we

645
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,840
can accelerate this generational
change that we're trying, that I

646
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,040
think nature And the divine
intelligence is trying to bring

647
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:47,380
about in the human family, and
we are all part of this

648
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:51,520
revolutionary transition. Simply
by being here, we are

649
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,120
acknowledging that we are part
of this revolutionary

650
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,420
transition. Thank you very much.
You

651
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,040
Ehren Cruz: thank you so much,
everybody, please. Dr

652
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,000
Christopher Bache, applause.

653
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,280
Just taking a moment to just
honor this man's profound

654
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,280
courage. You know, as I shared
before, the mental health the

655
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,140
healing dynamic is the on road
to our reintegration of

656
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,260
psychedelics into our culture,
into our community, and very

657
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,760
much an important on road for
many reasons, but as he has

658
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,940
shared the exploration to
consciousness, into our

659
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,300
connection, to our spirituality
and to our cosmology, there is a

660
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,660
frontier. There a profound
frontier that maybe many of the

661
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,760
ancients might have been aware
of as well, that we are re

662
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,140
stepping into. So let's carry
that in our hearts as we are now

663
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:03,360
expressions. Of this possibility
we are active members in this

664
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,600
great learning that has been
tasked to us. How do we take

665
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,960
these medicines and grow and
learn beyond the self into a

666
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,180
collective, into a holistic
being?

1
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,140
Unknown: Good morning, so I now
have the joy of introducing to

2
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,380
you our first speaker this
morning, and also, I have to

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,200
say, one of my most influential
teachers, Christopher Bache.

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,460
Chris is professor emeritus in
the Department of Philosophy and

5
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,640
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University, where he

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,520
taught for over 30 years in
psychology of religion,

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,160
Transpersonal studies, Buddhism
and Eastern religions. For two

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,040
years, Chris was the director of
transformative learning at the

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,120
Institute of Noetic Sciences in
Petaluma, and he is also adjunct

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,380
faculty at CIS where each of his
classes feels like one is being

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,520
held and participating in a
transformative sacred container.

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,220
His publications include life
cycles, the living classroom and

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,180
his groundbreaking work, dark
night, early dawn this morning,

14
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,880
Chris will be speaking on
exploring the boundaries of

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,000
death and rebirth in LSD
psychotherapy. Please join me in

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,080
welcoming Chris Bache. You

17
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,280
Chris Bache: Good morning,
everyone. It's a true joy to

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,760
join you this morning in the
continuing celebration of Stan

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,560
Grof, extraordinary lifetime
accomplishment as a scholar, a

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,980
healer and a pioneer, like many
others in this room, Stan has

21
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,040
had a profound influence on my
life. He changed the direction

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,300
of my professional and personal
life. The turning point for me

23
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,560
came in 1978 I just finished
graduate school in philosophy of

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,800
religion, which left me an
atheistically inclined agnostic

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,420
and begun my career as a young
academic. I was in a time of

26
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,020
transition, and I didn't know it
at the time, but I was in a

27
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,940
Saturn Return, and I read realms
of the human unconscious, and in

28
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,260
that one reading, I found my
life's work. I was convinced

29
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,500
that the people who would make
the most substantial

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,800
contribution to my field and
philosophy of religion, would

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,860
soon be writing out of an
experiential basis, not simply a

32
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,700
conceptual basis. And here was a
man who was opening up a

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,160
methodology for exploring the
deep psyche that was more had so

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,660
much extraordinary potential and
with such solid scholarship

35
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,500
behind it, that I knew I could
trust this man. So I made the

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,720
choice to begin what turned out
to be a 20 year journey, working

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:57,160
with high doses of LSD that
lasted between 1979 and 1999 and

38
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,260
what I'm going to talk about
today basically comes out of my

39
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:09,060
attempts to understand my
experiences on that journey and

40
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,500
after this journey, my life has
never been the same. How do you

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,620
thank someone for such a gift as
that? The experience of dying

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,000
and being reborn is one of the
central dynamics of Holotropic

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,620
and psychedelic work, and at the
same time, it's deeply puzzling.

44
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,000
This morning, I'd like to share
with you my attempts to address

45
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,880
three basic questions about the
Death-Rebirth dynamic. First

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,640
question, why does death become
as large as it sometimes does in

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,460
psychedelic therapy. Secondly,
why does death repeat itself so

48
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,960
many times in this long process?
And third, and perhaps most

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,340
difficultly, why what is
actually dying in the

50
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,880
Death-Rebirth process along the
way, I'd like to also revise the

51
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,060
discussion of Death-Rebirth that
I presented in my book Dark

52
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,020
Night early dawn, which I now
find to be incomplete. Now I'm

53
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,020
just going to be giving you
quick bullet points this morning

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,040
of an article that discusses
this in greater length. This

55
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,160
article will appear. There we
go. Okay. Well, back, back.

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,460
Okay. This is the book that Tom
Roberts mentioned yesterday,

57
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,620
edited by Harold Abram Evans.
Evans is Harold here. Raise your

58
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,800
hand. This is a wonderful two
volume book. Many of the

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,280
speakers who are presenting here
today are included in this two

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,960
volume work, and you'll find a
more complete discussion of what

61
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm going to be presenting today
here. So let's jump into it. Why

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,180
does death become as large as it
sometimes does in LSD

63
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,380
psychotherapy? I wrote dark
night, early dawn, in part to

64
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,980
answer this. Question, so I need
to give you a little bit of

65
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,380
background. My first two years
of psychedelic work were focused

66
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,920
on the perinatal level of
consciousness. For two years, my

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,980
sessions were filled with the
usual perinatal symptomology,

68
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,120
extreme existential
confrontations, convulsive

69
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,500
seizures and various forms of
fetal experiences, and then this

70
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,340
eventually culminated in a
Death-Rebirth experience that

71
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,060
turned my life inside out and
snapped my identity like a twig.

72
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,340
I began the day as a white
middle class, fresh out of the

73
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,440
Ivy League, philosopher obsessed
with the meaning of life, and I

74
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,760
was forced to become women,
hundreds of women of color,

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,960
women with no educational
background, women with no

76
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,620
philosophical horizons. And it
was frightening. The inversion

77
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,320
of my values, and particularly
the loss of my sexual identity

78
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,740
was shattering. It was the
perfect hell for a male

79
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,460
academic. When I lost the
distinctions that had defined my

80
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,400
life, I died and I was reborn
into a new world, the world, the

81
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,500
extraordinarily beautiful world
of the feminine explored under

82
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,600
the arm of the great mother.
Immediately after this, a new

83
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,200
cycle began, in which I was
repeatedly immersed in

84
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,560
experiences of collective
anguish that dwarfed these early

85
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,000
sessions and shattered all my
previous frames of reference. In

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
this second phase, I entered an
ocean of suffering that expanded

87
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,400
session by session until it
eventually encompassed the

88
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,940
entire history of the human
race. The dying in these

89
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,500
sessions was vast and elemental
in scale and intensity. One

90
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,600
excerpt will give the flavor the
anguish thickened into a

91
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,060
terrible horror acted out around
me on all sides. The forms of

92
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,180
the horror were so many that
there was no way to describe it.

93
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
Disembowelings by the score, the
mauling of lives, deaths in the

94
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,480
1000s, swirling forms so
complex, multi dimensional and

95
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,480
multi thematic that isolated
images barely stand out. It was

96
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,660
war, savagery, destruction,
killing and anguish. It lasted

97
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,100
hours. I know many in this room
have had similar experiences.

98
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,600
This phase of work lasted four
years and 28 sessions, one year

99
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,940
of active work, then a six year
break, followed by three years

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,860
of active work. My first
interpretation of these

101
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,760
experiences was to see them as
leading to a deepening of ego

102
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,540
death, as leading to a more
complete ego death. My

103
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,900
assumption was that if any form
of death were taking place in a

104
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,540
session, there had to be pieces
of dying in somewhere in the

105
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,800
mix, pieces of ego dying
somewhere in the mix. What did

106
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,080
the sensation of dying attach
to, if not to an ego Eventually,

107
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,980
however, this assumption was
overwhelmed by the sheer volume

108
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,020
and intensity of the collective
suffering involved. These

109
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,620
episodes went on for too many
years and were too extreme in

110
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,820
their content for me to continue
seeing them as being drawn in

111
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,500
through resonance to a core of
unfinished ego death. This

112
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,400
forced me to reassess the
boundaries and the goal of the

113
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,920
entire therapeutic enterprise.
The conclusion I eventually came

114
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,880
to was that these collective
episodes were not primarily

115
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,620
aimed at the transformation of
my personal consciousness, but

116
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,300
rather they were aimed at the
transformation and healing of

117
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,060
the species mind as a whole. In
dark night, early dawn, I

118
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,480
abandoned the person centered
narrative I had been assuming

119
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,440
that the goal of therapy was the
healing of the individual, and

120
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,460
adopted a larger narrative by
integrating Rupert sheldrakes

121
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,620
concept of Morphic fields into
Stan's paradigm, the way open to

122
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,540
viewing these collective ordeals
as part of A larger process

123
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,920
aimed at healing the scars that
humanity still carried in its

124
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,600
collective memory. I think that
in these highly energized

125
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,960
states, the field of the
collective psyche is sometimes

126
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,520
activated so intensely that it
triggers a collective healing

127
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,560
process through some fractal
flip that I had not even thought

128
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,640
possible at the time, the
patient in My Sessions had

129
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,460
stopped being me and had become
humanity itself, or some part of

130
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,100
humanity. So I want to show you
a couple of slides. But to do

131
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,780
this, I have to sort of show you
the vocabulary. First. Stan's

132
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,180
perinatal matrices organized as
a cycle, and then drawing upon

133
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,660
Rick and Stan's work on the
correlations between the

134
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,560
planetary archetypes and the
perinatal matrices, changing

135
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,780
this into the glyphs where one
Neptune, Saturn, Pluto and

136
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,980
Uranus, and then this image
simply an image to suggest the

137
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,460
relationship between ego,
represented as the little drop

138
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,120
at the bottom and the vast
expanse of tart, of perinatal,

139
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,260
of the Transpersonal territory
and the Death-Rebirth cycle at

140
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,040
the perinatal level, at the
interface between personal

141
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,880
consciousness and Transpersonal
consciousness

142
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,540
in dark, night, early dawn, I
kept the perinatal vocabulary to

143
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,020
describe these collective
ordeals, but I tried to stretch

144
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,520
the rationale for their
appearance. I proposed that a

145
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,500
person's experience of the
perinatal domain could tilt or

146
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,220
slant towards either the
personal or the Transpersonal

147
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,420
side of that interface. If your
parent if your perinatal

148
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,360
experience tilted in the
personal side, you might

149
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,900
experience the loss of your
physical identity intertwined

150
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,100
with reliving your biological
birth. But I hypothesize that if

151
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,260
your perinatal experience tilted
towards the Transpersonal side

152
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,200
of the interface, then you might
experience your death and

153
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,240
rebirth in a state of profound
fusion with the human species,

154
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,600
in which case the birth canal
would become the birth canal of

155
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,300
history. I also suggested that
there were two tiers of death

156
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,140
and rebirth operating here, one
tier aimed at personal ego

157
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,160
death, and another tier aimed at
collective ego death, trying to

158
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,960
hold these two together. At the
present time, however, I've

159
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,640
shifted to what I think is a
simpler and more elegant way to

160
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,840
understanding these episodes. My
current thinking emphasizes that

161
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,560
death and rebirth is an
archetypal cycle that repeats

162
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,400
itself many times as we move
through deeper stages of

163
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,660
psychedelic unfolding. It is a
wheel that, like the wheel of

164
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,600
Buddha, Dharma, turns multiple
times being an archetypal wheel

165
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,440
any single Death-Rebirth
experience can draw in elements

166
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,780
from multiple levels of reality,
but being a cycle, it repeats

167
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,040
itself in different forms as one
moves into deeper dimensions of

168
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,540
consciousness. So the essence of
my revision of dark night, early

169
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,120
dawn is this, rather than seeing
these episodes of collective

170
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,540
suffering, at least in my
experience, as a protracted

171
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,980
first turning of the wheel of
death and rebirth, now I see

172
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,480
them as a second turning of that
wheel. They are the second

173
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,620
movement of a larger symphony, a
movement taking place at the

174
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,360
subtle level of consciousness, a
movement whose dynamics are

175
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,740
inherently collective, focused
on the collective patient and

176
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,300
aimed at a collective
transformation in a personal

177
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,020
Exchange. Exchange with Stan on
this topic, he supported this

178
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,600
revision. He wrote me quote, I
feel that for clarity, we should

179
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,560
change the terminology and make
it clear that the term perinatal

180
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,100
should be used only for fetal
experiences and not for

181
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,400
experiences of death and rebirth
on higher levels of the

182
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,880
Transpersonal spectrum with no
relation to biological birth. So

183
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,260
that brings us now to the next
question. The second question,

184
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,280
why does dying repeat itself so
many times in psychedelic

185
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:57,880
therapy? Let me return to my
personal story. When this long

186
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,740
phase of collective dying and
being reborn had ended. It was

187
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,280
followed by a series of five
overwhelming positive sense

188
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,780
sessions that seemed to
constitute a mega rebirth. I

189
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,860
felt overwhelmed by grace and
filled with blessings. I had a

190
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,500
deep sense that I had
accomplished the primary purpose

191
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,360
of my entire incarnation. At
this point, I didn't know what

192
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,560
to expect after all these years,
I hoped that the dying, the

193
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,300
ordeal of dying, would stop
sooner or later. I thought the

194
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,340
transition to Transpersonal
reality would become easier, and

195
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,300
it would have, I think, if I had
stayed within the boundaries of

196
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,980
Transpersonal experience that I
had been initiated into thus

197
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,180
far. But for better or for
worse, the method of exploration

198
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,860
I was you I had chosen to use
was so powerful that it kept

199
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,920
pushing me beyond my
experiential limits, and I was

200
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,480
working with five, 600
micrograms in of LSD in totally

201
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,360
internalized sessions that are.
You know, the whole works. So

202
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,960
another image, I don't have any
interest, vested interest in how

203
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,260
many cycles of Death-Rebirth,
and how you describe the

204
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,260
multiple levels of reality. I'm
going to be using the language

205
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,720
of psychic, subtle, causal
levels of reality. But we may

206
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,900
have many different maps for
mapping the vast expanse of

207
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,840
Transpersonal territory. It's
just the principle that I'm

208
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,960
trying to illustrate with this
graphic. Over the next six years

209
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,420
and 35 sessions, a third phase
opened in the work in which I

210
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,740
was propelled through a series
of Death-Rebirth experiences

211
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,660
that drew me ever more deeply
into the divine. I was spun into

212
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,500
the radiance of what the
Buddhists call sambhogakaya, and

213
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,000
what I came to call the domain
of diamond Luminosity. I had

214
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,480
known light many times before
this, but this was an

215
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,960
exceptionally pure light. It was
a different order of reality

216
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,000
altogether. Its clarity was so
overwhelming and its energy so

217
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,680
pure that returning to it became
my only goal, and it completely

218
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,760
extinguished any residual
interest I had in exploring

219
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,920
dimensions of archetypal reality
that had previously fascinated

220
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,860
me. This is something different.
When this phase was over, I

221
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,600
counted six cycles of death and
rebirth. There were many deaths,

222
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,800
of course, but six seminal
breakthroughs. And it's the

223
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,800
pattern of experience that's
important to the point I'd like

224
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,320
to make here, that death and
rebirth is a cycle that repeats

225
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,240
itself at successive levels of
initiation into the cosmos, no

226
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,800
matter how complete and
satisfying each rebirth was, it

227
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,460
was in time followed by more
experiences of dying as the

228
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,000
spiral continued to turn. Death
repeats itself, not because it

229
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,560
has failed to hit the mark and
ego has survived, but rather

230
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,040
because the Divine is an
infinite landscape with

231
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,620
countless levels to explore each
death is a gateway to what lies

232
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:22,220
beyond. In his beautiful book,
the ultimate journey. Stan

233
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,280
describes some of the forms that
death can take at these

234
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,600
Transpersonal levels. He writes,
we may identify with our

235
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,300
ancestors or people from
different countries and

236
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,720
historical periods who are dying
or whose lives are threatened.

237
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,840
Such sequences from the
Collective Unconscious can

238
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,040
sometimes be associated with a
sense of personal remembering,

239
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,840
which characterizes them as past
incarnational memories. Death

240
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,140
can even be experienced in full
identification with an animal or

241
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,400
plant. Death is also powerfully
represented in the collective

242
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,480
unconscious as mythological
motifs of death and rebirth and

243
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,460
as various eschatological
themes, including specific death

244
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,900
gods and underworlds of various
cultures, the archetype of death

245
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,760
astral or Bardo realms, the post
humanist journey of the soul and

246
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,700
abodes of the beyond. Only Stan,
I think, could write a sentence

247
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,900
like that, really. And you know,
he knows what he's talking

248
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,340
about. That's what gives that's
what's so amazing. I really, I

249
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,740
wouldn't, I don't think I would
have had the courage to go some

250
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,980
of the places I went if I had
not known that he had gone there

251
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:40,540
before me and lived to tell the
tale. At whatever level it takes

252
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,680
place the core of dying is
always the same, complete loss

253
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,900
of control, absolute surrender,
a disorientation so deep that it

254
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,700
dissolves reality as we have
known it. And rebirth is always

255
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,300
the same, the experience of
awakening inside a new and

256
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,340
unanticipated dimension of
reality, the birth of a new

257
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,440
identity with new capacities,
the experience of absolute grace

258
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,720
of having been given infinitely
more than one has given up. But

259
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,740
within this basic structure, the
details of dying and being

260
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,360
reborn reflect the specific
level of consciousness at which

261
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,540
one is dying at which one is
working, the experiential

262
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,560
texture of each death, its
flavor, focus and function and

263
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,600
even I'd suggest, what is dying
changes as the work progresses.

264
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,620
After one has died and been
reborn many times, eventually,

265
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,140
the very concept of death loses
its meaning. One learns through

266
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,680
repetition that at the deepest
level of one's being it's

267
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,680
impossible to die. The form that
you are can die. Reality as you

268
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,280
have known it can be destroyed
multiple times, but the

269
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,220
innermost essence of your being
always. Re emerges. The Phoenix

270
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,740
always rises. Death becomes
simply a measure of the degree

271
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,660
of purification being enacted
when purification reaches so

272
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,520
deeply that it dissolves the
form that you are then dying has

273
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,200
returned to grace you, and this
is what I mean by calling it

274
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,140
purification unto death. It was
during this third phase that I

275
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,800
surrendered one more assumption
about the Death-Rebirth process,

276
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,300
namely, that there is an
ultimate end to this cycle, a

277
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,800
final death. I no longer believe
that this is the case.

278
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,960
I believe that the progression
is endless. The dying stops when

279
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,920
one's capacity for discovery is
exhausted and one simply can

280
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,540
take no more. Now let me qualify
this carefully, because I know

281
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,780
it goes against the notion that
a complete death is a final

282
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,540
death when one's private
existence has been dissolved,

283
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,420
one can enter a state of oneness
that is completely and utterly

284
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,860
satisfying. One rests in the
source of existence. One with

285
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,200
all that is you cannot imagine
anything more satisfying. And

286
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,760
yet my experience has been that
with repeated immersion in this

287
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,900
condition, new dimensions of
oneness eventually reveal

288
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,160
themselves, and new levels of
joy are associated with each of

289
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,100
these levels, the one exists in
many modalities, and therefore

290
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,340
can be known in many modalities,
always one, but in different

291
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:49,900
depths of expression. So then
that brings us to, what is it

292
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,520
that's actually dying? And here
I want to affirm a delicate both

293
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,240
and balance. It's the individual
who undergoes these deaths and

294
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,160
absorbs them. They become part
of his or her life story, and so

295
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,420
they belong to the individual.
On the other hand, I think that

296
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,860
these deaths also belong to the
universe in ways that transcend

297
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,660
the individual. It is something
it is doing. The Universe uses

298
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,740
these opportunities to heal
itself and commune with itself

299
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,780
in ways that reach beyond the
individual. I think both these

300
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,460
perspectives are true and need
to be affirmed. So what is

301
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,900
dying? Well, first in the early
deaths, particularly the ego, is

302
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,260
dying, the constrictions and
wounds, the illusions, the

303
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,080
habits that are created by our
earthly history. But in the

304
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,440
later sessions, after ego has
surrendered its grip on our

305
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,060
consciousness, what exactly is
dying? Then there is often an

306
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,800
acute sensation of dying. But
what does it attach to? Well, I

307
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,940
think part of the answer is some
aspect of the species ego is

308
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,340
dying when the wheel of death
and rebirth is turning at the

309
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,280
subtle level of reality, where
the deaths are largely

310
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,880
collective. What is dying, I
think, is some part of the

311
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,380
species ego that is some
collective nodule of pain and

312
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,880
suffering that's living inside
the collective unconscious. When

313
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,440
the patient shifts from being
the individual to being the

314
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,000
species. Mind, the pulse of life
we are living in those hours is

315
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,100
the pulse of human history. We
may participate in this death

316
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,520
and rebirth, but we do so less
as an individual and more as a

317
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,500
fractal member of the entire
species. The Coex systems that

318
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,180
are resolving themselves are not
personal correct systems at this

319
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,600
point, but collective coexist
systems in the collective

320
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,020
unconscious, what I call the
meta matrices of the collective

321
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:56,140
unconscious. But there's another
level I think that we can move

322
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,160
to what's dying at these levels,
and it's what I named the

323
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,860
shamanic persona. Now, all of us
have had the experience after a

324
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,460
session has ended that we
sometimes can't hold on to all

325
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,860
the knowledge and all the
experience and all the insights

326
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,520
we had during a session. And
yet, when we re enter the

327
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,960
psychedelic state, we find that
this missing knowledge is there

328
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,760
waiting for us, and we resume
our psychedelic identity when

329
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,960
the next session opens. Now,
this common experience suggests

330
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,500
that the psyche retains and
integrates our psychedelic

331
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,040
experiences at levels deeper
than our conscious awareness,

332
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,720
ego, ego state. Psychology has
demonstrated that this

333
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,220
compartmentalization of
experience is actually a common

334
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,460
feature of our psychological
makeup. And I'm thinking here of

335
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:51,640
the work of Gordon Emerson, John
Rowan and Tom Zinser. I think

336
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,180
ego state psychology can throw
important light on how our

337
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,080
psyche manages the extreme
fluctuations that take place in

338
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,660
awareness and psych. Psychedelic
therapy. Specifically, I want to

339
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,520
suggest that in the repeated
opening and closing of awareness

340
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,380
in psychedelic sessions, a semi
autonomous state specific

341
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,400
consciousness is formed that
retains and integrates and

342
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,340
preserves the knowledge and the
capacities that we had acquired

343
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,520
in our sessions. I call this
psychedelically generated entity

344
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,500
the shamanic persona. It can be
thought of as a state specific

345
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,220
Alter Ego. There are many
variables which affect the

346
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,460
integrity of the shamanic
persona, but basically, as a

347
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,060
general rule of thumb, the
better run the session, the

348
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,320
tighter and more coherent will
be the shamanic persona that

349
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:52,240
emerges now, returning to an
earlier slide, when one system

350
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,900
begins to open to levels of
Transpersonal reality that are

351
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,260
deeper than the levels that you
have previously been exposed to.

352
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,260
Our earlier psychedelic history
must yield to this deeper

353
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,240
territory, our previous
psychedelic knowledge and the

354
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,740
identity based on that knowledge
must surrender control before a

355
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,400
deeper mode of Transpersonal
knowing can emerge and

356
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,860
stabilize. In essence, then what
I think is dying in these

357
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:26,540
sessions is sometimes the
shamanic persona, its death may

358
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,500
feel like a personal death, but
it's not the ego that's dying

359
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,940
here, but rather a deeper
individual identity that has

360
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,420
been birthed inside one's
previous sessions. One shamanic

361
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,140
persona may die and be reborn
multiple times after one

362
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,740
shamanic persona dies and one's
experiences stabilizes at a

363
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,940
deeper level of Transpersonal
reality, the second shamanic

364
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:57,400
persona will retain the memories
of the first Persona and then

365
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,680
will add to it the memories of
the Knowledge and the

366
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,900
experiences from this deeper
level down the road, when a

367
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,680
still deeper level of
Transpersonal reality opens the

368
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,300
second persona will have to die
and yield surrender in order for

369
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,300
Transpersonal experience to be
stabilized at these deeper

370
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:23,000
levels. I'd like to suggest
maybe one more layer of the

371
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,460
answer to this question, what is
it that's actually dying? I

372
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,100
think it's actually a dimension
of the cosmos itself. And here I

373
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,480
am thinking primarily about
those deaths that take place at

374
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,800
what we might some have
described as causal level of

375
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:50,020
reality. First, we might pause
to ask, What could possibly die

376
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,420
at these sublime levels of
reality? What need do causal

377
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,200
level reality? Levels of causal
levels of reality have of

378
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,480
rebirth at all? I don't know the
final answer to these questions.

379
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,500
I can only share some intuitions
that I've formed over the years,

380
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,400
and to do so, I need to very
quickly invoke Sri Aurobindo

381
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,300
involutionary evolutionary
cosmology, because his vision

382
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,780
resonates so deeply with the
cosmology that emerges in

383
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,400
psychedelic states, as Stan has
described so beautifully in his

384
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,200
book, The cosmic game.
Aurobindo, vision is of a

385
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,520
cascading involution of the
Divine, generating multiple

386
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,620
levels of reality, all of the
all divine, but with, but within

387
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,240
those multiple levels, a
descending scale of self

388
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,800
awareness of divinity like a
series of one way mirrors, the

389
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,320
divine looking down sees all,
but the divine looking up sees

390
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,840
less. Now at the end of dark
night, early dawn in the last

391
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:02,220
chapter, I made the point that
in such a multi level cosmology,

392
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,680
a Death-Rebirth Event can
function simultaneously as a

393
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,380
liberation from below to the
above and an infusion of above

394
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,620
to the below. You can often
stand at that threshold, and you

395
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,200
can feel the energy moving in
both directions. So a

396
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,980
Death-Rebirth can function as
ascent and also as descent. So

397
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,000
assume for a moment that we have
managed to stabilize experience

398
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,980
at the low causal level for a
few precious hours inside our

399
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,380
sessions, we exist as a life
form that breathes the rarefied

400
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:47,560
air of causal reality, bathing
in Divine oneness. When through

401
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,820
further exercises, a doorway
opens to still deeper levels of

402
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,200
causal reality. It allows a
cosmic communion to take place,

403
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,220
deep communes with deep a.
Bringing different levels of

404
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,460
Transpersonal reality into
conscious communion with each

405
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,140
other, even if only for a few
hours, seems to nourish and

406
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,360
bring joy to the weave of
existence as the below remembers

407
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,740
the above and the blessings of
above pour themselves into the

408
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,860
below. It is a cosmic dance
taking place between deep levels

409
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,000
of the Divine. It is God
communing with God.

410
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,460
So what dies and is reborn at
these deeper cycles of death and

411
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,360
rebirth, beyond the ego, beyond
the species ego, beyond a series

412
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,040
of shamanic persona. I think
what dies and is reborn is

413
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,680
something of truly cosmic
proportions, some dimension God

414
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:58,240
is calling, some dimension that
is extraordinarily vast,

415
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,580
surrenders and in that
surrendering awakens more

416
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,200
completely to itself, and much
to our surprise, the divine

417
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,220
appears to genuinely appreciate
our help in facilitating this

418
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,560
communion. Stan, thank you from
the bottom of my heart, thank

419
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,120
you. You

420
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,060
Unknown: i.

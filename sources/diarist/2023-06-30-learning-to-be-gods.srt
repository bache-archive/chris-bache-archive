1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,480
Chris Bache: CH, we can't solve
the problems, I think, which

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,700
we're facing at the level of
ego. So we either grow up or we

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,560
go extinct. And what growing up
looks like, I think, has to do

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,720
with the maturation of the soul,
the real sort of transition from

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,780
ego identity to soul identity,
because the soul lives in the

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,300
world differently than the ego
does. The soul has an awareness

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,740
of its history, and therefore it
has an aware an awareness of its

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,880
extended relationships with all
with people that it sees around

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,760
it. And so since we have been
black, white, red. We've been

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,220
all the colors. We've been all
the religions of the world.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,180
We've been rich, poor. We've
been through that when the soul

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,380
matures, there is this
tremendous sense of compassion

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,640
and generative freedom in that
process, and that's what I think

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,240
we need in order to solve where
we're going.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,660
Lauren Taus: Welcome to embodied
life, the podcast. My name is

16
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,500
Lawrence house, and this show is
a space for you to move past the

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,120
traffic of the mind and into the
stillness of your heart. The

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,920
journey is inward, and a
courageous traveler welcomes the

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,820
wide range of their human
experience. We are meeting

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,680
pioneers, healers and change
makers, who are showing us the

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,960
way with important guides and
maps, feel whatever it is that

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,840
needs to be felt so that you can
return home to yourself. Let's

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,840
go. Let's get in bodied.

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,260

an award winning teacher and
international speaker. Chris's

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
work explores the philosophical
implications of Non-ordinary

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,780
states of consciousness,
especially psychedelic states.

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,400
He has written four books,
translated into eight languages,

38
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,280
teaching and collective fields
of consciousness and LSD and the

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,400
mind of the universe, The story
of his 20 year journey with LSD

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,540
between the years of 1979 and
1999

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,880
Chris had 73 high dose LSD
experiences. We sat down to talk

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,960
about these experiences and the
book that he wrote about them. I

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,580
enjoyed every moment of my time
with Chris and I hope you enjoy

44
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,740
our conversation. Take a listen.

45
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,140
Thank you so much for taking the
time to share your extraordinary

46
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,400
experiences and wisdom.

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,100
Chris Bache: I'm happy to share
as much as I can. I'm also very

48
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,880
much aware that your work has
been working primarily with the

49
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,780
therapeutic applications of
psychedelics, and of course, my

50
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,080
work is very different from
that, so you'll have to sort of

51
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,620
show me how I can support your
work with what I have

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,520
Lauren Taus: very happy to do
so. And I think that there's a

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,880
larger conversation that I'm
part of and that I'm weaving

54
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,900
together around consciousness.
And for me personally, one of

55
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,520
the biggest parts of the
medicine is to sense into what

56
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,260
else we're part of.

57
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,220
Yes, and I think that's a lot
where you come in.

58
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,080
Chris, okay, all right, so

59
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,020
can you tell me a little bit
about how you started your

60
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,300
explorations in the psychedelic
space?

61
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,000
Chris Bache: Well, that I have
to go back to 1978

62
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,140
when I had just started my
university position at YSU. And

63
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,580
that first year, I encountered
the work of Ian Stevenson, whose

64
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,900
research on reincarnation turned
my worldview upside down. And I

65
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,920
also encountered the work.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,680
Stanislav Grof, who turned me
upside down even more because he

67
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,440
gave me a method. He showed me
the method that would allow me

68
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,100
to explore these deep states of
consciousness. Now, I was

69
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,700
trained as a philosopher of
religion. I'm not a clinician,

70
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,400
but what interested me about
these substances were their

71
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,660
capacity, not only to heal or to
clarify my personal

72
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,900
consciousness, but to explore
the deeper structure of

73
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,300
consciousness itself, and
eventually the mind of the

74
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,300
universe. So that's where I
began, and that's where I began

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,960
doing the work. And of course,
to do that, my most of my life,

76
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,020
or a good large slice of my
life, had to go underground,

77
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,300
because I was working at a state
university. I was working, you

78
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,720
know, in a public environment,
the age of

79
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,080
legally sanctioned psychedelic
research was over in 1970 This

80
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,380
was 78 so I divided my life into
my public life, and then in my

81
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,840
private Life, I began this
psychedelic work.

82
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,520
Lauren Taus: And you took 73
high dose LSD trips over the

83
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,600
course of 20 years, yeah, and
really high dose,

84
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,300
Chris Bache: yeah. And I
wouldn't recommend that. I

85
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,940
wouldn't do it the same way
again myself, and I really

86
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,000
strongly recommend that people
don't do it that way. I would be

87
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,520
much gentler with myself, and I
would have a much more modulated

88
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,820
approach, but yeah, that's what
I did. I started. There were

89
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,440
three sessions of medium doses,
about 250 mics, and then for the

90
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,560
remainder of all the sessions, I
was working at 500 to 600

91
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:40,900
micrograms. What inspired you to
double the dose and continue in

92
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,860
the way that you did.

93
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,020
Well first I saw Stan's early
work and the distinction between

94
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,660
psycholytic therapy and
psychedelic therapy, so that I

95
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,660
knew that working with high
doses was safe and could be

96
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,020
managed effectively. I knew that
the sessions would be more

97
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,620
difficult working at that
intensity, but I thought if I

98
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,620
were, you know, in focused on
confronting my shadow, that I

99
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,620
could work with those doses, as
long as I could manage the

100
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,040
intensity of what was emerging.
But I started working at those

101
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,660
levels, frankly, simply because,
in the beginning dual career,

102
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,320
arranging a session day in a
dual career, marriage and so

103
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,240
children would be there was just
it's hard to do, so I figured I

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,960
wanted to make the most out of
every day. But then, after I

105
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,060
worked with these doses for a
while, I developed an aptitude

106
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,480
for them. I liked where they
were taking me, and I just

107
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,040
continued to press on in it

108
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,960
Lauren Taus: for the sake of a
listener who might not have as

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,520
much knowledge as we do. Can you
name the difference between

110
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,500
psychedelic therapy and
psychedelic therapy?

111
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,460
Chris Bache: Psycholytic therapy
is low dose, LSD therapy,

112
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,240
working with doses anywhere from
50 on average, about 150

113
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,200
micrograms, up to maybe 300 but
mostly in the 150 or so range,

114
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,400
and it's a it's an amplification
of consciousness. It causes your

115
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,580
unconscious to surface, layer by
layer, you know, different

116
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,560
layers of your personal
unconscious, and then the

117
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,800
perinatal level of
consciousness. Psychedelic

118
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,640
therapy is high dose therapy was
which was originally developed

119
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,860
to work with terminally ill
cancer patients to try to blow

120
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,100
through all the levels of
consciousness and to trigger a

121
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Near-Death Experience, or an
approximation of an interior

122
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,720
death experience, so they could
have a an experience of where

123
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,480
they were going when they were
dying. And it was quite

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,360
successful. So I thought, you
know, if you could do this

125
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,000
safely, one it was limited to
three times in that early

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,940
protocol. So I thought if you
could do it three times, you

127
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,360
could do it more than three
times safely. What I hadn't

128
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,260
counted on is that when you do
do it like that, things happen

129
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,300
and things are started that go
beyond the framework of the

130
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,540
early psychedelic therapy.

131
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,340
Lauren Taus: Chris, when you
started this work yourself, did

132
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,820
you anticipate that it would go
for 20 years and that you would

133
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,380
continue at such high levels of
exploration and experience?

134
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,340
Chris Bache: I didn't. No, I
didn't. I didn't anticipate

135
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,080
where it would go. I basically,
I mean, I worked. Let me back up

136
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,160
a little bit. I worked for four
years. I did 17 sessions, then I

137
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,880
took a six year break, and then
I worked for 10 years very

138
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,660
intensely. I was doing about
five sessions a year on average.

139
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,080
During that time, I didn't
really have a plan, I didn't

140
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,240
have a strategy. I was just
really following the

141
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,680
experiences, following where
they went, and as long as I

142
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,860
could manage it, and as long as
they were continuing to unfold

143
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,880
new levels or new experiences
that were philosophically

144
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,480
productive and personally
productive, I just went with it

145
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,500
until I got towards the end. And
as I explained in the book,

146
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
things developed that just led
me to know that it was time.

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
For me to stop. That's when I
stopped.

148
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,200
Lauren Taus: What were the
questions that were leading you?

149
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,120
What were you looking to answer
or experience with the

150
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,920
psychedelic work?

151
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,820
Chris Bache: Well, as I said, I
was trained in Western religious

152
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,720
thought. I was trained in
philosophy of religion, so I had

153
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,640
all the kind of questions that
people take into philosophy in

154
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,880
that classical sense of the love
of wisdom, not in the modern

155
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,420
sense, which is highly
mathematized types of inquiry.

156
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,320
So I, you know, I wanted to
understand what the structure of

157
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,380
reality was. I wanted to
understand why life is the way

158
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,940
it is, and why our life's life
is the way it is, and what are

159
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,460
the what are the working
dynamics? What's the rule book?

160
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,420
What's the manual in this damn
thing? And I wanted to

161
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,720
understand the deep structure of
the universe as much as I could.

162
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,340
That's the drive so and I
learned a lot, I mean, the

163
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,320
universe. What I found is, if
you approach these things

164
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,660
conscientiously, and if you
approach them in a way that

165
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:12,120
encourages clear contact and
clean contact and high

166
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,320
retention, and if you really
work on recording your sessions

167
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,240
and integrating your sessions as
you go, it's It's as if the

168
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,080
universe sees that you're
working hard to absorb the

169
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,520
teachings from it, and it starts
to pay you attention. And it

170
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,120
took me systematically through
levels of consciousness and

171
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,960
levels of experience that I
always felt, you know, the

172
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,840
intelligence of the
consciousness that I was engaged

173
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,080
in?

174
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,560
Lauren Taus: Can you describe
those levels?

175
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,980
Chris Bache: Well, it took me a
while to sort of figure it out.

176
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:54,100
After I was done with the work
in 99 and I was sort of plotting

177
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,240
what the larger trajectory was,
what is the story that what I

178
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,460
would be telling in this book? I
eventually differentiated five

179
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,320
levels of consciousness that
seemed to be operational. The

180
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,580
first one is takes place at the
level of personal mind, where

181
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,820
you're basically going beyond
your personal time, space

182
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,480
identity, culminating in what we
classically call ego death,

183
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,220
which is simply just the
explosion of your consciousness

184
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,660
beyond the parameters of your
physical experience. The second

185
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,780
took place at the collective
level of mind, at the species

186
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,780
mind, lots of experiences in the
collective unconscious of the

187
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,740
collective psyche. Third Level
took place at the archetypal

188
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,440
mind, going deeper beyond simply
the species mind going deeper

189
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,720
into archetype of reality.
Fourth was the one mind, causal

190
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,400
reality, the where the domain
is, where the fundamental theme

191
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,380
is oneness. And there are many
degrees of oneness and many

192
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,780
permutations of oneness, but
basically, that's the core

193
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,880
domain. And then in the last
five years of my work, I entered

194
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,840
what I came to call the diamond
Luminosity work, which is the

195
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,140
clear light of absolute reality,
as it's called in Buddhism

196
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,040
Dharmakaya.

197
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,740
Lauren Taus: How is this not
therapeutic. I mean, all of

198
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,940
these journeys and all of these
kind of dimensions are so

199
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,420
important. I mean, I can only
grasp at some of them from a

200
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,520
conceptual basis, but I imagine
there must be tremendous relief

201
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,900
and and ease when you can access
dimensions.

202
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,280
Chris Bache: Sure, it's very
healing. You might think of it

203
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,980
as healing at the soul level,
rather than healing at the

204
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,980
personal level. I mean, there
were healings that took place at

205
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,800
the personal level, like
everybody I had issues going

206
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,700
into this work,

207
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,240
and there was personal healing
in relationships and early

208
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,200
childhood relationships. But
overall, I didn't walk into this

209
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,140
life with a whole lot of trauma,
so there wasn't a whole lot of

210
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,660
deeply buried trauma in my
psyche.

211
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,880
But at a deeper level, it was
very healing at the level of the

212
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,260
Soul, in that when one begins to
have what we often call mystical

213
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,460
experiences, or experiences of
oneness, when you're taken by

214
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,180
the what I experienced as being
taken by the universe and being

215
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,620
shown how life works, how
reincarnation works. What's the

216
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,120
larger trajectory of the
reincarnation dynamic being

217
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,380
taken deeper into the
evolutionary dynamics that are

218
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,120
that underpin our very existence
back from billions of years back

219
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,500
and billions of years forward.
You know, those are questions

220
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,040
that I had been holding and
wanting to understand for many

221
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,200
lifetimes, and in that respect,
it was very healing at a soul

222
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,000
level. And very satisfying,
because it gave me enough of a

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,100
sense of what's going on that it
allowed me to, in a sense,

224
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,200
relax, and it quieted that
existential hunger that we all

225
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,400
have to understand the game of
life better.

226
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,460
Lauren Taus: Yeah, and I know
that you had these experiences

227
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,360
with your wife as your sitter,
yeah? And she's a psychologist,

228
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,280
right? And you're, you would do
these journeys on Saturday

229
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,680
mornings, usually, yeah, and
that, you know, music was a part

230
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,220
of it. Did you ever have one of
these 73 high dose LSD

231
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,940
experiences, or 70 because the
first three were medium you

232
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,540
mentioned, with different
conditions or without a sitter.

233
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,740
Chris Bache: I have done
sessions without a sitter, but

234
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,400
never with these in when I was
doing this high dose work, I've

235
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,440
done sessions after this
particular phase of work ended

236
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,640
lower dose sessions or with
gentler substances. But when I

237
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,540
was doing the high dose series,
I always had a series. So I was

238
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,900
always protected from the world.
I was always working in

239
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,440
isolation from the world. I was
always buffered. I was always

240
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,800
taken care of by a sitter. There
was always music involved. I

241
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,400
only had contact with my sitter
during a session, largely

242
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,940
through the music. Not a lot of
conversation. When you're

243
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,020
working with doses of LSD this
high, your verbal functions are

244
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,100
pretty much knocked out. You're
not really in strong contact

245
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,100
necessarily with the room. So it
was a very, very controlled

246
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,000
environment. I called it the
Kiva. It's this kind of, you

247
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,360
know, you climb into the Kiva
and and then you pull up the

248
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,780
ladder and you're there for the
duration of the experience.

249
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,440
Lauren Taus: Yeah, were you able
to control or direct the

250
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,580
sessions in any

251
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,220
Chris Bache: way? No, not
really. When? Again, difference

252
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,460
working at low doses, where you
maybe can hold on an idea of

253
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,880
something you want to work on.
When you're working with doses

254
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,600
of LSD this high, the most
effective thing you can do is

255
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,660
just surrender completely to the
process and not knowing where

256
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,980
it's going to take you, but just
trust that wherever it takes

257
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,740
you, there is an intelligence
behind it that's larger than

258
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,040
yours, and you can trust that
intelligence. So I didn't try to

259
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,560
control it. In fact, I really
there were times when I was

260
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,640
begging it, please take me this
way, but it would take me that

261
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,720
way, you know? So, yeah, I just
would surrender to it all and

262
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,260
let it go.

263
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,960
Lauren Taus: Did your wife ever
participate? Did you ever What

264
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,420
was that like for her? I mean,
obviously it's best asked to

265
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,260
her, but I'm curious about what
that was like for her. What that

266
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,720
was like for your marriage,
like, what was

267
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,240
Unknown: what was that like?

268
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,180
Chris Bache: No, she never
participated. She supported me.

269
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,440
She really wasn't fond of the
sessions. They were not natural

270
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,140
to her mode of spirituality.
Carol had an early in her life

271
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,620
orientation towards meditative
practice, contemplative

272
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,300
practice. She is a serious
Vajrayana practitioner. After

273
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,060
our separation in 2000 she has
gone on to complete her three

274
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,020
year, three month retreat in the
classic Vajrayana tradition. So

275
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,800
she's a serious practitioner.
She was never attracted to

276
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,940
working with psychedelics, so we
just kind of, and I followed her

277
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,280
into the Vajrayana community. I
sort of, I benefited greatly

278
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,440
from learning the vadna
practices that she was learning

279
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,160
in various retreats and
settings, but she wasn't

280
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,060
attracted to the psychedelic
work. It was too violent. It was

281
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:57,940
too too intense and and she
really, she had other criticisms

282
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,100
of it. It just it wasn't her cup
of tea, and we just accommodated

283
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,680
that difference in our marriage.
We just, we navigated that

284
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,020
particular difference
comfortably enough.

285
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,180
Unknown: Nice,

286
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,340
Lauren Taus: you mentioned the
violence of psychedelics. And

287
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,860
often we speak in the space
about

288
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,160
the, you know, the dying, right?
The death and rebirth. How has

289
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,360
that process impacted you? And
how was that for for you

290
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,780
personally, during these
experiences? Yeah,

291
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:36,739
Chris Bache: well, violence
maybe is not quite the right

292
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:39,979
word that shows up in the early
stages when you're going through

293
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,659
the very powerful kriyas, and
you're doing this tremendous

294
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:46,779
physical and emotional
detoxification, which can leave

295
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:49,599
you going into convulsions,
bouncing around the mattress,

296
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,879
where your body throws off vast
quantities of physical stress

297
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:58,719
and emotional stress out of your
body. But there is a certain

298
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:04,619
quote. Violence in dying. But
over the course of the work, I

299
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,579
learned that the deepest
breakthroughs followed the

300
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:13,499
deepest purifications, and the
deepest deaths yielded the

301
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:18,119
deepest ecstatic joys on the
other side. So as that became

302
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,339
clear over the course of the
work, death became my closest

303
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:26,719
ally in the work. And so rather
than kind of trying to navigate

304
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:32,059
through bad trips or trying to
avoid that type of harsh

305
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:37,639
confrontation, I would do
everything I could to facilitate

306
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:40,659
the emergence of that type of
confrontation. I would go right

307
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:44,919
at it, and that was that was not
because I like suffering. That

308
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,259
was because I like what was on
the other side of that

309
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:52,479
suffering, I came to understand
that even death in a psych in a

310
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:56,679
psychedelic context, is a form
of purification. It's a form of

311
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,079
letting go of reality as you
know it at one level in order to

312
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:06,059
gain access to reality at a
deeper level. So it just became

313
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:06,959
part of the work

314
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,040
Lauren Taus: I certainly relate
to that any any of the

315
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,520
psychedelic experiences that
I've had that have confronted me

316
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,500
with my own mortality and the
dying of have been generative

317
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,520
and life affirming and
liberating, and yet, like in

318
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,840
this field, it's one of the
scarier things for most people.

319
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,800
Chris Bache: Yeah, I understand
that, and maybe I pushed it a

320
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,020
little harder than most. That
makes some people in the

321
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,200
therapeutic community may be
uncomfortable, but once you

322
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,800
understand that, once you
learned that the deep

323
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,800
purification, the deep
confrontation with the limits at

324
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,820
any level, leads to ecstatic
deliverance from those limits at

325
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,120
another level, then it's the
most natural thing in the world,

326
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,580
right?

327
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,620
Lauren Taus: Well, it's quite
natural for us to die, yeah. I

328
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,060
mean, nobody survives the game
of life and and I think that we

329
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,960
live in a culture that's just so
uncomfortable talking about and

330
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,840
engaging with content around
death,

331
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,380
Chris Bache: because we don't
understand what death is. You

332
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,580
know, we're just so kind of
chronically constricted to

333
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,440
within time, space, realities.
We don't understand what happens

334
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,500
to us when we don't when we die.
We don't understand the

335
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,100
liberation that death involves.
And it's not just psychedelics

336
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,260
that show us this. But of
course, near death episode

337
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,580
research shows us this hypnotic
regression past life therapy

338
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,660
work can show us this. Michael
Newton's work, for example,

339
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,220
shows us this, once you begin to
understand the larger circle,

340
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,180
once you understand that life is
a circle, that there is a birth,

341
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,800
a deep internalization of
circumstances and challenges

342
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,040
learning, and then there is a
death, which basically is a

343
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,500
phase of Homecoming, a phase of
returning to the light, then

344
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,940
what's to be afraid of dying?
Dying is graduation. Birth is

345
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,100
when the hard work begins.
That's when the you should be

346
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,760
afraid of.

347
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,140
Lauren Taus: So you're not
afraid of dying.

348
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,920
Chris Bache: No, not at all. In
fact, just the opposite. I look

349
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,780
forward to it, because I've been
through that death process so

350
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,560
many times, and I've been
privileged to be given

351
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,720
experiences of where I'm going
when I die that I'm looking

352
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,160
forward to it very much,

353
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,460
Lauren Taus: not rushing there
no

354
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,240
Chris Bache: my work is here as
long as I can be productive and

355
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,140
as long as I can contribute to
the larger project that we're a

356
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,000
part of, but it is nice to know
that it's particularly as you

357
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,480
get older. I'm 70 now, you know,
and you get older, it's nice to

358
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,920
know that the one thing that
life cannot do is stop you from

359
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,240
returning to paradise. So it's
like sliding down a sliding

360
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,420
board, leading you to plunge
into a swimming pool of pure

361
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,080
light. You know, it's just joy
waiting for us at the end of

362
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,860
this life.

363
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,200
Unknown: What's the point of all
this?

364
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,060
Chris Bache: That's a big
question, isn't it? Well, there

365
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,020
are lots of ways, I guess, we
can begin to answer that

366
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,600
question. But any early answers
that we give to that question

367
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,140
would need to be kind of, we
need to stack them up, because

368
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:36,440
it has so many layers to it. You
know, part of my work is in the

369
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,440
psychedelic work, and before the
psychedelic work involved

370
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,940
reincarnation. So I see
reincarnation as a natural fact

371
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,800
of life, so extending over
multiple, multiple generations,

372
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,240
hundreds, 1000s of lifetimes,
we're constantly learning. We're

373
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,820
constantly growing. We make
mistakes. We learn from

374
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,680
mistakes. We're going through
this developmental process. I

375
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,940
think. One of the things that's
happening in this process is not

376
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,500
simply the good that we do or
the growth that we undergo in

377
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,940
every individual life, but
cumulatively. It's not just like

378
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,840
we're going from first grade
second grade to graduate school,

379
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,560
layer by layer, but
cumulatively, I think all of our

380
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:26,120
farmer lives eventually, sooner
or later, they congeal into one

381
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,920
integrated consciousness, the
totality of our consciousness a

382
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,080
being of hundreds of 1000s of
years old. We know that we

383
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,620
return to that consciousness
when we die, because that's the

384
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,120
rhythm of reincarnation. We go
from soul when we die to

385
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,860
incarnate. We're ego, soul. Ego,
back and forth over and over

386
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,760
again. But eventually it comes
into, I think sooner or later,

387
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,680
the soul manifests in its
entirety on Earth. So I think in

388
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:04,080
part, the process is about
learning. It's about activating

389
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,340
the capacities which are
inherent in our nature. And our

390
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:14,340
nature at its core, classically,
is the nature of divinity. Atman

391
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,520
is Brahman, so the
consciousness, the capacities

392
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,220
that we are activating are the
same capacities that created the

393
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,760
physical universe, the
capacities, the capacity that

394
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,020
creates galaxies, we're learning
how to activate that and use

395
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,240
those and use those to create
heaven on earth eventually. Of

396
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,400
course, there are all these
intermediate stages. You could

397
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,600
say, well, we're learning love
and we're learning service, and

398
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,380
that's all true. We're learning
to surrender violence. We're

399
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,220
learning compassion, and those
are all intermediate aspects.

400
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,780
But at a deeper level, I think
you could say we're learning how

401
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,800
to be gods, and I mean that
modestly, but I mean that

402
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,160
literally. We're learning how to
create, how to literally

403
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:08,220
manifest the deepest capacity of
our being to create our reality

404
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,060
in the very demanding
circumstances of time and space.

405
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,140
And time and space is a very
demanding environment. It's much

406
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,120
more demanding than spiritual
reality, but it's very useful in

407
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,020
that respect,

408
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,140
Lauren Taus: I work as an
academy and assisted

409
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,400
psychotherapist, and I had a
session recently where a client

410
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,100
said, time is just an adjective.
It's not really a thing. And had

411
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,960
this whole journey around the
infinite. And what's it like?

412
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,680
Can you speak into the
experience of transcending time

413
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,340
and space?

414
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,100
Chris Bache: Well, there's a
tremendous sense of freedom.

415
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:52,300
Just your entire physical life
will kind of falls away. And

416
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,600
I've had experiences where all
the leftover desires or

417
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,100
unfulfilled ambitions from my
historical existence just fall

418
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,740
away in the face of the most
elementary conditions or

419
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,820
possibilities of being conscious
at these deeper levels, there's

420
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,820
a tremendous sense of
Homecoming, deeper and deeper

421
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,180
levels of Homecoming, kind of
there's a tremendous sense of

422
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,940
remembering. And you ask
yourself, How could I possibly

423
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,020
have forgotten this? How could I
have forgotten this for so many

424
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,360
billions of years. So there's a
tremendous sense of being where

425
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,140
you belong, being where you came
from, in some essential way,

426
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,540
this extraordinary sense of
peace, just, you know, a peace

427
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,020
that,

428
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,960
as the Bible says, The peace
that surpasses all

429
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,960
understanding. Something along
those lines, it's an

430
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,200
extraordinary peace. And at a
deeper level, when you dissolve

431
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,460
into the radiant light. In my
cosmology, I understand that all

432
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,860
physical existence ultimately
merges out of light, and the

433
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,400
light emerges out of the primal
void. But when you dissolve into

434
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,320
light, to actually be light, to
become light, or to dissolve

435
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,680
into that light, so that your
being has the quality of life,

436
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,780
it has the infinite extension,
the simultaneity, the clarity

437
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,600
and of light.

438
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,720
Unknown: Yeah, that sounds
pretty

439
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,840
Lauren Taus: No, you know,
Chris, right now my mind is is

440
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:39,740
very much holding on to the
world that we live in. I'm like,

441
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,940
very and I'm looking at a very
binary world, yeah, man, woman,

442
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:57,520
black, white, yeah, good, bad.
And you've spoken about your own

443
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,480
personal transformation,
shifting into a. Collective

444
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,680
transformation you've spoken
about experiencing profound pain

445
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,840
that wasn't yours, but was sort
of systemic and maybe ancient,

446
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,500
given the environment that we
find ourselves in. Now can you

447
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,020
and how do you relate to to this
sort of historic suffering and

448
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,700
this, these historic systems of
oppression within the context of

449
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,120
like the light and the oneness
and like outside time and space.

450
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,260
Unknown: Yeah.

451
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,760
Chris Bache: Well, again, you're
asking, it's a it's a very large

452
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,420
question.

453
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,920
Lauren Taus: It is, it is, and
may not be a fair question, but

454
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,960
as some of the

455
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,040
Chris Bache: repair, okay? It's
just large, that's all, yeah,

456
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,720
you know, reincarnation is not
simply a personal thing. It's

457
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,960
not a matter of simply a
personal soul, evolving, making

458
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,680
better choices, learning and
growing, becoming more it's also

459
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,660
a collective thing. Every 100
years, entire generation. I

460
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,220
mean, we're constantly the human
species is reincarnating. All of

461
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,060
our individual incarnations are
part of the single intelligence

462
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,380
of our species incarnating. So
there, the human species is

463
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,280
reincarnating and growing in
this dynamic way. And a lot of

464
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,680
it involves actualizing and then
transcending kind of lesser

465
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,700
forms of our capacity, lesser
our lower self are, you might

466
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,880
say our animal self, if you want
to put it that way, I wouldn't,

467
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,560
but and so I think you know
humanity, like individuals, are

468
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,720
growing deeper, better, sweeter,
stronger, more courageous.

469
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,300
Humanity is growing in that way
as well. But we find ourselves

470
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,420
at all sorts of we're at a pivot
point. I think we're coming to

471
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,320
and this was, well, let me back
up just a little bit. When I

472
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,220
began this work, I thought, Oh,
this is about personal healing,

473
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,960
personal enlightenment, personal
spiritual realization. But after

474
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,060
a couple of years, most of my
work was not focused on personal

475
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,960
work at all. It became very
much. I was drawn into some

476
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,320
collective project that I didn't
understand the beginning, and I

477
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,240
began to understand only slowly.
A lot of the the engagement, the

478
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,480
pain I was engaging, as you
mentioned, seemed to be

479
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,580
collective pain. I seemed my
sessions were being used by a

480
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,380
larger intelligence to clear
collective trauma, which I

481
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,680
understand is kind of the trauma
of history that's stored within

482
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,420
the collective unconscious. But
there always has been a strong

483
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:41,380
collective theme in my work, and
so starting in the 23rd session,

484
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,160
and continuing consistently,
intermittently all the way up

485
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,660
through the 70th session. A
reoccurring theme in her work

486
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,220
was the evolution and the
transformation of humanity. And

487
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,460
there was this recurring series
of teachings that I was given

488
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,080
that humanity is coming to a
turning point. Humanity is

489
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,920
coming to a major breakthrough.
Humanity is entering a great

490
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,960
awakening, a profound spiritual
transformation, a before and

491
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,860
after point in history that's
going to change everything,

492
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,280
which I eventually came to
understand as a change in the

493
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,620
fundamental architecture of the
collective psyche, so that when

494
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,980
the architecture, when the core
blueprint of the of the human

495
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,760
psyche, changes, then all
individual incarnations

496
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,360
subsequent to that point in
history will be actualizing

497
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,800
their individual life in the
context of this shifted

498
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,820
archetypal blueprint for the
human psyche. And just as

499
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,220
individuals, as they go into, as
they work towards mystical

500
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,380
union, go through a dark night
of the soul, a very intense

501
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,220
purification process where they
have to let go of everything

502
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,320
which is keeping them small in
order to open to that which is

503
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,700
large. Humanity seems to be
going through the same process

504
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,000
we're having to let go of
everything which is small in

505
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,420
order to open to this new to
give birth to this new human.

506
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,980
And what are the things which
have kept us small? Our hatreds,

507
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,940
our divisions, our self,
preferential treatment, by race,

508
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,960
by religion, by class, by
country, all the ways in which

509
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,160
we've divided history, all the
ways in which we partitioned the

510
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,300
planet, in these ultimately
socially constructed, but

511
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,800
ultimately unreal divisions. And
we're all of these. It's kind of

512
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,940
like the sins of our fathers and
mothers are coming up on us now.

513
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,840
It's like we're vomiting up the
racism. We're vomiting up the

514
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,920
gender abuse. We're vomiting up
all these sort of terrible

515
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,400
things that we've been doing to
each other in the past in order

516
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,480
to permanently remove them from
our system, in order to confront

517
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,640
our past. Right, but we're doing
this not simply to heal that

518
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,300
past. I think we're doing this
to lay the foundation, the

519
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,980
energetic Foundation, for a
different communion with the

520
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,300
divine, a deeper communion with
the universe, a more porous

521
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,560
communion, and one which will
reconnect us, not only with each

522
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,720
other, but will reconnect with
us with the universe, and allow

523
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,920
a more intimate rapport with the
universe to develop, and a

524
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,740
rapport, I think, which has
immediate consequences. I think

525
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,660
that since all the intelligence,
all the things we could ever

526
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,440
want to know, all the problems
that we could ever want to

527
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,480
solve, the answers already exist
inside the divine mind, inside

528
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,200
divine reality. And of course,
when I use the word divine, I

529
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,380
don't, I hesitate to use that
language because I don't mean it

530
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,900
in a theistic sense. I don't
mean it in the God in the

531
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,980
narrow, culturally defined kind
of sense. I mean it in a in a

532
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,980
post religious kind of broader
horizon. I mean it in the

533
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,420
horizon on the scale that
science has shown us of a

534
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,420
universe millions and billions
of years old, a creative

535
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,400
project, billions of years in
the making, a framework which

536
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,280
just dwarfs all the religions of
history. But this process is

537
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,540
basically taking us into a new
opportunity and an unprecedented

538
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,400
opportunity, and this so means
this is a hard time, the time of

539
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,880
birth, and I think that's what
we are entering. Is a time of

540
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,900
labor. Gestation is long, labor
is fast, and we have been

541
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,100
gestating the future human for
1000s and 1000s of years through

542
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:53,560
our evolutionary reincarnation
dynamic. But the time of giving

543
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:59,980
birth to this new human is now.
It's short, it's intense, it's

544
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:05,520
very hard. It's very painful,
but it's magnificent. The

545
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,600
project is coming into a time of
fruition, a hard time, because

546
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,260
it's hard to let go of our
habits of the past, but a

547
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,400
magnificent time, a time of
grace, and I think that's,

548
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,860
that's what's happening to us
now. I think we're in a very

549
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,200
tumultuous time, and we're being
pulled very, very fiercely by

550
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,800
forces which are trying to pull
us back to the past, back to the

551
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,360
old ways, back to the divisions
of history, back to patriarchy,

552
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,140
back to my religion is better
than your religion, and my race

553
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,900
is better than your race. And
then there are the forces you're

554
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,000
pulling us into a future, into a
future of more intimate

555
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,420
equality, more intimate
communion with each other, a

556
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,100
different relationship with the
Earth, a different transformed

557
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:56,380
relationship to the Earth
itself. And it's all on the line

558
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,040
right now because I don't think
we can this world was built by

559
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,560
ego. That means it was built by
a species at a certain level of

560
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,760
its psycho spiritual maturity,
where it had matured into self

561
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,180
consciousness, but it had not
pressed its maturity to the

562
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,440
point where it really grasped
the truth of our

563
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,700
interconnectivity, the truth of
our profound participation in

564
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,140
each other's lives and in the
life of the planet. We can't, we

565
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,680
can't solve the problems, I
think, which we're facing at the

566
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,380
level of ego. So we either grow
up or we go extinct. And what

567
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,400
growing up looks like, I think,
has to do with the maturation of

568
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,480
the soul, the the real sort of
transition from ego identity to

569
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,560
soul identity, because the soul
lives in the world differently

570
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:56,680
than the ego does. The soul has
an awareness of its history, and

571
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,040
therefore it has an aware an
awareness of its extended

572
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,780
relationships with all with
people that it sees around it.

573
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,640
And so since we have been black,
white, red, we've been all the

574
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,040
colors. We've been all the
religions of the world. We've

575
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,820
been rich, poor. We've been
through that when the soul

576
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,080
matures, there is this
tremendous sense of compassion

577
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,360
and generative freedom in that
process, and that's what I think

578
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,060
we need in order to solve where
we're going.

579
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,800
Lauren Taus: I gotta take that
in for a second. Well said,

580
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,040
Chris. And there's so many
different pieces along the way

581
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,620
that really echo in the chambers
of this soul. And when I look

582
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,660
outside, I feel like it's one
giant Ayahuasca vomit, and

583
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,780
there's like, all of it's coming
forth and it's coming out, and I

584
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,040
want it to, like, bring it,
bring it on, so that we can let

585
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,140
it go. Yeah. And I've also
likened this process to giving

586
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,440
birth, which, in my mind, if you
just look at a woman giving

587
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,500
birth and you. Have no idea
what's happening. You might

588
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,780
think she's dying and there's
blood and poop and pee and

589
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:13,080
screaming and crying and and
it's not pretty. Yeah, yeah, new

590
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,940
life, and it's beautiful.

591
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,360
Chris Bache: And I think that's
why I know you're a yoga

592
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,980
teacher, and so I think that's
why disciplines like meditation

593
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,120
and yoga and operating within a
therapeutic awareness is really

594
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,420
important, because there's a
tremendous amount of poison

595
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,300
coming through our systems. Is a
tremendous amount of

596
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,720
conditioning. And if we don't
have a system where we're every

597
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,500
day purifying ourselves this
energy, which is a collective

598
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,580
energy and it's part of our
personal story, but it's a

599
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,500
collective story, if we, if we
don't constantly do something to

600
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,040
let it go through us, it can get
stuck and get lodged in the

601
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,360
system. So never has it been
more important, I think, to have

602
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,040
regimens of purification, self
transformation as part of our

603
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,900
daily habit,

604
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:04,979
Lauren Taus: couldn't agree
more. And I've heard you also

605
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:11,039
say, Chris, that sort of the the
twin anchors for the work that

606
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,139
you did were courage and
grounding.

607
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,419
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah, courage
to face the difficult

608
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:22,519
experiences when they rise, and
grounding to bring back the

609
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:26,899
insights that one is given and
ground them into your daily

610
00:41:26,899 --> 00:41:30,199
life. And what we're finding
with psychedelics is that it's

611
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:32,839
it's getting easier and easier
to have extraordinary

612
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,439
experiences with psychedelics,
and now we're beginning to pivot

613
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:39,619
to, in some ways, the harder
task, or at least the equally

614
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:43,359
hard task, of holding on to
those experiences, integrating

615
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,619
those experiences, literally
into our body, into our minds,

616
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,379
into our social relationships.
Yeah, do

617
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,920
Lauren Taus: you have any
particular strategies that

618
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,340
you've found to be effective in
terms of integration? As a

619
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,500
clinician that, again, is
working with psychedelic

620
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,520
medicine, I have my worksheets.
I invite my clients to journal,

621
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,060
to create art, to dance, to do
whatever feels relevant to the

622
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:11,460
individual and the the learning.
But, um, yeah, I think that

623
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,940
commonly, profound experiences
are not met with profound life

624
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,200
changes. And how do how do we
bridge that gap?

625
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,560
Chris Bache: Yeah. Well, the
things, all the things you

626
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,980
mentioned, I think, are really
good things, which are basically

627
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,520
using all our talent, whatever
our particular talents are, to

628
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,020
reach out, grab and hold on, to
talk about them, to write about

629
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,780
them, to create music about
them, to draw them, and most of

630
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,360
all, I think, to follow the
teachings which we're given.

631
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,240
Because in our psychedelic
sessions, we are given

632
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,020
teachings. We're given
instructions, and you have to

633
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,260
then put those into practice.
You have to practice them every

634
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,480
day, you know, so as you go
through and I think we have to

635
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,680
sort of self modulate, and this,
I wouldn't say I've been very

636
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,680
good at that, but we have to
sort of pace ourselves to know

637
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,840
when we are, when we should slow
down, when we should speed up,

638
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,280
when we've gotten enough that we
need to digest it longer rather

639
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,040
than taking on more. For me, of
course, being an intellectual,

640
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,480
in the sense it's my work is to
sort of be mentally oriented. I

641
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,260
spend a lot of time thinking
about and trying to understand

642
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,380
my experiences and understand
the implications of the

643
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,220
experiences. But someone like
Alex Gray, while I'm sure he's

644
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,160
intellectually absorbs his
experiences. Look what he does

645
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,080
with his experiences. I mean, he
creates these magnificent works

646
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:46,780
of art. You know, other people
are doing are plunged into

647
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:50,200
social activism to actually
bring about the social

648
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,580
transformation that has a chance
of saving this planet from us,

649
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,720
of taking us into this great
future. So different strategies

650
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,640
for different people, but it all
involve some type of way of

651
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,560
basically taking the time and
paying attention to make those

652
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,180
wonderful insights or those
wonderful experiences, not just

653
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,560
memories, but part of our living
tissue of our life.

654
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:20,659
Lauren Taus: And you've said, I
don't remember exactly the

655
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:24,559
language. But essentially, these
experiences give us a taste of

656
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,439
the infinite, and integrating
that into the finite body and

657
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:36,439
psyche of an individual is a bit
challenging. And you've said as

658
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:40,179
well that it took you 10 years
to to really kind of digest what

659
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:41,499
you experienced in the 20

660
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,179
Chris Bache: Yeah, when I came
back, when I stopped my work in

661
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:50,499
99 I thought that I would just
be able, since I had, by that

662
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:54,099
time, been given so many gifts,
I thought I could simply

663
00:44:54,099 --> 00:45:00,599
withdraw and would be able to
nourish myself. Health by the

664
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:05,279
continued digesting and
assimilation of those gifts. But

665
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:09,539
what I found was that it was
more complicated. I found that

666
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,779
that was true, but that was only
half the truth. The other half

667
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:16,739
that I had to confront was the
tremendous sense of loss that I

668
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:21,499
had of not being able to enter
this deeply into into the

669
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:27,199
communion with the universe. So
there was a real sense of a loss

670
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:32,359
of communion, because I could
not sustain this deep communion

671
00:45:32,419 --> 00:45:35,899
in my daily life. There are some
beings who can. There are some

672
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:40,039
great teachers. And the great
masters of the meditation

673
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:44,379
traditions have always been my
heroes, and they can hold these

674
00:45:44,379 --> 00:45:49,059
experiences in an abiding way
that wasn't the case for me, and

675
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:53,679
so it did. It took me about 10
years to get over my sense of

676
00:45:53,979 --> 00:46:01,259
loss and to get to basically
recommit myself to being as I

677
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:05,759
was, who I was, what I was,
where I was, for the remainder

678
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:11,459
of my life, and do as much as I
could with that time. Yeah,

679
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,939
yeah. And for me, the other
thing that made it hard to come

680
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:18,239
back was, of course, our
society's rules that we can't

681
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,279
talk about these things. I could
not I could not teach. I'm a

682
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:26,059
teacher. I love to teach. I
could not teach from this

683
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:30,799
knowledge. I could not share it.
And so writing LSD in the mind

684
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:35,059
of the universe has been a very
satisfying part of integrating

685
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:39,619
my work, of publicly, owning my
experiences, beginning to teach

686
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:43,059
on the basis of those
experiences, and not just my

687
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:46,479
experiences. Of course, if my
experiences weren't supported by

688
00:46:46,479 --> 00:46:49,479
the psychedelic experiences all
the other people who are working

689
00:46:49,479 --> 00:46:52,239
in the psychedelic community,
then they would amount to

690
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,959
nothing. But given the fact that
I'm simply part of a movement,

691
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:59,499
and there's a tremendous
coherence in this movement,

692
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:04,499
that's the significance that we
are entering into the systematic

693
00:47:04,499 --> 00:47:09,239
integration of psychedelics into
our culture. That's the exciting

694
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:11,519
part. That's that's the teaching
moment.

695
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,699
Lauren Taus: Having community,
for me has always been one of

696
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:19,859
the most important integrative
tools. And people who know me in

697
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:25,219
my journey work. And I know you
said, you know, I was in I was

698
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:28,579
not in San Francisco, I was not
in LA or a place where this was

699
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,519
something that was fair ground
for conversation. And then, of

700
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,939
course, the risks in terms of
being a philosophy professor and

701
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:38,899
not feeling safe to talk about
what you were experiencing,

702
00:47:39,379 --> 00:47:41,919
yeah, I'm glad that those
conditions

703
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,980
Chris Bache: have shifted. They
have shifted. I'm glad too,

704
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,700
because that cumulative what I
found was that it's kind of

705
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,200
schizogenic. It kind of makes
you I mean, I know I divided my

706
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,160
life into these two halves, but
I didn't realize the wear and

707
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,540
tear that that division was
going to cause. Because when

708
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,360
you're constantly checking
yourself, when you can say one

709
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,200
thing to one person, you can't
say something to somebody else,

710
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,760
you're living a divided reality.
And those divisions begin to

711
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,740
enter into your psyche, and they
produce cracks, which I had not

712
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,680
anticipated in the beginning,
and so coming out of the

713
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,180
psychedelic closet was, in some
ways, just as liberating as

714
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:28,160
coming out of any closet. And we
know what some of these closets

715
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,340
have been, and how same making
it is to come out of those

716
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,120
closets.

717
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:36,499
Lauren Taus: Yeah. What do your
children think about this work?

718
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:45,999
Chris Bache: Well, I think they
understand it to varying

719
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:50,619
degrees, some more than others.
They have an aptitude for it

720
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:56,139
more than others. I think some
have some intellectual

721
00:48:56,139 --> 00:49:02,039
reservations. Some completely
understand and rejected and

722
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:06,899
accepted. Others are kind of
understand it, but kind of from

723
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:10,379
the sidelines, that not as a
participant, a

724
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,919
Lauren Taus: range, there's a
range, there's a range. One. I

725
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:19,859
think my proudest achievement,
and I've done a lot of

726
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:23,599
interesting things in my years.
It's converting my father to

727
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,659
psychedelic experience in his
70s. And my dad is my

728
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:30,199
prescribing MD In my clinical
practice. And, you know, I've

729
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:32,299
developed, as well, a
relationship with a lot of the

730
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:35,719
Maps team and and Rick, for
example, talks so much about the

731
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:40,119
importance of talking about
these experiences and coming out

732
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:44,919
of the psychedelic closet, and I
think doing so in Family

733
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:49,899
Constellations is also really
healing and important. Yeah, I

734
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:54,459
ask now i Chris you 500 to

735
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:59,080
600 micrograms, like I know you
said you don't recommend it.

736
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,380
Yeah? But what was like the

737
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,960
gift in that

738
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:08,099
Chris Bache: the gift is that
it's like taking a month

739
00:50:08,219 --> 00:50:15,659
meditation retreat and cramming
it into five hours. The gift is,

740
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:20,899
again, I don't recommend it, but
having gone through it, I just

741
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:25,939
try to describe it objectively.
It is a very, it's a very

742
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:29,959
accelerated explosion of your
life. It's not It's very

743
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:33,619
different than low dose
psychedelic work, where you sort

744
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:36,859
of soften the boundaries of your
life and you have certain

745
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:40,839
amounts of cognitive functions,
and the shadow begins to

746
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:45,579
surface, and you begin to engage
it. And working with very high

747
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:49,239
doses, when you're amplifying
those doses with very intense

748
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:53,859
music and in isolation, so on so
forth, it just basically, it

749
00:50:53,859 --> 00:50:57,279
just blows your psyche
completely apart, layer by

750
00:50:57,279 --> 00:50:59,799
layer, until eventually you're
dissolving yourself into the

751
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:02,879
universe. So you basically, on
Saturday morning, you're in time

752
00:51:02,879 --> 00:51:08,039
space, and then you just blow
yourself apart and you dissolve.

753
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,779
It's not like you're not there,
except by continuity of thought,

754
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:17,819
pro of consciousness, but you're
not functioning as Chris Bache,

755
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:21,979
having an experience, you
dissolve as Chris Bache, and

756
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:27,379
dissolve into some stratum of
existence and some, some field

757
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:31,939
of reality. And you you
literally have to work as I did,

758
00:51:31,939 --> 00:51:34,819
at least. You dissolve and you
become that reality. You

759
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:38,719
dissolve into that reality. And
you have continuity. If you do

760
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:43,179
it well, you have continuity of
memory in and out. But you don't

761
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:47,979
have continuity of identity in
the sense that in when you are

762
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,239
dissolved into these fields of
consciousness, you can do things

763
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:56,619
that my Chris Bache could never
do, and you can experience

764
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:59,319
things and learn things that
Chris Bache could never learn

765
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:03,479
within his ordinary time, space
reality. You're just blown into

766
00:52:03,479 --> 00:52:07,919
these realities. You get to live
there for a few hours, and then

767
00:52:07,919 --> 00:52:11,579
slowly the second miracle
happens, which brings you back

768
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:18,299
into your integrated time space
identity. I seem to be have a

769
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:23,659
psychological makeup that makes
it easier. I seem to be able to

770
00:52:23,659 --> 00:52:27,859
dissolve into those realities
without too many problems, and

771
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:31,999
to congeal without many
problems. And both of those

772
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:35,479
rhythms are important, the
letting go and dissolving into

773
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,599
and then the coming back and
becoming a single human being,

774
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:41,139
again,

775
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,200
Lauren Taus: so profound and
given that you don't recommend

776
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,220
that, what would you advise for
someone who is potentially

777
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:55,540
seeking to access some of these
experiences?

778
00:52:56,619 --> 00:53:00,479
Chris Bache: Well, I would
recommend a more balanced

779
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:05,759
regimen, I would recommend low
dose session, high dose

780
00:53:05,759 --> 00:53:09,539
sessions, balance with low dose
LSD sessions. I would recommend

781
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:14,279
balancing LSD with more body
grounded psychedelics like

782
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:19,679
Psilocybin or Ayahuasca, because
LSD tends to be I think of it as

783
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:25,039
kind of a high altitude
psychedelic. And it's very, very

784
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,699
different from Psilocybin, which
is a much more kind of body

785
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:33,379
emotional, you know, sense of
psychedelic. So I would

786
00:53:33,379 --> 00:53:37,939
basically, I'd be more nuanced.
I would just be more balanced in

787
00:53:37,939 --> 00:53:42,159
the rhythm. What if I had a
breakthrough session, I would

788
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:45,339
balance that in the subsequent
sessions with Psilocybin

789
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:48,759
sessions, which would help me
integrate and absorb the very

790
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:52,839
intense energies that I had
gotten dissolved into. Because I

791
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:55,839
just mentioned, one of the
things I learned was every step

792
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,959
into a deeper state of
consciousness is a step into a

793
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:03,359
higher level of energy. So
you're constantly having to

794
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:08,339
transform your entire psycho
physical system to enter into a

795
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:12,779
state of energy, and to do it in
a way that you can maintain

796
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:16,559
cognitive coherence at that
level. Because it's one thing to

797
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,039
just touch them briefly in a
confused way in a session, but

798
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,119
if you want to enter a state of
consciousness and learn how to

799
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,079
hold that level of awareness, so
that you can engage that with

800
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:31,819
continuity of memory and
continuity of consciousness, so

801
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:36,679
that the universe can meet you
there and engage you there, then

802
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:39,979
you have to acclimate to that
energy. You really have to go

803
00:54:39,979 --> 00:54:43,599
through all this
transformational process to be

804
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,319
able to stabilize at that level.
And I found, for example, that

805
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:50,439
after every major breakthrough
to another level of

806
00:54:50,439 --> 00:54:55,479
consciousness, the next session
was always very difficult, very

807
00:54:55,479 --> 00:54:59,319
challenging, very turgid,
because it involved ahead to

808
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:03,119
sort of once. Broke into a new
level of purity, then I had to

809
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,379
go through a process of cleaning
out in my system all the levels,

810
00:55:07,439 --> 00:55:12,059
all the different components of
my being that were lower than

811
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,839
that level so that I could
return to that level with clear

812
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,979
and sustained focus. So it's
it's an energetic thing as well

813
00:55:21,979 --> 00:55:23,359
as a cognitive thing,

814
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:27,919
Lauren Taus: for sure. And
you're working on, like, you

815
00:55:27,919 --> 00:55:31,519
know, from a psycho spiritual
level, it's you're utilizing

816
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:34,219
energy of the body, energy of
like, Transpersonal space,

817
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:38,899
collective space. What's the
story that you're telling with

818
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:39,499
your book?

819
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:43,959
Chris Bache: The story I'm
telling is basically just what

820
00:55:43,959 --> 00:55:49,359
happened. It's basically saying
among all the psychedelics that

821
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,659
we have on the table today and
all of the experiences that

822
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:56,739
people are cultivating today,
this is one person's experience

823
00:55:56,739 --> 00:56:01,559
with one psychedelic used in a
very specific manner. It's a

824
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:07,079
extreme in certain ways. And so,
you know it, I think I drilled

825
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:11,219
an unusually deep bore hole in
the universe. But I didn't

826
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:15,899
explore a lot of the levels that
I was moving through. I just

827
00:56:15,899 --> 00:56:21,499
went very deep and very far. And
so the story is basically when I

828
00:56:21,499 --> 00:56:24,439
was always sort of falling back
and thinking, Oh, my God, how

829
00:56:24,439 --> 00:56:29,359
can I, how can I tell him this?
How can I I know it's a radical

830
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,019
story, and therefore I know
it's, it's, it's a challenging

831
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:36,199
story to absorb, and it was a
challenging story to write. But

832
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:39,319
in the end, I always fell back
on, just tell them the truth.

833
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:42,819
Tell them what happened. No
judgments. Let them do with it

834
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:47,199
what they will just as best as
you can tell them what happened.

835
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:50,499
And towards the end of my
sessions, the universe just

836
00:56:50,499 --> 00:56:54,879
asked me. It said, Let them see
me as you've seen me. That's

837
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:57,939
all. They'll know what to do
with it. They'll know whether it

838
00:56:57,939 --> 00:57:02,339
fits or doesn't fit them. Let
them see what you have seen, and

839
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:05,999
that's it. I'm not really trying
to do anything else. Did you

840
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,180
Lauren Taus: write much of it
during the course of these

841
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,600
experiences in terms of the app,
like the integration process, or

842
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,280
was it reflections, looking

843
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,480
Chris Bache: back? Reflection
looking back? I basically had

844
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,580
all my sessions were recorded
within 24 hours. So I had about

845
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:26,900
400 pages of session notes which
I had studied and blocked and,

846
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,180
you know, and I took them apart
and put them back together

847
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:35,600
again, and I diagrammed them in
different ways, but basically it

848
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:41,020
took years for me to finally
kind of piece together what is

849
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,740
the storyline, and also what to
leave out and what to include?

850
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,640
So I left out a lot of the
personal stuff. I left out the

851
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,240
personal healings. I left out a
lot of the personal small

852
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,080
things, because those were not
the important parts. You know,

853
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,540
everybody has a personal story,
but it's when, to me, as a

854
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,780
philosopher, it's when the
process takes you beyond the

855
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,860
personal psyche into the deep
waters of the psyche, that's

856
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,460
when the philosophically
interesting story begins. Now,

857
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,220
the therapist story is an
important story the healing of

858
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,220
the personal psyche. That's a
really important story and an

859
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:21,440
important work. That's just not
the story that I'm telling, I'm

860
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,740
telling the story of a love
affair with the universe and a

861
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,900
love affair with the
intelligence of the universe.

862
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,580
And that's why I call my name
for this intelligence that I

863
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:37,100
engaged as my beloved. It's just
my beloved, because it activates

864
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:42,100
such profound love in your being
to engage that, to dissolve into

865
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:48,040
that. That's your it's the most
intimate kind of true, becoming

866
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:54,280
one to a pre existing one. It's
a love affair. It's it. I wish

867
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:59,200
it were not a love affair, but
an abiding marriage, and maybe

868
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,720
one day it will be. But working
with these are temporary states.

869
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,420
They're not permanent states.
You have to come to terms with

870
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,500
that temporalness, but they're
temporary states. So it very

871
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,460
much is like an affair. You
enter, you make love in some

872
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:19,140
way, and then you come back and
you try to live it as best you

873
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,260
can, inside time and space

874
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:24,799
Lauren Taus: for so listeners
are not going to be able to see

875
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,699
my face, but my I'm My face
hurts from smiling, and my heart

876
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:32,839
feels like, like it's exploding.
I mean, I love this love, and I

877
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:36,019
think it's, I think it's a
really healing love. And as

878
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:40,419
somebody who does work with the
individual psyche, and you know,

879
00:59:40,419 --> 00:59:42,759
in our initial conversations,
you're like, Well, I'm not

880
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:47,319
working on that, like part of
this conversation. And for me,

881
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:51,759
you're really contributing to
this part of the conversation,

882
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:55,899
and I'm incredibly grateful to
share your voice, your wisdom,

883
00:59:56,019 --> 00:59:59,439
your experience with my
community. So deep, deep

884
00:59:59,439 --> 01:00:03,359
gratitude. Tuned and reverence
for for you and your time and

885
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,319
your wisdom.

886
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:10,679
Chris Bache: Thank you. It's a
joy to share, and my hope is

887
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:15,179
that you know in some way, my
story or my experiences will

888
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:19,739
support you and all the other
people in their story and their

889
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:22,459
experiences. They'll know what
to do with it. They'll know what

890
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:25,579
to take from it. We all have
different journeys, but in the

891
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:28,279
end, we're all in this arm in
arm. We're all in this together,

892
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:33,379
you know. So everything you do,
everything I do, all it, reaches

893
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:37,279
out into the larger collective
network, every morning, every

894
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:43,359
day, every minute. So yeah, it's
a joy to be of use to people I

895
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:44,199
feel the same.

896
01:00:48,699 --> 01:00:51,099

Chris Bache: In all of my work,
I always felt myself engaging

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,880
and being engaged by a larger
consciousness. This

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,440
consciousness did not take
concrete form. It never took

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,420
personified form. It never took
concretized form, and it

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,340
changed, or the qualities of
this consciousness changed the

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,140
deeper I went, so that I began
to understand the way I think of

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,640
it is the consciousness that we
enter into communion with in

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,780
psychedelic states, is an
infinite consciousness that's

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,120
capable of generating any number
of different types of

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,500
experiences or types of
awareness within us and our mind

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,120
acts as a seed catalyst, a seed
crystal that catalyzes a certain

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,600
set of experiences from this
infinite consciousness. If you

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,580
do this repetitively, over
repeatedly the experiences that

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,600
you have and you integrate,
internalize and go through the

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,320
various purification processes,
it changes your your

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,620
consciousness, and therefore the
consciousness that you take into

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,860
the next encounter is a
different consciousness that

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,940
catalyzes a deeper set of
experiences from the infinite

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,360
potential of consciousness. And
that means that the what you

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,560
experience as this guiding
intelligence, the this massive

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,060
intelligence that you meet at
different levels is, in a way, a

22
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,260
consciousness that arises at the
intersection between your

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,800
individual mind and this
universal Mind. And as you

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,900
change, the intersection
changes, so that from my

25
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,800
experience, the consciousness,
which I felt was always guiding

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,320
my sessions, was always
invisible to me, but was always

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,060
felt. It didn't adopt concrete
form, or very seldom, adopt

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,640
concrete form, because the form
would change as the experiences

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,460
deepens. So you know that
formless quality is, I think,

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,280
something innate to do with the
consciousness itself, and then

31
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,140
in going beyond the collective
level of consciousness, between

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,980
beyond the collective psyche and
even beyond human history. When

33
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,360
you're pushing so deep, you're
going beyond Jung's category of

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,420
archetypal consciousness, you're
letting you're going beyond

35
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,860
human history altogether, all of
the interpretive frameworks, all

36
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,600
the images, all the concepts
that we associate with our

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,120
religious and spiritual history,
they just fall away. Basically,

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,380
if several 1000 years or five or
10,000 years of religious

39
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,220
history just fall away, and
you're moving into states of

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,280
consciousness that go beyond any
category of gods or deities or

41
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:07,020
angelic beings. You're in a
completely different world. So,

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,040
yes, always guidance, always an
intelligence engaging me, but

43
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,940
formless,

44
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,960
Unknown: yeah, well, I have yet
to get to that level in my

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,900
particular journeys, but perhaps
some day, and I'd like to ask

46
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,900
more specifically about sort of
the forms that can appear so.

Unknown: Ryan,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,660
Ryan Kemp: Okay, welcome
everybody to the naked guru

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,560
experience. I'm Ryan Kemp, just
as a little forward. This

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,440
discussion is part of a series
in tribute to the American

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,040
ethnobotanist Terence McKenna,
and is sponsored by the

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,720
psychedelic society as ever. It
really helps in the production

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,360
of these discussions, if
listeners subscribe to our

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,740
YouTube channel, today's guest
is Christopher M Bache. Chris is

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,380
an emeritus professor in the
Department of Philosophy and

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,860

State University, where he

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,760
taught for 33 years, an emeritus
fellow at the Institute of

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,620
Noetic scientists. He is also a
junk faculty at the California

the Grof Transpersonal training
and the Grof foundation. An

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,120
award winning teacher and
international speaker. He is the

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,180
author of a number of books,
including life cycles, dark

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,020
night, early dawn, and the book
we'll be discussing today, LSD

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,400
and the mind of the universe,
diamonds from heaven, in which

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,420
Chris catalogs his epic journey
over 20 years, where he engaged

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,680
in 73 high dose LSD sessions,
working at 500 to 600

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,340
micrograms. Chris, welcome to
the podcast, and thank you so

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,820
much for agreeing to this
discussion. Hi, Ryan. It's a

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,440
pleasure to be here with you
today.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,380
So we have a lot to cover in
just a small amount of time. And

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,160
I just wanted to say from the
start that your book has been

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,580
profound in my life, and it's in
huge discussion all around the

27
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,120
world and multiple groups I know
the feedback from many others,

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,940
it's been life changing for many
others. So thank you for your

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,920
work. Thank you. I'd just like
to start with a little

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,800
introduction to you and your
background and influences, if

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,760
you will, please. Chris,

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,800
Chris Bache: well, I'm the last
person you would expect to have

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,580
written this book. I was raised
in the Deep South, who grew up

34
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,360
in Mississippi. I studied
theology at the University of

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,560
Notre Dame. I was actually in
the seminary for three years in

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,280
high school and one year in
college. I did my masters at

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,160
Cambridge in New Testament
criticism. I was going to be a

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,780
New Testament scholar. Shifted
out of that, got my PhD from

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,800
Brown University in philosophy
of religion. But when I came to

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,920
ISU and I was looking for the
next area to focus myself. I was

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,300
trained in philosophy of
religion. I encountered the work

42
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,380
of Stanislav Grof, who was it
was life changing. I also

43
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,080
encountered the work of Ian
Stevenson, whose research on

44
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,340
reincarnation was life changing.
But it was Stan's work

45
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,800
particularly that seemed to set
the course for my life. I was I

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,880
understood immediately the
implications of his research

47
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,660
for not only psychology, but for
philosophy, the opportunity to

48
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,800
develop a new philosophical
methodology, the systematic

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,280
exploration of consciousness
through the disciplined use of

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,960
psychedelic states. Now, of
course, the United States had

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,100
made psychedelics illegal at
that time, so I divided my life

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,520
in half. In my daytime job, I
was a professor at the

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,600
University teaching courses in
Eastern religion, psychology of

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,260
religion,

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,960
comparative mysticism, a course
called Transpersonal studies.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,720
And then I began in my personal
life, a very private exploration

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,080
of the my deep psyche, using
Stan Grof protocols for

58
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,260
psychedelic therapy, and then
pushing those protocols to their

59
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,140
limits to explore my
consciousness. And through that

60
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,100
exploration, what I came
eventually to understand was the

61
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,660
consciousness of the universe
itself. Brilliant, brilliant.

62
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,620
Now, a lot of what we're going
to discuss in this talk,

63
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,460
there'll be people within the
psychedelic and psychological

64
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,960
and even spiritual community
that will be very familiar with

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,740
what we're going to talk about
and our terminology, but there

66
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,180
is a good I'd say, probably even
a majority of human beings on

67
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,220
our planet that that are not
aware of these kind of

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,380
psychological landscapes and the
terminology. So for me, I think

69
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,480
it would be helpful if you could
please frame for us the context

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,440
that we're talking about when we
discuss LSD, a lot of people

71
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,220
will see this as a discussion on
drugs, when actually it's a

72
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,420
discussion far from it, from
something far more profound.

73
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:43,180
Yes, yes, yeah, we all kind of
suffer from the carry over of

74
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,520
our experience with
psychedelics, our culture's

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,580
experience in the 1960s and all
the negative press that

76
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,300
psychedelics generated or were
generated around psychedelics,

77
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,280
when the true story is really
very different. Psychedelics in

78
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,920
general and LSD in particular,
Fung.

79
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,020
Function as non specific
amplifiers and catalysts of

80
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,320
consciousness. They don't give
you a particular experience.

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,920
They don't

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,260
what they do is hyper amplify
your consciousness, and if you

83
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,640
use these hyper these hours of
hyper amplified consciousness

84
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,280
carefully and conscientiously,
if you shut out all outside

85
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,120
stimulus and focus your
attention completely from

86
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,160
within, you can use those hours
to explore and to, in a sense,

87
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,240
excavate the deep architecture
of the psyche. Now,

88
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,260
nature of consciousness itself.
I should say that when I was

89
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,820
doing this work, just to be
clear, I was always working

90
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,000
privately. I was always working
in very controlled

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,440
circumstances, either at my
house or at my wife's office. My

92
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,260
sitter for all the years of my
work was my wife, my first wife,

93
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,920
who is a clinical psychologist.
So I was always protected from

94
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,920
the world. I was isolated. I was
lying down. I was surrounded by

95
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,880
pillows. I was wearing
headphones, listening to a very

96
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,040
carefully curated playlist of
music which is designed to

97
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,120
facilitate a deepening of the
experience and wearing eyeshades

98
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,840
so I was completely protected.
Someone was taking care of my

99
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,100
body, taking care of the musical
selection. My job was simply to

100
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,840
focus on what was emerging at
the center of my experience, and

101
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,940
to allow that experience to go
wherever it would go if you do

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,960
that, what begins to happen in
the early stages is you begin to

103
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,100
confront your personal shadow.
You begin to front confront all

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,180
those aspects of your life which
you are ashamed of, are

105
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,680
embarrassed by, are intimidated
by, or uncertain about, the

106
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
deepest fears of your life,
including when you get down to

107
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,080
it, the fear of death, the fear
of extinction, the fear of the

108
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,920
meaninglessness of life. And
then, as you if you keep that

109
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,560
process, these fears kind of
come to a crescendo, a peak

110
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,980
expression. And if you will, can
confront that peak expression

111
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,160
and let it take you where it
wants to take you. It will take

112
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,660
you through some crisis, which
eventually becomes some form of

113
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,820
death and rebirth, some absolute
shattering of your life as you

114
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,420
had known it, of reality, had
you as you had known it. And

115
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,960
then you fall into a deeper
level of reality. You die at one

116
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,820
level and awaken within a deeper
level of reality. And your

117
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,420
session shifts from purification
to

118
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,900
an ecstatic phase of the
session, and you basically are

119
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,740
given you enter into an intimate
dialog with the universe, an

120
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,200
inter intimate initiation into
successive layers of the

121
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,500
universe. This is what working
critically, therapeutically with

122
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,940
psychedelics is all about.

123
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,040
Ryan Kemp: And would you
describe that Chris is what Jung

124
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,080
would term the collective
unconscious.

125
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,640
Chris Bache: Well, the
Collective Unconscious is a

126
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,600
stratum of consciousness that
lies below the personal

127
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,760
unconscious. So in Jung's model,
every we first encounter when we

128
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,640
go below our conscious mind, we
encounter our unconscious mind,

129
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,480
our personal unconscious. But if
you can go deeper than your

130
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,900
personal unconscious, you enter
into a stream of awareness,

131
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,460
which seems to be a collective
stream shared by all human

132
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,020
beings of your species. So this
is Jung's collective psyche,

133
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,220
right? Then, if you go deeper
than that, you enter into still

134
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,600
deeper streams of consciousness,
entering into what some would

135
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,220
call global consciousness. But
you can enter into levels of

136
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,480
consciousness that go beyond
space, time, reality altogether.

137
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,940
Enter into archetypal levels of
consciousness enter into

138
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,800
complete states of dissolving
into Non-duality and what might

139
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,960
be called causal oneness, and
you can enter deeper states of

140
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,560
consciousness even than that. So
it's it's a long journey with

141
00:09:59,560 --> 00:09:59,920
many.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,980
Ryan Kemp: Levels of exploration
along the way. So in your view,

143
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,240
like the view of Jung and in
many spiritual texts and very

144
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,140
many religious texts, we have
our personal, individual mind,

145
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,400
but the universe itself is a
mind, a oneness of its own. It

146
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,360
would that be correct?

147
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,740
Chris Bache: Yes. And our as I
experience it, at least, our

148
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,660
individual mind is a fractal
embodiment, a fractal

149
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,420
manifestation, of this larger
cosmic mind. So at one level,

150
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,660
there is a functional duality,
which we might think call a

151
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,020
small mind and the big mind, but
at a deeper level, there really

152
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,600
isn't a duality. There is a
continuum of awareness that we

153
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,740
are a small actualization, a
fractal manifestation of this

154
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,440
larger cosmic consciousness.

155
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,220
Ryan Kemp: Now, just while we're
discussing about your technique

156
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,540
and what you were, what you're
up to in these sessions, one of

157
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,680
our questions from, from, from,
from the Terence McKenna guys

158
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,180
was about the music you were
listening to. So you described

159
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,440
the area where you were and that
Carol, your lovely wife was ex

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,280
wife currently was sitting for
you. But what? What about the

161
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,340
music you were listening to the
I know this changed over time,

162
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,900
but could you tell us a bit
about that?

163
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,600
Chris Bache: Well, here I was
drawing upon Helen Bonnie's

164
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,520
work, early work in the study of
the stages of psychic of

165
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,340
psychological opening, and it's
like an LSD session. I learned

166
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,560
about her work through Stan Grof
work, and she differentiate five

167
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,500
stages of opening and closing in
an LSD session. LSD session is a

168
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,740
long session. It's, you know,
it's a six to eight hour

169
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:07,320
session. And there is the early
stages of latency, then the the

170
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,900
medicine begins to kick in. Then
there is an acceleration of an

171
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,640
opening of consciousness. One
begins to encounter resistances

172
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,820
and fears as one moves deeper
the the energy continues to

173
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,400
build exponentially. There is a
peak period, and then there is

174
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:34,340
you hit the long, kind of steady
plateau of the experience. And

175
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:40,420
then there is a long, slow,
gradual return. So each of those

176
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,500
stages of consciousness are best
paired with particular types of

177
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,060
music. In the early stages, you
want music to calm you and relax

178
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,620
you before the session actually
gets underway. And then when the

179
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,380
session begins, you want music
that gives you a sense of flow

180
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:05,640
and continuity, music that can
support your support your

181
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,520
letting go of your fears and
resistances, shifting gradually

182
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,040
to stronger music with more
climactic cadences and themes to

183
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,520
support You really letting go
into the deeper turmoil that

184
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,600
rises in your consciousness,
eventually leading to the

185
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,440
moments of great breakthrough.
And then as you move into the

186
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,880
breakthrough, you want music
that supports the vast expanse

187
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,600
and the opening of horizons that
can open after you go through a

188
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,980
Death-Rebirth process, and in
the return you want music which

189
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,900
is very gentle. Increasingly
gentle gives you a lot of space

190
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,040
in which to process your
experiences. Now, again, I want

191
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,640
to mention that all of this is
contingent on the type of

192
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,680
psychedelic you're using and the
dose at which you're working

193
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,140
with now, I chose to work with
very high doses of LSD. I worked

194
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,280
with 500 to 600 micrograms. I
started working I did three

195
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,420
sessions with about 200
micrograms. Chose to work at

196
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,100
five to 600 micrograms in a
sustained protocol of this sort.

197
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,100
And this generates enormously
powerful experiences. I mean,

198
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,180
the process of of your
consciousness. It's not like

199
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,260
taking 150 micrograms and
relaxing on a Sunday afternoon

200
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,640
sun, a sunny afternoon under the
trees. It's it's a much more

201
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,460
powerful, hyper stimulation of
your consciousness that just

202
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,080
challenges and shatters all the
limitations of your known mind,

203
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:54,640
and the music accordingly is I
found it I was important to have

204
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,860
very strong music, engaging
music. I found quickly that.

205
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,260
That indigenous chanting and
music from foreign cultures was

206
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,300
more effective for me than
classical music. It's very

207
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,080
foreign nature made it easier
for me to surrender to the

208
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,980
foreign territory that I was
entering into. It gave me gave

209
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,365
my ego less room for anything to
hold on to, and therefore it was

210
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:27,485
more challenging, but it was
more productive in that it

211
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:31,205
helped me get into the deep
material more quickly, more

212
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:31,745
easily,

213
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:35,225
Ryan Kemp: right? And the
indigenous music you were using,

214
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:42,125
were these kind of Ayahuasca
shaman chants, or were they were

215
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,545
from worldwide, different
different tribal chants.

216
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,860
What in particular

217
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,000
Chris Bache: I have used the
escaros from Ayahuasca

218
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,760
ceremonies late in in my
psychedelic life, mostly after

219
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,420
my LSD years. I mean, I did this
work between 1979 and 1999

220
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:11,760
between when I was 30 and 50.
I'm 70 now, but in the primary

221
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,740
years, I didn't really encounter
the Ayahuasca music until much

222
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:23,900
later in this process, the music
tended to come from a lot of

223
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:31,520
African music, a lot of Tibetan
music, Indonesian music,

224
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,340
Japanese music, South American
music. I basically just was

225
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:44,620
always looking for music that
would give me a supportive but

226
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,900
challenging context against
which I would allow myself to

227
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,860
enter into these deep states.
And I found that I could only

228
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,340
use a piece of music
approximately about about three

229
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,940
times after I'd used it three
times the music became encoded

230
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,320
with the experiences that I had
had with the music. And in order

231
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:14,040
to allow to avoid being kind of
repetitiously encoded or

232
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,120
programmed by the music, I
always had to be looking and

233
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,560
using fresh music,

234
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:25,340
Ryan Kemp: right? Okay, so the
mind had, had taken the music

235
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,520
and you kind of knew it, and it
was, it was then program along

236
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,540
with the previous experience. So
that's if you re listen to it,

237
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,880
you would go back to the same
experience, or,

238
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,080
Chris Bache: well, it would tend
to pull you in that direction.

239
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,720
Or at least there was some
potential for it to pull you in

240
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,500
that direction, maybe not the
second time you listen to it.

241
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,540
But if you listen to the music
repetitively repeatedly, it can,

242
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,800
it can narrow your conscious
experience instead of expanding

243
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,760
and opening it

244
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,920
Ryan Kemp: right so as you just
touched on there as well you saw

245
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,200
this, or what you came to learn,
that what you were doing was a

246
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:17,280
series of iterated deaths and
rebirths in one body, which is

247
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,840
also quite in the other
literature with Stan grofs work

248
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,700
and whatnot. So could you talk a
little bit about how you view

249
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,180
that, and what is it
relationship to actual death and

250
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,020
rebirth as we know it, the
leaving of this form and coming

251
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,900
back into a new form? Perhaps
your views on that?

252
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:43,720
Chris Bache: Yes, well, it took
me a long time to understand the

253
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,580
patterns of my sessions, because
in some ways, they started as I

254
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,940
expected them for drawing upon
Stan's map of consciousness that

255
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,140
he gave us in his early
writings. But then after a few

256
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,620
years, they seemed to diverge in
some ways and enter into new

257
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,500
territory. But one of the things
that

258
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,960
I've come to understand over
time is that consciousness has

259
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,760
many levels, many tiers,
operational levels, and the only

260
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,780
way to and when you enter, each
time you enter into a new level

261
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,100
of consciousness, there is
required a surrender of

262
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,640
everything you had known before,
everything you had learned and

263
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,420
assumed before, in order to
enter into a level of

264
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,440
consciousness that operates by
completely different rules. Now

265
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,420
it's it's not that Chris Bache
is ego, even a softened ego, can

266
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,720
be catapulted out in some
reality and have an experience.

267
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,100
It's more that

268
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,780
Then you transition to a deeper
level of reality. You enter

269
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,640
spiritual reality, which
operates by different rules than

270
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,560
physical reality, but in the
early years, often at least also

271
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,640
speak for myself, I my
experience of this reality was

272
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,900
still colored by my experience
of time and space. So the

273
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,560
assumptions of time and space
kind of place limits on your

274
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,180
experience of that spiritual
level of reality. And there

275
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,860
comes a time if you keep pushing
that eventually there is an

276
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,420
invitation extended or a
breakthrough which you come to

277
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,860
where you have to let go even
deeper, let go to something even

278
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,060
deeper than your physical
identity, which shatters you yet

279
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,560
again and takes you into yet
another level of reality which

280
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,740
is deeper, a deeper level of
spiritual reality than the

281
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,640
earlier level you had been
experiencing. And this process

282
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,060
repeats itself multiple times if
you, if you use your sessions in

283
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:48,640
a focused way and always pushing
to explore the deepest dimension

284
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,800
of consciousness, that's
possible. Now I want to say, I

285
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,340
don't advise that people do what
I did. I mean really, I if I

286
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,960
were doing it over again, I
would not adopt such an

287
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,720
aggressive strategy as I, as I
adopted, always pushing so hard

288
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,700
with such high levels of LSD, I
would be much gentler on myself.

289
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,000
I would balance high dose
sessions with low dose sessions.

290
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,500
I would balance working with
LSD, which is a kind of a high

291
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,900
ceiling psychedelic, with
Psilocybin or Ayahuasca, which

292
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,100
are much more body grounded
psychedelics. So I'm describing

293
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,640
something without recommending
it to be followed or be used by

294
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,860
other people. Truly, I don't but
doing what I did and learning

295
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,260
how to navigate these waters and
surviving my own foolishness.

296
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm just in the book. I'm just
trying to tell stage by stage

297
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,080
exactly what happened as best I
could on this deepening

298
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,180
immersion into the universe.

299
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,920
Ryan Kemp: And when you say
pushing forward, that suggests a

300
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,140
kind of active,

301
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,380
Unknown: an active role in the
in the experience. Was it? Was

302
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,500
it a process of pushing outward
into these kind of further

303
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,620
landscapes, these further
psychedelic and psychological

304
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,840
VISTAs, or was it a process of
surrendering into them, or maybe

305
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,240
a combination of the two? It's
really a matter of surrendering

306
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,820
the only pushing is by the
repeating of the circumstances

307
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,100
of availability. You

308
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,020
Chris Bache: you create a
completely quiet and safe

309
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,040
container. You detach yourself
from all the circumstances of

310
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,320
your daily life, you take a
powerful medicine, you surrender

311
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,860
yourself to the care of another,
and then you open. You allow

312
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,020
yourself to open. What happens
next is beyond your control. At

313
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,720
least working with this
substance at this higher dose,

314
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,540
is beyond your control. You
surrender to a. Larger

315
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,040
consciousness. And I've the
longer I work with this this

316
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,960
material, the more it became
clear that there was a larger

317
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,220
consciousness that was guiding
my sessions, guiding my

318
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,140
education in the sessions, that
was meeting me, breaking me

319
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,480
down, loving me, caressing me,
breaking me down some more,

320
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,800
forcing me to face certain
things, challenging me to face

321
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,420
certain things, and then
thrilling me, taking me into

322
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:38,180
deeper and deeper intimacy with
what I would come to describe as

323
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,460
the creative intelligence of the
universe, the cut. It's hard to

324
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,540
describe when you enter so
deeply into states of

325
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,420
consciousness that so far
transcend your physical

326
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,780
consciousness. How do you
describe it? What? What

327
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,680
categories do you have to
describe it? We could call it

328
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:05,040
the cosmic mind, the universe's
mind, the great expanse in my in

329
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,500
my heart of hearts, I've came to
call it My beloved, because

330
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,460
returning to such intimacy with
the very source of your

331
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,140
existence, with the source of
all existence, awakens such a

332
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:29,000
deep passion of embrace and
being embraced that it well, I

333
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,920
call it my beloved. Yes.

334
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,880
Ryan Kemp: I mean, what I really
love about your work, for me and

335
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,740
somewhat Stan Grof work, is it
reconciles psychology,

336
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,820
psychedelics, religion and
spirituality in a way can be

337
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,120
read in a way that reconciles
that when you discuss

338
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,840
terminology and you discuss it
as your beloved Jesus may have

339
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,540
called that the kingdom of
heaven within Buddha may have

340
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:58,540
called that Dharmakaya, the
Hindu Atman. And so there exists

341
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,520
kind of a spiritual terminology
that to a lot of people, is very

342
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,740
alien and dogmatic and separate,
but once viewed in the context

343
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,760
of your work, through through
the psychedelic where one can

344
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,560
experience this as a direct
contact with the trans person or

345
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,720
the transcendent, it all fits
very, very nicely, and You all

346
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,500
of a sudden become to understand
what those human beings were

347
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
trying to describe. It's not
something abstract, it's

348
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,980
something that can be
experienced in a number of ways.

349
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,000
Would you agree?

350
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,080
Chris Bache: Yes, it can. And
certainly, once these

351
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,600
experiences become part of our
cultural story, they are subject

352
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,900
to all the distortions that
culture can bring so they can be

353
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,920
subject to the distortions of
historically limited

354
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,900
perspectives, to patriarchy, to
all sorts of cultural

355
00:27:52,900 --> 00:28:00,100
constrictions. But I had the
advantage of I was teaching

356
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,940
world religions, and I was
teaching courses in comparative

357
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,740
mysticism and so over and over
again, year after year, I was

358
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,920
studying some of the great
spiritual teachers from around

359
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,420
the planet. And if you do this,
you very quickly outgrow the

360
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,920
limitations of your own religion
of birth, and you begin to enter

361
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,320
into this collective
perspective, where you begin to

362
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,000
recognize a deeper, fundamental
core overlap of many of the

363
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,920
teachings of the different great
religious teachers, what what is

364
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,920
often called the perennial
philosophy, the perennial

365
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,680
tradition, and at the same time.
So there is a sense which

366
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,740
recognizing what people have
been talking about when they

367
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,620
when they talk about the divine,
what they talk about when they

368
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,160
talk about Transcendence or
Atman and Brahman, these

369
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,760
categories become alive for you
as as an essential vocabulary to

370
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,400
articulate what is becoming your
natural experience of the world.

371
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,520
And at the same time, at least
in my experience pushing as

372
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,440
deeply into the universe as I
did, I was shown over and over

373
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,180
again that all the religions of
the last four or 5000 years are

374
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,340
radically and profoundly
incomplete. They are noble

375
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,820
initiatives in history which
reflect a certain state of human

376
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,160
evolution. But the landscape of
human evolution the landscape of

377
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,880
the Divine initiative, and I
even hesitate. I don't talk

378
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,080
about God very much, and I
hesitate to even talk about the

379
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,280
divine, because those words are
so heavily laden with

380
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,860
theological presuppositions that
I don't necessarily want to

381
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,540
affirm or buy into. But
basically, when you when you

382
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,920
begin to experience the
magnitude of the intelligence.

383
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,260
Presence that suffuses existence
and the magnitude of the

384
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:11,280
compassion and an intimate love
that the creative impetus, the

385
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,500
creative intelligence has for
all of its manifestation, all of

386
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,820
its manifest beings. It just it.
It just opens worlds within

387
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,680
worlds within worlds. So there
is a both an affirming and a

388
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,720
humble recognition of the
greatness of the great teachers

389
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,220
and saints of history, and at
the same time, a sense that even

390
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:43,840
they, even they have not
captured, perhaps, the vastness

391
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,240
of the great expanse of the
world, of the world as it is,

392
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,360
the world of, you know, our 13
point 7 billion year old world,

393
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,800
and the scale of the
evolutionary project. You know,

394
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,920
Sri Aurobindo said that humanity
was a transitional being, and if

395
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,580
we don't understand what we're
transitioning to, it's hard to

396
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,440
understand what we are. Even
right now, everything we're

397
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,700
doing is taking us. It's not
we're not only the culmination

398
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,440
of everything that has been in
our evolutionary story, but

399
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,620
we're also laying foundations
for what we are in the process

400
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,000
of becoming. And what we're
becoming is something, at least

401
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,300
from my experience, is not
something that results in a

402
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,100
culmination of a few 1000 years
out, but hundreds of 1000s,

403
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:42,160
millions of years, millions of
years coming. So it's just that

404
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:49,300
radical expansion of existential
horizons that that qualifies my

405
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,400
relationship to the world's
religions

406
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,440
Ryan Kemp: and your journey in
particular. I mean, what? What I

407
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,920
really enjoyed in the book as
well, was your journey hasn't

408
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,120
necessarily being one of just
love and light and bliss and

409
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,440
divine unfolding. As many have
the kind of presupposition of

410
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,060
the spiritual path to use, for
lack of a better word, the

411
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,480
spiritual path they think is
some kind of love and light,

412
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,100
blissful path, but actually it
can be very difficult, very

413
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:27,620
isolating, very lonely and very
nightmarish in some, some sense,

414
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,440
many people that are on the
path, whether it be through

415
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,340
psychedelics or whatever
spiritual, spiritual practices

416
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,500
they may be involved in, to be
on that individual path can be

417
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,660
Very difficult. And what you
mentioned in your book was some

418
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,180
of the dark side of what you've
been through very openly and

419
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,900
honestly, voyaging, especially
in the in your early sessions,

420
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:56,920
through the hell realms, and in
your sessions 11 to 15, you

421
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,440
mentioned the hell realms. I
mean, could you? Could you talk

422
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,540
about those a little bit,

423
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,840
Chris Bache: yeah, I had, I had
to think a lot about how to

424
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,180
present the different types of
suffering and the different

425
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,960
types of challenges that I faced
on the journey because, and in

426
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,480
fact, it was my greatest concern
in beginning to Share my the

427
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,680
story of my journey with the
world, with others, because I

428
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:30,140
did not want them to become
scared of the unseen universe,

429
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,820
and I did not want them to
prematurely misjudge the

430
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,220
psychedelic method itself. And I
really had to think about this.

431
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,440
And eventually I decided just to
tell, to tell what happened, to

432
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,200
lay it out and to tell what
happened. And there is great joy

433
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,880
and great beauty and great
ecstasy. And just, I mean, I

434
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,860
wouldn't trade these 73 days for
any treasures on earth. I mean,

435
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:05,040
they just, they showed me so
much and they gave me so much

436
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:11,700
that whatever purification
processes I went through and

437
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:17,040
whatever pains I went through, I
paid them gladly to have been

438
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,120
and had been rewarded more than
fairly for what happened along

439
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,160
the way, but the what you
mentioned the hell realms? Well,

440
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,120
this is the kind of scenario I
basically after about two years

441
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,860
of work, I went through a really
crushing ego death, where my

442
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,840
historical existence was just
turned inside out and shattered.

443
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,960
And I thought, Okay, I've gone
through ego death, then I won't

444
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,540
have to go through that anymore.
I won't have to go through ego

445
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:54,520
death. Everything's going to get
better and better now. But what

446
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,480
happened was that very quickly,
within a couple of sessions, I

447
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,060
began to enter into. Realms of
collective suffering that were

448
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,840
just much, much worse than
anything I went through. In ego

449
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,680
death, I entered into what
Buddhism calls the hell realms.

450
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,500
I called it an ocean of
suffering. I was systematically

451
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,880
over two year period, and I was
taken deeper and deeper and

452
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,040
broken down at deeper and deeper
levels into realms of collective

453
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,620
anguish involving 1000s and
1000s and 1000s of beings, human

454
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,180
beings, and 1000s of years of
history and very detailed

455
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,460
patterns of configuration. And
at first I thought, This must be

456
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,820
a deeper iteration of ego death.
I must be going through a deeper

457
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,540
form of ego death. But
eventually, by the time this

458
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:58,840
ended, I realized that this
wasn't about my personal ego

459
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,420
death. It wasn't about personal
healing at all that somehow the

460
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,740
universe or something was using
my sessions to facilitate a

461
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:13,140
healing of my species, of my
people, that in somehow, in

462
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,780
opening myself or allowing into
my conscious awareness the

463
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,840
unresolved trauma of history,
all the terrible things we've

464
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,500
done to each other, all the
killings and maimings and rapes

465
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,640
and just that gave terrible
scars in the collective psyche

466
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,560
that somehow, when a person
opens this deeply, if you are

467
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,100
willing to let This pain and
suffering in, it has a

468
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,700
clarifying effect, a healing
effect, a transformational

469
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,700
effect that heals a certain
portion of the collective psyche

470
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,700
of humanity. Now I wouldn't dare
try to estimate how large a

471
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,340
portion or what its impact is,
but I was just taken repeatedly

472
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,880
through these hell realms, into
these hell realms, and

473
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,260
eventually they culminated. I
was about four years, four and a

474
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,360
half years in, 24 sessions in,
and they culminated an

475
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,240
extraordinary kind of orgy of
the ocean of suffering. And then

476
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,800
I was spun out into a deeper
level of reality that lay beyond

477
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,600
the hell realms into archetype
of reality. And at that point,

478
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,880
all the collective suffering
stopped, just as the ego death

479
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,200
suffering stopped when I went
through ego death, the ocean of

480
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,580
suffering stopped when I went
through this culmination and

481
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:48,700
entered into archetypal reality,
but later at deeper levels, as I

482
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,620
went into still deeper levels,
there were still challenging

483
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,860
periods that I would go through,
just periods where I entered

484
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:03,000
into patterns of chaos, patterns
of psychological dismemberment,

485
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,360
patterns of just different
subtle, subtle forms or ordeals

486
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,380
that were hard to understand
because, you know, we're

487
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,180
charting some territory that
lies far, far deep into the into

488
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,500
the collective fabric of Things,
into the not the collective

489
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,380
fabric. This is beyond the
collective fabric, into into the

490
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,300
dimensions of the Divine, into
the dimensions of the cosmic

491
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:39,680
mind itself. But every time I
came into one of these sort of

492
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,860
patterns of ordeal, or patterns
of clarification, I came to

493
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,060
recognize that these were all
some form of purification, that

494
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,200
if I allowed these things to
take place, something was being

495
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,760
lifted from my system, something
was being broken open, and

496
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,220
eventually it would culminate
and take me into yet a new

497
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:09,240
stunning level of discovery and
a deeper intimacy with the body

498
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,020
of the Divine.

499
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,820
Ryan Kemp: I mean many, many
people at these points where

500
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,060
they're going into an ocean of
suffering, and in your book,

501
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,260
describes also your experiences
were sometimes violent and

502
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,280
vomiting. And many people would
say, well, that's enough of

503
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,380
that, you know, I understand.
I'm going to start what, what

504
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,280
was it that drove you forward,
in particular, into this? I

505
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,900
mean, what was that drive to?
Because it could have

506
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,320
hypothetically been that they
would never end. He would just

507
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,800
continually. You didn't know
what was was over the horizon, I

508
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,480
guess. Or did you intuit that?

509
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,220
Chris Bache: I didn't know what
was in the horizon, over the

510
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,780
horizon, but it is something
that I perhaps the most profound

511
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,920
gift that Stan Grof gave me was
a trust in the universe.

512
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,600
Universe, they trust that you
could surrender yourself to

513
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,920
whatever was asked of you, and
if you did so completely the

514
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,240
your the universe would in the
end, it would take care of you.

515
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,900
You would go through ordeals
that you may not understand, but

516
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,560
in the end, you would understand
them. You would get large enough

517
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,420
and enter deeply enough into the
universe that, with hindsight,

518
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,120
you would get a deeper
understanding of what was going

519
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,340
on. But absolute trust, if you
surrender completely, it will

520
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,000
lead to breakthrough. It will
lead to a deepening initiation.

521
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:40,160
So and I think you know,
everybody has different measures

522
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,740
of tolerance and different
circumstances, and again, I

523
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,460
don't think it's wise to push
even though I did this as

524
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,660
responsibly as I could, and
really taking very good care of

525
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,140
my body throughout and in
between my sessions, I was doing

526
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,632
about five sessions a year. I
worked for four years. I stopped

527
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:05,972
for six years, and then I worked
for 10 very intense years. So

528
00:41:05,972 --> 00:41:10,232
over the 14 years, or 14 and a
half years when I was actively

529
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:14,912
working, I was averaging about
five sessions a year. So I had

530
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:19,352
months in between every session
to digest my experiences, to

531
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:23,240
write them down, to think about
them, to reflect upon them, and

532
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,180
I was doing a lot of yoga in
between. I was doing a lot of

533
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:31,460
meditation, a lot of spiritual
practice. But even doing all of

534
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:37,160
those preparatory practices, I
found myself pushed to my

535
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:43,300
absolute limits in going as
deeply as I did. And ironically,

536
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:49,240
in the end, it wasn't the pain
that was the most difficult

537
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,240
thing to manage in my work. It
was the ecstasy. It was the

538
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,600
intimacy with the fabric of
existence. It was entering into

539
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,040
what I came to call the diamond
Luminosity, what Buddhism calls

540
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,500
Dharmakaya, the absolute, the
clear light of absolute reality,

541
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,140
entering into such dissolving
into the light that precedes the

542
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,040
physical universe as
manifestation, dissolving into

543
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:25,100
the crystalline body of the
Divine, that ecstasy, that joy,

544
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,500
became more difficult to manage
than the pain of getting there.

545
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,560
And the reason it became
difficult to manage was not

546
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,580
because of the joy itself, but
because it was a temporary

547
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,040
condition. I could not stay in
that condition. Now there are

548
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,820
great masters and Great Beings
who can stay in that condition

549
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,200
and all honor always to the
great ones. But in my condition,

550
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,920
in my circumstance, I could only
gain temporary access to these

551
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,300
realities, and when I would come
back out of them, I was

552
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:04,020
simultaneously deeply and
profoundly spiritually satisfied

553
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,300
and gratified, and I was left
with an aching sense of

554
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,360
bereavement because I could not
stay. I had to leave.

555
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,960
Ryan Kemp: Yeah, it reminds me a
little bit of what Baba Ram Dass

556
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,980
used to talk about. He used to
say, We're all walking each

557
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,040
other home. And a little bit
about what you're you're talking

558
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,600
about, it, it one necessarily
doesn't require psychedelics in

559
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,500
order to go to this place. There
are people that seem to be able

560
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,120
to do it without the use of
these tools. And life itself is

561
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,560
an analogy for what you're
talking about we go through on a

562
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,700
day to day basis, forms of
suffering, of which we tolerate

563
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,820
and overcome for the good of
ourselves and the community and

564
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,420
the society and the human race,
and we also experience periods

565
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:57,760
of bliss. So we are interfacing
with our reality on a day to day

566
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,980
level, independently of these
kind of cosmic experiences.

567
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,520
Would you agree that's the case?
We're all walking together. I

568
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:05,880
mean,

569
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,020
Chris Bache: yes, absolutely,
absolutely. I mean, once again,

570
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,340
what happens in these sessions
is that your consciousness is

571
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,940
temporarily amplified. That's
all your consciousness is

572
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,620
tearing, temporarily amplified.
So if you want to understand

573
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,160
what truly happens in a session,
you must have an understanding

574
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,400
of basically what happened,
what's happening in life outside

575
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,180
of a session. So in that
context, my understanding of

576
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:37,040
life, which I draw from my
philosophical studies and

577
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,240
psychological studies, and then
in addition to that, my

578
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,980
psychedelic experiences. For me,
reincarnation is a simple fact

579
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:50,380
of life. It's just this is how
life works. We incarnate.

580
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,620
There's a narrowing of our
conscious experience with an

581
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,220
incarnation, we take on a
particular persona, male,

582
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:02,520
female, rich, poor. We. We
incarnate in a particular

583
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,540
historical period, social
conditions. We live our life as

584
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:13,200
best as we can, and then we die,
we expand back into our deeper

585
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,100
soul consciousness, back into
spiritual reality. When we die,

586
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,800
our consciousness expands. We
return to the light when we

587
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,820
incarnate, there is a
contraction into the specificity

588
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,960
of our next learning exercise,
different gender, different

589
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,380
social circumstance, different
historical period, we live and

590
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,920
learn, and then we expand.
Because I'm an academic, I tend

591
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,220
to see this as like a semester.
You know, we choose our courses

592
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,360
for the semester, and then we're
locked in. And then at the end

593
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,200
of the semester, we get some
breathing space expand, so we

594
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:52,960
keep this up. And we're always
kind of, we're in the dance of

595
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,560
learning to create learning the
consequences of our choices,

596
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,300
making good choices, making bad
choices, you know, just learning

597
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,000
and growing and becoming more
and this is the dance of life.

598
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,180
This is taking place, and it's
been taking place for hundreds

599
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,160
of 1000s of years, when we begin
to meditate without

600
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,640
psychedelics, just when we begin
to meditate and focus on the

601
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,240
consciousness which is living
through all of these lives, one

602
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,760
of the things that happens is we
speed up what is taking place

603
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,420
when reincarnation, if you want
to speed up your spiritual

604
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:32,300
evolution, then focus on the
fundamental inner experience of

605
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:38,360
your being. And if you do that,
you begin to confront themes and

606
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,160
issues and choices, which, if
you didn't do that, would

607
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,700
eventually manifest in some
conditions in the outer physical

608
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,240
world. But if you don't want to
wait for them to manifest in the

609
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,020
outer physical world, you can
confront those conditions in

610
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:58,720
your inner psychological world.
So you you actually you speed up

611
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:04,260
your evolutionary process when
you focus in your your inner

612
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,440
being, in the sort of the inner
flow of your being. And

613
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,820
psychedelics is simply another
form of spiritual practice which

614
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:17,580
very intensely, for temporary
periods of time, focuses on that

615
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:21,680
fundamental core stream of your
being and so there is a

616
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,760
detoxification process, an
accelerating process that takes

617
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,040
you eventually deeper and deeper
home. I mean deeper and deeper.

618
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,360
There are just so many levels of
home, so many levels of return.

619
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,840
But yes, this is simply we are
simply dancing the dance of

620
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,160
life, just doing it in a
slightly different form. And you

621
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,400
can stop anywhere along the way.
And just as you can stop your

622
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,700
meditation practice, you can
stop your psychedelic practice,

623
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:57,520
and you continue to dance the
dance in life. It is the dance.

624
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,320
Ryan Kemp: I mean, we touched
upon this briefly in a private

625
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,820
conversation, but we discussed
the idea of moving outward from

626
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,540
the kind of collective egoic
mind, what a car Tolle would

627
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,260
call the collective egoic mind,
and moving into a process of

628
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,700
what Jung would term a process
of individuation, becoming an

629
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,220
individual. And that that
process can be a very lonely

630
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,400
process, too, if you, if you're
not within the community that

631
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,420
understand you, like, like Jung
said, loneliness is not, not,

632
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,300
not from comes from having
nobody around. It comes from not

633
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,960
being able to express the ideas
that are important to you or

634
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,860
that others find it invisible.
This, this idea, the journey of

635
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,420
individuation can be a lonely
one, and the road to that, as

636
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,500
you're discussing it now, is
this process of evolution and

637
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,220
meditation. And I'm sure you've
been through experiences like

638
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,860
that, like many of our listeners
and and people that are on these

639
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,100
journeys, I'm sure you've been
through those experiences you

640
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,240
know, through this book and
through your life. Would that be

641
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,200
correct in saying,

642
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,640
Chris Bache: Yes, I think
basically the deeper I've gone

643
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,760
into this, on the one hand, like
I feel more deeply my

644
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,440
fundamental common ground with
all human beings. I don't feel

645
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:22,700
unique or separated or set aside
in any way. I resonate more and

646
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:27,200
more deeply with the human
condition and with the dance

647
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,180
that human beings are dancing
across the globe, around the

648
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:37,760
world, and you know, in many
spiritual traditions, if we

649
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,100
address this issue of
individuality, in my book, Dark

650
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,360
naturally dawn. The last chapter
of that book in which I am

651
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,640
discussing there a number of
things, but one of the things

652
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,680
I'm discussing is my own
psychedelic history. In the last

653
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,260
chapter, the fate, the name of
that chapter is the fate of

654
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:01,020
individuality, because many
spiritual. Definitions basically

655
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,880
say the individual is an is an
illusion. Individuality is

656
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,260
basically a it's just an
illusion. And the goal is to

657
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:14,460
transcend individuality and
return to the one. And you, the

658
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,000
drop returns to the ocean.
Vedanta thought in India

659
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,620
basically that the drop returns
to the ocean you dissolve into

660
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:27,620
the divine, and that is coming
home. And any kind of holding on

661
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,920
to, any kind of sense of
separate existence and

662
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:38,540
individuality is basically it's
it's not a fully mature

663
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,660
spiritual understanding or
experience. And I disagree with

664
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,520
that. My experience has been
that individuality is one of the

665
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,360
great gifts of creation.
Individuality is one of the

666
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:58,060
great manifestations of
existence. And what we don't

667
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,220
want to do is live in an
isolated individuality, to think

668
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,000
that somehow our individuality
is makes us separate

669
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,560
ontologically in with respect to
the core of our being separate

670
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:16,200
from other beings in the world,
unique in the world, or that our

671
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,660
individuality is a permanent,
abiding individuality which

672
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,700
never changes. I mean,
basically, I agree with Buddhism

673
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,920
in their teaching of anata or no
self, or emptiness of self, that

674
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:36,260
there is no private self in the
sense of a separate self, that

675
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,920
all our experience is part of
the matrix of cause and effect

676
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,560
manifesting in a continual
arising and falling away. And

677
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:49,360
there is no unchanging Self.
There is no absolute, unchanging

678
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:55,060
Self over time. But if you can
let go of that small sense of

679
00:51:55,060 --> 00:52:01,140
self, that ego which sees itself
separate and unchanging and open

680
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:06,120
and grow into a deeper
experience of individuality,

681
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:12,120
which is in continuous exchange
with all living beings, and in

682
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:18,660
continual expansion and Growing
and development. And I think

683
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:25,460
that basically the maturation of
that individuality over time.

684
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,320
The maturing of that selfless
kind of individuality is one of

685
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,860
the great spiritual gifts of our
time space experience. So the

686
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:41,260
two truths, one is the truth of
wholeness, the truth of oneness,

687
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,520
the truth of interconnectedness,
of inner penetration, another

688
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,440
truth is the truth of the
learning system, which

689
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,880
experiences all these things,
learns from it, internalizes it,

690
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,100
and becomes more because of it,

691
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,560
Ryan Kemp: which is also one of
The things that I grappled with

692
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:06,240
within your book and wasn't
quite sure about was, are we

693
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:12,720
talking about we have one soul,
which is known as God to many

694
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,200
people. Is the term linguistic
reductionist terminology that we

695
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,980
have to kind of use, is God or
the divine? What I was thinking

696
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:26,360
about many individual souls.
Which is it, or is it both?

697
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:33,380
Chris Bache: Well, we can choose
to use language any way we want.

698
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,880
We can. We can define our terms
as we go, as long as we're

699
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,300
careful and we know what we're
doing. So one can talk about God

700
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,220
as the one soul of which we are
all drops within that one ocean

701
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:52,240
of soul, and that's perfectly
fine. We can also use the term

702
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:59,140
soul to refer to the accumulated
experience of all of my former

703
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:04,860
lives integrated in a unique
individual consciousness, which

704
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:11,940
is as unique as a fingerprint
within a still larger matrix of

705
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,620
the collective species mind and
a larger matrix within the

706
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,220
planetary mind and within a
larger matrix of the Galactic

707
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:26,240
mind, but a true individual, an
individuality which she emerges

708
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:32,000
so we can determine, we can use
the word soul any way we want,

709
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,840
as long as we're clear what
we're doing with it. In my

710
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,140
experience, about halfway
through my journey, in session

711
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,740
38 which is a session I discuss
in the chapter on the

712
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:50,260
benediction of blessings, I had
a very interesting experience

713
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,500
previously, 11 years previously,
I had the experience when I was

714
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,920
coming through the ocean of
suffering. I had a series of.

715
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,940
Sessions which repeatedly took
me back into the same

716
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,420
experience, taking me deeper and
deeper into it, which was

717
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,980
experiencing the totality of my
life, from birth to death, as

718
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,960
simultaneously present as a
completed whole. It was, it was

719
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,180
like looking down my life from
beginning to end, and seeing it

720
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,960
and experiencing it as a
totality, complete and finished

721
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,700
with on within itself, which was
a mind shattering experience.

722
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:35,960
And it, and I discuss it in the
in the chapter, deep time in the

723
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,200
soul. But 11 years later, I was
given, I was a very deeper stage

724
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,220
of the work, I was working at
causal level, reality, a little

725
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:50,980
reality of oneness. And in this
time, I had the experience of

726
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,000
seemingly integrating all of my
former lives. They were coming

727
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,600
in quite quickly, from different
centuries, different periods,

728
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,220
and it was like wrapping a
filament of white light around a

729
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,720
kite spool. Just wrapping these
lies were coming in and were

730
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,980
wrapping themselves around this
kite spool. And at one point

731
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:19,020
they hit critical mass, they
fused, and when they fused,

732
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,340
there was an explosion of
diamond light from within my

733
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:27,020
chest, and I was catapulted into
a state of consciousness that

734
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:34,700
was unlike any I had experienced
before. I was an individual, but

735
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,780
beyond any category or any
experience of individuality that

736
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:44,140
I had ever known before, and I
came to language this in terms

737
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:48,820
of the birth of the diamond
soul. And they gave me, I was

738
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:53,260
given a series of teachings in
this session that all focused

739
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:57,820
upon reframing my understanding
of what the goal of

740
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:02,580
reincarnation is about, because
much of our teaching of

741
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:06,300
reincarnation comes from
cultures and times in history

742
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,140
where the pattern of the
teaching seems to be we are

743
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,220
mired in illusion. We grow
slowly, slowly through multiple

744
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:18,300
incarnations, eventually, we
come to a discovery of our

745
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,280
essential divine nature. We
awaken to our divine nature, and

746
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,360
when we achieve that awakening
breakthrough, we leave time

747
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,620
space. In Hinduism, the earliest
term for reincarnation was

748
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:37,160
moksha. Escape. We escape time
and space. We escape ego. But I

749
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,720
think all of the and the same
thing we have all of the

750
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,040
cosmologies of the religions of
the last 4000 years or so are

751
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,180
all up and out. Cosmologies. We
achieve salvation, we achieve

752
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:54,400
spiritual realization, and we
leave. We achieve nirvana. And

753
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,060
when we die, we move into parin
Nirvana, final Nirvana, or

754
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:03,660
Nirvana without the body. They
basically spiritual realization

755
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,740
culminates in some off planet
heavenly paradise, whether it's

756
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:15,600
the heaven or the garden or some
off planet paradise. And I think

757
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,500
basically that is a
fundamentally incomplete

758
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:24,020
cosmology. I think it represents
a certain stage of our human

759
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,780
development. But it's not the
end of the story. I think in

760
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:34,280
this experience, what I was
being shown is that eventually,

761
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:39,200
in this long, long process of
expanding and contracting, being

762
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,360
dying and being born, dying and
being born, learning more,

763
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:48,340
learning more, over time, over
time, sooner or later, sooner or

764
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:53,560
later, the soul, which usually
we experience. And by soul, I

765
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:58,780
don't I mean the totality of all
of our experiences in all of our

766
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:04,920
former lives. Sooner or later,
the soul wakes up inside the

767
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:10,440
body. The soul wakes up inside
time and space. That's what I'm

768
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:16,020
calling the birth of the diamond
soul. It is to be spiritual. It

769
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:20,640
is a spiritually waking up, a
spiritual maturing, a

770
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:26,240
psychological maturing where we
know that we are much, much more

771
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,840
than our body's physical
experience. We know we are more

772
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,780
than everything we have
experienced during the years

773
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,220
since our physical birth. We are
no longer tempted to identify

774
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,080
strictly with the limits of this
particular body. We have an

775
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,440
intuitive recognition of the
breadth of all of our

776
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,440
relationships with human beings
that we have been developing

777
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,860
relationships with for 1000s of
years. And there is a

778
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:56,380
transparency, not only to other
people or to other species, but

779
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:01,620
a transparency to the universe
itself, so that. Can we can

780
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:06,720
rest, we can absorb, we can
commune more deeply with the

781
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:13,740
divine, say, in while we are
inside time and space, that's

782
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,400
the birth of the diamond soul.
This is, this represents, I

783
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,340
think, the next stage of our
human evolution, which is a

784
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:26,600
spiritual maturation. It's
heaven on earth. It truly is

785
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,560
heaven on earth.

786
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:32,540
Ryan Kemp: So, so what you mean
is the spiritual realm as we

787
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,780
know it. One might kind of
perceive that as the dream

788
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:39,560
world. For those without
experience with the tools, the

789
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,900
dream world doesn't exist in
matter. It's outside of matter,

790
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,840
and that is the source of
creativity. It's the source of

791
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,580
what some people term God, the
source of the Divine, and that

792
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:55,720
is manifesting in matter. But
you're talking about the divine,

793
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,680
the collective mind, manifesting
in matter within the universe.

794
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,600
Is that correct?

795
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:07,140
Chris Bache: Yes, basically, we
can think of it perhaps, like

796
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,620
the mother universe and the
daughter universe. The mother

797
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,880
universe is spiritual reality
which is continually infusing

798
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:23,780
and orchestrating and shaping
and receiving physical reality.

799
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,500
So there is at the very quantum
level, this dance that takes

800
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,220
place. At the subatomic level,
we're learning that there's a

801
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:37,100
continual infusion of energy
into time and space coming from

802
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:42,520
this quantum or sub quantum
realm, that 96% of the universe

803
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,180
is dark energy, dark matter.
That that physical existence is

804
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:49,840
just the surface of things. Yes,
with reincarnation, we learned

805
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,580
that our our egoic identity, is
not our final identity. It's

806
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,500
only a temporary identity. There
is a deeper identity that is

807
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:04,200
emerging over long stretches of
historical time. There's a soul

808
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,400
identity. So there is, I think
there's just a sort of a larger

809
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,380
sense of the of the architecture
of the universe. Is a larger

810
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:20,840
sense of the landscape that we
are how to we are standing

811
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,380
always astride two realities. We
have one foot in the daughter

812
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,460
universe, one foot in the mother
universe. And the more we can

813
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:33,560
make this a conscious, you know,
integration, the more we begin

814
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:42,340
to consciously live as the
expression of the inflowing of

815
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:47,560
this mother, spiritual energy
into the divine energy of

816
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,760
manifestation. So I tend to
image this very simplistically,

817
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,860
as one reality is light and the
other reality is green, the

818
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:00,480
manifest universe, the green
universe, the physical world,

819
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:05,220
is, is the manifest body of the
Divine, the world of pure light,

820
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,320
the world of pure spirit, is the
other side of the Divine, the

821
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:14,040
transcendent divine. We live
with the foot in both of those

822
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:19,020
realities most of the time. I
guess we tend to get caught in

823
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:24,800
just the physical side of
reality, and so we tend to long

824
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,880
for the spiritual dimension. But
I think as we awaken more

825
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,980
completely and more deeply, we
realize it's not simply a matter

826
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,220
of awakening and leaving time
and space as if something's

827
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:42,040
wrong with time and space, but
awakening more completely to the

828
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:47,380
fruition of the evolutionary
project inside time and space,

829
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:50,620
so that can we become more
conscious creators and

830
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:55,960
collaborators in creation inside
time and space. It doesn't deny

831
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:59,980
the joys of heaven, it doesn't
deny the joys of transcendent

832
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:06,840
reality, but it is, it leads to
a new cosmology. It needs, leads

833
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,400
to a deeper understanding of
what the purpose and project of

834
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,360
physical existence is.

835
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,180
Ryan Kemp: Within one of the
questions that came from one of

836
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,080
the Terence McKenna groups, from
one of the members there was,

837
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:25,220
it's nicely slotted in here. I
guess would be that during your

838
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:29,300
experiences, did you meet any
entities, any entities that

839
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:34,700
existed in a non atomic realm,
in the quantum realm, any, any

840
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:39,200
entities there that were not
human souls? And we, we can read

841
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,300
about that in Rick Strassman
work, the spirit molecule and

842
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:47,440
some, some of the work he's
done, was there anything there

843
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,500
for you that was foreign from
that was not the collective,

844
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,580
that was not not this one soul,
or was it all a oneness?

845
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,260
Chris Bache: Well, it's
interesting. I have had

846
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:03,720
experience. Is where I have met
discrete intelligences, discrete

847
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:09,900
entities in spiritual reality.
But on the whole, that has not

848
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:14,400
been the flavor or the
trajectory of my experience. And

849
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,420
again, this is partly to do with
the substances, and partly to do

850
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:22,280
with how we work with the
substances. The entities seem to

851
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:27,860
be particularly prominent in
experiences that involve DMT, or

852
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:35,660
some of the variations of DMT,
Ayahuasca, or five Meo DMT,

853
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:44,920
sometimes or straight DMT. My
experience again, use LSD

854
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:52,540
somewhat different. I kept being
dissolved into deeper levels of

855
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:58,840
spiritual reality, and it was as
if I was being dissolved, not

856
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,720
into a society of beings,
though, I did meet beings in

857
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,920
different forms, but at a
different at a deeper level, I

858
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,960
was being dissolved into deeper
levels of being itself. It

859
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,780
really was like being dissolved
from atomic reality, leaving

860
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:24,260
atomic reality to entering into
quantum reality, into fields of

861
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:30,500
awareness and larger patterns of
awareness. So at every level,

862
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,000
there are patterns which one
could call, one could categorize

863
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,560
as entities. But if you really
sit with each of those entities

864
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:45,040
in deep forms, they eventually
dissolve themselves into yet

865
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:51,160
still deeper patterns within
existence itself. So on the one

866
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,800
hand, I do I'm really
comfortable with the entities,

867
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,340
and I see the wonderful art
produced by the great Ayahuasca

868
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:03,300
artist Pablo ameringo, and just
the it's a universe filled with

869
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,240
entities and spiritual
presences, and I'm really

870
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,320
comfortable with that. That does
resonate with my experience, but

871
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:15,480
my deeper experience has been to
be dissolved into deeper and

872
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:22,940
deeper patterns of being, rather
than separate beings. Right?

873
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:29,780
Ryan Kemp: Brilliant, brilliant.
So just moving then on as as we

874
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,620
look to the future. I mean, we
just touched upon that a little

875
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:37,760
bit. But what, what inclinations
you've had according to the book

876
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,700
and what you've just mentioned
there is you've seen where you

877
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:48,940
think this process is going and
how this ties in with the human

878
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:53,740
journey, not only now and the
past, as we discussed, but where

879
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,380
it's going into the future. I
mean, could you talk about your

880
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,860
insights there, and how you
think this is unfolding at the

881
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:03,660
moment, particularly now under
under these circumstances of

882
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,100
covid lockdown and whatnot,
which also part of something

883
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:11,700
much larger, much larger. Yeah,
yeah.

884
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,840
Chris Bache: Well, this is one
of the largest surprises for me

885
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:23,780
in this work, and I'm really
cautious about entering into it,

886
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:27,380
and yet I in discussion, even
though I also believe it's

887
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,120
perhaps the most important body
of visionary experience that

888
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:36,320
emerged in my work because, and
I say it was surprising, because

889
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:41,260
in the early years of my work, I
saw doing this work in terms I

890
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:45,820
had a model of individual
transformation, either

891
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:49,660
individual healing or individual
enlightenment. I was doing this

892
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:55,480
work to improve myself in some
way or shape or form. But what

893
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,600
happened was, of course, in
entering the ocean of suffering,

894
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,080
it all became about collective
transformation. It all became

895
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,920
about healing the collective and
about releasing the pains that

896
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,800
have been accumulated in
history, in the collective

897
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,240
psyche. And then I was moved
into deeper levels. And about

898
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:21,680
that time in that transition, a
series of visions began. And

899
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:26,000
these visions were consistent
from the 23rd session all the

900
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,420
way to the 70th session. It
wasn't that they were there

901
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:33,200
every session, but they were
periodically, I was being

902
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,820
initiated into a particular
understanding of history, a

903
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:41,860
particular understanding of
human history. And repeatedly,

904
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:45,940
there was a sense that humanity
was coming into a period of

905
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:51,040
decisive significance, a period
of profound breakthrough, a

906
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,400
spiritual culmination, a
culmination of our entire

907
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,300
reincarnation history, that
we're this was going to be a

908
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:02,880
before and after a. Moment, this
was one of the ways it was

909
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,720
envisioned. Was I was climbing
up this mountain, and on the

910
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,720
other side of the mountain I was
in sort of shadows, but on the

911
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:13,080
other side of the mountain there
was this brilliant light, a

912
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:16,800
brilliant valley with just
brilliant light, and that

913
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,800
humanity was coming into the
fundamental turning point. And

914
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,960
this went on for years, this
vision of it. And I eventually

915
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,320
wrote these down. I collected
them, and I call them the

916
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:38,180
visions of awakening. But I did
not see, I had not seen how life

917
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,580
was ever going to carry humanity
across the threshold, because

918
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:46,120
when I looked at the world
around me, I saw as much

919
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,740
evidence for our being stupid
and making just terrible choices

920
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,860
as I did for us making
spiritually wise choices. I did

921
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:01,560
not see us letting go of our
collective greed. I did not see

922
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,160
us taking more and more
responsibility for the well

923
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,420
being of others. Some were, of
course, but many weren't. And

924
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:16,440
then in 1995 and 55 sessions
into the journey the universe

925
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,180
took me deeply into deep into
the future, deeper into deep

926
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:25,460
time than it had ever taken me
before, and it took me into an

927
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:30,740
experience which I experienced,
not as an individual, even a

928
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:35,240
spiritual individual, but I
experienced it. And I know this

929
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:40,460
sounds outrageous, but I
experienced it as the species I

930
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:45,820
was dissolved into the
collective psyche, so deeply

931
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:52,900
that for these hours, I was our
species mind. I was dissolved

932
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:56,920
into the collective psyche, and
in that context, I experienced a

933
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,320
building crisis, a mounting
crisis that just was taking

934
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:05,340
away, stripping us of reality as
we had known it. It was it was

935
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:09,960
the dark night of our collective
soul. It was a time in history

936
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:16,140
where a real confrontation with
the consequences of choices that

937
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:20,600
we've been making, historically,
a real confrontation with our

938
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,120
poor choices. We were losing
control. We were we were just

939
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,800
being shattered. It really it
reached a point where I thought

940
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,860
it was an extinction event. I
thought we were all going to

941
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:37,160
die. It was like being on a
small island when a hurricane

942
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:41,740
comes upon, comes upon, it that
it just was wiping out all life

943
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:46,480
on the island. And just when it
was at its peak, just when it

944
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,880
was it seemed that death was
inevitable. The storm passed,

945
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,660
and there were survivors. Many
had been killed, but there were

946
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:58,660
survivors. And when the
survivors started to pick

947
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:02,820
themselves up and started to
gather and find each other and

948
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:08,340
reconstitute life. There was
springing forward, springing

949
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,780
from within us. The most
extraordinary phenomenon there

950
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:17,760
was this, a birth of new
insights, a birth of new values,

951
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,460
new understanding, new
priorities,

952
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:27,500
new social initiatives there
were basically an unleashing of

953
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:32,000
something that we had learned,
something that had taken place

954
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,840
in the center of the human heart
in the midst of this crisis.

955
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:42,160
Basically just as a saint in
undergoing intense spiritual

956
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,860
practice, goes through the
purification which John of the

957
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:49,180
Cross, cross calls the dark
night of the soul, likewise, in

958
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:53,500
our collective evolution, the
dark night of our collective

959
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,040
soul a time of complete
surrender and intense

960
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,700
purification which breaks us
down at the center, yielded to a

961
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:08,700
time of great awakening, a great
spiritual manifestation, a great

962
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:13,620
redirection of the human heart
and of human culture. It was a

963
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:19,440
true great awakening of the
species. And in time, in

964
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:24,500
subsequent sessions, I was taken
into the deep time again, and I

965
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:29,360
began to be shown that this
represented not simply a

966
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,620
historical breakthrough and not
simply a technical or economic

967
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,140
restructuring of our culture,
but it was a truly seismic shift

968
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:45,040
in the depths of the collective
psyche. A pivot took place in

969
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,060
this global crisis, a global
systems crisis, which appeared

970
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:53,500
to be driven by a global
ecological crisis. It was a

971
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:59,740
shift in the core psyche, the
collective psyche, which all

972
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:04,380
other. Human beings draw from on
their individual life. So when

973
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:08,760
the collective psyche shifted,
it meant that every generation

974
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:13,200
that was born on the planet
after this shift took place,

975
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:18,420
they were being informed by and
were infused by this new

976
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:23,000
blueprint, this new
psychological blueprint, this

977
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,220
new capacity. And I think what I
was experiencing was a true

978
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:33,260
spiritual awakening out of just
individuals, but of our entire

979
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:39,260
species. And this was deepening,
deepened in the years that

980
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:44,560
followed. So ever since this
time, I have come to understand

981
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,840
that my personal belief in the
visionary experiences that were

982
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,280
given to me in the sessions were
showing that humanity is coming

983
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:58,420
to a decisive moment in its
evolutionary journey. We were

984
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:04,380
coming into a time of critical
challenge and a time requiring

985
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:11,580
maximum effort and maximum
clarity. We are literally this

986
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:16,620
is a time of labor. Gestation is
long. The period of gestation is

987
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:21,560
a long time, but the time of
labor is short and intense and

988
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:25,280
convulsive, we have been
preparing for this time in

989
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,120
history for 1000s and 1000s of
years through reincarnation,

990
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,680
reincarnation, reincarnation.
But now we have entered into a

991
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:38,600
time, I think, in which we are
giving birth to the future

992
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:43,120
human. We are giving birth to a
different kind of human being.

993
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,980
And I think we are giving birth
to the diamond soul. I think the

994
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:53,680
soul is going is entering into
history in a collectively

995
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:58,360
unmanifest, an unprecedented
fashion. I think the world as we

996
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:03,480
know it was designed by ego. And
the ego is a magnificently

997
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:07,080
beautiful psychological
structure. I mean, I really, I

998
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,560
respect it enormously. But
ultimately, the ego is a

999
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,060
fragmented psychological
structure, and it leaves us cut

1000
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:19,740
off from each other and from
existence itself. The world

1001
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:24,920
designed by the ego creates
categories of problems of

1002
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:29,300
division which we know and
recognize well in history now

1003
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,660
dividing between races, dividing
between religions, dividing

1004
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:35,960
between classes, just division,
division, division, division.

1005
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,480
But the birth of the diamond
soul represents a new starting

1006
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:45,700
point for humanity, a deeper and
I think the core of it is this,

1007
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,920
a deep experience of oneness,
not just as a concept or as a

1008
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,780
category, but a profound
awakening of oneness within the

1009
01:17:55,780 --> 01:18:01,080
human heart and the world that
is A species which is grounded

1010
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:06,180
in this experience of oneness
builds a different world than

1011
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:10,500
the ego builds. And I think the
diamond soul is we are giving

1012
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:16,320
birth to the diamond soul in
history. And I see the covid 19

1013
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:21,200
not as this crisis, but perhaps
as an early stage of this

1014
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:26,180
fermenting crisis. It is a
crisis which is very painful and

1015
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:29,540
very difficult, but it's
teaching us something. If we

1016
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:34,580
learn the lessons that covid 19
is has the opportunity to teach

1017
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:40,220
us, if we learn about well here,
everybody would put their own

1018
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:43,000
fill in the blanks at this point
what it is trying to teach us.

1019
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,620
But if we learn the lessons of
compassion, if we learn how bad

1020
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:53,800
things go when we give ourselves
over to egoic leadership and

1021
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:57,280
divisive patterns of leadership
and self centeredness within the

1022
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:02,040
species, then things go very
badly. But if we open into other

1023
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:06,000
caring, if we open into
selflessness, if we open into

1024
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:11,580
reigning in some of the patterns
of blind repetition and greed,

1025
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:17,220
then we are learning things
which will be very valuable to

1026
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:23,120
us when the deeper crises that
are coming manifest, and all you

1027
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,780
have to do is just read the
works of the deeply informed

1028
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:31,520
ecologist and environmental
students of history to

1029
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,660
appreciate the scale of what we
are coming into as we

1030
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:40,780
increasingly heat the planet and
weather the tragedies that are

1031
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:44,800
going to be generated, that are
being generated by our changing

1032
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,540
climate. This, I think, is
really the crisis, the deeper

1033
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:53,800
crisis that covid 19 is giving
us an opportunity to prepare

1034
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,280
for.

1035
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:59,140
Ryan Kemp: Yeah, beautiful. It's
it's in the collective mind as

1036
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:02,100
well. I think that. All on an
individual level, aware that

1037
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,860
something is brewing or
something is coming. And I don't

1038
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,380
know if that's how it's been
throughout history of humanity

1039
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:11,700
that we've always felt there's
some kind of cataclysmic event

1040
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,420
on the horizon, but now, now
more than ever, it's certainly

1041
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:20,240
in the collective mind and our
habits, our nature, our way of

1042
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:26,720
being at this moment is is both
destructive, but we're also

1043
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:31,100
seeing this kind of psychedelic
Renaissance, and we're also

1044
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,400
seeing a lot of people looking
to the past for answers about

1045
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,880
the future more than ever, I
think, in the past two years,

1046
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:45,100
than say, in the past 20 but,
yeah, it's, it's a big part of

1047
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:50,080
of of your vision. But you say
that the covid, what you think

1048
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:56,260
is the covid is only a small
part of that. But as you look to

1049
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:00,220
the future, do you see a very
like throughout evolution,

1050
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:03,960
previous species have had to die
off in order for new versions of

1051
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:10,140
ourselves to evolve. Yeah, do
you see like a catastrophe, a

1052
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:13,320
world ending catastrophe? Is
that what you're you're pointing

1053
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:13,440
to?

1054
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,220
Chris Bache: Well, I want to be
careful. I'm not a visionary

1055
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:24,080
outside of my psychedelic work.
Yes, I don't. I don't have a

1056
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:29,720
psychic ability to see into the
future. And when I I only have

1057
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:34,460
what I saw and what I was shown
in my visionary experiences

1058
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,180
inside my psychedelic sessions,
these have been consistent, in

1059
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:42,220
uniform. I trust the
consciousness that gave me these

1060
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:47,980
visions. They seem to be
deliberate and well crafted, so

1061
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:51,640
I trust them, but I recognize
that one person's visions are

1062
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:55,180
only one person's visions, and
they don't necessarily hold the

1063
01:21:55,180 --> 01:22:03,060
same value to other people. So
what I saw was a world coming

1064
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:08,520
into acute crisis, a depth of
crisis that was literally

1065
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:13,620
breaking us down at very deep
and fundamental levels. And it

1066
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:18,060
was only when we when we had
reached intolerable amounts of

1067
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,920
suffering, that we were willing
to start making choices that we

1068
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,960
were not willing to contemplate
previously, and in making these

1069
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:32,420
new choices, choices for the
greater good, choices for our

1070
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:37,160
children's children's children,
choices that were necessary in

1071
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:41,620
order to pull ourselves back
From this destructive binge that

1072
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:46,900
we had been on for the last
several 100 years. Then a new

1073
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:51,220
future began to emerge. But I
was not given specifics about

1074
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:55,720
how, when or why. I wasn't told
when I wasn't told why. It was

1075
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:01,080
just very, very broad strokes,
but what I was given was the the

1076
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:05,820
inner experience of this death
and rebirth as a species, and I

1077
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:10,260
was given some understanding of
the collective mechanisms. See

1078
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:13,740
we have, we have to travel a
great distance in a very short

1079
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:18,300
period of time. How can we
really mature to the drives, to

1080
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,880
the level, to the challenges
that we are facing as fast as we

1081
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:28,040
need to in order to survive what
we are letting loose on the

1082
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:33,920
globe. And I was given some
insights into mechanisms that

1083
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,280
are operating at the collective
level. I won't go into these in

1084
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,960
detail because they laid out in
the book, but it has to do with

1085
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:45,400
how systems operate when they
move into non linear into non

1086
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,580
linear ranges non equilibrium
systems. Some of the physics of

1087
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:53,320
non equilibrium systems as they
apply to psychic fields and the

1088
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:58,120
psychic field of the human
family as a totality, you know,

1089
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:05,640
so to me, I I guess the some of
the greatest gifts I were given.

1090
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,860
I was given at the end of my
journey was to be taken deep

1091
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:17,640
into the future, and was given
the privilege of experiencing

1092
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:23,000
this, what I'm calling the
future human, the child that we

1093
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,740
are giving birth to, what the
future human feels like, looks

1094
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:34,280
like, and if I try to describe
it to you, I'll probably end up

1095
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:39,920
weeping, because it was So
beautiful. This being was so

1096
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:45,280
beautiful, so magnificent. We're
talking about a healed humanity,

1097
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:51,040
truly healed, right down to our
bones, a humanity with an

1098
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:55,420
absolutely radically expanded
heart, what Christians look at

1099
01:24:55,420 --> 01:25:01,080
Jesus and call the sacred heart,
the heart, the one heart. A mind

1100
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:05,940
open to the intelligence of the
universe in new and profound

1101
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:12,060
ways, a truly enlightened
humanity, one in all, just a

1102
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:18,780
magnificent shift in the common
ground of human experience. And

1103
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:23,480
I believe that just as a mother,
when she has her baby in her

1104
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:28,460
arms after a hard labor, forgets
the labor at one level, because

1105
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:34,520
the child is is with her. Now,
likewise, humanity will is going

1106
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:38,540
through this very, very intense
birth process, but when this

1107
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:43,240
birth sees its goal, when the
child is born, when the future

1108
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,840
human is born on the earth. And
I don't have any particular

1109
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,960
vision of again, how when I
don't know whether it's this

1110
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,160
long, gradual or it's a sudden,
cathartic thing, but when this

1111
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:59,140
child is born in history, we
will look back on the terrible

1112
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:03,060
pains that we went through to
give birth to it, and will say

1113
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:07,440
it was worth it. Maybe if we had
been smarter, we could have done

1114
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,700
it easier and faster. Maybe we
brought some of this on our own

1115
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:16,980
heads unnecessarily, but when
the child is born, it will be

1116
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:19,560
worth it. Beautiful.

1117
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:24,380
Ryan Kemp: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You
posed a question in your book.

1118
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:29,180
You said, what is the value of
true but temporary knowledge,

1119
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:32,600
moving into these planes and
coming back and being able to

1120
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,620
sustain them? You mentioned you
have different answers at

1121
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:39,500
different times, and so I
thought it'd be interesting to

1122
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:43,240
to ask what? What is your answer
to it at the moment, at this

1123
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:43,660
time?

1124
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,820
Chris Bache: Well, the soft
underbelly, if, if we do this

1125
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:57,100
work in order to facilitate, not
simply temporary Hies or

1126
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:01,680
temporary, you know, insights,
but if we do it in order to

1127
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:08,580
encourage or facilitate a
maturation of our psycho

1128
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:13,500
spiritual life, which leads
ultimately to a shift in the on

1129
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:18,660
the ground of our consciousness,
an abiding shift to shift not

1130
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:21,860
Only into peak experiences, but
a shift into plateau

1131
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:28,760
experiences. If we approach
psychedelic experience with this

1132
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:33,260
long term maturational view,
then the soft underbelly of

1133
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:36,980
psychedelics is their temporary
nature. You know, we enter into

1134
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:41,680
these states. You can't stay
there. We're going to be in

1135
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:46,960
there only for a few hours at a
time, and then we come out. We

1136
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:51,700
have to kind of reconcile
ourselves with the limitations

1137
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:56,080
of the of the practice that
we're engaging in. But if we use

1138
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:00,840
those hours carefully, if we use
them conscientiously, I believe

1139
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:04,680
they do accelerate our
evolution. And then they can, by

1140
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:09,000
showing us where we are going,
they can, they begin to act as

1141
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,460
kind of strange attractors,
drawing us into our individual,

1142
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:19,260
individual and collective
evolution faster, more deeply.

1143
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:25,040
And so it is frustrating to sort
of, you know, at two o'clock in

1144
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,820
the afternoon to be so deeply
immersed in the wisdom of the

1145
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:33,860
universe, and then by 10 o'clock
that night, you know your your

1146
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:38,840
ordinary mind is congealed
around yourself again. And no

1147
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:43,600
matter how hard you try, you're
not living in the same reality

1148
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,560
that you were in before the
value, what is the value of true

1149
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:55,360
but temporary knowledge? And I
think in my case, at least, I

1150
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:01,740
pushed myself perhaps deeper
than was wise, into deep, deep,

1151
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:06,720
temporary knowledge, and so
again, if I were doing it over

1152
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:10,860
again, knowing what I know now,
I would be more patient with a

1153
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:17,160
slower pace of my own personal
evolution. I would and and the

1154
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:22,100
way this manifested for me is I
reached a point after 20 years

1155
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:26,120
of this work where I knew it was
time for me to stop my sessions,

1156
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,000
and, more importantly, the
consciousness that I was

1157
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,280
engaging knew it was time for me
to stop and it ended our

1158
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:37,040
sessions. I did not think they
were going to end. I did not

1159
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,200
know we were ending, but after
this very, very deep what I call

1160
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,500
the final vision, the last of my
great visions. In the 70th

1161
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:47,680
session, there were three
sessions, which I call the

1162
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:52,000
goodbye sessions. It basically
drew our work together to a

1163
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,340
close. And I had been given so
many blessings and had been so

1164
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:01,680
many joys on. The journey, I
thought that I could simply

1165
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:07,560
withdraw and I would be able to
be nurtured for the rest of my

1166
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:12,660
life by these blessings, and I
have been and and that is true,

1167
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:16,680
but there's something else that
happened, and that is I began to

1168
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:23,240
to experience a profound
existential loneliness, because

1169
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:27,020
I was not able to go back into
this deep, deep intimacy with

1170
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:30,680
the divine in even though I
continue to do spiritual

1171
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:35,660
practice, the spiritual
practices that I was doing, if I

1172
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:39,500
did them from multiple
lifetimes, perhaps I would be

1173
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,840
able to move back there, but in
this lifetime, I knew I would

1174
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:50,020
not reach that deep until I
died, and I found myself very

1175
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:56,620
quietly, just waiting to die so
I could return to my beloved and

1176
01:30:56,620 --> 01:31:01,440
that that's not a good way to
live. And it took me a while.

1177
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,940
Took me literally 10 years after
I stopped my sessions, to get

1178
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:11,220
fully grounded, to recommit
myself into living within my

1179
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:17,280
incomplete self, inside time and
space with some contentment for

1180
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:23,000
the remainder of my years. And
that's why I think true but

1181
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,020
temporary knowledge can be very
valuable. Transcendence can

1182
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,620
teach us who we are. It can
teach us what we're doing here.

1183
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:34,400
It can teach us maybe, what the
purpose of our life is. But if

1184
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:38,540
you plunge too deeply into
Transcendence, as I did, I think

1185
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:43,660
it can also undermine your sense
of belonging to the earth. And

1186
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:46,660
that is an equally important
lesson that it took me a while

1187
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:50,500
to, you know, kind of reground
myself in after I stopped my

1188
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:54,820
sessions. But the other thing I
found it was so hard after I

1189
01:31:54,820 --> 01:32:00,160
stopped. It wasn't just the loss
of communion. It was the

1190
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:04,860
sickness of silence. It was
having to stay silent about my

1191
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:09,720
psychedelic experiences. I'm a
teacher. I love to get to learn

1192
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,960
new things and to share that
learning with others, but in my

1193
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:17,820
society, I was never allowed to
bring my experiences to my

1194
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:21,200
colleagues, to bring my
experiences to my students, I

1195
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:25,280
always had to keep silent about
my psychedelic experiences

1196
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:29,240
because they were illegal and
but now that I've retired, I

1197
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:34,220
retired from my university a
little early in order to write

1198
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,120
diamonds from heaven or LSD in
the mind of the universe. And

1199
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:42,040
now, you know, I've given myself
permission. I'm past the statute

1200
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,220
of limitations for these
psychedelic crimes, and now I

1201
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:48,040
can say whatever I damn well
please, yeah, and

1202
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,920
Ryan Kemp: that's quite
liberating. It

1203
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,100
Chris Bache: is liberating. It's
because it's like coming out of

1204
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,520
a psychedelic closet is just as
liberating as coming out of any

1205
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,440
closet where we are forced to
deny the truth of our being, and

1206
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:06,180
so writing this book has really
been very healing and has

1207
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:11,220
facilitated a deeper level of my
own experiences, because now

1208
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:15,000
that I can talk about them, now
that I can just talk about them

1209
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,840
freely and receive other
people's experiences freely in

1210
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:23,600
the expanded psychedelic
conversation, now I can be in my

1211
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:29,000
physical existence who I have
been also in my shamanic,

1212
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,680
psychedelic existence. So the
two halves of my life are coming

1213
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:37,460
back together, and I'm beginning
to be experience levels of

1214
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:42,880
wholeness as an incarnate being
that I could not experience as

1215
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:48,520
long as I was being forcibly
held silent to my experiences.

1216
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:53,020
Ryan Kemp: Would you say you
have found any happiness or

1217
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:56,920
contentment from your
experiences? Obviously, I

1218
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:00,280
completely empathize and
understand with that separation

1219
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:03,120
and that, I don't know if it's a
feeling of rejection, but

1220
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:07,260
certainly like bereavement or
not being able to return to

1221
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:10,320
those, those very unique
landscapes and those unique

1222
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:15,600
feelings. But now in life, post
sessions, have you found a

1223
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,140
deeper happiness and
contentment? Are you still Ram

1224
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:22,940
Dass often says he hasn't cured
one neurosis through his entire

1225
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:28,280
spiritual journey, and he's
still he never used to be and so

1226
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:32,600
he never really changed, nor
found much, much deeper, deeper

1227
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,460
liberation, I guess. How is it
for you?

1228
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:41,620
Chris Bache: Hmm, wonderful. Ram
Dass, what an interesting man.

1229
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:57,880
Absolutely great respect. Hmm,
there is a deep relaxation when

1230
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:03,060
you I have had. Had so many
existential questions answered.

1231
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:08,760
I've had so many existential
pains soothed with the clarity

1232
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:14,580
of truth of experience. I feel
I've been given a much deeper

1233
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:20,960
understanding and appreciation
for how life works, and in that

1234
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,800
knowing, in that philosophical
and spiritual knowing, there is

1235
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,800
a great relaxation and a sense
of deeper cooperation with life.

1236
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:37,580
More than that, there's been in
the intimacy with the creative

1237
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:41,860
intelligence of the universe and
experiencing the depth of love

1238
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:46,600
that the universe pours into me,
into each of us, into all of us

1239
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:52,000
together. There's just been such
a there has been a profound

1240
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,800
spiritual fruition, which
probably has not cured me of all

1241
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:01,740
my foibles, but I certainly hope
it's tilted the balance and has

1242
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:10,920
helped me become a kinder
person, a calmer person, a more

1243
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:17,640
compassionate person. You know,
enlightenment, that's a tricky

1244
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:22,880
thing, maybe one day, but if I
were really aiming for

1245
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,540
enlightenment, as this is
classically conceived, living in

1246
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:31,640
a condition of deep transparency
to our eternal abiding nature,

1247
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:37,100
living perpetually conscious of
that aspect of our nature which

1248
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:43,000
Never begins, never ends, is
never divided. It is the the

1249
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,460
unchanging truth on which all
changing truth stands. If that

1250
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:51,400
were the goal of this work, I
would have done the work

1251
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:57,640
differently. I would have worked
with very, very small doses. The

1252
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:02,700
purpose of my work, or the
project of my work, it began

1253
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:08,400
kind of pursuing enlightenment,
but it became that just fell

1254
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:15,060
away early on, the work became
to support the enlightenment of

1255
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:19,320
my people, to support the
transformation of humanity as a

1256
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:24,440
whole. And then beyond that, it
became a process of cosmic

1257
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:31,160
exploration, to enter as deeply
as I could into the inside of

1258
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:35,600
the universe, and was given the
opportunity to see things and

1259
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:40,240
experience things that are went
far beyond my ability to

1260
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:46,060
stabilize as an abiding
consciousness when I return. So

1261
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:53,020
it's not from this perspective.
I don't consider my sessions as

1262
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:56,620
failures of attempted
enlightenment. I see them as

1263
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:03,360
successes of cosmic exploration,
and which, of course, is related

1264
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:10,200
to the condition of awakening or
enlightenment at one level, but

1265
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,200
at another level, it's
different. It's really quite

1266
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,200
different. You don't have to go
back to the beginning of the Big

1267
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:19,500
Bang to be enlightenment. You
don't have to experience

1268
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:22,880
archetypal reality. You don't
have to experience the future

1269
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,080
evolution of humanity to be
enlightened. This is just a

1270
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:33,260
different project. I hope,
however, in the deepening

1271
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:37,700
intimacy with the divine, I hope
there's been some progress

1272
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:44,080
towards spiritually wakening up,
you know, healing the fragments

1273
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:50,200
that we all carry from our
historical experiences, I feel a

1274
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:57,640
deep peace and contentment. And
perhaps most notably, not only

1275
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:01,500
am I not afraid of dying, I'm
looking forward to it. It's

1276
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:05,280
absolutely no fear for me,
because I know, I know where I'm

1277
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:09,660
going. Yeah, I know where we're
going. You know, we're going

1278
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:13,620
deeper into that light. So if
you're if there were one thing I

1279
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:18,360
wish I could give to other
people from my experiences, it

1280
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:21,980
would be this loss of fear of
death. Because if you're afraid

1281
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:26,600
of dying, your entire cosmology
is upside down. Yes, this is

1282
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,540
where, this is the hard place.
This is the time. Space is where

1283
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:36,320
the hard work is done. Spiritual
reality is, is it's it's reward,

1284
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:37,940
it's home, it's light.

1285
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:44,440
Ryan Kemp: Have you been tempted
in these later years to go back?

1286
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:49,240
I you'll know Aldous Huxley on
his deathbed, his wife injected

1287
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:53,440
him with a large amount, I think
is around 500 micrograms of LSD,

1288
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:58,060
and read him the Tibetan Book of
the Dead. Have you been tempted

1289
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:00,600
to go back into a high dose
session of. All these years

1290
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:02,820
later, I think it's been 20
years, hasn't it?

1291
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:07,260
Chris Bache: Yeah, actually, he
was injected with two low dose

1292
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:11,880
sessions, very low doses, yeah,
just low. And Laura Huxley

1293
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:21,500
discusses this in her biography
of autobiography. No, I mean,

1294
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:27,020
I've done, I've done low dose
sessions with LSD in the years

1295
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:32,600
since I stopped, but generally I
find it, it doesn't work well

1296
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:36,500
with me now. I mean, I've had
wonderful experiences, but I've

1297
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,360
pushed my system so hard with
the high doses that it is almost

1298
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:46,300
as if I've developed an allergy
for it. And if I were to take a

1299
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:50,740
massive dose of LSD today, I
would not be able to get back to

1300
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:55,420
where I was regularly journeying
in the last years of my work.

1301
01:40:55,720 --> 01:41:01,320
And it has to do with energy
every step into a deeper level

1302
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:07,440
of reality is it moves you into
a more intense level of energy.

1303
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:11,880
And there is an accumulation of
energy that builds up in your

1304
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:17,820
being in your over multiple
sessions. So I found that my

1305
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:22,700
system was accumulating energy,
storing this energy from session

1306
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:26,480
after session, even though those
sessions were months apart, it

1307
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:30,320
was accumulating a massive
quantity of energy which would

1308
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:35,180
then focus that energy and lead
to a breakthrough into a new

1309
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:38,480
level of consciousness. So those
breakthroughs are being paid

1310
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:43,180
for, not simply by hours of
intense psychedelic work. They

1311
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:48,160
sometimes were being paid for by
years of psychedelic work. So if

1312
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:51,700
I wanted to get back into some
of the territory I was

1313
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:55,480
exploring, of the diamond
Luminosity, that territory, I

1314
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:59,500
think it would take me years of
conscientious work to develop

1315
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:03,720
the momentum, the energetic
momentum to tap that deeply into

1316
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:09,900
the universe again. So at this
point my life, I'm content with

1317
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:14,820
more conventional spiritual
practices, a daily meditation

1318
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:19,920
practice. If I do use
psychedelic, sometimes I use

1319
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:25,520
gentler psychedelic Psilocybin
or Ayahuasca, which basically

1320
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:32,660
helps connect me to the fields
of knowledge that continue to

1321
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:39,800
surround me, deriving from my my
LSD work. So I experienced them

1322
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:43,600
not as breaking new ground, but
it's helping me integrate and

1323
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:48,580
absorb what I've already done
into my present being, which is

1324
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:53,140
how I experienced my meditation
practice. I'm not trying to go

1325
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:56,860
back to where I was into my most
intense psychedelic experiences.

1326
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:02,280
I'm not trying to break new
ground. I'm simply facilitating

1327
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:08,520
a deeper absorption of the
reality that I touched on those

1328
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,220
days into my physical being

1329
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:15,420
Ryan Kemp: like Alan Watts,
famous adage, when you've got

1330
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:19,800
the message, hang up the phone.
What are your thoughts on that?

1331
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,800
Is that right now?

1332
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:28,520
Chris Bache: Well, that's No, I
don't that. I would just say

1333
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:31,520
that's not been my experience. I
mean, this is thought. Huston

1334
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:35,540
Smith used that adage when he
had had about he says in his

1335
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:38,180
book, cleansing the doors of
perception after he had had

1336
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:41,680
about a half dozen psychedelic
experiences, the bummers

1337
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:49,420
increased, and it just really
wasn't working for him. And my

1338
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:53,140
experience is, it's when the
bummers increase is when the

1339
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:56,020
deeper cleansing is taking
place, and that's when it begins

1340
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:58,960
to get interesting. It's only
when death starts to really

1341
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:03,480
pound on you hard that it really
begins to get interesting. When

1342
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:06,060
you're having to lay your life
on the line, then it's getting

1343
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:10,980
interesting. So to me, if we
say, once you get the message,

1344
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:14,520
hang up the phone. Well, okay,
but what is the message? And

1345
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:18,300
there's so many messages and so
many levels, Nobody judges for

1346
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:22,580
another. But to me, there are
messages that come through in

1347
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:25,760
the early work, and they're
magnificent, and they're

1348
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,580
messages that come through in
the middle work, and they're

1349
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:31,640
messages that come through in
the later work. And if I had

1350
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:34,400
stopped with the early messages,
it would have been perfectly

1351
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,480
okay, absolutely, perfectly
okay, but I would have missed

1352
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:42,400
some of the things that came
later. Yeah, so to you know, so

1353
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,060
I think everybody has to make
the choices of how much is good

1354
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:49,780
for them, how much serves them,
and then whether it becomes

1355
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:54,040
counter productive. And I'll own
right up front, that I think I'd

1356
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:57,040
bit off a little bit more, not
not more than I could chew,

1357
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:01,080
because I chewed it all, but I
bit off more. Or maybe then was

1358
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:05,760
wise for for me to bite off.
Yeah.

1359
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,000
Ryan Kemp: Well, you know,
Chris, thank you very much for

1360
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,120
your time here and this
conversation, it's really has

1361
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:16,800
been brilliant, and you've been
massively inspiring in my life,

1362
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:20,600
and I know the lives of many
others that are involved in

1363
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:25,520
these kind of paths and pursuits
and these things that sometimes

1364
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:30,920
can seem so foreign and so
abstract that when you've taken

1365
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:34,880
the time, as you have done to
rigorously catalog everything

1366
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,540
you went through over these
years and put it in the book for

1367
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:42,760
some of us to read, that is very
reassuring, because it can, it

1368
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:46,000
can let us know that what's
happening to us and what's

1369
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,300
happening to others is not just
some random, random happening.

1370
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:52,240
It's like, Well, it happened to
this guy, and he's got a PhD,

1371
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:56,020
and he's a teacher, and he lived
a very normal life and and so

1372
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:59,800
you're not completely insane, as
some of us confuse some time,

1373
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,700
and that's what your book has
done for me and for many others.

1374
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:03,840
So I thank you for that.

1375
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:08,940
Chris Bache: Thank you, Ryan. It
truly is. It's an honor to have

1376
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:12,900
this discussion with you. Thank
you for the privilege of being

1377
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:17,460
able to share this time
together. It's a true joy for me

1378
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:21,980
and a privilege in my old age,
just to be able to have these

1379
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:25,400
kind of conversations, because
you are there's a whole new

1380
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:28,520
generation, and a generation
behind this generation which is

1381
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:31,880
going into this territory, and
we all have a lot to learn from

1382
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,480
each other.

1383
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:36,680
Ryan Kemp: Yes, perfect. So your
book is available on Amazon. And

1384
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,780
I don't know if you have a
website, do you, Chris?

1385
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:43,120
Chris Bache: You know, I'm
afraid it's not finished yet. It

1386
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:47,020
will be out. I hope in a month
or two. I've just been slow and

1387
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:49,960
busy. I've just moved to North
Carolina. It slowed up some of

1388
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:56,440
these things, but the website
will be Chris bache.com and but

1389
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:01,680
for the time being, people can
find my articles and essays on a

1390
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:08,700
website called academia.edu and
and the book is on Amazon,

1391
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:12,180
Ryan Kemp: yep. And it's also
very nicely enjoyed as an audio

1392
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:14,940
book on Audible, which I can
recommend to people because it's

1393
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:17,520
read by you also. So I think

1394
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:19,200
Chris Bache: that, yeah, I
enjoyed that. I think the

1395
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,880
written, the word, the spoken
word has a power even beyond the

1396
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:26,780
written word. And I really what
valued the opportunity to be

1397
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:29,360
able to read the book for for
listeners,

1398
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:32,060
Ryan Kemp: absolutely okay,
Chris, well, thank you very

1399
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:37,160
much. Yeah, and so yeah, thank
you, Chris.

1400
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:39,500
Chris Bache: Thank you. Love and
blessings.

1401
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:40,600
Unknown: You too. You applause.

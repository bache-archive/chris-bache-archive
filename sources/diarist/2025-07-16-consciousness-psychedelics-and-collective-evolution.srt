00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,740
Chris Bache: Hi everybody. It's
nice to see your faces. Nice to

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,160
see the Meet the Klan who is
interested in the things that

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,020
the presenters are interested
in. Short Introduction, I've

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,580
made my living as a university
professor in Ohio. I taught in

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,580
the Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at young sound

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,420
state. I taught in religious
studies, Eastern religion,

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,440
psychology of mysticism,
comparative spirituality,

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,540
Eastern thought. But what brings
me here today is not that work,

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,380
but it's my work with
psychedelics, which basically I

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,240
did for 20 years while I was an
academic, but I wasn't really

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,540
allowed to speak about those
things in the academic

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,440
environment, and it was only
after I retired that I was able

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,640
to write a book that I'd like to
speak from today. Now let me see

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,020
if I can get this working
correctly. This is a book that I

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,320
published at the end of last
year. It's a book I'd like to

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,920
speak from today. It tells the
story of where I went. Over 20

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,120
years of working with LSD, I
followed a protocol established

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,020
by Stan Grof, working in
psychedelic therapy, which is

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,920
totally isolated, isolated. The
conventional sort of therapeutic

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,340
environment, totally isolated.
Working with headphones and

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,840
eyeshades and music and all
those traditional trappings,

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,220
except that I worked with very
high doses. I did 73 sessions

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,060
over 20 years, working with
between 506 100 micrograms. I

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,180
don't recommend this protocol. I
wouldn't do it the same way if I

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,080
were starting over again, but
that's what I did, and this is

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,940
the story. When someone asks me,
what's it like taking that doses

27
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,360
of LSD that's high, I say it's
it's like being the middle of a

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,180
nuclear explosion. It just
completely shatters all the

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,500
dimensions of your mind and the
boundaries of consciousness. And

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,220
if you keep this up for long
periods of time, it reveals

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,740
levels of reality that lie
beyond time, space reality, it

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,340
is like this nuclear explosion,
which, as it pushes higher into

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,300
the atmosphere, it takes levels
of the atmosphere that are

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,280
invisible and makes them visible
when you work systematically

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,980
with psychedelics, whether it's
an indigenous context, or in

36
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,880
contemporary context, you
basically go through a process

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,260
that reveals levels of existence
that lie beyond your ordinary

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,360
sensory experience. Very
briefly, in the book, I tell the

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,420
story of the levels of
consciousness that I went

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,220
through in this process, going
through a series of death and

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,620
rebirth experiences, a series
that took place at first the

42
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,520
personal level of mind, where
one is dealing with personal

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,960
issues, eventually going through
ego death, and then at the

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,500
collective level of mind, where
you're engaging deep structures

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,380
within the collective psyche.
Third, the archetypal dimension

46
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,120
of mind, going beyond time
space, reality, entering into

47
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,520
being, dissolved into some of
the archetypal structures that

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,380
underlie physical existence.
Fourth, going into causal level

49
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,880
reality, causal oneness. And
finally, entering, for me,

50
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,200
entering into what I call the
diamond Luminosity, what

51
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,660
Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, or
the absolute, the clear light of

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,120
absolute reality. Making a
transition from one level to

53
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,540
another involves going through a
series of deaths and rebirth.

54
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,980
It's not simply ego death. It's
going through a death that takes

55
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,040
place at the collective level,
deaths that take place at the

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,660
archetypal level, and so on and
so forth, entering into deeper

57
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,900
intimacy with the universe. Now
that's all the slides I wanted

58
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,680
to share, let me see if I can
get out of that. Such a long

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,220
journey, so many years, so many
levels of consciousness, it's

60
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,820
impossible for me to summarize
them very succinctly. But for

61
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,380
today's presentation, I simply
wanted to focus on two aspects

62
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,480
of this story which I think are
relevant to this discussion of

63
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,120
the relationship between
consciousness and the

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,840
exploration of consciousness and
building the regenerative

65
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,400
society. The first issue has to
do with something that happened

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,020
in the collective level of mind,
and the second has to do with

67
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,320
what I call the birth of the
future human. After I had gone

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,200
through ego death. After I had
worked for a couple of years and

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,680
had gone through a number of
different ego death experiences,

70
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,020
I entered a domain that involved
large quantities of vast

71
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,680
territories of collective
suffering, a domain that I call

72
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,540
the. Ocean of suffering. It
eventually expanded over two

73
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,880
years to encompass hundreds of
1000s of beings, of persons and

74
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,620
1000s of years of time. And this
was confusing to me at first,

75
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,400
because I did this work, like
many people working with

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,300
psychedelics, thinking that I
was doing this work for my

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,940
personal benefit that I was
doing it to heal myself, to

78
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,660
enlighten myself, to accelerate
my own spiritual development,

79
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,340
but it was always kind of self
or self referencing. What I

80
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,240
found was that this ocean of
suffering went on for so long

81
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,120
and it was so challenging and
involved so many 1000s of people

82
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,260
that eventually it shattered the
very model that I had brought to

83
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,760
working with psychedelics, and I
abandoned what I would call the

84
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,360
individual model of
transformation, and I adopted a

85
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,320
collective model of
transformation. That is, I

86
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,000
believe that what I was doing
when I entered into the ocean of

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,940
suffering was actually being
used or facilitating a healing

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,780
that was not focused in my
personal life or my personal

89
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,920
soul even, but it was focused on
the collective psyche of

90
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,220
Humanity, that something was
using my sessions to drain

91
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,560
toxins that live in human psyche
that are the residue of

92
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,960
unresolved trauma from 1000s and
1000s of years of war and the

93
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,900
terrible things that we've done
to each Other through history.

94
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,920
Eventually, this work culminated
in an orgy of cleansing and

95
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,660
purification and healing, and I
was jettisoned from there on

96
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,460
into archetype of reality, and I
never returned into the ocean of

97
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,920
suffering. My point from this,
to keep it very short, my point

98
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,740
is everything we do when we are
working in deep states of

99
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,000
consciousness not only affects
our personal being, but it

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,200
affects the beings of those
around us. It affects those who

101
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,120
are immediately around us in our
system of social relationships.

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,500
Some of my work affected my
students, for example, without

103
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,940
them knowing what I was doing.
But it also reaches deeper than

104
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,040
that. It reaches deep into the
fiber of the collective psyche

105
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,880
of humanity. And I think when we
work in deep, Non-ordinary

106
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,300
states, we are if we choose to
do it, if we choose to allow

107
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,280
this to happen, or if it is our
karma for this to happen, we go

108
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,160
through processes. We do things
which allow us to facilitate a

109
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:58,420
direct healing, a direct
transformation of our species as

110
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,480
a whole, of our deep family,
there is no private self in the

111
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,660
world. We are part of a species.
Our species is part of the

112
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,020
ecosystem of Earth, and earth is
part of the galaxy and so on and

113
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,920
so forth. And when we do this
work conscientiously, we are

114
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,460
given opportunities to bring
about a transformation which I

115
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,500
think extends far beyond our
personal life and far beyond our

116
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:28,940
moment in time. Now, perhaps
because of this very strong

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,920
collective orientation my work,
something else began to happen.

118
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,060
Over the course of the 20 years
that I was doing this work, I

119
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,420
began to experience a series of
visions about the human

120
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,900
trajectory of evolution, about
where evolution was taking

121
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,500
humanity, where we were, what
was happening in the larger

122
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,520
scheme of things, I entered
repeatedly, a state of

123
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,720
consciousness that I would
describe as deep time. Deep time

124
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,820
is not eternity. It isn't
timelessness. It's a it's a

125
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,920
condition of time in which you
can experience hundreds of

126
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,360
years, or even 1000s and 10s of
1000s of years in a very

127
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,940
compressed time frame, sometimes
as a simultaneous now, I entered

128
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,980
into deep time, slowly,
personally, with my own personal

129
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,120
deep time, and then I entered
from there into collective deep

130
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,860
time in which I was given
teachings about where humanity

131
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,520
was in its evolution and what
was happening and where we were

132
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,080
going. There is a chapter in the
book called The Birth of the

133
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,020
future human, and the focus of
these visions was that humanity

134
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,380
was coming into a culmination
point.

135
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,780
They were coming we were coming
into a before and after point, a

136
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,980
turning point, a critical
transformation that involved the

137
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,280
entire human family. What? Is
emphasized was that the creative

138
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,000
intelligence of the universe was
not simply trying to awaken

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,880
individuals. It's almost as if
the age of individual

140
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,300
enlightenment was over, but the
creative intelligence was

141
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,760
actually trying to awaken the
entire human species, and that

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,520
we were poised on the cusp of a
profound transformation of the

143
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,940
human condition, a
transformation that would change

144
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,520
not only our economy and our
ecological values and our social

145
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,360
orientation. It would reach so
deep that it would actually

146
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,140
change the bedrock of the human
psyche. It would change the

147
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,800
fundamental archetypal blueprint
of the human psyche that that,

148
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,520
in my understanding, is that is
our hour of history. That is

149
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,420
what's happening. That is what
we are entering. The visions

150
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:59,200
that I had for this I did this
work between 1979 and 1999 so

151
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,560
when I when this was taking
place. This is 30 to 25 years

152
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,360
ago in which I was experiencing
these things. And in one

153
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,320
critical series of sessions, I
was taken deep into humanity's

154
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,360
future, and I experienced the
death and rebirth of humanity.

155
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,940
All mystics tell us, we learn
from the mystical traditions

156
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,720
that before Great Awakening,
there takes place a great death,

157
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,100
before the awakening of mystical
oneness, we experience the dark

158
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,260
night of the soul. Humanity as a
whole was entering the dark

159
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,860
night of the soul, of its soul,
which is a time of intense

160
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,960
purification, a content
confrontation with our

161
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,920
historical karma, with the
limitations that we have created

162
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,300
and lived with in history. And
in this series of sessions, I

163
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,200
went deep into the future, and I
experienced the complete

164
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,260
collapse of civilization as we
know. It, just a profound

165
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:07,080
implosion that seemed to be
driven by an ecological crisis,

166
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,400
but an ecological crisis that
was so deep that it triggered a

167
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,460
global systems disintegration at
our collective level and just at

168
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:23,120
the depth of this death process
when it looked like it was going

169
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,380
to be an extinction event, I
experienced that the worst of

170
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,180
the problem that was like a
storm passing over, a hurricane

171
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,920
passing over a Pacific Island.
The storm passed and the

172
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,140
survivors began to get up and
pick themselves up and began to

173
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,240
begin anew, and when they began
anew, they were different human

174
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,160
beings that a transformation
took place in the depth of this

175
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,260
death and rebirth process in
which we let go fundamental

176
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:02,460
beliefs and values and patterns
of our past and we engage the

177
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,200
future as different human beings
with an expanded heart, a

178
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,520
profound, innate sense of the
oneness of existence and our

179
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,280
oneness with other human beings,
a profound a deeper transparency

180
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,220
to the mind of the universe as A
whole. This truly was a before

181
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,760
and after point in time. It took
me literally years to recover

182
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,360
from the tremendous time
expansion and this encounter

183
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,040
with this, at the one hand,
awesome, and at the other hand,

184
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,300
very challenging and very
difficult confrontation with the

185
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,320
human story, or extension of the
human story, but this has been

186
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,560
the reality that I've lived with
ever since. It's been the

187
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,620
reality that I understand what
is taking place in history

188
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,940
today. It's been the reality
that basically is my background

189
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,360
to confronting the covid 19
crisis, the pandemic, which I

190
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,460
see, is simply just an overture
to a much series of punctuated

191
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,800
historical crises that lie ahead
for us in the 21st Century. And

192
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,680
I think there is a correlation
between what's happening in the

193
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,640
outer world and what's happening
in the inner world that as the

194
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,800
at the outer world, as we are
trying to become one planet, an

195
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,820
integrated planet with an
integrated citizen, Sri and a

196
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,100
healthy planet. That external
drive to oneness is being

197
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,240
mirrored in an internal drive to
oneness, which involves, I

198
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,160
think, an integration of the
soul into time, space, reality.

199
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,160
And by the soul, I mean the
consciousness that holds all the

200
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,200
experiences of all of our former
lives. I think basically our

201
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,920
consciousness of all of our
former lives is coming together

202
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,840
and fusing, and when they fuse,
it creates a higher form of

203
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,080
consciousness. Which really, I
think, is the new platform of

204
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,660
humanity in future time. Now I
think I probably close to the

205
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,500
end of my time. I know I've
thrown a lot of large ideas out

206
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,080
there, so I'll just stop there
and see where we take this.

207
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Daniel Pinchbeck: Christopher,
that was wonderful. Thank you so

208
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,100
much for sharing. I really love
your work, and I love your

209
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,500
vision, and it's kind of, yeah,
I mean, extraordinary to talk

210
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,340
with somebody who has explored
the sort of depth dimensions of

211
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,560
the LSD space, perhaps as much
as anybody alive right now. I'm

212
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,260
kind of curious. What's your
perspective on LSD. I mean, did

213
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,680
you have any perspective on what
it is in this, in this

214
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,840
exploration? Is it itself a you
know, is there an entities

215
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,220
attached to it? Is it a being?
Is it just a chemical catalyst?

216
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,680
Is it here accidentally? Is
there some kind of

217
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,780
intentionality to it?

218
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,320
Chris Bache: Well, given the
synchronicity of the birth of

219
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,980
the atomic bomb and the birth of
LSD in the same decade, I don't

220
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,460
think it's an accident that it's
here. I understand it to be an

221
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,660
amplifier and a catalyst of
consciousness, similar to S is

222
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,960
Psilocybin and Ayahuasca and DMT
and five Meo DMT, each of these

223
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,380
are fundamental catalysts of
consciousness. Each of them have

224
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,440
their own distinctive
characteristics. One of the

225
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,860
things I think, which is
different about LSD is it's

226
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,880
relatively new, and therefore
humanity doesn't have a lot of

227
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,920
history with it. I my sense is
that when we do Ayahuasca and

228
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,540
when we do Psilocybin, we don't
only experience the

229
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,980
physiological absorption of this
chemical into our biophysiology,

230
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,000
but we also engage the fields
which have been fields of

231
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,660
consciousness, which have been
created by all the beings who

232
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,560
have worked with this substance
through through time. So because

233
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,060
we've been using Psilocybin for
1000s of years, we've been using

234
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,800
Ayahuasca for 1000s of years.
They are very strong fields

235
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,220
associated with these substances
that we encounter when we use

236
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,920
these substances. LSD is a
relatively young substance, and

237
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,780
therefore I experience it being
unusually clean. In this

238
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,680
respect, I did not experience
much of a cultural overlay, much

239
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,280
of an historical overlay. It
seems to be particularly clean.

240
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,120
And I experience it as and
remember, I was working at high

241
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,540
levels, higher levels than I
recommend, 500 to 600

242
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,820
micrograms. It has a tendency to
drive to the high ceiling of the

243
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,980
high cosmological ceiling.
Psilocybin is much more body

244
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,860
grounded at the states of
consciousness that awakens are

245
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,020
much more, kind of closer to
where we live in our body. LSD

246
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,860
isn't necessarily so at lower
doses, yes, but in higher doses,

247
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,100
it tends to dry, drive high into
the cosmology.

248
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,600
Daniel Pinchbeck: I'm also kind
of curious. I bet you seem like

249
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,360
you have a bit of a Buddhist
orientation also. Am I correct

250
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,480
in

251
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,400
Chris Bache: that that's true?
Yeah,

252
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,640
Daniel Pinchbeck: you mentioned
reincarnation in past lives. I'm

253
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,200
kind of curious, if you have a
insight into what that means. I

254
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,740
mean, I got very excited by
amitha Swamis book. I think it

255
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,940
was called the self aware
universe. Amigos, a quantum

256
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,420
physicist who was, I believe,
working at Institute of Noetic

257
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,340
Sciences, and he began to look
at how quantum physics, action

258
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,240
at a distance, could kind of
provide a, you know, at least a

259
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,620
you know, starting point for
scientific hypothesis around how

260
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,100
there might be kind of an
aggregate, kind of a quantum

261
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,180
aggregate of, you know, feeling
willing, thinking, that somehow

262
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,260
continues, connected, you know,
after, after the physical death,

263
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,160
and kind of seeks to re
aggregate, to continue some

264
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
process towards maybe the
ultimate goal of, you know,

265
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,780
unification or realization or
enlightenment. I don't know if

266
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,460
you had any any thoughts in
those regards.

267
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,400
Chris Bache: Regards I do.
Reincarnation is a fundamental

268
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,420
part of my worldview. The first
book I wrote is a book on

269
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,680
reincarnation, life cycles, and
it discusses the empirical

270
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,280
evidence. As a philosopher, I
believe that the physical, the

271
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,280
evidence, the scientific
evidence for reincarnation now

272
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,240
is overwhelming. We have
extraordinary number of cases.

273
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,780
Ian Stevenson's work with young
children at the University of

274
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,220
Virginia basically established
the empirical database for

275
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,160
justifying a belief in
reincarnation. Now that doesn't

276
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,800
mean we understand the physics
of it. There's so much we still

277
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,300
don't understand about it, but a
fundamental principle that I

278
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,780
take away from Stevenson's work
and all the work done by past

279
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,580
life therapist in the cycle
psychotherapeutic community is

280
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,840
that nature retains its
learning. Nature holds on to its

281
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,920
learning. My understanding is
that reincarnation is the higher

282
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,960
octave of evolution. So an
evolution. Then we find that

283
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,280
nature folds forward the
learning of groups in

284
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,940
reincarnation, nature has found
a way of folding forward in

285
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,260
time, the learning of
individuals. Now, I think

286
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,320
eventually, lifetime after
lifetime after lifetime, we're

287
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,040
learning more, we're becoming
more. We're acquiring more

288
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,120
skills. We're activating more
potentials that are late within

289
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,100
our structure, sooner or later,
sooner or later, I believe all

290
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:33,920
of our reincarnational history
becomes integrated into a higher

291
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,100
order of intelligence. I've
experienced this in my sessions

292
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,840
where all of my former lives
came together and they came

293
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,380
together, and they fused. And
when they fuse, there was an

294
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,600
enormous explosion of energy of
diamond light broke out of my

295
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,080
chest, and it shot me into a
state of consciousness in which

296
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,980
I was an individual, but I was
an individual beyond any frame

297
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,720
of reference I had previously
known.

298
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,380
Daniel Pinchbeck: We had a
question from Deanna. She's

299
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,720
curious to know your thoughts
and experience and people

300
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,300
getting to these places of
insight, integration and deep

301
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,580
time without the use of mind
altering drugs or plant

302
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,300
medicines.

303
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,480
Chris Bache: Absolutely, I've
had many people write me since

304
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,500
this book has been published,
and they say I understand what

305
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,620
you're talking about. I've had
experiences similar to what

306
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,680
you're describing, but I've
never done psychedelics. I'm a

307
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,920
lifelong meditator. I've had
these experiences under Med,

308
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,780
with meditation, and I think
that's absolutely true. If LSD

309
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,480
is an amplifier of
consciousness, it is

310
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,920
consciousness that does the
work, and there are many ways of

311
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,640
intensifying and amplifying
consciousness. We know many of

312
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,960
the forms, LSD or psychedelics,
is simply another form, another

313
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,720
key to working with
consciousness, but it's

314
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,580
consciousness that does the
work.

315
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,140
Daniel Pinchbeck: Yeah, and what
kind of since you have these

316
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,820
insights into kind of the
future, although didn't exactly

317
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,300
seem like you had an exact time
frame, but I remember in dark

318
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,940
night, early dawn, you kind of
said it was going to be a very

319
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,300
compressed period when
civilization began to crack

320
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,600
apart, and these kind of
emergent new properties of the

321
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,140
new human, you know, kind of
began to integrate together. You

322
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,400
know what you know? Maybe that's
not, that's what I remember, but

323
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,520
you tell me if I'm wrong. But
then also I'm curious, like, you

324
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,700
know, how would you ground that
into, like, practical advice for

325
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,580
people in this time? Is there,
you know? Should you know? Is

326
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,420
doing these psychedelic,
entheogenic explorations a form

327
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,920
of a way to prepare oneself for
what's coming? You know? Is

328
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,720
there a way we can minimize the
destructive impacts of what's

329
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,660
coming, because it definitely
feels like there's a bit of a

330
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,660
destructive express train
heading our way right now.

331
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:53,859
Chris Bache: There is, it's kind
of a Kali destroyer. In order to

332
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:57,159
make room for the new I think
there are many things we can do.

333
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:01,259
I think basically collectively,
we're facing our collective

334
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:04,859
shadow, and that collective
shadow is a shadow that all of

335
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,459
us have personally had a hand in
creating, in the sense that we

336
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:11,579
have lived through history, and
therefore we have been part of

337
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,119
our history. And this kind of
confrontation with the

338
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,619
collective shadow is part of our
common work. Now, I think one of

339
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:23,179
the ways in which we can
consciously participate in this

340
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:26,539
process is first by
understanding what's taking

341
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:30,019
place. And you're right, I
wasn't given any specific

342
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:35,179
details of date. I wasn't given
any details of exactly how, when

343
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:39,319
and where this was going to take
place. I was given experiences

344
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:43,419
of this, of this meltdown, not
as an individual would

345
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:47,739
experience, but But literally
ask the human species as a whole

346
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:52,719
would experience it. And I think
the one of the key things we can

347
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:56,799
do is basically take responsible
for responsibility for our own

348
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,659
shadow, to do whatever
psychotherapeutic work,

349
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,979
psychedelic work, meditational
work, spiritual work, to

350
00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:11,459
basically help us confront the
the shadow dimensions of our own

351
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:16,679
being, in order to dissolve
those and let light in where

352
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,879
previously darkness had reigned.
But then at another level, we

353
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,779
can collectively participate and
help others in confronting the

354
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:30,139
shadow of our culture, the
shadow of history. That's the

355
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:33,679
kind of political action side,
the social action side.

356
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,080
Daniel Pinchbeck: Beautiful
Christopher, I love it. I think

357
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,920
that'll be great to have David,
Luke, come on and speak for a

358
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,760
bit, and then maybe have a
little bit of a dialog after So,

359
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,760
David, if you are there, do you
want to jump in?

360
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,620
David Luke: Yeah, sure. Hi. Can
you hear me? Okay, yep. Oh,

361
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,800
great, yeah. Good to be here.
Thanks for inviting me along.

362
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,920
Good see everybody. Thanks for
that. Chris, fantastic. Is that?

363
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
To hear you talk. So I'll just
give you a little bit of

364
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,100
background about me, and I'm
going to give you kind of pricey

365
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,220
of I've been doing for the last
few decades, or what the

366
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,840
insights I've kind of come to so
I'm a psychologist by training,

367
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,980
primarily parapsychologist,
Transpersonal psychologist, and

368
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,460
my kind of big umbrella area of
interest is kind of altered

369
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,760
states of consciousness and
anomalous or Transpersonal

370
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,320
experiences. So I've done a lot
of research on all kinds of old

371
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,140
states. I do a lot of research,
specifically with psychedelics.

372
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,680
I do a lot of research when I'm
not on psychedelics as well, but

373
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,180
it's not as much fun. And so I'm
going to give you a kind of a

374
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,840
bit of an overview of some of
the insights I've had that come

375
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,140
from the research, but also my
own particular journey as well.

376
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,540
So insights that are coming from
the research and what the

377
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,740
journey involves and what it
leads to, you could pretty much

378
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,360
sum up the kind of the where we
are currently with our kind of

379
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,740
intellectual quest, by
suggesting that psychedelics and

380
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,680
altered states in general,
because I think all old states

381
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,740
have a have a kind of continuity
with psychedelic experiences.

382
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,800
Just perhaps the volumes turned
up more with psychedelic

383
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,580
experiences is they increase
connectivity, and they increase

384
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,160
connectivity across the whole
kind of spectrum of experience,

385
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,460
from the biological through the
psychological, the sociological,

386
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,240
the ecological, and even into
the cosmological or spiritual

387
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,720
realms, perhaps so on a
biological level, we know from

388
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,960
research at Imperial College,
for instance, they increase

389
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,400
connectivity within different
brain regions, so areas of your

390
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,620
brain, which don't normally
communicate with each other,

391
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,080
suddenly become very
communicative. They have hyper

392
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,260
connectivity. And on a kind of
cognitive level, this explains

393
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,680
things like synaesthesia,
divergent thinking and increased

394
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,300
creativity, cognitive
flexibility and so on. On a

395
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,320
psychological level, they
connect us with ourselves, so

396
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,820
they give us access to our
unconscious material. Tap

397
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,000
straight into that your shadow,
as Chris said, your personal

398
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,720
history, your past traumas and
so on, and hopefully through a

399
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,020
kind of assistance, or through
being guided through that

400
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,140
journey, you can come to some
kind of resolution of your prior

401
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,880
traumas. I just found a
brilliant quote by GABA Matt a

402
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,900
about half an hour ago. He says,
Every human being has a true,

403
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,740
genuine, authentic self, and the
trauma is the disconnection from

404
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,120
it, and the healing is the
reconnection with it, and we

405
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,200
know that this results in a kind
of enhanced mood, well being and

406
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,340
enhanced mindfulness. From a
site, psychological, scientific

407
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,900
perspective on a sociological
level, psychedelics in old

408
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,480
states can help us connect,
increase our connection to each

409
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,720
other. They can increase our
openness to experience, our

410
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,600
willingness to engage with, you
know, culture and art and

411
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,660
different perspectives. They
increase our empathy. They

412
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,440
increase compassion. And this
can lead to increase in pro

413
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,960
social behavior and enhanced
value orientations. This is

414
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,660
where my own particular area of
research has been, kind of deep

415
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,080
diving more recently, is into
the ecological perspective on

416
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,720
that level, and that we find
that these states of

417
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,200
consciousness can increase our
connection to nature, which I

418
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,520
think is kind of pretty vital
right now. So we have an

419
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,060
increase in Eco consciousness or
biophilia, interspecies

420
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,660
communications or interspecies
connections also increase, and

421
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,620
this has a concomitant knock on
effect of increases in

422
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,400
ecologically orientated
behavior. So from a big survey I

423
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,380
conducted, we found that of the
people had taken psychedelics.

424
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,740
They said their psychedelic
experiences and the majority had

425
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,980
made them change their diet,
become more raw, more vegan,

426
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:53,740
more local, more vegetarian. It
also increased in the majority

427
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,500
of the sample, the amount of
gardening they do, which is a

428
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,020
massive take home news.
Headline, psychedelics increase

429
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,980
gardening. This is big news
everybody. And they can also

430
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,100
increase people's ecological
activism. And even people change

431
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,820
their career as a result of
their psychedelic experiences.

432
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,120
And then so we go beyond the
environment, the ecosystem and

433
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,400
the biosphere into the
cosmological levels as well. We

434
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,160
find that people have a greater
sense of connection to the

435
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,500
universe God, the other,
whatever it might be, and went

436
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,340
to the realms of Transpersonal
and mystical experiences, which

437
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,160
have the knock on effect of
helping people reduce their fear

438
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,520
of death, enhancing
spirituality, enhancing their

439
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,900
sense of purpose and meaning,
increasing self, Transcendence.

440
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,340
And we find in the clinical
research with psychedelics that

441
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,540
those people who have had a
mystical experience by the kind

442
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,300
of standard psychological
measures are the ones that have

443
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,020
the best clinical outcomes in
terms of dealing with

444
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,940
addictions, fighting depression,
anxiety or even end of life

445
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,880
fears. So. So all of that is
encapsulated within this kind of

446
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,760
notion of of course, we need the
appropriate set, setting and

447
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,480
substance and the preparation
and integration to book end it.

448
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,720
So there's some kind of insights
about where we are with the

449
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,380
research currently, insights
directly from the journey. I

450
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,500
think I'm going to give over a
few points here, one of which

451
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,320
is, I think the psychonaut and
scientist John Lily best

452
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,320
encapsulated this for me, and
that is that he had this famous

453
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,320
dictum, which is in the province
of the mind, what one believes

454
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,400
to be true is either true or
becomes true within certain

455
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,940
limits. These limits are to be
found experimentally, I through

456
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,220
science and experientially so
through personal endeavor, and

457
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,220
when these are found, they just
turn out to be more beliefs to

458
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,460
be transcended. In the problems
of the mind, there are no

459
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,960
limits. He did add a little
addendum to that, however, after

460
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,900
a few near death experiences,
pushing his physical body to the

461
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,080
limits, and he said, however, in
the promise of the body, there

462
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,640
are certain limits not to be
transcended, but in the problems

463
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,240
to the mind is limitless. So
this kind of gives off two other

464
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,360
kind of interesting points and
avenues. Is that what the first

465
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,840
one is that beliefs are our
reality. Our reality is only

466
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,080
constrained by our beliefs. But
there's a danger in that as

467
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,560
well, because they can our
beliefs can also be prisons. Our

468
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,180
convictions can make us
convicts, and we know that

469
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,280
because what kind of
psychological rabbit holes we

470
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,540
can fall down, such as
confirmation bias, whereby our

471
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,840
beliefs prescribe the kind of
things and information that

472
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,840
we're willing to accept or even
look for in the first place, and

473
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,680
we just end up bootstrapping our
own dogmas and belief systems.

474
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,840
And we see this kind of kind of
transposed into into science and

475
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,260
the endeavor of the research of
consciousness, where, you know,

476
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,920
the kind of the academy and the
scientific endeavor is pretty

477
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:57,280
much constrained by its a priori
dogmatic kind of reliance on

478
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,100
materialist reductionism, This
kind of neuro reductionist

479
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,320
perspective on physicalism, and
this view that the human

480
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,020
organism and consciousness
itself is merely just a

481
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,160
mechanistic process, and that
consciousness and life is kind

482
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,120
of devoid of any kind of real
sentience or or life, for that

483
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,720
matter. So and how that
translates is this, these kind

484
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,700
of limiting beliefs therefore
constrain the kind of questions

485
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,700
that scientists even ask in the
first place, so they only ask

486
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,880
questions which tend to support
these kind of prior dogmatic

487
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,360
belief systems about the
material nature of the universe.

488
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,300
And therefore, you know, fields
of research like Transpersonal

489
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,960
psychology and parapsychology
don't receive any funding, and

490
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,120
so we don't just kind of get a
big enough voice in the kind of

491
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,380
dominant paradigm and worldview.
So basically, make an argument

492
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,460
for agnosticism and plurality,
plurality that we should have,

493
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,160
you know, be, should be open to
many, many world views and

494
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,700
perspectives and and try not to
believe anything particularly,

495
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,640
you know, just to just beware,
be wary of beliefs in general,

496
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,420
and that's kind of quite useful
in this era of apparent fake

497
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:10,260
news, you know, post truth era.
And I think we've always been in

498
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,400
a post truth era since, you
know, the dawn of communication,

499
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,300
because we see in nature that
nature is constantly using

500
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,800
deception for its own particular
survival. So, you know, there's

501
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,220
never been such a thing as real
news, right, or true news. But I

502
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,280
think it's good to kind of take
an agnostic position and a

503
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,660
plurality and not get too hooked
on any particular belief system.

504
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,440
The other dictum, I think, that
comes out of John Lilly's famous

505
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,460
sentence, is that the mind is
infinite. Okay? So, I mean, we

506
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:47,500
can see that as apparent from,
you know, evidence from genius,

507
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,100
inspiration, creativity, along
with the findings of things like

508
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,000
parapsychology, which show that,
you know it by the empirical

509
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,720
evidence standards of today,
there is, I think there's very

510
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,820
we can talk to Dean Radin about
this. There's very little room

511
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,020
to consider that the evidence is
not substantial enough to pause

512
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,100
the idea that we can transcend
time and space and access any

513
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,000
point of time and space with our
mind. And I think Chris would

514
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,620
probably back that up with his
various LSD sessions. And I

515
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,940
think the research and theory
and physics is beginning to look

516
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,780
more like Parapsychology all the
time. There's an increasing

517
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,680
conceptual confluence of both
the fundamental quantities and

518
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,280
forces of physics with
consciousness. You know, time is

519
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,820
now considered to be somewhat
time. Subjective. Human

520
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,320
Experience of time is considered
to be illusory, and things like

521
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,620
pre cognition become more and
more possible all the time. And

522
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,920
then finally, my final point is,
then everything is connected.

523
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,519
That's one thing of
parapsychology and psychedelics

524
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,279
and Transpersonal psychology has
shown us that everything is

525
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:57,219
connected. We can transcend time
and space. We know that from the

526
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:00,959
evidence, from precognition to
empathy and. Clairvoyance,

527
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:04,619
synchronicities and so on,
although that is circumscribed

528
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,859
by point two, you know, that's
circumscribed by our beliefs and

529
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:11,759
the limitations of our beliefs.
And as a result of that, we

530
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:15,599
should act with openness
transparency in everything that

531
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,919
we do, with compassion and with
the spirit of reciprocity. And

532
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:23,179
so that we kind of start to move
away from all kinds of isms,

533
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:27,259
including the ones that aren't
given much air time these days,

534
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:30,079
you know, things like
ethnocentrism, but also species

535
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,319
centrism, stepping outside the
box of thinking we're at the top

536
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:37,579
of the of the food chain, and
even cognoscentricism. So that

537
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:40,959
is the view that, you know, only
one state of consciousness is

538
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:43,359
valued in our current society,
everything to be more

539
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:46,599
pluralistic and value everything
from dreams to meditation to

540
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:49,959
psychedelics and so on. And that
takes us back to the beginning,

541
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:53,019
is that these old states of
consciousness can help us move

542
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:56,439
towards increased connectivity.
So that's it,

543
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,380
Daniel Pinchbeck: David, that
was awesome. Thank you so much.

544
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,680
And, yeah, the work you're doing
is tremendous. Yeah, I guess I'm

545
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,980
curious a little bit about, you
know, what you wrote about in

546
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,280
the book about extraordinary
experiences, kind of like, you

547
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,000
know, the psychic and the
paranormal experiences that are

548
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,320
so common in psychedelic states,
and what that kind of reveals

549
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,120
about consciousness in your
perspective?

550
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,599
David Luke: Yeah, I think, I
think it poses an enormous

551
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:31,159
question mark against the idea
that you know brain, or that

552
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,799
consciousness is confined to the
brain, right? I mean, we already

553
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:37,699
have kind of 135 years of
evidence from Parapsychology

554
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:40,179
that you know, psychic abilities
and the Transcendence of time

555
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:43,299
and space. Have some really good
evidence to back it up. It's not

556
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:46,119
an everyday experience, but it
happens to enough people enough

557
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:49,239
times and under control
laboratory situations that we

558
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,539
can say, Okay, this is ability
to transcend time and space and

559
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:55,899
psychedelics pretty much just
turn up the volume on that. You

560
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:58,899
know, people have way more of
these psychic experiences,

561
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:02,879
paranormal like experiences,
Transpersonal experiences with

562
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:05,699
psychedelics. And I believe, you
know, a good proportion of those

563
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:08,819
are probably very genuine. Some
of them may be a bit delusional,

564
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:11,219
but some of them may be very
genuine. And I think the

565
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:14,159
evidence is moving towards that.
There hasn't been enough

566
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,839
research done on that, but we
have, you know, 1000s of years

567
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:22,219
of shamanic practice using
psychedelics and other states of

568
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:26,119
consciousness, which is for that
very purpose. And I think we

569
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,079
need to spend more time
listening and communicating with

570
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,099
indigenous peoples who have this
animistic, shamanistic world

571
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,159
view and what can be learned
from that. So I think we come to

572
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:40,219
this point where, you know, the
cork is out of the genus bottle.

573
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:46,899
Now the academy is once more
exploring psychedelics in a kind

574
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:51,819
of serious way. We can't deny
that the people are having a

575
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:54,339
large amount of these
Transpersonal and even

576
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:57,999
parapsychological, paranormal
like experiences, and we should

577
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:02,879
openly investigate them with an
open mind at face value, rather

578
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,799
than just trying to explain

579
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,480
Daniel Pinchbeck: them away. I
guess my understanding is that

580
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,140
psychic and paranormal effects
are extremely difficult to study

581
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,780
under normal, traditional
research methods. I've heard,

582
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,740
for instance, that even when an
effect seems to be demonstrated

583
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,540
at first with repeat
experiments, it seems that the

584
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,920
correlation goes down. It's
almost like the secret, you

585
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,320
know, there's a secret that
tries to protect itself or that

586
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,340
doesn't want to make itself
known to humanity at this point.

587
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,820
David Luke: Well, you can ask
Dean more about that. I think

588
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,780
there is a sense in which a lot
of the Parapsychology

589
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,660
experiments aren't immediately
repeatable, but when you stack

590
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,900
them together with meta
analyzes, you do find this kind

591
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,080
of highly significant data set.
When you take all the research

592
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,320
that's been done, you add it all
together, and these results are

593
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,680
kind of highly compelling. There
is a sense in which some of the

594
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,120
effects do reduce over time, but
they hit a plateau, you know. So

595
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,380
like the gansfield studies, have
remained a kind of 35% kind of

596
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,900
32% above chance, you know,
figure beyond this kind of

597
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,260
initial decline. So overall,
when you stack the data, the

598
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,780
effects are actually there, but
in a way, it's very hard to

599
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,420
learn much about them, largely
due to the complexity, I think,

600
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,360
of the factors involved. You
know, we're dealing with with

601
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,300
kind of turning a mirror on
consciousness itself, and it

602
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,940
becomes a very slippery
endeavor. It's like we the some

603
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,000
of the major problems are we
don't know where the psychic

604
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,080
abilities are coming from,
theoretically, because it could

605
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,500
always just be the experimenter
themselves are exerting their

606
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,680
psychic abilities, their
precognition, whatever it is, to

607
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,680
try and get the results they
need. And so all, I think we

608
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,380
need to take that very
seriously, because it applies to

609
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,740
the whole and scientific
endeavor. Like, for instance,

610
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:02,040
you know the Higgs boson, the
discovery. The CERN particle

611
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,520
accelerator, the way that
experiments set up, it's kind of

612
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,820
completely indistinguishable,
really in effect and size, from

613
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,520
the global consciousness
project, right? You have lots

614
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,400
and lots of people seemingly
coming together in a kind of

615
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,760
concerted, focused consciousness
trying to affect this kind of

616
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,940
random number generator. And in
global consciousness project,

617
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,360
and you get these hugely super
significant figures, right?

618
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,360
Whereas in the Higgs boson
experiments, you've got all

619
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,360
these physics coming together,
spending millions of pounds or

620
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,700
dollars, even, you know,
building this kind of massive

621
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,660
particle accelerator to try and
find something which they think

622
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,140
it exists, and all you get is a
probabilistic outcome, right,

623
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,560
that it exists and it's no more
significant than the global

624
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,640
consciousness project.

625
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:55,419
So I'm not sure where I was
gonna leave that point there.

626
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,540
Daniel Pinchbeck: What about you
know, you were talking about,

627
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,840
kind of the positive ecological
and psychological and

628
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,080
psychological effects of
psychedelics, then we have, you

629
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,480
know, I mean, it's almost
becomes, you know, certain ways

630
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,560
of discussing psychedelics have
now kind of, you know, forged

631
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,960
these kind of, like tracks in
the collective psyche, like, you

632
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,800
know, DMT, you know, like, if
you smoke at N DMT or have a

633
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,860
direct experience of it, the
experience is so incredibly

634
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,820
alien that, yeah, how do you how
do you know, what do you think

635
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,520
about that? Do you think there's
any evidence that suggests many

636
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,540
people talk about having a sense
of there being entities or, you

637
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,740
know, other dimensional
realities? I mean, is it just

638
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,920
the wiring of the brain being,
you know, totally reconnected,

639
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,160
or a switchboard shifted, or,
you know, is there any evidence

640
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,860
that there might be some, some
other, you know, sort of hyper

641
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,200
dimensional reality that we,
that we connect to in these

642
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,800
states?

643
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,280
David Luke: Well, I think the
question of DMT is, is super

644
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,740
interesting, and that one in
particular, because it's the one

645
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,280
most reliable at giving people
encounter experiences with with

646
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,140
some kind of sentient entity,
which they believe most of the

647
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,520
time to be some kind of real
encounter. There isn't been

648
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,460
enough research done on it, like
I say, for all the reasons

649
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,700
pointed out before that. You
know, the scientific endeavor

650
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,240
only looks to kind of bootstrap
its own belief systems by

651
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,660
researching things it can
explain with neuroscience,

652
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,840
right? So, you know, there
hasn't been much, oh, virtually

653
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,740
any research looking into the
nature of these DMT entities.

654
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,280
Most of the data is coming from
Psychonauts and and we see there

655
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,460
are certain commonalities, you
know, certain people tend to

656
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,060
encounter, you know, like the
elves for one, are quite common.

657
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,860
Or these kind of totally
dispassionate beings, which are

658
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:46,000
kind of doing some kind of neuro
anatomy experiments on people

659
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,240
and extracting their emotions.
That seems to be a pretty common

660
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:54,340
meme as well, but we can't ever
really separate out the cultural

661
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,420
influences, you know, in in kind
of examining this, this huge

662
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,560
data of phenomenology. But I
think there are commonalities,

663
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,800
and I think they need to be
explored, really, in a more kind

664
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,280
of concerted way. And what I
will say is, you know, some data

665
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,780
came out of Johns Hopkins this
year. Last year showed that of

666
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,460
people having entity encounter,
experiences with with DMT, of

667
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,780
those who were atheists prior to
their experience, less than half

668
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,900
of them were still atheist after
their experience. So they, you

669
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,080
know, that they're deeply,
profoundly world changing

670
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,680
experiences. We tend to lead
people to believe that there is

671
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,000
some kind of genuine other
there, and it's, you know, it's

672
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,840
going to be a tricky kind of
sticky wrestling match with

673
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,800
science to try and kind of bring
out any kind of empirical

674
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,300
validity on the ontology of
these beings, I think, but it's

675
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,020
worth the rest of

676
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,900
Daniel Pinchbeck: David, I know,
in the book on extraordinary

677
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,200
experience, you were also
talking about how you could

678
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,840
envision there being in the
future, some type of research

679
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,480
institute into into
consciousness itself. I mean,

680
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,880
that's something that really
fascinates me. And I think maybe

681
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,640
with everything that's
happening, and the sense of also

682
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,240
the ecological kind of doom
cloud up ahead, you know, maybe

683
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,720
it's time to accelerate that,
you know, and actually bring

684
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,660
that into manifestation. How
would you, how would you

685
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,180
construct such a thing? Do you
think it's possible that we

686
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,320
could, you know, have our kind
of Hogwarts, or, you know,

687
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,920
consciousness, you know, deep
diving, you know, what would

688
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,620
that consist of? What type of
research would you want to see

689
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:27,920
done?

690
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,560
David Luke: Yeah, I think I
totally can. Thanks for that

691
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,020
question, Daniel. And I think,
you know, we have to bring

692
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,680
together all the kind of
perspectives on it, you know, so

693
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,140
it can't just be a purely kind
science medical model led

694
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,240
endeavor, I think we need
psychiatrists and

695
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,000
psychotherapists and
psychopharmacologists for what

696
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,400
we can learn about, you know,
the brain and all that kind of

697
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,640
part of the jigsaw puzzle. But
we also need to bring people

698
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,520
from kind of wisdom traditions
in as well. So, you know, kind

699
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,940
of people from cultures like the
we Charlie, you know about 1000s

700
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,380
of years of shamanic practice
with we. Substances like Peyote

701
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,680
and and kind of really bring
these together in one kind of

702
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,920
melting pot, and also kind of
wisdom twisted relations, you

703
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,340
know, from from the East as
well. So I think that's what

704
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:15,420
they'd have to look like. And I
think moving forward, like, you

705
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,600
know, if Psilocybin and other
substances are going to get

706
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,300
licensed pretty much soon, for
for treatment, for depression

707
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,240
and so on and so forth. We're
going to need people who are

708
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,700
more savvy with the kind of
Transpersonal kind of

709
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,280
experiences that end of the
spectrum. Don't just mean

710
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,400
mystical experiences, but I mean
experiences of telepathy,

711
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,940
entity, encounters out of body,
experiences, all these kind of

712
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,780
things. People are going to have
to have some kind of better

713
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,660
understanding of these
experiences. And I don't think

714
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,220
we can leave that to
psychiatrists and

715
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,300
neuroscientists really, to kind
of just deal with, you know. And

716
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:54,040
I think people like shamans or
Tibetan Buddhist monks and

717
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,440
people like that need we all
need to sit around the table

718
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,660
together. So we need to kind of
a completely multi national,

719
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,080
multi disciplinary kind of
center where we can all share

720
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,340
ideas and exchange.

721
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,700
Daniel Pinchbeck: I was hoping,
I hoping he'll still pop up. But

722
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,460
one of the people I'd invited to
speak today, and who was on a

723
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,300
roster, Sergio Magana, who is a
nawadal Shaman, I don't know if

724
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,860
you know his work at all. He
works in the dream, you know,

725
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:27,620
kind of the dream, kind of
practices of the Aztecs. And he

726
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,380
wrote a book called The age of
the six son, where he kind of,

727
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,780
you know, cuz I written the book
on 2012 and then, you know,

728
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,480
people were like, Oh, the world
didn't end in 2012 and I was

729
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,300
like, Well, I never said it was
gonna end in 2012 you know. But

730
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,160
we're clearly in some type of
shift, you know, Sergio Magana

731
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,640
perspective, and obviously this
is not a scientifically

732
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,660
verifiable idea, is that we are
in a transition from the fifth

733
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,840
sun to the sixth Sun, which, in
the, you know, Mesoamerican

734
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,740
cosmology, is a shift from a son
of light to son of darkness. The

735
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,720
son of light, for them, is a
period of fascination with

736
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,280
material, technology,
rationality, science, logic. As

737
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,880
you move into the sun of
darkness, it becomes more of.

738
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,580
The psyche becomes more
predominant. The dream world

739
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,980
becomes more predominant.
Reality becomes more like a

740
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,260
waking dream. And I feel that I
find this a very fascinating

741
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,300
notion. I'm kind of curious how
it resonates with you. I also

742
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:28,880
kind of, in a way, correlate it
with the accelerating or, you

743
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,480
know, kind of popularity of
psychedelics, and a sense that

744
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,840
many more people are kind of
opening these doorways in

745
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,380
different ways right now, and
maybe that's somehow having a

746
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,220
kind of effect, you know, on the
collective psyche that's

747
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,480
happening in a way that you know
is unpredictable. I don't know

748
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,280
what your thoughts on that? I
just thought, and maybe

749
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,840
Christopher has some ideas on
that too.

750
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:56,319
David Luke: Yeah, I'll just jump
in. I would say, yeah. I mean,

751
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,419
for sure, this kind of revival
of psychedelic interest is going

752
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,579
to have an effect on the
collective consciousness,

753
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,759
certainly in the West, where it
seems to be happening first and

754
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:10,139
foremost. But, and I think, I
think it can only be a good

755
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:14,279
thing if we reconnect with this
kind of more dreamy, associative

756
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:17,339
kind of region of our brain, get
into the mythological and the

757
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:20,039
unconscious kind of side of
things, you know, as Ian

758
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:23,239
McGilchrist is has kind of very
neatly, kind of described in his

759
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:23,479
book

760
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,560
Daniel Pinchbeck: The Master
only in McGilchrist idea, for

761
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,880
those who don't know it.

762
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,980
David Luke: So you know the idea
of when it kind of takes a kind

763
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,920
of more poetic than literal
stance. But also, back to some

764
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,320
science on the nature of the
left brain and the right brain.

765
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,560
The left brain being the kind of
the literal, logical, linear,

766
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:44,140
linguistic kind of approach to
reality and experience, and the

767
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,080
right brain being more this kind
of dreamlike, associative,

768
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:52,960
mythological, you know,
endeavor, right? So, and that,

769
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,800
that we've confused the master
with the emissary, right? The

770
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,140
emissary is the left brain, the
bit that is all the

771
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,660
communicating, the mouth, you
know, the language, and we've

772
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,600
got to the point where the
emissary the left brain thinks

773
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,300
it's the master, you know, we
are kind of so heavily skewed

774
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,540
towards this kind of logical,
linear, linguistic mode of of

775
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,980
being in the developed world
that we've completely ignored

776
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,020
the dream Time, the imagination,
the associative thinking, the

777
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,560
mythological to our to our
peril, right? You know, it's

778
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,920
like, kind of our intelligence
has outstripped our wisdom in

779
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,680
many ways, and this is kind of
bringing us to this kind of

780
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,820
cataclysmic point, right, this
kind of moment of crisis. And so

781
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,480
we can it really help us, I
think, to flip that back over

782
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,860
and get these two things in
balance. And I think, yeah, I

783
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,380
think psychedelics have a big
role to play in that. And I

784
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,620
think also the internet and
things like that. The danger is

785
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,800
with the internet, though it's,
you can think of it as kind of

786
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,080
like the news sphere, and it's
kind of like a kind of

787
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,380
technological bootstrapping for
our own kind of clairvoyant

788
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,440
telepathic abilities, right? You
know, we can fake it till we

789
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,060
make it. With with kind of
telecommunications and the

790
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,460
internet, and then we've
probably come to realize that we

791
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,360
can do all that anyway,
hopefully. But meanwhile, we're

792
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,020
going to sifting through an
ocean of detritus, of

793
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:17,340
misinformation. I'll let Chris
jump in. Yeah.

794
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,240
Chris Bache: I think the analogy
that I use for this in Dark

795
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,540
Knight early dawn is the analogy
of the daytime sky and the

796
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:27,500
nighttime sky. We are like a
culture that basically head of

797
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,640
the rule that we have to be
behind closed doors by the time

798
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,760
the sun goes down, and we're not
allowed to get out until the sun

799
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,600
is up. So our entire known world
is from the nearby, close at

800
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,000
hand, brilliantly illuminated,
Sun soaked world, but think if

801
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,120
we were a culture like this,
we've missed the night sky. We

802
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,320
just don't see the far away, the
greater context, and so we don't

803
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,760
have we can't answer questions
of cosmology. We can't answer

804
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,060
questions of origin, because
this is the types of questions

805
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,160
that require the depth, which
are available only in the

806
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,640
deepest levels of consciousness,
where we can actually experience

807
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,140
the consciousness of the
universe, which we have come to,

808
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,920
which we are appreciating in the
physical world. But everything

809
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,580
which is physical has a
conscious dimension to it, and

810
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:21,080
so I think that this balancing
out seeing the nighttime sky of

811
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,580
consciousness really will have a
huge impact on a rebalancing of

812
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,780
our of our worldview.

813
00:51:30,139 --> 00:51:33,319
Daniel Pinchbeck: David, I'm
curious also, what kind of, from

814
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:36,619
your research, you know, what
would you offer people in terms

815
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:40,959
of, you know, kind of practical
advice? I mean, do you think

816
00:51:40,959 --> 00:51:45,279
it's kind of the right time for
people to explore these

817
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,799
alternative dimensions of
consciousness through

818
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:52,479
entheogens? Do you think there
are dangers in them? I guess

819
00:51:52,479 --> 00:51:54,999
another, another question for
you, which could be part of the

820
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:59,499
same question, is there a Do you
Do you also recognize a dark

821
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:04,859
side for both of you actually in
psychedelic exploration, you

822
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,739
know? Yeah, so, so curious to
hear what you

823
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,260
David Luke: say, I'd say, you
know, I think it's down to the

824
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,840
individual to determine whether
it's right for them. I don't

825
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,660
necessarily think psychedelics
offer a map for everybody. I

826
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,440
think they can help a lot of
people in lots of different ways

827
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,780
and but they're not necessarily
suited to everybody. And, you

828
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,900
know, I could talk more about
that, but I think there are many

829
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,900
ways to get there. They can be a
kind of good door opener, you

830
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,360
know, they kind of just smash
the door right off its hinges

831
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,720
and show you the other side. Or
you could just kind of open it a

832
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,600
bit more gingerly, perhaps by
getting into your dreams, or

833
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,880
lucid dreaming, meditation,
yoga, practice, whatever it

834
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,280
might be. So there are the other
techniques to get you there as

835
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,100
well, which may be a bit more
controlled. But you know, in

836
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:52,780
this fast paced 21st Century
existence, a lot of people have

837
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,300
got themselves into a very
sticky rut for all kinds of

838
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,320
reasons, urbanization, 21st
Century, living, etc. I think

839
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:05,940
they can be a good Fast Track
door opener for many people. But

840
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,640
is there a dark side? I think
potentially, that there can be,

841
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,100
not just in how these things are
distributed or experienced, but

842
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,980
in terms of the experience. I
think that's where you're going

843
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,540
to, Daniel, in terms of the
experiences that people have, or

844
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,020
more about the kind of community
around the use of psychedelics,

845
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,200
are the

846
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,600
Daniel Pinchbeck: experiences
that people have, and even if

847
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,580
you know, they can have
negative, negative, positive

848
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,100
effects on people's character,
but are there cases where they

849
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,560
start to have a very negative
effect also, yeah.

850
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,200
David Luke: I mean, I certainly
can do and it's not all light.

851
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,480
And I think, you know, I think
you maybe have to look at it as

852
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,860
more of a process. I mean,
certainly from the clinical work

853
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,620
that's been done. You know, very
few people, a lot of people, may

854
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:47,440
have challenging experiences,
which, you know, they're very

855
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,900
difficult for them, but they
usually pass through them, and

856
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,540
those are the ones that
typically give, like, a lot of

857
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,420
insight, and that people feel
they grow more from, even though

858
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,200
it wasn't particularly pleasant.
And a very few people have, you

859
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,680
know, kind of somewhat in the
Division of traumatic

860
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,280
experiences and and regret doing
doing in the first place. So

861
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,060
maybe either there shouldn't be
taking psychedelics, or

862
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,580
psychedelics are not necessary
for them, or they started a

863
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,000
process which, which kind of a
process which, which threw up

864
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,860
too much stuff for them to be
able to immediately deal with. I

865
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,000
haven't really got a clear
answer for that, but you know

866
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,720
that there can be heavy, dark
experiences besides when you go

867
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,480
into the shadow, when you turn
up the volume on the mirror,

868
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,780
you're not necessarily always
going to like what you see in

869
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:38,240
there. So yeah, and also the
problems of spiritual bypass and

870
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,260
potential narcissism and things
like that which, which kind of

871
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,080
may arise as part of the
journey, but this is a part of

872
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,960
any kind of like journey of
personal or spiritual

873
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,720
development, and not just with
psychedelics, I would say, I'll

874
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,340
hand over to Chris.

875
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,040
Chris Bache: I completely agree
with you. That's David. That's

876
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,020
there are dark experiences that
serve. In these states, and

877
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,600
therefore you have to be well
prepared. You have to fasten

878
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,720
your seat belt, you have to
choose a very careful location

879
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,800
work with all all the safety
precautions. My experience has

880
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,540
been that all these dark
experiences are some form of

881
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,240
purification and clarification.
And in my experiences, I found

882
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,480
that the deepest breakthroughs
into ecstatic knowledge,

883
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:28,220
ecstatic knowing and visionary
knowing, came after the deepest

884
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:33,080
purification, dark experiences,
so that in my work, I actually

885
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,880
created the conditions that
would facilitate the deepest and

886
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,760
darkest encounters, not because
I was fond of suffering, but

887
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,820
because I was fond of what took
place on the other side, would

888
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,720
lay on the other side of that
suffering. But to do that, it's

889
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,720
really important to take
psychedelics in a very, very

890
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,560
carefully structured setting,
not in a recreational setting,

891
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,720
not casually, with a lot of
forethought and lot of

892
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,680
discipline preparation, not only
going into the session, but

893
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,160
coming out of the session, for
the integration process, for the

894
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,180
retention process, for the
encoding and eventually the

895
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:16,020
debrief after your session is
over, and a good, thorough

896
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:20,660
debrief is actually a very good
way to prevent problems that

897
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:25,160
emerge in your subsequent
sessions. So it's very

898
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,700
important,

899
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,960
Daniel Pinchbeck: I guess,
Christopher, or actually, for

900
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,120
both of you. Question for you
is, you know, what are, what are

901
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,780
things people can do to prepare
what's the best way to prepare

902
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,960
yourself for psychedelic
experience? I mean, how do you

903
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,920
approach these, these sessions?
For yourself.

904
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:45,759
Chris Bache: Well, in the
southwestern in the Hopi

905
00:56:45,759 --> 00:56:48,279
Indians, they have a Kiva,
right? It's a hole in the ground

906
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,339
with a circle in the top, and
you climb down with a ladder,

907
00:56:51,459 --> 00:56:53,799
and then they pull up the
ladder, and you're completely

908
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:56,979
isolated environment for the
duration of the entire

909
00:56:56,979 --> 00:57:01,199
experience. And I always think
of my work with psychedelics.

910
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:04,979
I'm in a Kiva. I'm in a place
that's completely isolated,

911
00:57:04,979 --> 00:57:07,499
protected. I'm with someone
who's going to take care of my

912
00:57:07,499 --> 00:57:11,999
body. I'm not in a talking
relationship. I'm in an highly

913
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:16,619
internal, engaged relationship.
I want to have clean contact, so

914
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:21,499
I want to eliminate all outside
influences. Now it's wonderful

915
00:57:21,499 --> 00:57:24,799
sometimes to take psychedelics
and go into nature, and that's a

916
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:29,359
wonderful experience. But when
you're going deep into this, in

917
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:33,019
facing the personal and
collective and historical shadow

918
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,479
that work is best done, I think
in isolation, I do a lot of

919
00:57:38,479 --> 00:57:42,639
spiritual practice before and
after a session, I take care of

920
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:47,319
my body. I make sure my body is
well tuned and relaxed and

921
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:50,559
aligned before going into a
session. Because when you're

922
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,219
running in psychedelics, a very
high dose psychedelics, your

923
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:58,119
body is processing enormous
quantities of energy. It's very,

924
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:01,139
very demanding on your subtle
energy system. And if you

925
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:04,499
haven't been taking care of your
subtle energy system well before

926
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:07,739
your session, you're going to
have more complications arising.

927
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:11,459
So a lot of care for my body, a
lot of care for my subtle energy

928
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:15,539
system, a lot of spiritual
practice beforehand, and then a

929
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:19,439
very careful and sustained
debrief after, afterwards.

930
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:24,319
That's my approach. And David,
yeah.

931
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,620
David Luke: I mean, I guess it
depends on the your level of

932
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,980
experience, the context, what
you hope to get from the

933
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:35,960
experience. So, but always, you
know, if you're inexperienced,

934
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,200
do your homework. Make sure you
know what it is you're taking

935
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,940
all the kind of basics, you
know, dosage, substance, purity,

936
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,400
Where'd it come from? Do you
trust the source? Set and

937
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,000
setting. You know where you are,
psychologically, physically with

938
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,360
it, preparation and then
integration afterwards, as Chris

939
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,080
pointed out, but it needn't
necessarily always be a 600 my

940
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,300
deep dive increases process,
which is brilliant, but you

941
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,600
know, it could be, for instance,
we've experimented with 100 mile

942
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:08,580
low doses with top level
scientists for creative insight,

943
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,940
creative problem solving, on
technical problems, and that,

944
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,580
you know, they seem to be, which
is a completely different agenda

945
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,880
to a kind of completely deep
philosophical, spiritual

946
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,720
journey. And that kind of
produced really good results. So

947
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,720
it all really depends on the
context of use, but, but you

948
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,600
make sure you pay attention to
the context your intentions,

949
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,020
set, setting and substance
preparation and integration.

950
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:33,679
Daniel Pinchbeck: David, I know
that England, and particularly

951
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:36,499
the Imperial College, is now
kind of the center, in a sense,

952
00:59:36,499 --> 00:59:40,399
of the sort of cutting edge of
psychedelic kind of research. I

953
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:44,199
wonder if you could tell people
kind of what's going on there

954
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:48,879
now, what's what's active, and
what types of discoveries are

955
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:49,419
being made.

956
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,260
David Luke: So I'm kind of
loosely affiliated to Imperial

957
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,020
College, the psychic research
center there. There haven't been

958
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,020
too much going on recently
because of lockdown. I think

959
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,340
they're beginning to is. Zoom,
kind of recruitment of

960
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,700
participants for various
studies, but some of it is

961
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,040
clinical. So they've been
looking at kind of Psilocybin

962
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,120
for depression as part of a kind
of a kind of global endeavor to

963
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:15,540
help get Psilocybin kind of
licensed as medicament for

964
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,180
treating depression. But also,
most of their focus is on the

965
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,560
kind of neuro scientific, the
neuro psychopharmacological

966
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,860
research. So how do these
substances work in the brain?

967
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,040
And more importantly, what does
it tell us about the nature of

968
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,940
consciousness, from what we can
discover about how these

969
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,020
substances work in the brain? So
some of the projects have been,

970
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:40,460
you know, the loss of neuro
imaging of MDMA, Psilocybin, LSD

971
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,400
and Dimethyltryptamine. I'm
working collaborating on the DMT

972
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,480
study. We're looking to do kind
of slow infusion, so taking

973
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,440
people into kind of high dose
breakthrough experiences over

974
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,220
extended periods of time, and
both exploring the neuroscience

975
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,080
connected to that, but also the
kind of the experience as well.

976
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:04,680
So what comes out of those
experiences? And one of the

977
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,920
things as a parapsychologist,
I'm looking to do with them

978
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,600
there is explore kind of shared
visionary experiences. For

979
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,800
instance, can we get two people
on DMT at the same time in a

980
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,560
kind of prolonged state, in kind
of side by side, by side, but

981
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,080
separated in different kind of
rooms, you know, so doing it at

982
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,140
the same time, and kind of look
at their brain activity, see if

983
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:30,140
there's any kind of correlation
which we wouldn't expect from if

984
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,360
they did it at different times,
but also in the kind of

985
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,600
experiences that people have, is
there some corollary of the

986
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,780
experience of two people may
have at the same time When, with

987
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,780
the intention of having a shared
journey. I mean, that takes us

988
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,440
into kind of some pretty far out
Transpersonal realms. But, uh,

989
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,800
yeah, that's just to kind of tip
the iceberg of the stuff that's

990
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,980
going on there. They're doing a
lot of really great research and

991
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,100
survey work too, and working
with retreat centers and all

992
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:57,640
sorts,

993
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,520
Daniel Pinchbeck: um, I'm
tempted to ask both of you just

994
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,920
It may sound like a funny
question, but it's always on

995
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,800
one's mind from your different
personal psychedelic

996
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,760
explorations, how do you what?
What's your philosophy on what

997
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,640
like the purpose of life is, and
the purpose of argument

998
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,240
experience?

999
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,660
David Luke: Nice, small
question, Chris, you want to go

1000
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:18,900
first?

1001
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:26,600
Chris Bache: Goodness? That's
that is a large one. Hey,

1002
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,040
listen, the universe has been
unfolding for 13.7 or so billion

1003
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,400
years. We don't see any evidence
that it's going to be stopping

1004
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,260
for another 13 point 7 billion
years. So I think all of our

1005
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:42,580
attempts to say what the purpose
of life is will always be

1006
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,600
inadequate, given the enormity
of the actual project of life.

1007
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,500
What we can see, what we can
project, what we can extrapolate

1008
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,700
about the purpose may carry us a
certain distance, but it won't

1009
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:59,680
take us through the entire
process. So to me, Central is

1010
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:06,480
learning, loving, deeply
experiencing, opening, learning

1011
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,700
and exploring and developing,
expanding our capacities.

1012
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:18,480
Exploring, to me, exploring is
really important, the purpose,

1013
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,660
one time within a deep encounter
with this creative intelligence,

1014
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,620
this nameless, faceless
intelligence that I was engaging

1015
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,700
and the topic of what the
purpose of existence is, what is

1016
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,420
it all? And I was popping in and
out between non being or the

1017
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:40,160
pure void and suddenly being.
And by popping back and forth

1018
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:45,700
between being the universe and
non being the primal void out of

1019
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:49,060
which the universe sprang. It
really generated a question,

1020
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:52,000
what is the purpose of being?
What is the purpose of

1021
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,260
existence? And this
consciousness said to me, have

1022
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:00,720
we not learned anything? And it
just shattered me. I just broke

1023
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,780
down and wept because and it
just seemed like it was all

1024
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,780
about learning. I don't think
there's an idea often that this

1025
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,320
consciousness is trying to learn
something about itself. I don't

1026
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,560
think so so much that that
doesn't persuade me, but that

1027
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,620
learning is central to the
entire project seems to be

1028
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,300
really important.

1029
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,860
Daniel Pinchbeck: Okay, David,
what you got for us?

1030
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:26,660
David Luke: Not that much. I
mean, I guess the thing is, we

1031
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,660
are, we are on a quest for
meaning, right? You know, what

1032
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,760
is the meaning of the nature of
the universe is like? Well,

1033
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:34,880
that's a human endeavor to
establish meaning. You know, I'm

1034
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,660
not sure all species necessarily
try and try and find the

1035
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,460
meaning, right? But we are kind
of lost in a way as well. You

1036
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:47,440
know, where we are like? I think
our loss of meaning in a kind of

1037
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,440
materialist, reductionist
universes has kind of led us

1038
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,440
into all kinds of difficult
places. So I think the quest for

1039
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,600
meaning in itself is worthwhile
endeavor, but ultimately it may

1040
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,860
be not say meaning. This, but
pointless, because it might be

1041
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:05,640
just about the being, as Chris
said, that is kind of really the

1042
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,600
important thing.

1043
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:15,359
But I'm a bit confused. What do
you think Angel?

1044
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,620
Daniel Pinchbeck: That's good
question. I mean, I think, yeah,

1045
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,720
learning, creativity,
expression, play. I don't think

1046
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,060
there's a necessity to it. And I
do think, you know, meaning

1047
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:34,280
itself is a human, created term,
you know, dreaming,

1048
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:39,380
experiencing, creating,
discovering, loving, you know,

1049
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:45,160
maybe multiple purposes. We had
a few questions about the value

1050
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,540
of micro dosing, and I was
curious if you had a perspective

1051
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,960
on do you see that as a really
helpful tool for people at this

1052
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,500
point in time?

1053
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,579
David Luke: I guess that might
be for me, because Chris seems

1054
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:03,239
to be bit more in the macro
dosing can either end of the

1055
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:07,559
spectrum. I think micro dosing
may have potential. I don't

1056
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:10,619
think we have enough data yet. I
mean, certainly there's a lot of

1057
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:15,959
kind of uncontrolled data, you
know, like kind of from non

1058
01:06:15,959 --> 01:06:18,659
placebo, randomized, controlled
studies from the scientific

1059
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:21,499
perspective, saying that people
feel like it's really beneficial

1060
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:25,759
for all kinds of things, for
depression, inside creativity,

1061
01:06:26,479 --> 01:06:30,439
all of that kind of stuff.
There's very little research to

1062
01:06:30,439 --> 01:06:34,399
say those experiences or that
kind of outcome may be genuine.

1063
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:37,399
We don't know, right? It could
be one massive placebo effect.

1064
01:06:37,399 --> 01:06:40,419
But hey, if people think it's
beneficial, then then that's

1065
01:06:40,419 --> 01:06:44,199
might be good enough. I mean,
again, most of my research, I

1066
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:48,399
focus more on low to high macro
dosing, right? So I think

1067
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:53,919
there's potentially a room for
micro dosing. There's some

1068
01:06:53,919 --> 01:06:57,459
potentially dangers in it, and I
think, and that is, it's just

1069
01:06:57,459 --> 01:07:01,139
the kind of CO opting of
psychedelics as just kind of

1070
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:04,799
mere psycho vitamins when they
can do so much more, right?

1071
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:10,379
Fortunately, what I can gather
from the research is a lot most

1072
01:07:10,379 --> 01:07:14,219
people who microdose invariably
end up accidentally macro dosing

1073
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:18,179
at some point, and you should
get a surprise, and that might

1074
01:07:18,179 --> 01:07:18,779
be beneficial.

1075
01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:23,179
Chris Bache: Yeah, I'll leave
that one in your hands, David,

1076
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:25,939
because I personally don't have
a lot of experience with micro

1077
01:07:25,939 --> 01:07:31,639
dosing, because when I have
tried micro dosing with LSD, it

1078
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:34,879
was after years and years of
working at these very high dose

1079
01:07:34,879 --> 01:07:41,019
levels. But basically I found
now that I really don't like LSD

1080
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:45,759
in my body. It's like I drove it
so hard with these massive doses

1081
01:07:45,759 --> 01:07:49,419
for so many years that my body
developed kind of an allergy to

1082
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:53,439
it, and so it's just not good
for me to use now, and I haven't

1083
01:07:53,439 --> 01:07:57,099
used it for years, so I don't
have much experience on micro

1084
01:07:57,099 --> 01:08:00,119
dosing. I read the literature,
and like you, there's a lot of

1085
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:04,259
anecdotal, positive literature,
but there isn't as much

1086
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:08,459
scientific, good, solid
literature on micro dosing. I'm

1087
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:12,239
sure it's coming along. And like
you, I also think of that.

1088
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:17,219
That's a good phrase. What was
it? Psychedelic, sort of psycho

1089
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:21,859
micro pill, a vitamin pill. It
can do so much more.

1090
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:27,260
Daniel Pinchbeck: Yeah, later on
in this session, we're going to

1091
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:30,440
have a presentation for my
friend Andrew Camargo, who's

1092
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,860
been working very heavily with
Santo Daime and the Ayahuasca

1093
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:37,340
tradition for many, many years.
But I thought first, actually,

1094
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:43,540
if he, if he's up for it, has he
disappeared on me. I was going

1095
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:48,040
to see if Jeremy Johnson wanted
to give us a little bit of

1096
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:53,800
insight into the integral model.
But he may have flown the coop

1097
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:57,580
for a second. Daniel, there you
are. Jeremy. Okay, great. You

1098
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,240
want to jump in and give us a 10
Minute kind of overview of

1099
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,460
Gensler integral consciousness
model,

1100
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:11,340
Unknown: sure, sure. Yes, yeah.
Thank you, Daniel. And just been

1101
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:15,480
really enjoying today's
presentations already. So some

1102
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,540
of you may already be familiar
with integral theory. I know

1103
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:21,440
Rory has mentioned spiral
dynamics a number of times in

1104
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:26,300
the context of like extinction,
rebellion and so on. But I think

1105
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,660
when we're talking about the
history of consciousness, I

1106
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:34,460
think a lot of this stuff can be
very abstract and very detached,

1107
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,780
and we look at our own history,
our own living history, from the

1108
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:45,580
distance of books, right? So
when it comes to Gene gebsters

1109
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,580
work, he's sort of these
foundational thinkers of

1110
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:52,240
integral theory and Ken Wilber,
but GEP sir is very, very

1111
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,340
different from Wilber in the
sense that he's not a

1112
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:59,440
developmentalist per se. And if
anyone has engaged with his his

1113
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:02,400
writing. Writing on the topic,
his writing is deeply

1114
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:07,380
phenomenological in that it's
always encouraging us to explore

1115
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:11,760
and inquire our own experience
of consciousness. We've been

1116
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,880
talking about the left and the
right brain with McGilchrist and

1117
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:20,280
in many ways, GEP SIRs work is a
kind of if you want to jump in

1118
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,200
and begin to explore the left
and the right brain in your own

1119
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,800
phenomenology, then he's sort of
a good guidebook towards that.

1120
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,500
Now, little bit of background
with me. I'm an integral scholar

1121
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,840
and researcher. I've been
working with the gene gebster

1122
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:39,140
Society for the past 10 years or
so, planning to get my PhD work.

1123
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:43,480
Hopefully things go well at CIS
as well. So it's good to see

1124
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:48,460
Christopher here and the PCC
program. So yeah, gepzer

1125
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:53,080
presents us with a phenomenology
of consciousness, very carefully

1126
01:10:53,080 --> 01:11:00,280
looking at basically a kind of
an archeology of meaning making,

1127
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,280
looking at particular works of
art, forms of literature, the

1128
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:09,180
evolution of language and
etymology, the meaning of

1129
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:12,780
certain words, and how, even in
our language, right, even in our

1130
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:20,420
language has a kind of, how to
put it, a processual movement

1131
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:24,740
from what we're talking about,
sort of night time or side real

1132
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:28,520
dimensions of consciousness into
the waking and he very carefully

1133
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,660
constructs a kind of descriptive
process in which human

1134
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:36,920
consciousness has moved from
these side, real nighttime Magic

1135
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:43,180
and mythical forms or structures
into waking apolonic, discerning

1136
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:48,640
ratio oriented, as he says, um,
sort of the secular age, so to

1137
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,000
speak. But there are gains and
losses in this, right. And I

1138
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,200
think having a more nuanced and
non linear approach to this that

1139
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,620
is also encouraging it,
encouraging us to explore these

1140
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:02,820
modes of consciousness in
ourselves can really help us

1141
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,600
make these things concrete
rather than abstract, and really

1142
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,800
kind of come and become to live
the magic and the mythic again,

1143
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,860
rather than to merely
acknowledge them right to live

1144
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:19,440
in some capacity or have some
contact with these earlier modes

1145
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,240
of consciousness. So for gepse,
the challenge in our time is not

1146
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:30,080
so much to move to a next level
as to presentiate and to open up

1147
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:34,700
the wealth and the history of
our consciousness, different

1148
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:38,840
modes of time, cyclical forms of
time and participatory

1149
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,880
cosmologies, bringing into
contact that with the more

1150
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,940
rational and scientific and
secular modes of thinking. And

1151
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:50,020
for gepse, the requirement for
that isn't just to bring those

1152
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:55,480
modes of consciousness back, but
to sort of facilitate and enable

1153
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:00,400
an equanimous and open enough
what he calls it is the

1154
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,560
principle of diaphin 80, a clear
enough consciousness to allow

1155
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,960
those different modes and
structures to presentiate

1156
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:14,520
themselves in us and as a kind
of a too long didn't read micro

1157
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,400
dose of geppser, the idea for
integral consciousness is an

1158
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:22,040
intensification of clarity and
the capacity to bring forth

1159
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,400
different modes of being in the
world and being in time,

1160
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,960
including linear time,
timelessness, rhythmic time,

1161
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,280
right? Cyclical cosmology, etc,
bringing all of those things

1162
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,580
forward in the human being, to
bring them forward at will, as

1163
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:41,860
if we were a kind of mercurial
being that was both a living

1164
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:45,460
past and also, interestingly
enough, his theory of time.

1165
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:49,360
We've been talking a little bit
about temporics and transcending

1166
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:53,020
time and space. His theory of
integral consciousness, to me,

1167
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:56,800
is very futuristic in a certain
way, because it's talking about

1168
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,840
a way of being in the present,
in which the poetics of the

1169
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:08,400
present is able to be both in
the deep past and in the future.

1170
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,280
The future is latent in the
present as a tangible

1171
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,760
experience, and there's a
poetics of presence that we can

1172
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,120
engage in that allows that to
kind of come forward. Yeah,

1173
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,140
somebody's mentioning Ancient
Future. This is what I'm writing

1174
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,540
about in my next book called
fragments of an integral

1175
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:28,340
futurism. Very much this idea
that a lot of the future looks a

1176
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:32,960
lot like the past. And in some
ways a poetic statement of this,

1177
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,020
because this is too short of a
presentation to really get into

1178
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,200
the theoretical details. But a
poetic statement of this would

1179
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:43,540
be when we do and ancestor work
right when we are able to listen

1180
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:47,200
to the dead within us. This is
not an abstract thing. When we

1181
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,200
are at our altars and we are
working with our ancestors, they

1182
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:57,460
are present. GEP sir, was very
sensitive to that, and I think

1183
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:00,660
his phenomenology of this
integral future is. The capacity

1184
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:06,300
to listen to the unborn as well,
somehow that the the long dead

1185
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:10,920
and the not yet born are present
in us, and not as just a

1186
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:16,140
conceptual statement, but as a
living communion. Right? How can

1187
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:19,920
we live like this in the present
and also, how can we embrace a

1188
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,880
sense of the present, in which
past, present and future

1189
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:27,080
intermingle with one another.
And by doing so, obviously, you

1190
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:31,940
know, I think that would be a
wonderful tool to to, or mode of

1191
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:35,840
being, an ontology to have right
now, right where the past,

1192
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,600
present and future are
collapsing into one another,

1193
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,820
right, just in terms of climate
change and the modes of thinking

1194
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:46,480
that ecological thought require
of us. It's an intensification

1195
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,600
of temporics. And I could get
into all this other stuff, but I

1196
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,240
think that's Daniel. I think I
summed it up,

1197
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,580
Daniel Pinchbeck: and we have
Jyoti is coming on in a minute.

1198
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,540
She's only has a bit of time
today. But I did want to quickly

1199
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:03,300
talk about the structures of
consciousness that Jepson

1200
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,540
mentions, which I also talked
about in my book 2012 the return

1201
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,480
of Quetzalcoatl. He has this
idea that there are these, I

1202
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,200
guess. He identifies four
structures of consciousness, and

1203
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,680
he talks about how each one
reaches a crisis in which the

1204
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,080
only way forward is to go
through a kind of mutation or

1205
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,900
transmutation, break into a new
structure of consciousness about

1206
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:29,000
the the Aboriginal, the archaic,
the tribal, or in the mental

1207
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
rational. And he kind of would
say that we are at the at the

1208
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:35,660
end of this mental rational
structure with a particular way

1209
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:38,600
of conceiving time and space,
and that we've reached a point

1210
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,640
where the only way forward
requires a kind of mutational

1211
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,400
break into a new form of
consciousness. Maybe you want

1212
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,180
to, you know, kind of just, just
delve into that for a few

1213
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,920
minutes, if you can sure, sure.

1214
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:56,020
Unknown: So yes, the context in
which I read GEP sir about a

1215
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:59,620
decade ago was he sets up his
book. And again, I was

1216
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:02,880
interested in integral theory,
etc, and interested in cultural

1217
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,580
evolution. But his whole, the
whole premise and thesis of that

1218
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,580
book and his work, is that the
20th century, in the 21st

1219
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:12,240
Century, he was a mid century
thinker. He was born in 1905 he

1220
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:17,700
died in 1973 is that we are at a
civilizational juncture point.

1221
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,480
There is tremendous
destabilization and

1222
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:25,400
restructuration he lived
through, obviously, the first

1223
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,780
half of the 20th century, seeing
that firsthand, he was a

1224
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,540
European refugee, fleeing from
one country to another during

1225
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:37,340
that time. But he posits this as
the end of what he calls the

1226
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:40,660
mental, rational perspective
age, and the opening up of the

1227
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:44,740
this integral structure of
consciousness. And he basically

1228
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:47,320
said, Well, hey, look, I'm in
the middle of a transformation.

1229
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:51,460
There's new arts, there's new
sciences, there's breakdowns of

1230
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,860
different modes of being in the
world, right? There's a

1231
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:56,560
civilizational collapse
happening at the same time

1232
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,120
there's a civilizational
opening. So gepzer is a very key

1233
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:03,420
thinker in this regard, in that
he both lived through and was

1234
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:08,640
deeply sensitive and articulate
of exactly, in my opinion, some

1235
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,180
of the deep themes that we're
learning to let go of in terms

1236
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:15,300
of the mental world, right, the
perspective of world, the modes

1237
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,600
of time, the relationship
between subject and object, and

1238
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,100
Cartesianism is very much
related to the mental rational.

1239
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:28,880
So again, like, if you want to
really cohere the the culture

1240
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,720
that in some sense we are being,
we are helping to die, right? We

1241
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,140
are help, we're assisting in its
death process. I think epster is

1242
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:39,980
very helpful here, and that he
was a poet, and so he really

1243
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:45,400
makes this something that we can
phenomenologically explore in

1244
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,880
ourselves, in terms of our own
embodiment in relation to time

1245
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,120
and space. But yes, there's,
there's a general overall

1246
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:55,840
structure, just really quick,
archaic magic, mythic, mental,

1247
01:18:56,140 --> 01:19:00,360
integral. And each of these go
through these leaps, and I can

1248
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,020
go into this.

1249
01:19:01,379 --> 01:19:03,419
Daniel Pinchbeck: Let's maybe
come back to that later and go

1250
01:19:03,779 --> 01:19:06,359
into that, because it's a really
great framing, also for thinking

1251
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:08,639
about some of the subjects that
Christopher and David were

1252
01:19:08,639 --> 01:19:09,419
speaking about. Yeah.

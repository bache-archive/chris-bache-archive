1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,840
Richard Rudd: Hi, Chris, Hello,
Richard. Here we are. Here we

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,260
are

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,800
Chris Bache: made possible only
with new technology. Exactly me

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,780
in North Carolina and the USA.
Our guests from all over the

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,920
world. I see,

6
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:28,279
Richard Rudd: yeah, absolutely
and, and also the magic of, you

7
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,879
know, even though we're doing
this now, any other people will

8
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,619
be watching this in another now.
And I want to welcome all the,

9
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:42,519
all those people in all of those
now, yeah, yeah, all those

10
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:43,779
different timelines.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,760
Chris Bache: Yes. It sure has
been fun having this dialog with

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,420
you, sharing ideas and
perspectives on reincarnation.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,740
I've really been enjoying it

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,360
Richard Rudd: Me too. Me too.
It's I've learned a lot from you

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,020
and and you know, since I read
your book, it really, you know,

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,300
book that really blew, blew my
mind, and had so many resonances

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,060
for me, diamonds and, you know,
LSD in the mind of the universe,

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,280
those who Haven't heard about
that yet, it's quite something.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,400
Chris's book, so I recommend
that heartily, right at the

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,480
beginning here, and the
exploration that it's afforded

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,920
us and the overlaps with my work
with the gene keys. So,

22
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,360
Chris Bache: real pleasure, real

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,480
Richard Rudd: pleasure, and
we're also, you know, it's an

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,900
ongoing journey for us, isn't
it? So we, we, we haven't

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,500
finished this is just us sort of
getting going, I think. So, I

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,100
think we're probably going to
explore this subject in the

27
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,800
coming months and perhaps years,
and keep diving deeper into it,

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,520
and, yeah, mining the insights
that we that we can and also

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,300
involving a community of people
to to engage with us like this

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,920
today, yes,

31
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,500
Chris Bache: yeah, that's going
to be fun. I look forward to

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,240
that if we can get into as much
trouble as we got into it three

33
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,000
hours. Just imagine what we
could do with more time.

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:33,620
Richard Rudd: Exactly, help it?
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, we might

35
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,580
as well just jump straight in.
We've, we've got a load of

36
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,880
questions that have already been
sent in. So the plan here is,

37
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,920
we're going to Chris has, and
I've sort of sorted the

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,360
questions that you've sent in
into categories, and we're going

39
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,260
to kind of rip through them
first, because they cover broad,

40
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,780
a broad kind of area of subjects
connected to reincarnation. And

41
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,260
thank you. By the way, all those
who send in your questions,

42
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,480
they've really helped us to kind
of sharpen and some of those

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,960
questions lead to more
questions. And you should know

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,480
that we don't know the answers
to some of those questions as

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,480
well, and but we're going to
explore them together. So so

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,760
we'll do that first, and then
we'll come round to the live Q

47
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,200
and A questions that you can put
in to the little Q and A button

48
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,600
down here. If you get any point
you have a question, you can

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,260
drop it in there. And hopefully
we'll be able to get to as many

50
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,920
of those. So we have 90 minutes.
So a lot to you know, a lot of

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,840
time to explore.

52
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,520
Chris Bache: Well, you know, we
broke up the questions. There

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,000
were so many good questions, and
we could spend hours and hours

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,180
just in the questions that have
already been sent in. There were

55
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,960
so many good questions, we broke
them up into clusters. And so we

56
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,840
thought that let's go through
some of the ones in the first

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,340
cluster just to read some of the
questions so that the

58
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,720
participants can get a sense of
the types of questions that

59
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,360
people were asked to move to ask
after they listened to our

60
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,380
dialog, and then we can just
touch on a few of those and then

61
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,140
move into the second cluster of
questions, the first cluster we

62
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:26,120
identified as, how can we
acquire personal knowledge of

63
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,780
our farmer lives? Because it's
one thing, as many of you noted,

64
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,220
to have someone tell you about
these things. It's another thing

65
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,560
to do your own research and to
investigate these things, and

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,920
then it's another thing still to
have personal experience of your

67
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,480
own former life history. So let
me just hit a couple of these

68
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,660
questions. And then one was, how
can we get closer to completely

69
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,780
trusting the universe and that
reincarnation is true? If all we

70
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,180
have is book knowledge on the
topic or stories from others and

71
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,660
another person wrote, is it
possible to have a connection

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,300
with your previous lifetimes in
your present life, in another

73
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,240
Can you give us a practical
method that allows us to

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,820
remember our past lives and see
the lessons that are working we

75
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,560
are working on in our present
life and what needs healing in

76
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,720
our present life. Just to touch
lightly on these, just to start

77
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,720
on these three questions, maybe.
And then one last one was, have

78
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,460
each of you personally
experienced an awareness of your

79
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,600
past lives leading to the
present, and was it beneficial

80
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,640
for you to do so? It strikes me
that this whole question of, can

81
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,300
we trust this material? How can
I get closer to this material?

82
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,640
How can I begin to experience
these things for myself? It's a

83
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,720
really important question. I
personally started to accept

84
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
reincarnation on the basis of
research, on the basis of

85
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,740
people's research, and I think
this research is abundant.

86
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,300
There's a lot of wonderful books
that it's just deserving of our

87
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,220
close attention. But it's
another thing when you start to

88
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,240
have personal experience of your
own lives, when you do the work,

89
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,960
when you go inside, either
through contemplation or

90
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,340
hypnosis or some form of past
life therapy, and you begin to

91
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,200
follow your own memories back
into your earlier memories, And

92
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,000
to begin to have this vivid
experience that your

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,200
consciousness is bigger than
your body, it's older than your

94
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,160
body, it has a longer history
than your body, and that does

95
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,340
tend to cause this, this idea,
to live in your heart

96
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,040
differently than before. Don't
you think?

97
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,360
Richard Rudd: Richard,
absolutely. You know, one of my

98
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,040
favorite questions in there was
once I know about the soul that

99
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,340
gathers all my lives into one.
What are some practices to help

100
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,660
me embody it in my present human
life? You know? Because we're

101
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,820
talking about contacting the
energy of the soul, you know,

102
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,580
contacting the energy of the
part of us that's eternal, you

103
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,420
know? And that's like, that's a
journey, you know? It's a

104
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,600
journey we're all on, and most
people listening to this are

105
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,440
very certainly on. Otherwise you
wouldn't be here, I'm sure. So,

106
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,980
yeah, it's, that's the first
thing that could to contact

107
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:48,880
these realms and to discover or
come across wisdom that's that's

108
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,860
buried somewhere inside you, and
I firmly feel that this, these

109
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,740
memories, are actually held in
the physical body, in the

110
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,040
physicality of our body. So
right now, begin with that.

111
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,560
Begin with the knowing that, or
even the premise that inside

112
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:12,780
your physical body, somewhere
are memories held and and so

113
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,860
this is going to involve some
work with the physical body in

114
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,980
some form, some relationship
with the physical with

115
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,660
breathing, with awareness, with
mindfulness, with, as you said,

116
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,620
Chris, with contemplation. And
you know, there are, there are

117
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,220
lots of ways, and there are lots
of techniques and tricks and

118
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,180
things that can help you. And
but rather than kind of give

119
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,340
lots right now, I'd rather just
give a very broad guidance,

120
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,400
which is for me, is if you're
keen to know more about your own

121
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,380
story beyond this lifetime, and
that can be forwards or

122
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,520
backwards, then Start really
listening. And to really listen,

123
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,940
you need to clear space in your
life. So you need to have a

124
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,160
practice, I would say, of
listening or of contemplation or

125
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,340
of meditation, or perhaps of
prayer, or perhaps, you know,

126
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,960
anything that begins to enhance
and increase that awareness of

127
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,220
those other frequencies beyond
the body and and so finding the

128
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,180
ones that really work well for
you, the techniques that really

129
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,560
feel good to you and resonate
with you, is going to be a good

130
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,860
indication that that's a good
technique to begin to open up

131
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,500
the inner world and then begin
to create the space so that the

132
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,700
and you can put out the
question, I'd like to know more.

133
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,060
That's it. It's already in you.
If you're if you're here, it's

134
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,180
probably already in you. I'd
like to know more. I'd like to

135
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,660
remember more. And what you're
doing is you're really reaching

136
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,380
out into the ethers of the
cosmos, and you're inviting a

137
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,940
revelation. Revelation, or a
series of revelations, and

138
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,520
that's going to be a journey, as
it has been for Chris and

139
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,820
myself, and we've gone very
different ways, you know, Chris

140
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,240
is. Chris's route towards this
has been very different from

141
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,820
mine, you know, and and so you
have to follow begin with, begin

142
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,060
with what feels right, what you
resonate with, and then the rest

143
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:29,600
will begin to open up inside
you. You, I mean, you've had

144
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,720
more experience, I think, Chris,
with the past life therapy

145
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,280
community, than I have, so maybe
that you could give a few

146
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,260
pointers in that

147
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,860
Chris Bache: well, you know,
when one of the questioners

148
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,460
asked, Do we have any practical
suggestions for techniques that

149
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,040
can help people and discover
their former lives? And I don't

150
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,640
want to go in that direction.
This is there are no shortcuts

151
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,700
here. There is a matter of
living with this information.

152
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,160
And then also there is the
systematic exploration of your

153
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,460
deep consciousness, which is
just a matter of following your

154
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:18,720
your memories to earlier and
earlier stages. And this is can

155
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,560
be done with contemplation, as
Richard said, in various

156
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,760
meditation exercises. But then I
think it's also can be greatly

157
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,040
aided by working with
professionals who can, who can

158
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,180
help you stay conscious at
deeper levels of your memory

159
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,780
than you might ordinarily be
conscious of, because often when

160
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,040
we go beneath our personal
unconscious. We tend to get

161
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,300
fuzzy and maybe fall asleep, but
someone can help you keep

162
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,080
focused as you go deeper and
deeper. And it's often good to

163
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,600
focus on a particular issue or
problem or joy and follow that

164
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,020
to its root as you go deeper
within. But there are many ways

165
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,960
inside, some people's memories
are activated on a massage

166
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,520
table. Some people's memories
are meditated and activated in

167
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,660
meditation. But once you begin
to appreciate that your being is

168
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,840
older than your body, and live
with that idea every day, it

169
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,380
just becomes increasingly
natural to live in a world

170
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,760
that's saturated with time, to
live in relationships that are

171
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,560
saturated with time and with
life projects. It makes less and

172
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,220
less sense to try to compress
everything that's going on

173
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,200
inside us into one lifetime, and
more and more sense to let it

174
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,420
unfold into a larger agenda.

175
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,880
Richard Rudd: Yeah. So another
good tip is don't be in a rush.

176
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,540
No, take your time. Take your
time. You have all the time you

177
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,980
need to explore this amazing
mystery and the subject that

178
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,760
we're opening up here is not
just about reincarnation and

179
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,220
rebirth. It's, it's, it opens up
into into all, all other

180
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,040
questions, all the deep
questions, like, what are we why

181
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,000
are we here? How does it work?
You know, all those deep

182
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,060
questions that we have inside us
that we carry. How can we be

183
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,880
eternal? How can we know? How
can that work? And then we hear

184
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,380
all those, those things, and in
the work I do with Gene keys, as

185
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,420
many you will know has this
infuriating habit of pointing

186
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:41,380
people back into them their own
wisdom. Because if you can

187
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,980
begin, when you can begin to
access the wisdom that lies

188
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,980
inside you and it's and as I
said, start with your body, with

189
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,040
the physical, and begin to you
know, begin to kind of explore

190
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,880
what's inside you and who you
are, and begin to work through

191
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,980
some of the issues and the
shadows and the trauma that you

192
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,000
hold and begin to forgive and
begin to let go and surrender

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,120
and go through this process of
transformation, of inner

194
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,080
transformation, which is a whole
journey in itself, as as

195
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,940
everyone here will know, then
you start to open up space

196
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,140
inside for your wisdom to
appear, and your memories to

197
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,040
appear, and they will tell you
exactly what you need when you

198
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,900
need it, not before, not after,
just exactly when you need it.

199
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,500
The wisdom will come. The memory
will come if it's meant to come,

200
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,560
and it'll come in the way it's
meant to come. So for some

201
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,180
people are very visual. Some
people are kinesthetic, like you

202
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,300
go to a place, you're like, I
know I've been here before. Or

203
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,360
you meet a person and you look
in their eye and you know you've

204
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,080
met them before, those kind of
things. Or it could be it's just

205
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,260
a it's visual inside your
cortex, you know that you see

206
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,560
it. Or there's so many different
ways. Or it could be a smell, or

207
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,280
it could. Be through any of the
senses, or just an attunement to

208
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,120
synchronicities that are going
on around you, you know. And as

209
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,100
we get more heightened and more
aware of these other realms, we

210
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,860
begin to pick up on this
interconnectivity that lies

211
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,960
beyond this world, this, this
world that we are used to

212
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,320
inhabit, inhabiting, you know,
and we realize there are other

213
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,160
dimensions, and we begin to kind
of resonate with those

214
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,340
dimensions. And that's what we
call wisdom, you know, when the

215
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,540
when our when our world begins
to open up, and that clarity

216
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,980
starts to come through from
those other dimensions. And it

217
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:48,160
informs this dimension we're
living in, in some expansive

218
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,220
way, in some therapeutic,
virtuous way inside us, in some,

219
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,260
you know, in some process of
opening. And that's so, that's

220
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,920
really, you know, if you have
these questions, whatever they

221
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,020
are, know that you know the
journey is always, you know, one

222
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,160
of going deeper and deeper
inside the question itself and

223
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,000
sinking right down into the
heart of it. And because it's a

224
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,640
very valid question, if you hold
it and it probably has another

225
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,820
question hidden inside that, and
then another one inside that,

226
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,300
and then begin to open up and
open up and open up. So I want

227
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,740
to kind of say that as a as a
way of empowering everyone to to

228
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,300
trust in their own, in your own
intuition, and follow the

229
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,900
threads you know through the
labyrinth,

230
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,980
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah, yes.
Shall we pull a couple of

231
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,320
questions from the nuts and
bolts section, yes, Section

232
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,200
category, nuts and bolts
basically. How does

233
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,500
reincarnation work? You know,
some of them are long answers.

234
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,740
Some of them are short answers.
Here's a few that could be

235
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,800
answered quickly. Do we stay in
one ancestry? Do we hop across

236
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:14,100
to others? We hop, you know, do
we think our next reincarnation

237
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,300
could be as our children or as
our grandchildren? And there's

238
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,820
research that says, Yeah, could
be, you know, people reincarnate

239
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,260
in families. And another person
asked, are animals part of the

240
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,520
reincarnation cycle? And the
answer to that, I think in all

241
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,700
reincarnation cultures, they
say, Yeah, animals are part of

242
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,720
the cycle, but they tend to be
at the earlier stages of one's

243
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,600
reincarnational lives, because
once you have gone through a

244
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,300
certain level of cognitive
development that you can

245
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,540
function at a human level.
There's not too much to be

246
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,480
learned from going back and
living lives as an animal. So

247
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,160
they're part of our heritage,
but not necessarily. We don't

248
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,720
incarnate from a human to an
animal, even though that's a

249
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,460
very popular folk belief, it's
not really, it's not really a

250
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,820
belief held by more informed
thinkers of reincarnation. Do

251
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,300
you want to pull a couple of
questions from that

252
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,060
Richard Rudd: list? Yeah, and
actually, I'd like to go back to

253
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,200
the one about ancestry, because
I was recently talking to this

254
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,840
wonderful man, Tyson Jung ka
Porter, who's an Aboriginal

255
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:31,280
indigenous man, and he was
talking to me about in a kind of

256
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,960
interview we did together, kind
of informal one. We were talking

257
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,320
about transmigration of souls.
And in many indigenous cultures,

258
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:48,280
there are kind of they track
their incarnations, and they

259
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,540
have us that there's a strong
intuition held that within a

260
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,080
tribal grouping or a family
grouping or a clan that's close,

261
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,840
that's close knit, that's
operating like in those

262
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:06,960
cultures, then there's a there's
a real link between one's own

263
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,620
person and the great
grandchildren, or the great

264
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,340
grandparents. So it skips a
couple of generations, but they

265
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:21,200
see their great grandchildren as
the as the next wave coming

266
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,220
through, and there's all kinds
of cross patterning within that,

267
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,060
and there's no kind of fixed way
of understanding it, but it does

268
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,260
seem to be a strong, firm
tradition. So and recently for

269
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,780
myself, my father died recently,
and I've been going through all

270
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,920
of his ancestral things, and I
found photographs of my great

271
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,280
grandparents as it happens, and
and I, and I haven't, and was

272
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,940
before I knew I'd spoken to
Tyson and heard this, I have an

273
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:55,960
uncanny resonance to them that I
can't explain. And it just came

274
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,780
to me, and I've and I
intuitively just put their

275
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,000
photographs on my. Desk, and out
of all the photographs that I

276
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,760
looked at of ancestors and
people like that, those are the

277
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,880
two that I really wanted to look
at. And so I put them on top of

278
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,040
my desk, and they've been
sitting there looking at me for

279
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,780
the last few months, or month or
so. And so there's something in

280
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,720
that I believe, and I think it's
interesting that, yes, it

281
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,960
follows. It does tend to follow
through family lineages, but it

282
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,900
also hops about. And there may,
there may be a deeper storyline

283
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,760
to that that we could go into
another time. But yeah, I'll

284
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,660
hook another question out.
Sorry, I kind of wanted to touch

285
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,660
that one. There was also one
about wounding, which was from

286
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,060
the past, one, which I thought
was important not to miss, about

287
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,100
healing trauma in the body. And
I think it connects to some of

288
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,740
the further later questions,
which are about the nature of

289
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,940
incarnation and how we, you
know, what it really, what it

290
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,860
means to be in one of these. And
the way I understand it through

291
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:17,880
the work I do is that, you know,
as as you so well put Chris, you

292
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,560
know, we're, we're kind of
moving on now from this up and

293
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,280
out philosophy of like we have
to get, you know, we have to

294
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,740
attain this enlightened state,
and then we're out, and we're

295
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:34,220
beyond Samsara, and we're moving
on to another plane. And I speak

296
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,660
more about being down and in.
You know that the more work we

297
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,540
do internally, inside ourselves,
to clear patterns, to transmute

298
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,820
shadows, to forgive and let go
of trauma, through the physical,

299
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,740
emotional, mental body of our
being, then the more space there

300
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,400
is for us to incarnate more
deeply. So it's like our soul is

301
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,320
is a vast thing. It's vast. It
exists in another dimension.

302
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,640
Most of it's not here. Most of
us haven't incarnated, actually.

303
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,680
And so the more that work we do
inside us, inside our being, and

304
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,100
particularly I bring a deep
focus to the belly, to the

305
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,600
navel, which is where everything
seems to cluster, so that as you

306
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,800
clear your being, then more
light can, can actually come in

307
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,760
and live here and and more, you
know, you begin to radiate.

308
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,260
More. You begin you, you begin
to unlock more of that joy and

309
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,560
more of that healing energy
that's inside you, more of that

310
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,780
trapped energy, because more of
your soul can, can come here.

311
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,760
It's a bit like that's how
heaven comes to earth, through

312
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,540
us doing this shadow work, and
then more of us incarnate. So I

313
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,240
wanted to say that because it
felt like really important

314
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,760
connection between trauma and
incarnation. So I'm gonna let

315
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,960
you take it from there.

316
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,520
Chris Bache: Well, let me toss a
couple of these questions here.

317
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,880
One of them, I thought two of
them stand out to me. One is,

318
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,560
why do we forget our past lives
in the first place? And a

319
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,420
variation on that question is,
if we are all eternal, immortal

320
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,800
and infinite, what is the point
of reincarnation in a different

321
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,680
physical body? Could we not all
live eternity, different

322
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,160
experiences, places and people
in one body? And when I've been

323
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,280
talking about this to my
students, I ask them to imagine,

324
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,800
imagine that you are the
creative intelligence of the

325
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,960
universe, and you wanted to
design a system to maximize

326
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,680
accelerated learning,
accelerated development. And you

327
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,040
had two scenarios. You could
create a body that would live

328
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,060
100,000 years, and then set them
loose in the world to gather

329
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,920
100,000 years worth of
experiences. And you could plan

330
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,380
B would be to create a body that
lived 100 years. And every 100

331
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,920
years, you pull it out, and then
you plug it into the system in a

332
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,800
different body, a different
gender, different sex, and

333
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,580
different, you know, role in
society. At the end of 100,000

334
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,180
years, which of those two
systems do you think would

335
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,600
produce the most evolved being?
And I think we'd recognize

336
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,040
quickly that it's the one that
has discontinuity, because

337
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,360
discontinuity leads to greater
variety. Greater variety leads

338
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,260
to more accelerated learning.
And so the reason we forget our

339
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,420
former lives is precisely, I
think, so that we can completely

340
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,500
immerse ourselves in a new set
of circumstances that are

341
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,380
different, and it's the
differences that make them

342
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,920
challenging to us, and those
differences basically accelerate

343
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,360
our learning process. That said,
there comes a time, I think,

344
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,640
when the soul begins a process
of not simply differentiating

345
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,020
and gathering, differentiating
and gathering. But a process of

346
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,220
bringing in, bringing those
lives together, and when we

347
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,500
begin to assimilate the lives
that we have led, what often

348
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,640
occur, what manifest in our
lives first are the pain or the

349
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,780
problems left over from these
other incarnations, the tensions

350
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,440
and stresses. But as we continue
to work with those we begin to

351
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,480
tap into, I think, also the
assets of those lives, the

352
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,640
virtues and the capacities that
those lives have. And see, I

353
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,760
think much of our discussion of
reincarnation is influenced by

354
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,020
the past life literature. And
the past life literature is a

355
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,080
therapeutic literature where
people come to therapy because

356
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,460
they're they're carrying a pain.
But I think most of our past

357
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,780
lives don't manifest as pain in
our present life. Most of our

358
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,640
past lives manifest as
capacities, as skills, as

359
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,940
knowledge, as a capacity to do
things and know things, so we

360
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,020
have to be careful not to get
our understanding tilted just

361
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,100
towards the pain that that's a
figural part, but it's also all

362
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,440
the other things that are latent
in most lives. So there comes a

363
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,440
time when we begin to integrate
those lives and begin to bring

364
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,020
them together, and that's a sort
of a different stage than

365
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,440
earlier, when we were going out
and seeking new and different

366
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,760
experiences. And I think we are
coming at a time in history

367
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,100
where the emphasis is on
integrating our past, not simply

368
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,040
pushing the boundaries of our
past into new territory.

369
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,680
Richard Rudd: Yeah, yeah, that's
a great point, Chris. And I

370
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,140
think you know what we were
talking about earlier. You know

371
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,480
that what's being processed on
an internal level then is

372
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,720
manifesting externally as well.
By the way, be careful of your

373
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,320
mic, because sometimes it's
griping and so what we're seeing

374
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,260
in the world is we're seeing the
after effect of an inner

375
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,220
transfer, transmutation that's
taking place through the through

376
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:18,060
the group soul of humanity, the
group consciousness. And, yeah,

377
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:23,180
that was, I was looking at that
question about, you know, are

378
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,120
there parallel universes to
incarnate into? And it made me

379
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:32,240
think of, you know when you
know, when a soul evolves to

380
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,280
that level of beginning to kind
of, you know, beginning to

381
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,380
transmute more of the karma of
the of the world, or of the, you

382
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,480
know, of the suffering of the
world. There also is a more

383
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,460
there's a seems to be a greater
elasticity available to that

384
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,720
being, to that, to that aspect
of consciousness. So there's a

385
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,140
little bit more play, and that
means that there's more ability

386
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,100
to travel, to kind of
transmigrate between dimensions,

387
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,400
and to be able to kind of break
some of the rules of the

388
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,660
linearity of incarnating
sequences, you know, because

389
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,020
there's this like idea that
there's time, and we're moving

390
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,080
with like we're stitching this
beautiful cloth, this fabric

391
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,700
through coming in and out of
lives like that. And I think

392
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,240
that that, I think probably
there are many lives where we do

393
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,600
do that. But I think as we gain
in wisdom and soul evolution,

394
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,080
sorry excuse me, then we begin
to kind of reach a higher

395
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,440
velocity or higher frequency
where time is more is more

396
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,240
flexible for us, you know. So
some of you asked like

397
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,440
questions, like about, do we
have specific, do I have

398
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,860
specific memories of past lives
and and I kind of, I do in a

399
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:10,560
way. And I also don't, because
there's a part of my mind stream

400
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,020
that doesn't wish to cling to
locations in the space time

401
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,800
continuum, because there's a
playfulness I find in the way

402
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,260
that my mind operates. It reads
the whole stream, or it reads a

403
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,160
whole fractal, or a whole
pathway and a passage down a

404
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,060
lineage, and then it feels a
resonance somewhere, and then it

405
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,000
follows another one, and it
feels a resonance there. And

406
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,360
they're forward and backward in
time, you know? So they're not

407
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,620
just historical, they're more
mythic, and so there's more of a

408
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,240
there's more of an inter
dimensional play, the more

409
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,140
experience, let's say, a soul,
and a soul essence has gained.

410
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,840
And I think that's kind of
that's where we. Cross over into

411
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,780
other dimensions, and perhaps
even travel with beings from

412
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,360
other dimensions for periods of
time, so and have connection and

413
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,140
connectivity and memory of
beings in other dimensions, or

414
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,720
awareness of sometimes twins
even kind of like a twin energy

415
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,580
in another dimension, and that
can appear to us in many

416
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,220
different ways. And I've heard a
lot of stories down the years of

417
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:38,180
people who have that kind of
feeling, you know that they

418
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,200
carry, that they carry, that
they're not alone. There's

419
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,080
something traveling with them
and and whether they give that a

420
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,520
name or not, it's something
that's sort of that they're

421
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,160
participating in another kind of
level of experiment. So I think

422
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,860
there are so many layers and
intricacies within this woven

423
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,700
tapestry of time, space, you
know. And what's clear is that

424
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,360
in our talk, Chris, we decided
we started to explore this

425
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,300
notion of deep time, where you
begin to kind of step outside

426
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:22,760
the space. Time can dimension,
and then, you know, 10,000 years

427
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,500
on the earth can pass, you know,
as a single stitch in time, out

428
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,160
of the form. That's an almost
instantaneous so we have that

429
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,480
idea that, Oh, I may not, you
know, like one of my last

430
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:42,820
incarnations, I feel is quite a
long time ago and, and so that

431
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,640
might seem like, oh, I I've been
waiting around in some other

432
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,000
plane for a long time. But
actually that was that could at

433
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,680
that time was instantaneous, you
know. So it was just a bigger

434
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,520
loop in the stitching, rather
than lots of little ones. It was

435
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,740
like a bigger loop within the
time continuum. And then also

436
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,340
there's this idea that you can
then go the other way as well.

437
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,820
You can go forwards and take
leaps and loops forwards in the

438
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,140
stitch, in the weaving of this
journey that we're on. And you

439
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,660
can begin to the wider that your
your evolutionary lens becomes,

440
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,820
the more collective it becomes,
the more of the tapestry and the

441
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:28,220
fabric of reality or of space
time you can see. So it's like

442
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,340
you're no longer just doing a
little stitchy, you know,

443
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,680
pattern in the fabric that
you've been making for you. You

444
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,420
then suddenly see a whole
section of the weave that's been

445
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,580
created. And you suddenly see
your place in that, Oh, I did

446
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,700
that little stitch there, or I
was part of that. And then, and

447
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,820
then it's like, you pan out, and
you're like, it's, it's fast

448
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:54,040
beyond comprehension, because
there are so many beings, and

449
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,340
they're all one being, and
they're all weaving this

450
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,140
incredible tapestry together.
And it's within this, this

451
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,360
vibrating, rippling fabric of
space time. So there's a lot of

452
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,940
play in here as well, and, and I
think it's important to kind of

453
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,620
open one's heart to that, you
know,

454
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:23,000
Chris Bache: yeah, beautifully
said, Richard beautifully. You

455
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,540
know, reincarnation answers
certain questions, but in many

456
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:31,100
ways, it really is kind of
changes the direction of the

457
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,220
questions that we're asking. It
just opens us to a much more

458
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,240
complex universe, where we don't
necessarily know the rules of

459
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,260
where everything is going, where
it's heading, but we can begin

460
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,680
to explore it with a different
set of hypotheses, a different

461
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,980
set of assumptions. You know,
there is one question that we

462
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,640
put into this category I'd like
to make sure that we that we get

463
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,060
to and that is the question
about suicide, because it

464
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,860
obviously comes from a very deep
place. One person asked, what

465
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:06,840
happens with the soul of a
person who commits suicide, and

466
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:14,640
I'll just throw something in and
then hand it to you, but in a

467
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,080
reincarnating universe where
nothing is eternal, everything

468
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,920
is constantly changing, and
we're learning in incremental

469
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:28,640
bits. Suicide is just one more
episode of learning. It's not a

470
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:34,040
mortal sin. It's not doesn't
lead to eternal damnation. There

471
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,460
are many, many reasons why
people may take their lives, and

472
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,420
we may call them all suicide,
but they're not all the same

473
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,060
kind of suicides, they have
very, very different

474
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,300
motivational structures. But
even if we're dealing with a

475
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:52,600
suicide that comes as an act of
desperation or an act of almost

476
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,920
cowardice, we might say, if it
were, that even that kind of act

477
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,180
is greeted by. Universe with
understanding and with

478
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,500
compassion. When we die and we
begin to go through the life

479
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,640
review and we debrief our life
with the other levels of

480
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,720
intelligence and beings of
intelligence that surround us. I

481
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,180
mean, let's face it, life inside
time and space is hard. It's

482
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,660
challenging, and people get
themselves in all sorts of boxes

483
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,520
and dead ends where they they
get desperate. But even acts

484
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,840
made in desperation do not have
eternal consequences, and we are

485
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,760
not punished for such acts. We
are we are met, and we have to

486
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,860
learn from them. It's important.
I mean, all of our actions can

487
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,420
become habitual. So anger can
become a habit, a character

488
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,980
trait, suicide can also become a
habit that shows up in multiple

489
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,420
incarnations. So it's important
to confront the limits that led

490
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,600
us to such a desperate act and
find out how to bring that those

491
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,720
limits to different outcome, to
bring our life into a different

492
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,900
outcome, but certainly,
certainly, I don't think suicide

493
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:17,100
leads to anything like perpetual
estrangement from the

494
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,800
intelligence of the universe or
the love of the universe. Your

495
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,580
thoughts? Richard, yeah,

496
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,680
Richard Rudd: well, I was
thinking how suicide is almost,

497
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,880
it's always almost loneliness
taken to its far, far extreme,

498
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,180
isn't it? You know where it's
become so unbearable that you've

499
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:47,380
you know that that's the only
option you feel there is. And so

500
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,080
that's a very human condition.
You know? It's as you said, it's

501
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,640
like, it's absolutely
understandable that we feel, at

502
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,140
times, deeply lonely, and
sometimes the conditions that

503
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,420
surround us are so difficult and
challenging that, you know, one

504
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,400
can empathize, empathize with
that and and I think you're

505
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,320
right. I think, you know, in one
of the recordings I did recently

506
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,680
that I shared with you was, and
it's, I think we're going to put

507
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,660
a link to it. It's the I called
the rebirth sequence and the and

508
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,820
it's sort of the stages of
moving from dying and going

509
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,220
through these Bardo stages and
but very simply laid out. And

510
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,700
the final stage is called, I
call the arms of the mother. And

511
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,780
it has various levels to it. But
the arms of the mother is that

512
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:46,000
that's what you land in when
you've gone through those

513
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,720
sequences, those that life
review, and you're coming into

514
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,740
that place of self forgiveness,
you know, because you are

515
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,800
forgiven, but you have to
forgive yourself. And that

516
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,680
includes, also not just, you
know, that includes acts of

517
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,820
aggression and violence towards
others, or it could be things

518
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,380
like murder, you know. And you
know terrible things that take

519
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,540
place on this earth plane. So
the view from without, you know,

520
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,240
outside the human this human
plane in from the arms of the

521
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,880
mother is not, as you said, it's
not about revenge or

522
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,200
retribution. It's simply about
reconciliation and

523
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,700
transmutation, and a lot of the
times about forgiveness, self

524
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,020
forgiveness. You know, we we
have to, at some level, the soul

525
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:44,680
has to learn from whatever it's
done, and then absorb and

526
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,480
integrate that and forgive and
move on and become stronger

527
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,160
through it. And that's what this
whole reincarnating pathway

528
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,780
journey is offering us. So if
you really tune in deeply, like

529
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,640
you have Chris and your journeys
into the, you know, into the

530
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,740
into the field of wounding. And
in your book, as you describe,

531
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,840
you realize that you have done,
we've all done atrocious things.

532
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,840
You know, in our history, we
carry the memory of of terrible

533
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:26,000
deeds that we were party to or
part of, or on the victim side

534
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,560
of, and carry, and all kinds of
levels all inside us. I mean, I

535
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,100
have a hunch that a lot of that
memory is CO is in the non

536
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,180
coding DNA in our body. You
know, the so called junk DNA

537
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:45,100
that forms almost 90% of of our
DNA, that's that's not we can't

538
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,900
understand, we can't see that it
what it codes for. And so

539
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,700
somewhere in inside here are all
those, those memories of of

540
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,860
places we've been, people we've
been things, we've done. And.

541
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,660
Isn't the most beautiful insight
that arises from that, from an

542
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:10,560
incarnating worldview that we
are always forgiven, you know,

543
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,840
we love, we you know. And
knowing that you know that it,

544
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,540
it opens up the the journey of
the higher soul. You know,

545
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:25,520
because then the soul begins to
experience itself as light, as

546
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,540
as a Christ impulse, or a Buddha
impulse, and it begins to kind

547
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,800
of really become a beacon and
wishes to help others and be of

548
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,540
service and enter into that
higher evolution. And that seems

549
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:46,784
to me to be the natural
progression of the deep. And you

550
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:51,524
know that deep kind of encounter
with the nature of what we call

551
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:57,344
evil, or you know, or sin, you
know, and and that is like the

552
00:40:57,404 --> 00:41:01,980
or suffering you know. That is
the edge that that helps us

553
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,000
become better people, better
beings, you know, more beautiful

554
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,140
beings, ultimately, through self
forgiveness and forgiveness of

555
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:15,480
others and and it, but it takes
a wide it's a big it's a big

556
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,600
stretch. For some people that I
understand that it's a big

557
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,260
stretch.

558
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,000
Chris Bache: So, yeah, yeah,
forgiveness of ourselves and

559
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,600
forgiveness of others, but also
restitution. There's nothing

560
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,780
that we've done that we can't
repair, that we can't make

561
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,020
better, because we have
opportunity, we have time. We

562
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:41,260
can change our past by changing
our present and by moving

563
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,620
forward, we can make
restitution, we can help, we can

564
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:51,520
bring healing, where we brought
entry before, yeah, maybe I'm

565
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,060
very much aware that we have
many questions that are stacking

566
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,960
up in the Q and A, but I know
that we wanted to touch briefly

567
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,480
On the coming shift. Because for
a couple of questions about the

568
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,020
coming shift, let me just
mention a couple. One person

569
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,940
wrote, I feel very worried about
the changes ahead that you spoke

570
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,540
about, and wonder if you could
offer a sense of hope to those

571
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:20,240
of us who are struggling. And
another person said, I think

572
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,780
this shift that you are
discussing can happen in as soon

573
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:30,080
as 20 years. So very different
kind of takes on this. And I

574
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:38,120
think there is, I think there is
great grounds for hope. And it's

575
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,740
not not the hope that we can
avoid the suffering that's

576
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:47,020
coming at us so that we can
change it, but the hope based on

577
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,800
trust and trust on the
intelligence of the universe,

578
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,100
and that the intelligence that
had brought us through the

579
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,520
oxygen crisis billions of years
ago, and the intelligence that

580
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,940
gave us the 50% increase in the
size of our brain 200,000 years

581
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,780
ago, and the intelligence that
we see bubbling up underneath us

582
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,920
all over layer after layer in
the natural world, that

583
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,320
intelligence has brought the
human race to this point in its

584
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:22,280
story where it is basically
forcing us to shed the

585
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,300
limitations of living at a level
of awareness of just our

586
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,460
private, egoic body, mind
awareness and the summons is to

587
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,140
live out of a deeper soul
awareness with a deeper set of

588
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,260
our felt connection to other
beings and to other species, and

589
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:46,240
to the planet as a whole, and to
life as a whole, I think there's

590
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:51,760
tremendous grounds for hope, but
the kind of hope that is not the

591
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,480
hope and the avoidance of pain
and suffering, but the type of

592
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,320
hope that's born in the middle
of pain and suffering Out of a

593
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,980
deep, deep conviction that there
is a deeper intelligence It's

594
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,340
expressing itself. We may not be
able to see the full parameters

595
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,720
of this intelligence, but we
can. We can have the confidence

596
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,960
that this television
intelligence is functioning here

597
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,020
as it does function in other
areas of life,

598
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:24,019
Richard Rudd: exactly, and, and
that, that intelligence is

599
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:30,439
essentially benevolent, you
know, it is, it has, it has that

600
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,879
it, you know, it's highest, as I
described just now. It's like it

601
00:44:34,999 --> 00:44:39,139
through suffering, it comes to
know, its higher nature, you

602
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:44,319
know? And so as we experience
that as individual souls, so as

603
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:48,999
more and more of us begin to
come to that point, inside our

604
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:53,139
inside our own souls, evolution,
then the whole of humanity

605
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:57,279
begins to come towards that
realization that we are actually

606
00:44:57,339 --> 00:45:01,859
one being here doing this. You
know, and so we see this

607
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:05,159
externally, through the through
the way we our world now

608
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,159
operates through the internet
and through, you know, this,

609
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:12,419
this global connectivity that we
now have. And yet, we also see

610
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:15,599
all the shadows through that
more clearly than we ever have

611
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,319
and but we're also, we have the
capacity, potentially, to kind

612
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:24,979
of heal the situation more than
we ever have, because we have

613
00:45:24,979 --> 00:45:31,459
this connectivity. And humanity
seems to kind of need to drive

614
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:35,239
itself to the edge of a
precipice. Sometimes it seems to

615
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:39,019
be a pattern. Again, talking to
the indigenous people I've been

616
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:42,819
talking to recently, they say,
you know, in their memory banks,

617
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:46,179
their racial memory banks are,
oh, this has happened, you know,

618
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:51,639
many, many times. You know that
we've come to crisis and and

619
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:54,219
they're talking millions of
years, even, you know, the

620
00:45:54,219 --> 00:46:00,419
memory banks go a long, long
way. And so, you know, sometimes

621
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:04,919
we have to come to these Crux
points in order for there to be

622
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:11,159
enough of a kind of energy shift
for us to push us, you know, to

623
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:16,979
push us over and through. And
that's not a, not a pleasant

624
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:20,539
situation, and it and as that
energy builds more and more

625
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:23,719
towards that we will
collectively feel more and more

626
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:30,079
uneasy in our in our sort of
body biome, however, in the soul

627
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:35,659
awareness that you know as we,
as we expand into that more and

628
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,659
more deeply and into that trust,
that field of trust That's

629
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:41,919
underpinning the whole process,
and that's underlying creation

630
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:47,079
that then begin, that can then
begin to inform our biology. And

631
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:50,859
it really does you know that I
know that Chris and myself, we

632
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:56,559
both feel deeply safe in this
world, even as the world begins

633
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,039
to move closer and closer
towards what looks like a kind

634
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:06,299
of, you know, Armageddon type
scenario, but there's this

635
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:10,319
underlying benevolence, and as
you say, Chris, intelligence,

636
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:16,619
that is, that is preparing us
for this quantum leap, and we

637
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:22,459
have to kind of really sink into
that trust field in the that is

638
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:27,379
embedded in the eternal nature
of our soul. So this journey

639
00:47:27,379 --> 00:47:31,939
into kind of expanding our
awareness of the incarnating

640
00:47:31,939 --> 00:47:34,999
universe and humanity is really,
really important, because it

641
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:39,319
opens up, first of all, opens up
the mind to begin to, like, play

642
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:42,999
again, like, you know, this is
like when we were teenagers. The

643
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:47,979
teenage mind loves this realm,
you know. And for many of us,

644
00:47:47,979 --> 00:47:52,539
when we went into our kind of
20s and 30s, then, because of

645
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:55,119
the way we condition mentally,
intellectually by the

646
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,499
materialistic viewpoint, many of
us, then these kind of

647
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:05,759
conditioning paradigms fall over
us, like, like a kind of heavy

648
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:10,199
cloak, and so it's, it's
actually can be a great fun and

649
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:13,679
a huge relief to kind of shed
some of that stuff. And it

650
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:16,859
doesn't mean we're shedding
science and all its wonderful

651
00:48:17,279 --> 00:48:21,679
revelations. It just means we're
opening up to a deeper kind of

652
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,999
set of possibilities and and the
mind then kind of can go, wow,

653
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:30,739
anything really is possible. You
know, we do live in a, in a, you

654
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:34,459
know, in a magical universe
where, yeah, we can't understand

655
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:37,819
everything yet, you know. And,
but, you know, science is very

656
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:42,519
slow in its kind of methodical
processing. It moves at its own

657
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,859
pace, but the mind can really
expand and open up to great

658
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:52,659
vistas, and that that's the
first stage, I think, in

659
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:59,499
beginning to kind of feel safe
inside oneself again. So I want,

660
00:48:59,499 --> 00:49:04,535
I really hope, that that's a
part of the journey that we can

661
00:49:04,535 --> 00:49:09,275
help build Chris here together
by continuing to map these other

662
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:15,155
Chris Bache: realms. Yeah, yes,
very much. So we're committed.

663
00:49:15,935 --> 00:49:20,195
We're committed. We're here. And
you know, one of the things I

664
00:49:20,195 --> 00:49:24,919
talk about in terms of this
coming era, is the birth of the

665
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:29,479
diamond soul in history. And I
think actually the conversation

666
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:31,879
that you and I are having here,
with all the people who are

667
00:49:31,879 --> 00:49:36,199
gathered with us is a small part
of that process to become

668
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:39,259
because, to become aware of
reincarnation, to become

669
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:43,779
intellectually and in your
heart, aware of this larger

670
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:47,859
story that's playing itself out
inside your life. When you

671
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:51,279
become aware of something, you
give permission for that thing

672
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:55,119
to manifest more deeply into
your life, so to become aware of

673
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,239
reincarnation, to become aware
of the soul, and that the

674
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:04,019
dynamics actually i. Think it
facilitates the emergence of the

675
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:07,499
diamond soul in your own
awareness, in your own being.

676
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:12,119
And I suspect this awareness can
come in slowly for some people

677
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,599
and in some circumstances, and
it could come in dramatically

678
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,019
and with sort of stunning
effects in other circumstances.

679
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:23,899
But it's all coming in and to be
conscious of something conscious

680
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:28,399
even of the possibility actually
facilitates this deeper

681
00:50:28,399 --> 00:50:34,039
integration taking place. Shall
we shift to some of the

682
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:38,599
questions coming in from our
live audience? Yeah, before the

683
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:40,099
money that we haven't touched
on,

684
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,640
Richard Rudd: before we do that,
I want to just nail a couple of

685
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,680
the gene keys questions. Oh yes,
yes. More specific to me. You

686
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,560
know, someone asked, and I have
been asked this before, like

687
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:56,020
this, this, this notion that of
walk ins, of like a being that

688
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:02,940
comes into a body and kind of
supersedes it in some way. And,

689
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,000
you know, some people say, Look,
I've had an experience like

690
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,940
that, and I was completely
changed after that experience. I

691
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,560
was a new person. And, you know,
should I study a different gene

692
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,460
keys profile, you know, and from
that date, and what I'd say is

693
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:22,580
that it's important to have
both, because, you know, it's,

694
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:27,020
it's, it's like, you need the
old root stock. You know, it's

695
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,140
really important to have the
root stock. And then if there's

696
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,580
a new kind of hybrid that's come
in, those two have to harmonize

697
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,760
together. So you can use both,
and you can explore both, and

698
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,200
that's an added complexity for
you, but it's also a rich

699
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,300
journey to explore. So play with
that, as you wish I would say.

700
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,320
And there's also a question
about gene keys once gene keys,

701
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,800
which are these algorithms that
kind of determine our our kind

702
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:59,140
of awakening journey and our
incarnation and its themes? You

703
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,520
know they do. They? Is there a
continuity between them?

704
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:06,420
Absolutely, I would say that
there is a continuity between

705
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,340
sequences. But you don't have
the same sequences. And, well,

706
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,780
you might Through, through, you
know, some kind of sleight of

707
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,800
hand of the Creator or whatever.
But it's not this. You know,

708
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:24,080
that there's a there are, there
are patterns woven within the

709
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,000
matrix and the numbers that if
you were able to really look at

710
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,060
different, lots of different,
like lifetimes, you would begin

711
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,820
to see these patterns and
sequences. But they're not

712
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,800
always like obvious and clear. I
can, I can feel them, and as

713
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,900
when I used to do human design.
I mean, not human design, but

714
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,480
when I used to do gene keys
readings for people and human

715
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,180
design readings, I would see all
these patterns between people

716
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,420
and their families and their
partners and their loved ones.

717
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:00,120
And you get to see recurring
numbers and sequences, so, you

718
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,360
know, and it's really, really a
lot. So you get to see, wow,

719
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,960
this stuff that is so densely
woven, these patterns in the

720
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,220
fabric of these numbers, that
it's showing me something that

721
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,920
is not just kind of kept to one
lifetime. It actually continues

722
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,180
on. It's the thick in there are
these threads that, like I said

723
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:23,780
earlier that we're weaving So,
yes, there are continuities.

724
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,840
More on that at a later date, I
think. But yeah, let's, let's

725
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,760
move to some of the live
questions.

726
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:34,579
Chris Bache: So many good
questions here. I'm just

727
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:37,879
scanning through the list so
many wonderful questions. We're

728
00:53:37,879 --> 00:53:43,299
going to need more time.
Richard, one touches me here it

729
00:53:43,299 --> 00:53:47,499
says, Why do you suppose that
souls reincarnate for short

730
00:53:47,499 --> 00:53:52,419
periods of time, like the infant
that dies just after birth or a

731
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:56,559
young child that dies very
young? These are great

732
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,959
heartaches, of course, for any
parent or anyone who experiences

733
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:06,599
the death of a child, and I just
suggest that things which look

734
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,339
very large from inside the time
space perspective, and from

735
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:15,839
inside the egoic time space
perspective, from the soul

736
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:21,439
perspective, don't look
necessarily the same that it it

737
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:28,219
it feels, it feels tragic for us
to have a short lived life. But

738
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:32,659
for the soul, they're all short
lived lives, a 10 Minute life

739
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:36,799
and 100 year life are all
relatively small bits of time

740
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:42,039
against the vast spectrum of the
souls lifetime and sometimes,

741
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:46,599
you know, some of the past life
therapists have engaged souls

742
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:50,139
who have had this experience,
and they all generally tend to

743
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:54,399
agree that the most part they
are chosen incarnations. They

744
00:54:54,399 --> 00:54:57,159
chose the Incarnation knowing
they were getting into.

745
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:02,579
Sometimes the out the lesson was
for. Someone else. It was to see

746
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:06,119
the be the grain of sand and the
oyster that leads to a

747
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:11,579
development of other people.
Sometimes it's but they are

748
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:16,439
chosen. They are they are all
part of an ongoing and unfolding

749
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:21,439
process. And it doesn't mean, of
course, with reincarnation, we

750
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:26,179
really have true intellectual
permission to really understand

751
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:31,219
that our life does not begin at
birth and it does not end at

752
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:36,139
death, so we can let go of the
heartache. I mean, there is

753
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:39,919
separation in death and there is
separating, and there is pain

754
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:43,779
when a life that we wanted to
spend a lot of time with, we

755
00:55:43,779 --> 00:55:47,559
don't get to spend that time
with but life does not end at

756
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:51,819
death. Relationships do not end
at death, and purpose is not

757
00:55:51,879 --> 00:55:53,319
extinguished in death.

758
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,960
Richard Rudd: Yeah, beautifully
answered. That's such a tender

759
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:06,600
question as well. So malabika
has asked a question about the

760
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,400
soul outgrowing guy and moving
on to other systems and and can

761
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,740
the soul determine where it will
go, when and as what? And, you

762
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:21,860
know, so there's this notion of
how much free will, does the

763
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:27,860
soul have? And are there other
kind of forces at work? This is

764
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:34,700
a big, deep, deep question. I
kind of, I think we touched on

765
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:40,180
it a little bit in our sessions,
but for me, it's that, it's that

766
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:44,620
kind of notion of these two
forces of evolution and

767
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:49,060
evolution. And there's evolution
where the soul, let's took,

768
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,760
talking about it as a soul
evolution. So the soul is

769
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:57,340
evolving through through its
experiences coming in and out of

770
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:04,440
the form, and it's getting
broader and wider and more aware

771
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,700
of its universal nature, right?
And then there's also another

772
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:13,380
force involution, which is the
arms of the mother. You know,

773
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,100
the whole the mother itself, the
whole mother ship, the whole

774
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,520
collective consciousness. You
know, the God conscious, the

775
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,540
divine consciousness that's
doing all this through all

776
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:28,760
these, these monads, these, you
know, these fractals, these

777
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:34,400
holographic children, you know,
that are different sort of

778
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,780
crystalline aspects of itself.
But they are it then. So the

779
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:42,460
whole is also doing it. So there
is, there's both a kind of

780
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:47,020
choreography from the whole
taking place, and yet within

781
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:54,280
that, there's also this kind of
serpentine freedom and flow as

782
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,300
the as the crystals, the
individual crystal souls,

783
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,860
diamond souls, let's call them.
Become more and more aware that

784
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,700
they are of what they really
are, that they are the whole,

785
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,600
and yet they also exist in the
paradox of being a part of the

786
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,720
whole. How can that both the
ocean and the drop? How can both

787
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,200
of those take place? How can
that occur that's beyond the

788
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:21,740
mind's capacity to understand in
you know, that's a paradox, and

789
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:27,320
a paradox of startling truth
that can only be known as a kind

790
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:33,920
of as a through a bolt of
Revelation, I would say so. Both

791
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,460
are true. You know that we
determine where we're going. The

792
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,840
soul determines, but also the
mother determines. The

793
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,260
mothership has its own
choreography and dance that

794
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:50,320
we're a part of. And it's, it's
an incredible dance playing with

795
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,700
that paradox. That's all I can
say, is just to lay out the

796
00:58:54,700 --> 00:59:02,580
paradox before us so that we can
consider it. Yeah, thanks.

797
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,060
Malabika,

798
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:10,979
oh, I think you're muted. Chris,

799
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,380
Chris Bache: thank you. A
question from Catherine says

800
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,100
Buddhists say that reincarnation
is like transferring the light

801
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,540
from one candle to another. What
do you think of this

802
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:30,020
interpretation? This way, it can
be transferred. This way, it can

803
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:33,500
transfer both personal and
collective, karmic stuff. I

804
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:38,060
think when the Buddha was asked
a question about, what is the

805
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,580
self and the self that
incarnate. So we have many ways

806
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,460
of thinking about reincarnation
which are not very subtle and

807
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,460
not very adequate. And many
people think of the

808
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:53,560
reincarnation as a self
migrating from life to life. And

809
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:56,800
when the Buddha was asked this
question, he lie, had a series

810
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:01,920
of candles lined up, and he had
one. Lit and then he lit the

811
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,580
second one, blew out the first
one, lit the third one blew out

812
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,180
the second one, and passed the
candle flame all the way down

813
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:13,320
the line. And so then the
question is at the end, is it

814
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:18,720
the same candle flame, or is it
a different candle flame? And

815
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,460
the answer is, well, it's both,
but Buddhist wants to emphasize

816
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,000
it's a different candle flame.
And it's actually, if you get

817
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,880
right down to it, it's a
different candle flame from

818
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,260
second to second. So the
important point here for the

819
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:38,300
Buddhism is the teaching of no
self, that and no self is the

820
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,220
teaching, not that we aren't
individuals. That's an often

821
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,680
that's a misguided
interpretation of it. It doesn't

822
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,040
mean that there isn't an
individuality here. What it

823
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:53,320
means is there is no permanent
individuality and there is no

824
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:58,360
separate individuality. So there
is no permanent self which never

825
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,980
changes, and there is no
separate self, which is cut off

826
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:07,200
from the rest of existence, so
that the individuality, which

827
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,980
is, I think, the essential,
well, the center of our

828
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,360
individual experience, is open.
It's porous. It takes in

829
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,960
information and experiences and
energy from beings. It gives out

830
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,820
its own energy. And it's not
static. It's constantly changing

831
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:27,080
over time. So I think if we were
to take the Buddhist example of

832
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:32,780
the candle, it would lead to a
more subtle description of the

833
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:37,940
categories of reincarnation. And
that, I think, is the great

834
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,020
value of the exercise. It's the
subtlety of that description.

835
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,060
Likewise, I think that feel
theory is very is a very good

836
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:51,280
set of categories and metaphors
to talk about the soul, that

837
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:56,020
that the soul isn't an entity or
a thing or a machine or a

838
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:01,440
separate, you know, nut, if we
think in souls of souls in terms

839
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,400
of feels. Feels are, by
definition, open. They're open

840
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,900
at the boundaries. There's an
easier give and take between

841
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,440
fields and so, yeah, good
question.

842
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,200
Richard Rudd: Catherine,
beautiful answer. Chris, really

843
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:21,860
that was really beautifully put
and really great to have your

844
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,900
your vast knowledge of you know
different theologies here as

845
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:32,420
well, brought to the fore. Some
Nishad has asked about the Bardo

846
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,320
realms, which maybe both of us
could say something on. And

847
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,240
she's suggesting, is it possible
this life is in Bardo? So those

848
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,140
of you don't know the Tibetan
Buddhist, only Tibetans. I

849
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:47,440
think, is it only the Tibetans
that that name the Bardo

850
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,740
Chris Bache: Chris, their
vocabulary? I think, yeah,

851
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,400
Richard Rudd: so there's this
notion of the Bardo is the is

852
01:02:54,580 --> 01:03:00,180
the transitory threshold state
between lives or it. That's one

853
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:05,880
way of understanding it. It's
the stages as we move from one

854
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,380
state to another state. And
there's a whole description of

855
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:15,840
different, you know, stages and
states that they will describe

856
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:21,020
as we move from birth to death
and death to birth. And so

857
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,840
there's a transformational
process that goes on in that,

858
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:28,100
and there's also attachments to
those different layers and

859
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:33,860
layering. So the way I kind of
would understand it on a very

860
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:38,240
broad level, is that, because
the another way you could the

861
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,280
word Bardo has started to be
used by Western people, more

862
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:50,980
perhaps, is as a to refer to a
kind of an impermanent realm, a

863
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:56,080
changing realm, a transitionary
realm, or transitionary world or

864
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:01,440
sphere. And so in that, from
that perspective, yes, it is

865
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,280
possible that the earth is one
of those Bardos, and it is one

866
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,120
of those experiences that the
whole is exploring. And it

867
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,600
explores these theaters, let's
call them theaters, you know. So

868
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,100
it explores this theater, and
there's all these characters and

869
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:21,920
storylines that come together in
this theater and all these plays

870
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,960
that take place and, and the and
the whole is the audience, you

871
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,680
know, that's that's just
watching the whole, you know,

872
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:35,600
expansion of this process and,
and the whole, or the audience,

873
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:42,040
is out side of space and time.
And yet all the Bardo is exist

874
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:46,660
within space and time. So they
are the they are these journeys

875
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:52,420
and theaters and productions you
know, from hell to heaven and

876
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:55,060
all these you know, because
there's the heaven realms of the

877
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,820
deities and all the bliss
realms, and then there's the and

878
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,300
then there's the hell realms
with all the stuff. Offering.

879
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,020
And then there's all the places
in between. And all of those

880
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,980
are, in one sense, you could say
that they are, they are Bardos

881
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:13,800
experiences between states and
and so, yeah, it's all a

882
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:18,420
theater, as Shakespeare said. So
anyway, that's my, my, my

883
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,380
starting there, but you might
want to add some more of your

884
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:21,860
wisdom,

885
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,280
Chris Bache: yeah, well, no, you
say it, well, it's, it is

886
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,060
sobering. I mean the teaching.
There are different aspects of

887
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:32,420
the Bardo teaching, and the word
Bardo is used in different ways,

888
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:35,540
but you know it, one of the ways
it's used is in terms of the

889
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:40,300
levels of existence, as you say,
from the lowest hell realm to

890
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,440
the Hungry Ghost Realm, animal
realm, human, lower deities and

891
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,440
higher deity realms that there
are, these are exist in the

892
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,680
cosmos. They exist in the
spiritual world that lies

893
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:55,180
outside of physical reality. And
we enter into those various

894
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,600
Bardos, various levels of
reality, depending upon the

895
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,980
quality of our consciousness
that we have accumulated over a

896
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:07,200
course of many lifetimes. So,
but then it gets much more

897
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,480
intimate when the teacher says,
all those Bardos are taking

898
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,220
place right now in the physical
world, right here, right now. So

899
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,740
there are deity realms. There
are people who are born with a

900
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:22,760
silver spoon in their mouth, and
they just seem to everything

901
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,040
always goes well with them.
They're the captain of the

902
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,460
football team, or everything
just kind of breaks their way.

903
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,060
And there are other people who
are living in Hill realms, and

904
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,720
everything is changing.
Everything is turning over. And

905
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:40,480
then we can get even more
intense. It reminds me of a

906
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,360
story. I don't know whether I
can remember it completely, but

907
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:47,200
there was a samurai who came to
a Zen master, and he wanted to

908
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,400
understand the difference
between heaven and hell, and the

909
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,240
Zen master basically stood
there, and he began to insult

910
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,240
the samurai and tell him that
his clothes were dirty and his

911
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,400
sword was dull and he really
wasn't, wasn't wasn't worthy of

912
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,280
the name of samurai. And the
Samurai, of course, had

913
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,880
permission to kill anyone that
they deemed deserving of death.

914
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,880
And so he pulled out his sir
Lord, and he held it over the

915
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:16,140
Zen master about to cut off his
head. And the Zen master said,

916
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:21,740
That's hell. And then the
samurai recognized the great

917
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:24,800
compassion of the teacher who
had put his life at risk in

918
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,460
order to give him this lesson,
and he immediately felt

919
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:33,740
compassion and put away a sword.
And the teacher said, That's

920
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,940
heaven. So it's not just states
that last for an entire

921
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:41,920
lifetime. They're states that
last minute by minute, we're

922
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,000
constantly going in and out of
different levels of reality

923
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:50,800
minute by minute, then the
invitation is, what is it that

924
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:56,500
doesn't change? What is it that
is inside us that witnesses

925
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:01,980
everything and doesn't change as
our emotions change, as our

926
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:06,060
bodies change, as all these
things change. What is it that

927
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:12,000
doesn't change when we discover
that and then we hold that in

928
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,220
our awareness while we are
living these changes. It changes

929
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,860
the quality of the life that
we're living. It just kind of

930
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:24,020
deepens. It grounds us deeper
into the into the living quality

931
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:29,840
of the deep texture of existence
is to live in, in God awareness,

932
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,080
or in the divine awareness, or
in the in the awareness of the

933
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:36,920
Living Universe. Beautiful.

934
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,860
Richard Rudd: And thank you for
that great story you know

935
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:46,900
occurred to me that one of the
great modern, clear metaphors

936
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:53,380
for the whole reincarnative
story is, is Groundhog Day, you

937
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:58,540
know, because that film is
wonderful, funny film. It's so

938
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:02,460
wise. It's it hits something
very deep inside us, you know.

939
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:05,820
And many people have had that
same feeling like this is like

940
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,780
this repeat of like, trying
things out in different ways,

941
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:13,080
and then trying to take
advantage of it, and then try

942
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,160
and then becoming hopeless with
it, and then all the different

943
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:23,180
dramas that get played out in
one day, you know, and that you

944
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:26,120
could, that's the metaphor for
here, this planet, one light,

945
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,860
one world, all those different
dramas to play out until you

946
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:35,840
come to create the perfect day,
you know, like the absolute,

947
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,780
just your perfect day. What's
your perfect life? You know.

948
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:45,520
And, and then you're kind of
like, ah, that's, that's what it

949
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,820
is, I you know. And, and you've
brought it to the you've brought

950
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:53,020
it to the zenith, to the
crescendo. You've perfected your

951
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:57,100
soul within it, you know, even
though you had to go through

952
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:03,120
some terrible things, you know.
And. And, yeah, so I like that

953
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,240
idea, and I because I was, you
know, I know there's lots of

954
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,700
other questions, but it just
came to me as you were talking.

955
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,820
And, yeah, what do you think
about that? It's a good one,

956
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,300
isn't it?

957
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:20,300
Chris Bache: You're muted.
Chris, yeah. Oh, this is, Am I

958
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,980
on now? Yeah, it is. Here's the
Here's another good one. Maybe

959
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:30,620
mention this one here. Sherry
writes, I have had many traumas

960
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:34,880
in this lifetime. I'm tired of
all the spiritual practices and

961
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,720
processing. There are so many
different ones. I have done so

962
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:43,420
much spiritual work. This is why
I love Jean Keyes and Richard's

963
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:47,560
way of teaching. I'm at a point
of just desiring to be the love

964
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:52,900
I know myself to be. And her
question is, do you think it is

965
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:57,280
necessary to do past life
regression? I do not have the

966
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:01,680
money to go to those who do this
type of work. Or will we ever

967
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:08,160
just be the love and know that
that to be enough? And I this

968
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,520
has been the flavor of a few of
the other questions we received.

969
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:17,220
And no, I don't think you have
to go to past life therapy in

970
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:22,100
order to engage one's karma
conscientiously and to heal what

971
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:26,000
needs healing and to deepen what
we have an opportunity to

972
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,460
deepen. What's important is to
live one's life well. And if you

973
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:35,060
live your life well, all the
karma from your past that will

974
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:38,300
will come up in your life at
some time and circumstance. And

975
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,800
if you're living your life well,
you're taking care of business

976
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,280
as you go. Remember that
reincarnation has been going on

977
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:50,680
for hundreds of 1000s of years,
and it goes on and it works very

978
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,700
well, whether or not we know
that reincarnation is happening,

979
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,180
whether we know or believe or
understand reincarnation and

980
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,260
karma, it's still happening.
It's still been going on. It was

981
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,980
going on in the 15th century. It
was going on 1000 years ago, or

982
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:11,340
2000 years ago. What awareness
of reincarnation adds? It adds

983
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,640
an awareness. And with
awareness, we accelerate the

984
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,980
process. We can speed up the
process. We can we can stop

985
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:23,120
avoiding things and start
embracing more things. And as we

986
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,360
embrace more things, we solve
more issues. And as we solve

987
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:29,300
more issues, we live a more
relaxed life, a more open and

988
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,560
challenging life. So no, I my
two cents is I don't think

989
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:37,760
anyone needs to do past life
therapy in order to live a very

990
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:43,360
well and satisfying life. Live
your life deeply. It's all. All

991
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:47,800
your karma is right here around
you at the time. Live it well.

992
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:53,020
Live it deeply. If you want some
help getting around a particular

993
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:56,920
issue or getting a particular
boulder out of your life, well,

994
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:01,020
that can be it can be helpful if
you can do it. But it's kind of

995
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,280
a, it's an extra

996
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:07,499
Richard Rudd: great, great and a
lovely question as well, you

997
01:13:07,499 --> 01:13:11,999
know, really beautifully phrased
like that, the being just is,

998
01:13:11,999 --> 01:13:15,359
it's enough to just be. It is,
of course, it's enough to be.

999
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:19,919
That's a, that's the most,
that's, that's the most we can

1000
01:13:19,919 --> 01:13:24,079
do, really, you know. So I'm
very much resonate with that

1001
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:29,059
question. There's a question
here about old and new souls,

1002
01:13:29,059 --> 01:13:34,219
and number of souls and, you
know, and and kind of

1003
01:13:34,519 --> 01:13:37,159
populations expanding and
contracting. And it's

1004
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:41,739
interesting question. And, you
know, if you think about it,

1005
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:46,899
like most of the answers lie in
nature, you know, and and if

1006
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:49,179
you're observant and you're
listening and you're looking and

1007
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:52,959
you really contemplating nature,
most of the answers are there,

1008
01:13:53,139 --> 01:13:57,819
you know, I like you're walking
through a forest or a word, and

1009
01:13:57,819 --> 01:14:00,719
you look in there and you see
all These plants and trees. And

1010
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,279
there are old trees, and there
are kind of middle aged trees,

1011
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:08,339
and then there are young, kind
of ones shooting up everywhere.

1012
01:14:08,339 --> 01:14:11,699
And then there are parasite
trees. And there are all kinds

1013
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:14,999
of, you know, there are weeds,
and there's, you know, they're

1014
01:14:14,999 --> 01:14:20,059
all in there, and they're all
part of this ecosphere. And the

1015
01:14:20,059 --> 01:14:25,099
same here on this earth, you
know, on Gaia, we have, you

1016
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:31,759
know, enlightened beings. You
know, we have beautiful beings.

1017
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:36,079
We have villains and ruffians
and vagabonds, and we have all

1018
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:41,079
the different souls, exploring
and experimenting. We have young

1019
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:44,919
ones, young little saplings that
are still learning that kind of,

1020
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:50,259
you know, maybe get involved in
all kinds of difficult things

1021
01:14:50,259 --> 01:14:52,899
and suffering, deep in
suffering, and deep into

1022
01:14:52,899 --> 01:14:58,599
corruption and and and learning.
Are learning through that, you

1023
01:14:58,599 --> 01:15:01,019
know. And then there are older
ones. Ian's perhaps, who've done

1024
01:15:01,019 --> 01:15:04,199
all that. And they're like here,
and they're like, trying to kind

1025
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:08,219
of work more deeply into the
collective, or into some, you

1026
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:11,519
know, area where they've taken
on a lot of suffering, you know,

1027
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:14,759
to heal either inside
themselves, on behalf of the

1028
01:15:14,759 --> 01:15:18,779
whole or they're working in
service, in the service

1029
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:21,619
professions or whatever, where,
you know, in service in some

1030
01:15:21,619 --> 01:15:26,779
way. So there's all these
different, you know, story lines

1031
01:15:26,779 --> 01:15:33,499
and threads within the picture,
and, and, and sometimes, you

1032
01:15:33,499 --> 01:15:37,399
know, the forest dies back in
places and it and it's, it's

1033
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:40,459
less populous. And then there's
sometimes when it suddenly

1034
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:43,839
expands and it's more and
there's and it does. It's

1035
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:48,279
thriving, but they're all phases
then none of it's healthy or

1036
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:53,739
unhealthy. It's just what it is.
It's just part of the of the the

1037
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:58,959
whole theater, the tapestry. So
you know, one of the things that

1038
01:15:59,019 --> 01:16:03,179
the whole reincarnating view,
the rebirth view really brings

1039
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:07,619
to me is this sense of, you
know, amorality, you know, and

1040
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:12,779
that doesn't, doesn't take away,
you know, true morals and

1041
01:16:12,779 --> 01:16:16,199
ethics, and you know that are
naturally inherent in human

1042
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:20,959
beings, I believe. But there's
this kind of, it's just going

1043
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:25,039
on, and there's a journey taking
place, and we're at some point

1044
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:28,219
in that journey right now. The
Collective is in some point

1045
01:16:28,219 --> 01:16:32,299
right now. Our individuality is
at some point participating in

1046
01:16:32,299 --> 01:16:37,819
that right now. And as I I, I
was really sharing deeply

1047
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:41,379
recently, in the process, I'm
taking a big retreat, 1000s of

1048
01:16:41,379 --> 01:16:44,919
people in the Venus sequence,
which it's a process of healing

1049
01:16:44,919 --> 01:16:51,159
trauma, emotional trauma,
especially. And I was saying,

1050
01:16:51,159 --> 01:16:56,199
you know, when you heal some
pattern inside your own being,

1051
01:16:56,739 --> 01:16:59,619
then you reach out and you heal
it in the whole in the

1052
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:05,759
collective, because it is all
just one rippling web, one

1053
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:09,719
interconnected, woven web. I
mean, I seem to be saying the

1054
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:12,899
same thing over and over, but I
really want people to

1055
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:21,859
understand, you know, that, yes,
it's kind of, this is, this is

1056
01:17:21,979 --> 01:17:24,859
the theater, old souls, new
souls, you know, and then

1057
01:17:24,859 --> 01:17:27,799
there's old souls. And maybe,
yes, when you get to a certain

1058
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:31,879
stage, you have more choice
available to you. You can leave,

1059
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:34,759
you can go somewhere else, you
know, it's like you've earned

1060
01:17:34,759 --> 01:17:39,379
it. You've you've earned enough
money to be able to buy a ticket

1061
01:17:39,379 --> 01:17:43,479
somewhere else, further. And,
and it's, you know, that's the

1062
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:47,259
kind of metaphor, so, but yeah,
then you might also come back,

1063
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:51,459
you know, and bring your wisdom
here. So I think there's a lot

1064
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:57,219
of the sinkers, a lot of a lot
of, you know, imagination that

1065
01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:00,119
is needed when we're entering
into this, into this kind of

1066
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:00,719
territory.

1067
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,220
Chris Bache: Yes, very much. So
you know reincarnation, you have

1068
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:12,360
to live with it for a long time
and then bring that, bring the

1069
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,740
questions that people are asking
to into that reincarnation

1070
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:22,160
paradigm and sit with it for a
long time to get intimations of

1071
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:25,520
the depth the way it
recontextualizes and gives a new

1072
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,320
context for the way we usually
think about these things. And

1073
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,100
here's a question that really
stretches us, a question by

1074
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:40,360
Jacqueline she and this is a
challenging question, how can

1075
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:45,280
collective suffering be a
creative process rooted in

1076
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:50,320
cosmic love? How can Creative
Collective suffering be a

1077
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:56,680
creative process rooted in
cosmic love? That's a hard

1078
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:00,600
question, just because the sheer
scale first it works. It's it's

1079
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,020
a question that's hard for an
individual life. How does

1080
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:09,300
suffering, you know, is, how is
suffering in our individual life

1081
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:12,420
compatible with the idea that
the universe is compassionate

1082
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:16,200
and loving, but at a collective
level, how does collective

1083
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,040
suffering of the type that we
were talking about in our third

1084
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:25,460
dialog, in our coming, you know,
our coming, challenging period

1085
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:30,860
of history. How can that mag
magnitude, of that suffering, of

1086
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:36,080
that magnitude be a creative
process rooted in cosmic love?

1087
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:41,200
And I'm reminded that
Ramakrishna, the great Hindu

1088
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:45,880
saint said, if you want to
understand God, you must be

1089
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:51,220
willing to look evil in the
face, because evil is not

1090
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:54,940
outside the divine, but it's
actually part of the Divine

1091
01:19:54,940 --> 01:20:00,060
process, and suffering is part
of the Divine process. So in. We

1092
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:06,660
want to understand how any
compassionate person wants to

1093
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:10,140
reduce suffering and end
suffering. That's the natural

1094
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,200
impetus. That's what we want.
And we see suffering as the

1095
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,000
enemy, and it's something we
want to stop. But when we start

1096
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,920
to second guess creation, when
we start to think there has to

1097
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,340
have been a better way to do it,
God, you know, damn it, you

1098
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:28,040
know. Couldn't you have given us
everything that you want us to

1099
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,400
become without dragging us
through so many centuries and

1100
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,520
millennia of pain and suffering
are taking us more in the

1101
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:40,780
future? That's a wonderful
impulse, but that assumes that

1102
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:47,260
we we know what the project is,
that we know what the agenda is,

1103
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,900
and that we know what is the
best way to get to that

1104
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:57,340
particular outcome. So we would
have to ask, what is the

1105
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:02,580
project? What is the project of
cosmic love. What are we doing

1106
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:10,320
here? What is creation growing
on this planet Earth? And could

1107
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:16,200
it grow a species of diamond
beings? Could it grow a species

1108
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,980
of fully awakened beings and
fully empowered beings, and a

1109
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:25,040
species that can create out of
the sheer power of the divine

1110
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,240
consciousness that lives that is
flowing in their awareness

1111
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,860
without having to have gone
through some of the ordeals that

1112
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:40,180
we have gone through In our long
evolutionary agenda. This is

1113
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:44,920
challenging. And I on the one
hand, I want to affirm the

1114
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:51,040
compassion behind the question,
and I want to invite a deep

1115
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:56,500
sitting with the scale of
creation. We have to look at the

1116
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:00,840
galaxies and look at the stars
to appreciate the scale that the

1117
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,420
universe thinks on, and the
scale of the creative

1118
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:07,440
intelligence thinks on. And look
at all the stages of evolution

1119
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,680
that humanity and all life on
this planet has gone through.

1120
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:15,840
Suffering seems to be part of
it. Is just part of the grit of

1121
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,320
life that brings us forward.
Now, I think we may be coming

1122
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:23,180
into a time when we won't have
to grow through suffering so

1123
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,780
much as we have in the past that
we I think suffering has been

1124
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:30,020
part of the paradigm of how we
have grown in the past, and it

1125
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:35,180
may be that we'll be able to
grow out of grace more in the

1126
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:40,480
future, that we be challenged By
creativity, not simply by our

1127
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,920
pain, but certainly suffering
has been part of the stuff which

1128
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:51,160
has brought us where we are, and
I think where we're going. It

1129
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,760
suffering takes things away from
us. It breaks us down. It

1130
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:58,120
doesn't allow us to continue the
way we are. It forces us to

1131
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:03,540
reassess and do and to look at
things anew. And I think we're

1132
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:09,120
coming into a time where in
order for something radically

1133
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:15,480
new to come into the human
story, we have to let go of what

1134
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:20,900
we have been. And letting go of
what we have been is hard work

1135
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,680
and does involve a certain
amount of suffering, but the

1136
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:28,400
sooner we cooperate with this
process, the sooner we surrender

1137
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,940
to it, the sooner we let it go,
and the sooner we start taking

1138
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:36,200
care of each other with that
deep compassion which is rooted

1139
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:41,080
in that cosmic Love, the sooner
the suffering ends and the

1140
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:46,300
creativity begins. I know that's
not a completely adequate answer

1141
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:50,260
to the depth of this question,
but it's, it's just a piece.

1142
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:57,219
Richard Rudd: Thank you so much
for that. I mean, I'll add a

1143
01:23:57,219 --> 01:24:02,219
layer, which is in, in the in
the book I wrote the gene keys

1144
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:09,839
book, I laid out the kind of, as
I see it, the codes of

1145
01:24:09,839 --> 01:24:14,939
consciousness available to
humanity, you know, and and so

1146
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:18,119
you see this through these
shadows and these different

1147
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:21,859
these low frequency shadow
patterns that we, all you know,

1148
01:24:21,919 --> 01:24:25,519
play out with playing in the
suffering, and then hidden

1149
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:30,739
inside those are these potential
gifts. And then even inside

1150
01:24:30,739 --> 01:24:34,039
those gifts, those gifts are the
creative flowering, the healing,

1151
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:38,299
if you like, of the growing
through that suffering. And then

1152
01:24:38,299 --> 01:24:42,039
out of that comes this, this
fruit, which is, I call the

1153
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:48,339
cities, the 64 cities. And this
is like, probably where we want

1154
01:24:48,339 --> 01:24:52,299
to bring our talk to a close
with this, with this notion of,

1155
01:24:53,619 --> 01:24:57,039
there's something hidden deep in
the in the core of that

1156
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:01,619
suffering, and it is something
so. Are beyond what we can

1157
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:07,319
understand now, and it's
something so beautiful, and it's

1158
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:10,019
another realm, it's another
dimension, it's another way,

1159
01:25:10,019 --> 01:25:13,139
another field of learning, you
know, and we might call it

1160
01:25:13,139 --> 01:25:18,839
grace, or might call it bliss,
and it's another whole. And

1161
01:25:19,019 --> 01:25:25,819
well, you could even say we may
be entering the epoch in which

1162
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:31,579
incarnation itself starts to
fall apart and starts to open up

1163
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:36,559
and so that we no longer need to
move in and out of these forms

1164
01:25:36,559 --> 01:25:41,079
in the way we did. We may one
day look back and go, Oh, yeah,

1165
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:46,299
we used to have to differentiate
in that way because of the

1166
01:25:46,299 --> 01:25:50,379
shadow and the impetus of the
shadow inside us. But now we've

1167
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:55,059
explored that fully. We can sit
in these cities. These cities

1168
01:25:55,059 --> 01:25:57,819
are the these, these higher
states of consciousness, these

1169
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:04,199
avataric fields of oneness, and
we can still retain our souls,

1170
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:07,919
wisdom and individuality and its
journeys and its continuation

1171
01:26:07,919 --> 01:26:12,059
and its continued adventures,
but from within a much greater

1172
01:26:12,059 --> 01:26:15,839
field and of understanding and
compassion, you know, and these

1173
01:26:15,839 --> 01:26:23,239
Cities are the kind of these
Buddhic fields that are opening

1174
01:26:23,239 --> 01:26:26,419
up for us in the future. And I
think it's, you know, Chris and

1175
01:26:26,419 --> 01:26:31,279
I, we set this talk for Good
Friday, for good reason. In a

1176
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:34,999
way, it just fell there very
beautifully, because it's, it's

1177
01:26:34,999 --> 01:26:39,619
this notion of the constant
rebirthing of the universe, of

1178
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:47,679
itself, from within itself, and
it's just it, you know, I was

1179
01:26:47,739 --> 01:26:51,459
saying recently that it's like,
if you take the image of the

1180
01:26:51,459 --> 01:26:55,899
butterfly, you know, of what a
butterfly is, the myth of the

1181
01:26:55,899 --> 01:26:59,259
butterfly, that the allegory,
that the metaphor of the

1182
01:26:59,259 --> 01:27:04,739
butterfly, it's, it's, do you
need any more proof for

1183
01:27:04,739 --> 01:27:08,759
incarnation, for reincarnation,
than that? You know that that

1184
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:15,059
right there is, is the emblem of
what is hidden inside our

1185
01:27:15,059 --> 01:27:20,299
suffering, of what's hidden
inside this, this thing here and

1186
01:27:20,299 --> 01:27:24,079
and in this whole journey. So,
so, yes, I think we're moving

1187
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:28,399
into this next phase, and it's
good to be realistic, and it's

1188
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:32,779
also good to really expand and
open up into that and let your

1189
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:37,579
heart really ring out with
what's, what the what the

1190
01:27:37,579 --> 01:27:43,239
boundless potentials are inside
you, of your soul, and what

1191
01:27:43,239 --> 01:27:47,379
happens if you really have
worked those shadows through,

1192
01:27:47,859 --> 01:27:53,199
and then the full soul can come
in, the full soul can come in,

1193
01:27:53,619 --> 01:27:56,979
and that the body would hardly
be able to hold it, contain it,

1194
01:27:56,979 --> 01:28:01,739
because The incredible frequency
of the quantum field that's

1195
01:28:01,739 --> 01:28:05,399
generated from that, what we
call those cities, those and

1196
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:09,839
then then we start to be co
creators with the Creator.

1197
01:28:09,959 --> 01:28:15,179
Because then we're like, you
know, our thoughts become all

1198
01:28:15,179 --> 01:28:19,439
empowering, and we become these
children of of God, or these

1199
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:25,879
children of Christ, where we get
to play in a much vaster field,

1200
01:28:25,879 --> 01:28:28,279
that field that Chris was
talking about, the galactic the

1201
01:28:28,279 --> 01:28:31,819
galactic level, the the
universal level, would become a

1202
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:36,379
universal consciousness. And we,
we can kind of interact with

1203
01:28:36,379 --> 01:28:41,199
dimensions and paradigms that
right now we can't even begin to

1204
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:48,099
fathom. So I think there's cause
for great hope, more than hope

1205
01:28:48,459 --> 01:28:55,959
certainty, really, but we have a
few boulders to clear. First, I

1206
01:28:55,959 --> 01:28:57,999
invite you to have the last
word.

1207
01:28:59,859 --> 01:29:02,579
Chris Bache: Well, I'm glad you
brought in Easter, because it is

1208
01:29:02,579 --> 01:29:06,839
Good Friday, and this is a
special weekend in the Christian

1209
01:29:06,839 --> 01:29:10,199
calendar, and I know that you
and I have both been touched by

1210
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:13,439
Christianity, by its teaching,
and by people who have been

1211
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:22,159
steeped in Christian Teaching.
And we have been Christians and

1212
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:26,239
we have been Hindus at different
lifetimes, and we have been

1213
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:30,859
Muslims and we have been
aborigines. We have been all the

1214
01:29:30,859 --> 01:29:34,399
religions of the world and the
non religions and atheists we

1215
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:41,139
have we have sampled and drunk
from those wells. We have been

1216
01:29:41,379 --> 01:29:45,519
male and female, and in that
constant collecting of

1217
01:29:45,519 --> 01:29:48,399
experience, and gathering
experience and bringing that

1218
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:52,299
experience it to higher, higher
levels of fruition, when we

1219
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:57,159
encounter figures like Jesus or
like Siddhartha, Gautama, the

1220
01:29:57,219 --> 01:30:00,719
Buddha, or like Muhammad the
Prophet, when those. Beings are

1221
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,979
pictured in art. They're always
pictured filled with light. They

1222
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:08,399
have halos around them, and
light just emanates from their

1223
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,359
body. And they have so much
energy in them that they can

1224
01:30:12,359 --> 01:30:18,779
heal beings with a touch. And
Easter, of course, is, is death

1225
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:24,559
and rebirth, the the
indestructibility of life, death

1226
01:30:24,559 --> 01:30:29,179
and rebirth, continually going
and also, of course, the symbol

1227
01:30:29,179 --> 01:30:33,979
of compassion, because this is a
being who did not have to

1228
01:30:33,979 --> 01:30:39,739
suffer, but who chose to suffer
out of his great love for the

1229
01:30:39,739 --> 01:30:44,439
world and every mother worth
their salt, every father worth

1230
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:48,159
their salt, understands that and
would suffer for their children

1231
01:30:48,519 --> 01:30:53,799
for this. Those qualities, those
precious qualities, those are

1232
01:30:53,799 --> 01:30:55,899
the qualities that we're
developing. Those are the

1233
01:30:55,899 --> 01:31:00,659
qualities that we're bringing in
and empowering, and empowering,

1234
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:06,419
as Richard said, the power of
the soul, the energy of the

1235
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:12,179
soul, is huge, and to be able to
internalize the soul, we must

1236
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:16,259
make our body capable of
functioning at that level, the

1237
01:31:16,259 --> 01:31:20,159
way Christ was able to function
at that level, the way The

1238
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:25,039
Buddha and the Prophet were able
to function at that level. So I

1239
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:28,339
think that's I think that's what
we're coming to in history, at a

1240
01:31:28,339 --> 01:31:32,299
time when we, who have been
struggling in the shadows for so

1241
01:31:32,299 --> 01:31:37,159
many generations, are now
beginning to come into a time of

1242
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:41,859
light, a time of great
culmination, a time of greater

1243
01:31:41,859 --> 01:31:46,779
freedom, greater compassion,
greater wisdom, and where that

1244
01:31:46,779 --> 01:31:52,359
will take us will be a great
adventure, an adventure for us

1245
01:31:52,359 --> 01:31:56,979
all. I really appreciate this
conversation we've been having.

Richard, I really appreciate
everyone who's gathered around

1247
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:04,979
us and made this possible and
made this adventure possible.

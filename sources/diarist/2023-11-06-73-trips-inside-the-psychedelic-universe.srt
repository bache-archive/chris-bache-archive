1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Regina Meredith: Chris, hi
everybody. We're going to have a

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,300
phenomenal conversation in just
a moment here with Christopher

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,080
Bache, who I consider to be and
I know he'll be blushing if I

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,620
say this, but really a hero of
our times for being willing to

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,080
take on a journey that most of
us would not be able to

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,340
withstand, to find out about the
nature of consciousness, the

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,880
mind of the universe. In his
book, LSD the mind of the

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,460
universe, he shares with us his
experiences of some, I think, 73

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,120
different journeys he did with a
very prescribed protocol and

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,280
with someone sitting with him
and protecting him over decades

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,120
to be able to journey
sequentially further and further

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,260
out into what the future of
humanity looks like. So here we

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,620
go. Meet Christopher Bache, if
you don't already know him,

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,040
hello, Christopher. It's so good
to see you. How are you I'm

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,540
doing well, I'll tell you. I say
that very sincerely, after

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,080
reading your book, and the other
people who I know who've read

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,780
your book as well, the question
that comes up about halfway

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,680
through is, why in the world,
did he continue when you went

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,880
through that much pain, that
much suffering, enough that it

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,860
took months, even a year, to
recover from a journey, but you

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,820
would come back. You were
relentless in your search. So to

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,640
just set it up really briefly
for people, what made you do

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,200
this? You're a professor of
theology philosophy, what made

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
you go on this journey starting
way back when?

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,300
Chris Bache: At first, I think
it was a foolish strategy to

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,000
push it as hard as I did, but I
didn't know any better at the

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,900
time, or I was young and stupid,
but I was trained as a

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,560
philosopher of religion with a
passionate desire to understand

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,680
the deep structure of the
universe. I had studied some of

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,680
the great minds in our western
philosophical and Eastern

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,200
traditions. When I found this
methodology that Stan made

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,380
available, I just decided to
push it as long and as hard as I

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,180
could. And there was a great
deal of suffering on it,

34
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,680
episodically and periodically.
But at the end of every episode

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,220
of intense suffering, there
would be a breakthrough into an

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,860
episode of phase of deep,
ecstatic bliss and deep

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,500
Transpersonal encounter, and the
value of those insights and that

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,840
ecstasy balanced out, more than
balanced out, the transient

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,580
episodes of suffering in

40
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,820
Regina Meredith: the beginning,
when you first started the

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,400
journey, the very beginning part
was What you title in the book.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,640
And it took you 20 years or so,
after all these experiences, to

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,060
finally write this book and put
it out for the rest of us. Was

44
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,300
called the death of the ego.
While you were in the midst of

45
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,300
it, you were saying, What was I
thinking? So let's just set it

46
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,380
up with what that very first.
And we only have about 45

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,420
minutes, people are going to
have to read the book

48
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,240
themselves. We're going to
hopscotch through the phases you

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,900
went through. But let's start
with what was I thinking? What

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,360
happens upon the dissolution of
the ego?

51
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,000
Chris Bache: If you want to
allow your consciousness to

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,520
expand into the broader
dimensions, the deeper

53
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,540
dimensions of consciousness, you
must surrender the narrow

54
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,500
bandwidth of your individual
body, mind, ego. And so this

55
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,580
happens slowly or fast,
convulsively or smoothly, but

56
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,480
that identity that we hold has
to be shattered, has to be kind

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,560
of destroyed. And when it's
destroyed, then your

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,360
consciousness does naturally
explain, expands into a deeper

59
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,800
register, a wider spectrum of
consciousness. If you do this,

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,340
if your journey continues
repeatedly, as we'll get to you,

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,900
go through many such death
sequences, but it's not

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,440
repeating the original ego
death. The original ego death is

63
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,220
kind of the first transition
from your time space identity

64
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,260
into a deeper spiritual
experience of the universe.

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,680
Regina Meredith: Thank you for
that. And on the subject of

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,100
death, as you come to say toward
the end of the book, you

67
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,840
relished the death process. By
the end, death was something you

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,220
looked forward to in each one of
these journeys, because it freed

69
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,780
you so much from all of the
constraints in terms of

70
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,320
consciousness, and so we'll
build up to that. But one of the

71
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,640
parts you went through was you
became a woman. You started

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,600
experiencing the life birthing
all these elements of being a

73
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,200
woman, which was part of your
identity, is to be a male, to be

74
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,180
an academic, and so forth, just
briefly. What was your

75
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,140
experience? What did that do to
you when you suddenly connected

76
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,080
with the female experience after
being male

77
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,180
Chris Bache: about two and a
half years into my journey,

78
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,080
about 1011, sessions and the
universe put me into the

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,120
situation where I could
experience nothing except. Up

80
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,100
from within feminine identity, a
feminine identity, and it was a

81
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,600
feminine form, a womanly form
that was the exact opposite of

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,520
my own male, academic,
intellectually oriented form.

83
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,500
And it was totally terrifying to
experience myself being me, but

84
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,300
not being me within a framework
that I'd ever known before, and

85
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,940
it just snapped me. And so when
I let go and I yielded, then I

86
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,640
became hundreds, potentially
1000s, of women, and was given a

87
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,000
journey into the world of women
under the arm of the great

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,500
mother. And it was an ecstatic
experience, a wonderful

89
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,260
experience. In fact, when it
opened, I thought, what was I so

90
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,980
afraid of? What was going? Why
was I afraid of this? This is

91
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:53,440
marvelous. And what was the
universe was doing? Was it was

92
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,000
basically teaching me that where
I was going gender does not

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,820
exist. So all gender, all roles
based on gender, and any aspect

94
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,320
of my historical personality had
to be surrendered if I were

95
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,220
going to experience more
intimately what is there in the

96
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,760
universe.

97
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,580
Regina Meredith: So I would ask
you this, on behalf of the men

98
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,680
and women watching this, what
was the most either terrifying

99
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,020
or irritating and difficult part
initially, of being confronted

100
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,240
with a woman's reality,

101
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,820
Chris Bache: the most terrifying
part in the beginning was it

102
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,240
just wasn't my reality. It was a
reality, but it wasn't my

103
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,720
reality, and I couldn't get out
of it. I was trapped within a

104
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,920
feminine mode of experience that
just wasn't me. There was

105
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,340
nothing inherently frightening
about it. And then when I let go

106
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,200
and flowed with that experience,
oh, what a it was like having

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,440
half of the human race open to
me that had not been open to me

108
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
before. Now I believe in
reincarnation, and I believe

109
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,080
we've been men and women many
times, so there's nothing

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,040
foreign in that way. This was
different. This was kind of

111
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,400
opening almost into, I don't
want to say, an archetypal

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,980
dimension of womanhood, but
certainly to the collective life

113
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:18,600
being lived by women in history,
in time. So the joy was just to

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,600
experience a whole different way
of being alive than I had known

115
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,500
as Chris Bache, as the

116
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,000
Regina Meredith: academic, as
the male, engaging in academic

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,700
conversation, and here you're
dealing with a very different

118
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,700
kind of connection and flow
between women. Yeah, I thought

119
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,700
that was fascinating. It's an
interesting part of your book.

120
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,780
Chris Bache: I wish every man
could have an experience like

121
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,900
this. It truly, it does change
things profoundly,

122
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,940
Regina Meredith: you know, and
the other way around. And women

123
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,000
should have the other so we
understand what each other is

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,900
contending with in our bodies,
in this reality. So let's move

125
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,000
forward to session 11, and this,
there much has happened since

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,020
then. Time has passed, of
course, but when we go into

127
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:07,560
session 11, it really becomes
about archetypal, deep mass

128
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,040
suffering that you had to go
through witness and experience.

129
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,260
And if you could tell us what
that body of, body of memory,

130
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,120
collective memory, felt like,
and what it looked like to you,

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,400
that would be helpful, because
we're still in it,

132
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,360
Chris Bache: my transition from
an ego death process, which is

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,220
very personal, related to what
came over the next two years. So

134
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:39,380
it's a series of excruciatingly
difficult, horrendous waves of

135
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,400
vast landscapes of human
suffering, war, violence, just

136
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,020
unimaginable suffering. It was
transitioned by an experience

137
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,020
called the killing of the
children. And I just want to

138
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,980
mention that, because it's an
important signal in between

139
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,260
those two, I had this experience
of being an old woman

140
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,700
confronting soldiers who were
just killing 1000s and 1000s of

141
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,640
children, just smashing their
heads on rocks, just terrible,

142
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,380
terrible ordeal. And I think
this experience was given to me

143
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,220
to prepare for me for what was
going to come, this ocean of

144
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,320
suffering phase that is, it
awakened a depth of compassion

145
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,340
in me, which I think was
embedded at a soul level, to

146
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,180
prepare me to take on the work,
which is something my soul had

147
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,980
chosen to do in this lifetime.
What I learned was that just as

148
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,240
individual trauma gets buried in
our individual psyche and can

149
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,520
compromise our individual
health, the trauma of history,

150
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,580
is buried in the collective
psyche of humanity. And so

151
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,120
anything which is not resolved
by the species, that any one

152
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,840
generation accumulates in these
massive memory structures that I

153
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,860
call metacoic systems. And what
I think was happening was that.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Something guiding my sessions
began to use my sessions in

155
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,560
order to confront, absorb and
transmute vast territories of

156
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,740
collective anguish that were
embedded in the collective

157
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,700
psyche, meaning the patient
stopped being Chris Bache, and

158
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,920
in some way, the patient became,
became some aspect of the human

159
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,880
species.

160
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,480
Regina Meredith: So with that, I
want to ask you about something

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,560
in that's happening currently.
We have all of this going on in

162
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,680
the Middle East between
Palestine and Israel, and we

163
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,180
have collective side taking. We
have collective anger,

164
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,000
depression, anxiety all
occurring, and we have a

165
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,400
propensity toward people who
have been have proclivities

166
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,000
toward prophecy. To look at this
as the End Times, whether it's a

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,660
Christian community wedding for
rapture, whether it's conspiracy

168
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,080
groups saying, No, this is a
planned end time for humanity,

169
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,340
we get into these End Times
stories that start circulating,

170
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,100
but I want to ask you, having
been through what you went

171
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,580
through, you have this overlay
to it in your psyche that I'd

172
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,300
like to know about. Could you
tell us how you see these times

173
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,100
laid into what you went through,

174
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,780
Chris Bache: jumping many years
ahead in my work and I

175
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,240
summarized my experiences of our
time in history, what's

176
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,300
happening underneath the surface
where we're going in a chapter

177
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,340
called The Birth of the future
human. And there I was given a

178
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,180
number of visions over many
years of humanity coming to a

179
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,080
turning point, humanity coming
to a spiritual breakthrough, an

180
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,940
evolutionary turning point, a
shift in the plate tectonics of

181
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:49,180
the collective psyche. And then
eventually, in 1995 was taken in

182
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,900
a very deep experience,
dissolved into the species mind,

183
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,740
dissolved into what I call deep
time, being taken into the

184
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:03,120
future, and where I experienced
a death and rebirth process of

185
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,840
the human family, altogether,
not as an individual, but the

186
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,640
death and rebirth of humanity.
It was a global systems crisis

187
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,400
that was seemed to be
precipitated by a series of

188
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,260
escalating ecological crises.
Now, beyond that, I wasn't given

189
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,400
any details about it. I wasn't
given dates. I wasn't given any

190
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,580
specific nothing about
artificial intelligence, nothing

191
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:31,100
about a third world war, nothing
like that, just the experience

192
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,620
of the human family going
through a prolonged period of an

193
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,720
absolute loss of control and a
collapse of everything they had

194
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,700
considered the normal and
necessary goods or our standards

195
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,300
of their world. Ever since that
time, I've lived with this

196
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,240
awareness. And for me, it's not
a projected fantasy. It's not

197
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,640
something which I envisioned.
It's something which I

198
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,560
experienced. So for me, I can't
I don't question the truth of

199
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,440
it. So I experienced this period
of history. That's a period of

200
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,360
increasing a destabilization and
increasing escalation of

201
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,180
conflicts and breaking down all
our norms and our norms and

202
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,340
conflict between races, conflict
between religions, complex

203
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,400
between conflict between sexes,
between classes, all the

204
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,280
tremendous things that we've
been doing to each other,

205
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,260
terrible things over 1000s and
1000s and 1000s of years. We

206
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,640
have to go beyond where we are
and grow spiritually into the

207
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,980
next form that's emerging, I
think, in an evolutionary sense,

208
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,600
in the human as the human form.
So I think this is what we're

209
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,660
going into. That's why we're
beginning to experience so much

210
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,980
destabilization. And I think
what's happening now is not, in

211
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,560
any way, a final or turning
point, or at any final register.

212
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,020
I think we're going we're in a
process which will continue to

213
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,580
deepen for decades and decades
to come. So this is, I think,

214
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,280
just the overture of what's
coming and the terrible events

215
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,640
unfolding in the Middle East and
other countries, in many African

216
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,860
countries, other places, in the
United States, these are

217
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,960
bringing to the surface age old
hatreds, and we have to

218
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,120
transform these hatreds. And I
don't offer any political,

219
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,740
social solution to the events
we're looking at. My perspective

220
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,600
is not at the ground level. My
perspective is from the level

221
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,680
far above the Earth, looking at
the long evolutionary trajectory

222
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,520
forms.

223
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,219
Regina Meredith: Thank you for
that incredibly thoughtful and

224
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:51,819
articulate answer. And now what
we'll do, because we did jump

225
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:54,999
ahead a bit there, which will
work our way back toward there

226
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:59,139
are some other things in there,
but let's go back now to session

227
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,099
number 15. Where you learned
about karma, because all of this

228
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:05,459
has karma embedded in it. You
learned about the essence of

229
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,219
karma. And tell us what you
learned about karma at that

230
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,419
time, I had

231
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,340
Chris Bache: already, I mean, I
was an academic, and I was a

232
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,800
professor of religious studies,
so I had an intellectual

233
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,680
understanding of karma, which is
simply cause and effect

234
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,480
generated by choices that we
make their physical cause and

235
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,200
effect processes. And there's
psychological cause and effect

236
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,820
processes. And in traditional
worldview of karmic thought,

237
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,360
every choice we make sets in
motion a series of events, which

238
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,720
eventually we receive the
consequences of. We receive the

239
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,260
effects of. And by receiving the
effects of our choices, we learn

240
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,620
from those choices, and we make
a new set of choices. What I

241
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,820
learned in session 15 wasn't so
much a theoretical

242
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,900
interpretation of karma, because
I had that. It was a seeing and

243
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,760
being shown the karma of my
particular life. I went through

244
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,380
a series of sessions for a year,
over and over again for seven,

245
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,220
seven sessions where I
experienced the entirety of my

246
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,340
life, from beginning to end, as
a happening, as a totality, as a

247
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,660
finished, complete totality. And
this is my first entry into what

248
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,420
I came to call deep time. And in
that context, when I looked at

249
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,420
relationships, my the
relationships around me, Thy

250
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,660
people. When I looked at the
issues that I was working with

251
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,580
in my in my professional life, I
could see how deeply embedded

252
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,580
they were in a deeper series of
karmic, causal processes, that

253
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,400
my position in history was not
accidental the people I was with

254
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,920
were not accidental. It was a
meaningful fabric. Then the

255
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,720
question became simply, how do
you respond most effectively to

256
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,140
a meaningful fabric that your
life is part of?

257
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,119
Regina Meredith: Okay, that
brings us to something that I

258
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,539
wasn't going to ask you about,
but it seems like the right

259
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,879
point you just spoke about,
every decision we make has an

260
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:12,479
effect. And so yesterday, two
days ago, a book was released by

261
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:18,419
Dr Robert Sapolsky, and it has
to do with the Science of Living

262
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,959
with no free will. The title
something like that, as I

263
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,459
recall. But essentially, he came
to the conclusion that there is

264
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:28,819
no such thing as making a
decision in free will, that

265
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:33,199
we're machines, and we cannot
lay anything that we do upon

266
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:36,979
ourselves any more than we would
any other machine. So I would

267
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:38,659
love for you to respond to that.

268
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,020
Chris Bache: Well, I haven't
read that book, of course, and

269
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,520
so no just came out, yeah. And
but that's a very familiar

270
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,180
position among my philosophers,
in my department, among

271
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,180
philosophers in general, and it
derives from a vision of the

272
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,240
universe which is based upon a
kind of a 19th century

273
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,720
metaphysics, which sees the
universe as a machine, as a

274
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,340
deterministic machine, and all
the parts are determined by the

275
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,060
larger movement of the whole,
and we have no freedom. But I

276
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,980
think that's a deeply outmoded
and outdated vision of reality.

277
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,720
We're now looking at a quantum
world. We're in a world which

278
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,320
values indeterminacy, that there
is a there's much more

279
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,540
flexibility and in the system
than we had previously thought.

280
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,480
96% of the entire of reality is
dark matter or dark energy, and

281
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,480
we don't know anything about it.
I think if we just step back,

282
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,260
it's clear that much of our
psychological life is clearly

283
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,440
highly conditioned, but within
that highly conditioned context,

284
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,680
we make choices, and the choices
we make can increase the

285
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,360
conditioning or it can reduce
the conditioning exactly, and we

286
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,400
can increase our freedom. But
nobody exists in pure, absolute

287
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,480
freedom, except perhaps the
awakened, the fully enlightened

288
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,700
beings. But we can increase the
freedom by skillful choices.

join in. Thanks. I was very

296
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,100
disturbed, because the media
picked right up on this, and he

297
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,040
got a loud speaker off of this
one. I thought this is so

298
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,060
archaic and essentially saying
we have no self responsibility

299
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,800
either. Yes, we can't take
credit for the best of us, but

300
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,280
we also don't take credit for
the worst of ourselves. We have

301
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,080
no part in what we do as acting
as machines. I thought like you,

302
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,980
how outdated is this,
considering the quantum reality

303
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,700
that we're becoming aware of? So
one thing I wanted to read out

304
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,560
of your book, because your talk
is. Feeds into it, the notion of

305
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,100
us. We have a soul. We have
something that transcends this

306
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,460
physical reality, which that
author does not recognize, by

307
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,960
the way. So you in when at the
end of the karma, it says energy

308
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,500
started must simply complete
itself, and that's the nature of

309
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,780
karma. So then I go into this
area that I chose, where you're

310
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,740
defining the soul itself.
Because a lot of people wonder,

311
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,700
what, what is it I'm made of?
You know, at the most, the most

312
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,660
etheric, most, uh, sublime part
of myself, it says a story of

313
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,060
individual consciousness,
ultimately sourced in the

314
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,200
creative intelligence of the
cosmos, systematically moving

315
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,780
back and forth between the
physical universe and a surround

316
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,280
Metaverse in a long journey of
self development. I think that's

317
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,700
one of the best definitions of
soul, and the one I probably

318
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,420
relate most, relate most
strongly to in my own system of

319
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,200
understanding anything that you
care to add to that so people

320
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,080
can understand that this soul is
here for expansion, experience,

321
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,360
choice, and anything you'd like
to add to that, in terms of you,

322
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,200
what you came to understand is
what our soul is and what it's

323
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,980
here to do,

324
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,240
Chris Bache: just as we have a
center of integration that

325
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,680
integrates all of Our
experiences from this lifetime,

326
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,740
and we're not quite sure how to
describe that or what it is, but

327
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,340
it's we know what it what it
feels like, and what we can we

328
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,540
can understand it. The soul is
simply a center of integration

329
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,840
that integrates all of our
experiences from all of our

330
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,180
lifetimes and our times in
between our lifetimes. So it is

331
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,560
a center of integration that is
a learning system as part of a

332
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,380
learning system which is
continuously growing,

333
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,980
continuously expanding and
deepening. And if we ask, what

334
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,540
is the essence of what that
consciousness is? Classic

335
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,140
spiritual traditions have said
the essence of every individual

336
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,260
the soul is the essence of the
totality. Atman is Brahman. The

337
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,920
essence of the soul is the
essence of the Divine. For me,

338
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,440
the form, in my deepest
experience of the form of the

339
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,780
soul and the form of all reality
is light. It's light, but not

340
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,160
light, you know, not as we
experience it in the physical

341
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,720
world, a much more profound form
of light. It is light, but it is

342
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,420
light which is self aware and
learning over vast epics of time

343
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,400
and continuing to evolve as it
learns. And I think we are

344
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,800
coming in the time to have to a
transformation which is going to

345
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,340
change. I think we are actually
giving birth to the soul inside

346
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,140
time and space. That is usually,
we die, we expand to the soul.

347
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,340
We incarnate, we contract to
ego. We die, go, expand the

348
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,700
soul. And if we just keep that
up for a few 100,000 years,

349
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,560
sooner or later, I think the
soul, the integrated

350
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,080
consciousness we return to when
we die, manifest or wakes up

351
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,880
inside the individual human
being. And that's what I call

352
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,580
the birth of the diamond soul.
Literally wake up inside

353
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,660
physical existence. I think that
is the the challenge that we are

354
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,440
facing in this century. We no
longer have the luxury of trying

355
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,280
to run this planet based on the
experience of the of our the

356
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,700
psychological structure of
individual ego. The ego is a

357
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,220
magnificent entity, but it's
limited. It's cut off from each

358
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,060
other and from the larger
universe. We need to grow up

359
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,040
fast. And grow up in this case,
is to awaken to the soul that we

360
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,840
already are but we haven't
experienced fully inside time

361
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,740
and space.

362
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,480
Regina Meredith: Well, that's an
understatement. Yes, we do need

363
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,940
to wake up fast. And so now we
come to a point where you had a

364
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,160
session, and after that you did
not have another one for six

365
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,720
years. You quit for six years,
just briefly a synopsis of the

366
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,320
session, why you stopped for six
years, and what happened when

367
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,860
you picked it back up. Because
that's the fascinating part to

368
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:21,920
me.

369
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,820
Chris Bache: I stopped for six
years because my wife, who was

370
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,260
my sitter, asked me to too many
things were coming up out of my

371
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,000
sessions that were very novel
and disruptive, and she just

372
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,300
wanted the whole thing to slow
down, and she asked me to stop.

373
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,940
So I did, and then when I
resumed, I always knew I would

374
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,040
resume, and when I did resume,
six years later, I had my wife

375
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,160
support, and she continued to be
my sitter through all of the

376
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,120
remainder of my sessions. So it
was, it was kind of a husband

377
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,380
wife negotiation,

378
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,660
Regina Meredith: yes. And the
other part I found interesting

379
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,340
is that when you pick. Back up
six years later, you you're

380
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,280
being picked up at the exact
same spot you left off.

381
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,740
Chris Bache: That was striking,
because I was in the middle of

382
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,120
the ocean of suffering work. So
I was horrendous suffering six

383
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,920
years later, different period of
my life, different expectations

384
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,200
in different astrological
aspects. It my sessions began

385
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,860
exactly where it had stopped and
continued to deepen the ocean of

386
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,120
suffering for another year,
meanwhile, but in the ecstatic

387
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,480
portion of my sessions, when I
had stopped, I was doing this,

388
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,020
experiencing the whole of my
life, from start to finish.

389
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,840
Boom. Now I left all that
behind, and I was going into

390
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,340
subtle structure reality, and
being given a crash course in

391
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,920
cosmology, how the universe
works.

392
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,060
Regina Meredith: And then we
start going to lessons 2526 I

393
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,140
was absolutely fascinated with I
just I was trying, but I was

394
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,560
trying to read into it through
my own lens and filter of

395
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,500
understanding. And that was you
were out in the cosmos, and you

396
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:11,280
started encountering fast
beings, fast beings that were

397
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,420
almost like galaxies in of
themselves. And none of us have

398
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,780
ever seen this or felt this or
experienced this. Maybe just

399
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,340
give us a glimpse into what the
what seemed to be the makeup of

400
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,120
these beings. But the thing that
fascinated me was that you said

401
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,620
these beings live through
humanity, experience through

402
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,440
humanity, love through humanity,

403
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,960
Chris Bache: fill us in I've
often had kind of reservations

404
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,340
about that particular line in my
sessions, but I kept it in

405
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,360
because it's in my original
notes, when the ocean of

406
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,080
suffering came to a culmination
and exploded me into a deeper

407
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,160
level of consciousness. The
distinctive quality of this

408
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,960
level of consciousness is two
things. It was incredibly old,

409
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,520
ancient, ancient, beyond
anything I'd ever imagined

410
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,620
before, very, very old, and it
was more real than time and

411
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,820
space. So I was being catapulted
in what I eventually came to

412
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,480
understand as archetypal
reality, which is a level of

413
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,720
reality which is historically
exist before time and space

414
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,460
exist and contribute some of the
fundamental structures of time

415
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,020
and space. So the vision here is
that all of reality emerges out

416
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,980
of a primal one, which starts as
a void and manifest in the form

417
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,420
of the Big Bang. But in between
the one and even the Big Bang,

418
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,980
there are many gradations of
being many unfoldings that take

419
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,460
place of the Divine. Though I
don't like to use that word,

420
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,400
because we have so many
connotations of the Divine. I

421
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,440
want to go with but, and there
are many, many layers, and our

422
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,600
lower levels are sourced in the
actions of higher levels. And so

423
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,960
I was encountering these. I
don't know whether to call them

424
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,420
beings or principles, but vast,
vast beings and other people

425
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,620
have experienced them too,
because I think it's a universal

426
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,000
structure we're bumping into.
The very best my mind could do

427
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,640
to give it form was to see them
as galaxies, because I, you

428
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,900
know, watch the Hubble telescope
in the James Webb and we see

429
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,720
these galaxies that are billions
and billions of light years

430
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,380
across, so big we can hard,
can't even imagine them. And my

431
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,940
mind was using those images just
to give a picture to these

432
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,040
beings that were not galaxies,
but they have that massive

433
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,840
scale. And these beings were
part of the process of creation,

434
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,360
creating the time and space and
some of the structures within

435
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,860
Simon space. And far, far, far
down the line, we have human

436
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,280
beings. And the insight here was
that in some way, all of human

437
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:09,000
beings, and actually, all of
existence, was an expression of

438
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,260
the intentions of these deeper
cosmological principles and

439
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,660
cosmological beings. In some
way, I'm not sure that I got all

440
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:24,560
the pieces lined up correctly
there, but I do think that all

441
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,940
of human experience, male,
female, all versions of human

442
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,240
experience are aspects of a
species intelligence, and that

443
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,320
species intelligence is an
aspect of a planetary

444
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,940
intelligence, which is An aspect
of a solar system and a galactic

445
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:48,100
intelligence. And there is a way
in which this, these deeper

446
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:54,760
intelligences, manifest as our
lives, and they are experiencing

447
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,920
the world as as we experience
the world. And there.

448
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,660
Experiencing the adventures that
we are having as as we have

449
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,080
them.

450
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,680
Regina Meredith: So that would
bring us to the question then

451
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,100
that our experiences, and again,
we're looking at everything.

452
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,280
We're all watching this through
our mind, through an egoic lens,

453
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,180
all the filters of our past. So
each one of us is hearing this

454
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,660
the way we will hear it, but it
makes us wonder if we're kind of

455
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,860
the end toward the end result of
these vast systems of

456
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,400
consciousness, intelligence,
desire and creativity, how much

457
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,920
of what we're expressing in the
world is sovereign

458
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,300
Chris Bache: at all? Well, you
know, when I experience this

459
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:44,380
embeddedness in these higher
orders of creation. I never

460
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,980
experienced it in any way being
manipulative, and I never

461
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,180
experienced it as being
representing a compromise of my

462
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:58,720
individual agenda, individual
freedom. I experience this

463
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:06,060
downward flow of causation, but
as part of a profound, gracious,

464
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,640
compassionate, intelligent
process which was giving me and

465
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,660
all of us opportunities to grow
and develop that we might not

466
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:22,340
otherwise have. So it was it we
live in a conditioned universe

467
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,100
at levels upon levels upon
levels, and at the same time,

468
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,400
it's a creative universe which
is constantly manifesting new

469
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,480
levels, new things emerging out
of our fundamental deep

470
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,240
structure. And I just
experienced this as I was seeing

471
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,860
a complexity that had always
been there but I had not

472
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,820
appreciated before. So whatever
is happening has always been the

473
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,760
way it's happening. It's just
that we're beginning to be aware

474
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,660
of what's happening

475
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,920
Regina Meredith: that thank you
gives us, each one of us, we

476
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,860
could just go over this piece
over and over and try to get our

477
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,920
minds around the vastness of it.
Thank you for that, and also for

478
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,780
sharing that it was filled with
grace. I very much appreciate

479
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,320
that part of the story, and
another one we move on to, is

480
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,160
purification through
reincarnation. But we're looking

481
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,560
at groups of people, tribal
epoch. Periods of history are

482
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,320
involved when we're looking at
reincarnation, purification

483
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,400
through reincarnation as groups
of people throughout history.

484
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,560
Can you just talk about what
that looks like a little

485
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,680
Chris Bache: bit? Well, my focus
was not on groups of people, but

486
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,940
on all of humanity. When I moved
into the archetypal domain, I

487
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,180
moved into first and then get
counter with these cosmic

488
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,440
archetypes, and then I was
dropped down into what you might

489
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,420
call more of a Jungian level of
archetypal reality. Why I

490
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,340
experienced all of humanity
repeatedly as a single organism,

491
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,140
and I was shown, given many
lessons over the next year, that

492
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,840
each of our minds were like a
fractal spark within a species

493
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,880
mind, each of our bodies were
cells within an integrated body

494
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,440
of humanity. And so there was a
continuous flow back system

495
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,060
between from the whole of
humanity into the specificity of

496
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,960
each of us individually, and
then the choices that we were

497
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,760
making were flowing back into
the collective very similar to

498
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,240
Rupert sheldrake's Morphic
fields theory,

499
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,300
Regina Meredith: we tend to
incarnate during different

500
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,360
periods of history to purify a
previous period of history. But

501
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,600
we're doing it together, or
we're doing it as a species, you

502
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,960
know, and as almost soul and
tribal geographic groups.

503
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,920
Chris Bache: One of the things
that happened in this period is

504
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,840
that I began to experience, have
certain visionary experiences of

505
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,160
the entire human species
incarnating as a single

506
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,180
organism, and each of our
individual lives were cells

507
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,360
within that organism.
Previously, and I had written a

508
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,260
book on reincarnation,
previously, I had always thought

509
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,760
of reincarnation as the story of
the individual souls journey

510
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,380
towards enlightenment. But now
all of our I saw all of our

511
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:15,960
individual journeys an aspect of
its in collective journey. And

512
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,600
so what each of us were dealing
with was not just personal, it

513
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,560
was also collective. It wasn't
just this century. It was an

514
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,980
expression of something taking
place in a larger pattern. And I

515
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,660
think I was given this teaching,
which went on for a long time

516
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,760
years, in order to prepare me
for what was beginning to

517
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,460
unfold, which is this deeper
vision of where humanity is in

518
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,880
its evolutionary story, the
challenges we're beginning to

519
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,560
face, and the death and rebirth
and the birth of the next

520
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,440
iteration of human
consciousness, soul,

521
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,940
consciousness, diamond soul.

522
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,100
Regina Meredith: We're going to
get to the diamond soul in just

523
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,620
a moment. I just have one more
question I wanted to ask you

524
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,520
before. That, because this is a
big one for a lot of people

525
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,280
watching this, you had
assumptions about reincarnation,

526
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,260
and we all have assumptions
about everything. You were

527
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,200
learning, you know you're this
has been your life's path. Is

528
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,820
studying this, one of the things
many people watching this have

529
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,260
in common with what your
previous belief was, is that to

530
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,660
reach oneness is the end of the
road. The notion of oneness is

531
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,760
the end of the journey. Can you
tell us what you discovered when

532
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,060
you finally found that oneness?

533
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,419
Chris Bache: Oneness is a
profound truth. I mean, it is an

534
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:39,859
absolutely foundational,
profound truth, which is kind of

535
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:43,359
a seminal understanding that
runs through all the world's

536
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,639
spiritual traditions. It's kind
of a bedrock, because oneness

537
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:52,059
brings us in touch with our
essential nature, which is

538
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:56,979
underneath the variability of
our surface nature. Oneness

539
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,919
generates deep compassion. When
you have experienced oneness,

540
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:05,459
you are naturally going to be
gentle with everyone around you,

541
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:08,939
including yourself. You'll be
compassionate beyond measure.

542
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:14,699
And to experience oneness is a
profound step in our spiritual

543
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:18,539
journey. But I don't think it's
the end step. Sometimes the end

544
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:22,999
step is described as dissolving
into the primal void that

545
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:27,799
precedes even the manifestation
of the physical universe. But in

546
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:31,039
my experience, even that is not
the end step.

547
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,200
Regina Meredith: Should I give
one comment that you made? You

548
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,460
said it does not exhaust all
cosmological truths,

549
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,460
Chris Bache: yes, yeah. And
oneness is a profound stage in

550
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,760
our development, but the
universe has been evolving for

551
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,480
13 point 7 billion years. It's
going to continue to be evolving

552
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,140
for billions and billions and
billions of years. An individual

553
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,140
and a species awakening to the
truth of oneness, that's a

554
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,920
profound turning point for that
individual in the species life.

555
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,700
But evolution continues.
Challenges continue. It's not

556
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,760
simply that we achieve oneness.
We awake and become spiritually

557
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,580
realized. Then we leave the
planet, we leave the system and

558
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:17,400
go into some type of off planet
paradise. We oneness is a

559
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,900
profound stage in our journey. I
would start sounding like

560
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,920
science fiction. If I were to
try to share some of the things

561
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,900
that I've been shown about the
magnificent being that human,

562
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,880
humanity is evolving in,

563
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:33,979
Regina Meredith: please go
there. This audience is open to

564
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:36,019
science fiction, the

565
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,920
Chris Bache: future human, which
I think we are given the process

566
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,020
of giving birth to in history,
the form I've described it as

567
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,520
the birth of the diamond soul.
This is a the future. Human is

568
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:55,000
not simply a human being with an
open heart, a healed heart and

569
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,960
an expanded heart which holds
the entire world and compassion.

570
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,720
And it's not just an open mind
which is able to take in and

571
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,920
enter into deeper communion with
the intelligence of the cosmos

572
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,600
and incarnate that intelligence
within their own being. But it

573
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,460
actually transforms the
fundamental physiology of our of

574
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,980
our body and our sensory
experience. We have a tendency

575
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:26,060
to have a mechanistic
understanding of sensation. The

576
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,620
eyes, light comes in, brain
processes, senses, touch. It's

577
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,640
kind of very mechanical. But in
my experience, in the sessions,

578
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,840
it's not quite that simple. The
more conscious we are, and the

579
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,340
more conscious we consolidate,
and I'm talking about not

580
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,580
consciousness, which is
collected over experience over

581
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,360
1000s and 1000s of years, but
the more consciousness we

582
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,220
consolidate, it not only heals
our heart and opens our mind, it

583
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:59,260
enlivens our senses, so that our
eyes are in the process. Our

584
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,880
visual experience is in the
process of becoming hundreds of

585
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,700
times more sensitive than normal
today, our taste, our touch, our

586
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,540
sexuality, all the physical
senses are in the process of

587
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,900
being transformed. And if we
ask, how far can this

588
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:19,859
Regina Meredith: go? You had an
experience where you didn't

589
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,939
understand what was going on as
I recall when I read the book,

590
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,359
where you were looking at
something but it didn't look as

591
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:30,439
you normally saw it. I think you
were looking at your hands. Is

592
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,339
that correct?

593
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:34,159
Chris Bache: It was the very
last session. That was the 73rd

594
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:38,839
session, and I was at the end
stage of that session, about

595
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:43,779
five hours in, and I was given
an experience that I came to

596
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:47,739
call diamond vision. All of a
sudden, my vision was 1000 times

597
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:51,159
sharper than I'd ever known it
to be. I could see things. I

598
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:54,039
could discriminate colors and
shades and textures. I was

599
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:59,079
looking at my hands, and I was
able to see every pore in every

600
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:02,579
at the base of every. Every hair
follicle. I mean, it was just

601
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,239
amazingly detailed. I could see
dust floating in the air with

602
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,459
great precision. I could count
leaves on a tree. And then after

603
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:14,879
about 10 minutes, it
disappeared, and I was back to

604
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,419
my ordinary, perfectly focused
vision. And that's when I

605
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:21,319
understood that I was seeing
through the eyes of the future

606
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:25,939
human, that the future human is
a transformation of our physical

607
00:40:25,939 --> 00:40:31,159
sensations of our entire so our
entire existence is being

608
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:34,999
polished, evoked, brought
forward into deeper forms of

609
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,759
manifestation by the universe.

610
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,240
Regina Meredith: This is so
beautiful. And that was, as I

611
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,040
recall a session 71 through 73
where you were shown that this

612
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,880
human being, this vehicle, is
designed for rapid

613
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,560
transformation. And please
expand on that a moment before

614
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,480
we come toward our close here,

615
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,560
Chris Bache: well in the 70th
vision, I was given what I

616
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,020
consider the last great vision
of my journey after that, it was

617
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,580
kind of wrapping it up. But in
that journey, I was taken deeply

618
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:15,360
into deep time and given three
core experiences. And one of

619
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:22,280
those experiences was an insight
into how it is that humanity is

620
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,320
actually built, designed for
accelerated evolution, and it's

621
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,880
basically we have the surface of
our being is reincarnation. We

622
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,120
incarnate, we learn, we grow, we
change, we make decisions. We

623
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,900
incarnate again, different. This
is that part. But underneath the

624
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,420
incarnate, our incarnating self,
there is a deeper structure

625
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,500
which holds all of our
incarnational memories, and is

626
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,240
the fundamental blueprint, in a
sense, from within which we act

627
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,900
and behave, so that all of
humanity is growing and

628
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,920
changing, growing and changing.
And there is a structure to the

629
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,600
collective psyche, a very
specific structure which is

630
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,740
accumulating and storing all
this information while we change

631
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,640
individually, this deeper than
individual structure is holding

632
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,780
it and periodically, that deeper
structure goes through a change

633
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,920
of a pivot. It's what I call a
shift in the plate tectonics of

634
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,240
the of the collective psyche. I
think it's the genius of

635
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,420
creation that we learn at an
individual level, but it

636
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,040
collects at a deeper level. And
periodically that deeper level

637
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,840
changes, and after that shift
takes place, all individual

638
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,200
experience is based on that
changed fundamental psyche, so

639
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,680
that after we go through the
birth of the future human all

640
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,520
future incarnations of all
beings, all this human beings,

641
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,660
will be operating out of
transform this new fundamental

642
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,960
collective psyche, and it's
going to continue. It doesn't

643
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,540
stop. So individuals learn and
grow. It's collected at a deeper

644
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,840
level, and that deeper level
learns and grow like Rupert

645
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,260
sheldrakes talks about
morphogenic fields, and it's an

646
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,440
ongoing, continuous evolving
process.

647
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,740
Regina Meredith: And you know,
I've interviewed many, many

648
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,940
people over the last 20 years in
this particular role, and I do

649
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,680
also interview people who
channel other beings from other

650
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,820
times and spaces. And one thing
that has come up repeatedly is

651
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,660
that what humanity is moving
toward, it's a total overlay

652
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,400
with what you're saying is to
this expansive being, this

653
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,780
refined being that incarnates
into the physical body who's

654
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,880
operating through the heart
center as the primary influence

655
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,980
of intelligence, and that we
this is a species that can end

656
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,880
up, and will end up being a
model for other species

657
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,900
throughout the universes. Is
that how you saw it, too, once

658
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,000
we can embody all of this,

659
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,220
Chris Bache: you know, there was
just one piece, one line in all

660
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,160
of the sessions that seemed to
indicate something like that. I

661
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,220
What i intuited was that Earth
was a hot house, growing form of

662
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,420
consciousness that would, in
time, be exported to other solar

663
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,980
systems in our galaxy. I don't
think we're the origin of all

664
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,840
life, and I'm sure that there is
evolution taking place in highly

665
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,020
developed forms in all sorts of
solar systems and other

666
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,700
galaxies. But at least here, we
seem to be growing something

667
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,980
which is destined. Seemed to me
just that one inclination seems

668
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,080
to be destined for more than
planet Earth.

669
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,380
Regina Meredith: Well, I just
wanted to say you have

670
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,680
validation there from other
sources who have given that

671
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,980
information through to us. Now
it's a while getting there. We

672
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,720
just have to trip through these
times again. I can't thank you

673
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,720
enough for the courage it took
you. We didn't talk about what

674
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,320
you went through, but I mean,
we're talking about life

675
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,480
wrecking cause. Consequences of
taking such high doses of LSD

676
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,180
that you say now, was really
insane to have done, but you

677
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,240
didn't know any better. You
lived through it, thank God,

678
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,060
because it really, it really
pushed you out there.

679
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,320
Chris Bache: Yes, truly do not,
I do not recommend. No, I'd be

680
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,020
much gentler if I were doing it
again, and I recommend a gentler

681
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,780
protocol if you're going to work
with psychedelics,

682
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,240
Regina Meredith: yes, yes, and
you say that repeatedly in the

683
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,920
book. So I recommend for people
to really dive into this. We

684
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,340
just touched a few places in the
book. There's so much more

685
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,900
connective tissue to this story
of the human, the collective

686
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,880
human being. And any final
thoughts you want to leave us

687
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,560
with today before we sign off,

688
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,040
Chris Bache: first, I want to
thank you for helping bring the

689
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:55,600
message from this work forward.
Psychedelics is simply a

690
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,620
protocol. It's a new methodology
for accessing these deep states

691
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:04,380
of consciousness, but it's
simply a modern version. We have

692
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,620
many protocols that have been
accessing these deep states of

693
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,580
consciousness. Psychedelics are
not important. They're not the

694
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,360
signature of this work. They're
simply an amplifier. It's

695
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,560
consciousness that does the
work. It's consciousness that if

696
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,060
we use these sessions
skillfully. It's consciousness

697
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,480
that really does the work that
opens us to these things. So I

698
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,060
would really, at the end, I
would de emphasize the

699
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,740
psychedelics and emphasize the
consciousness which psychedelics

700
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,580
amplify.

701
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,340
Regina Meredith: And there are
many ways to reach that. Yes,

702
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,020
again, Christopher, thank you so
much, and I look forward to

703
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,900
meeting you in the flesh in the
Gaia Studios, where we'll go

704
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,020
over this, but start filling in
some of the pieces we didn't

705
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,760
weren't able to get to today.

706
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,220
Chris Bache: Okay. Thank you,
Regina. I look forward to that

707
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,780
too. Thank you so

708
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,940
Regina Meredith: everybody.
Again. The title of the book is

709
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,160
LSD and the mind of the universe
Christopher Bache, and I can't

710
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,720
recommend it highly enough, it
will take you to places that you

711
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,640
never dreamed existed. So until
next time, thank you for joining

1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:38,660
Chris Bache: Like a smile,
another side, purification,

2
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,460
purifications unto death in
order to enter that dialog,

3
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,440
Unknown: what do you what do you
think death is?

4
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,760
Chris Bache: Well, as I say in
the book, eventually you come to

5
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,840
a point, if you've gone through
many cycles of death and

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,560
rebirth, you come to a point
where the death loses its

7
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,860
meaning because you've learned
from experience that you can

8
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,460
die. You can lose all your
reality reference points,

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,940
everything you know yourself to
be can be shattered and

10
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,600
destroyed, but the Phoenix
always rises. You always wake

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:27,560
up. You a changed. You always
awakens in a deeper capacity and

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,340
a deeper level of reality. So
from this perspective,

13
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,960
eventually you learn that there
is no such thing as death. There

14
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,140
is only the shedding of one
particular set of parameters

15
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,540
within which awareness operates,
shedding those parameters and

16
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,140
letting consciousness expand to
a deeper experience of reality.

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,980
What we usually mean, and I
think death of the physical body

18
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,940
is something very similar what
you go through in an LSD session

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
deep one that type of death
approximates what happens when

20
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,940
you go through physical death,
the body dies. You lose your

21
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,600
physical reference points.
Consciousness expands into a

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,940
deeper and broader universe, but
eventually the very concept of

23
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,060
death loses its meaning in this
respect.

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,560
Unknown: Yeah, yeah. It was two
ways I was going to go. Some

25
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,040
I'll come back. I'll come back
to the way I was going to go on

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:39,020
that the grueling impact of that
on like I spoke to somebody. And

27
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,140
in a way, it's existential. It
can be existentially violent, a

28
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,780
psychedelic experience. Yes, is,
and there's moments. I mean, I

29
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,440
think that's a good it's a good
description, existentially

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:04,500
violent, and what's like, and
that, I don't think also, that

31
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,620
you ever get comfortable. It's
not like you suddenly go, Okay,

32
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,880
I've done 50, and this is going
to be no problem, because

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,800
there's bigger levels. Is that
fair to

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Chris Bache: say? And that I
thought that you would go

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,060
through a period of, you know,
Death-Rebirth and purging and

36
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,240
whatnot, and you would get to a
stable place, and all all

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,260
entries from that point on would
be clearer and easier. I found

38
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,160
that that's not true, that the
in the universe is infinitely

39
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,060
deep with an infinite number of
levels, and as long as you keep

40
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,340
pushing the outer edges of your
experience, if you're willing to

41
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,940
go farther, the universe will
keep taking you in deeper, and

42
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,900
it always will require some deep
surrender, some death and

43
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,780
rebirth process, to move deeper
into it.

44
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,800
Unknown: And would you when you
say, universe, what? What do

45
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,480
you? What's that to you? What
does what's that word mean to

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:00,780
you?

47
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,279
Chris Bache: Yeah. Well, my
experience is, of course, when

48
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:09,059
you let go of consciousness at
the physical level, you enter

49
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:13,319
into a deeper dimension of
consciousness, and then later is

50
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,799
still a deeper dimension, and
still a deeper dimension. And

51
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,859
it's all coherent from top to
bottom, and it is all

52
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,019
fundamentally unified. For me,
it never took a face. It never

53
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:28,519
showed an identity as such. It
was always open ended and

54
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:34,699
perpetually fluid and invisible
and yet very deeply felt. So

55
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:39,559
what do we call this thing? What
do we call this consciousness,

56
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:43,599
which we dissolve into its
successive levels. Some might

57
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,079
call it the infinite, the
absolute. I call it both of

58
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,999
those things. I call it the
creative intelligence of the

59
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,319
universe. It feels to be the
creative intelligence that's

60
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,659
inside the universe and behind
the universe. Different. Aspects

61
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:07,079
coming forward at different
times. In the end, in my heart

62
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,999
of hearts, I call it my beloved
because you do once you enter

63
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:15,479
into it, once you dissolve into
it, once you recover your true

64
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,739
identity within its identity,
then it opens up dimensions of

65
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:26,299
love within you, and it pours
dimensions of love within you

66
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:30,859
that it becomes my beloved.
Sometimes I call it the great

67
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:37,459
expanse, something to suggest
the vastness, its vastness, its

68
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:42,279
power, its creativity, its
intelligence, and of course,

69
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:46,539
since compassion is a mark of
oneness, it's inherent oneness,

70
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:51,459
so that compassion is a
spontaneous manifestation of its

71
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,659
innate oneness.

72
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:01,080
Unknown: Yeah, it's funny. I
think you called it some an

73
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,980
Indian guru who used the word
the beloved, and was the guy in

74
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,820
England. He would refer to
oneness. So he would refer to

75
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,200
the Beloved. Tony Parsons talk
about unconditional love, that

76
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,000
that it's but not the love that
we would know it's, it's love

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,060
beyond conditions beyond it's
not a personal it's the

78
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,460
allowance of all things. Yeah,

79
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,340
Chris Bache: it's, it's a deeper
love than human love, but I

80
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,080
think it is alive in the best of
us when we experience love. But

81
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,500
it is, it is, it's a radical
love. It's a It's the love that

82
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,160
the Dao has for the 10,000
things. You know, it's it is the

83
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,480
love that being has for its own
self, for its own being.

84
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,800
Because, in the end, from its
perspective, all of us and all

85
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,840
of creation is a manifestation
of its being. So how could it

86
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,220
not love itself? And therefore,
how could it not love us?

87
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,840
Unknown: So let's see, can we go
to go this route and see where

88
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:19,860
it goes? Say the idea of my
beloved and its Who do you think

89
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,380
is describing when you say it's
my who is describing the

90
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,100
beloved? You know this sort of
perspective? Because there is a

91
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,020
perspective that it cannot see
itself, only in reflections, and

92
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,460
it because it is already what's
happening. The Beloved is

93
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,040
already what's happening there.
Yeah, it can't. It can only ever

94
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,900
appear as, yeah, you know where
I'm going with that. Or do you

95
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,100
have your sense? Yeah, I do.
It's very hard to objectify, in

96
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,460
a way, when that objectifying is
almost what is a part of the

97
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,280
Beloved. Is a happening already.
It's fresh already. Yeah, it's

98
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,500
already complete. In other
words, what you're saying there,

99
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,560
whilst we're kind of talking
about experience that you've had

100
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,440
and you've written a book, it's
it gives the impression of being

101
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,020
Once removed, but obviously it's
a part already.

102
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,120
Chris Bache: Yeah, you know, we
have all sorts of ideas and

103
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,760
stories we tell ourselves about
what this totality consciousness

104
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,780
is and isn't, and what it can
know and can't know. And I think

105
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,000
a lot of that is just cultural
scripting. It's our best guess.

106
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,440
It's our best cultural guess,
and our best cultural guess is

107
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,180
not very old. At this juncture,
we've been kind of making these

108
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:45,400
metaphysical guesses or
intuitions for 5000 years, but

109
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,560
this intelligence is 13.7 plus
billion years in the making and

110
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,640
unfolding, and we're just kind
of getting to the stop place in

111
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,860
our evolution where we can
really begin to engage it. So my

112
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,360
sense is I don't know whether
this intelligence is not self

113
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,580
aware, except through us that
seems kind of outrageously, puts

114
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,580
enormous privilege of place on
us as to be the mirror of the

115
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,200
Divine Eye. Why should we assume
that this intelligence is not

116
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,400
self aware as it unfolds itself
with seeming pointed accuracy

117
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,680
through time and space. So what
I can say it is this, when I

118
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,940
lose my boundaries as Chris
Bache, while I allow myself to

119
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,780
dissolve as Chris Bache and
enter into these deeper layers,

120
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,460
there's many, many layers of
this phenomenon. So some of the

121
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,780
early layers have to do with my
species consciousness, the mind

122
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,020
of the collective unconscious,
the mind of my species. Other

123
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,200
layers have to do with the mind
of our planet, Gaia

124
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,560
consciousness. And there are
multiple layers going right

125
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,140
through species mind, the
archetypal. Line archetypal

126
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,560
dimensions, the root causes of
some of the patterns inside time

127
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,940
and space, the root cause even
of time and space itself, moving

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,800
even deeper into dimensions of
oneness, permutations of

129
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,100
oneness, even entering into the
primal void that appears to be

130
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,720
the formlessness out of which
all form emerges with the Big

131
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,760
Bang and subsequently and then
entering beyond even that. And

132
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,560
at each level of entry, entering
into clear and clearer and

133
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,720
clearer states of being, states
of awareness. Now, yeah, that

134
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:50,020
and so it's hard for me to
imagine that the being or

135
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,580
dimension of being that I have
been in it for hours at a time,

136
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:01,140
would not also be self aware in
its unfolding. Now it's also

137
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,040
been the case that I've had the
experience that this creative

138
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,060
intelligence, or an aspect of
creative intelligence, met me in

139
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,080
my sessions, took me on a cosmic
tour, you know, in that chapter

140
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,740
initiation in the universe, and
it seemed to want to show me its

141
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,840
work. It seemed especially
pleased to have evolved

142
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,260
consciousness to the point where
some of that consciousness could

143
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,160
come back and be shown what has
actually been being worked on

144
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,380
for billions and billions of
years. So it seems to delight in

145
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,760
being known. But I wouldn't say
necessarily that it didn't know

146
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,880
itself before I knew it. You
know what? I mean. Yeah.

147
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,440
Unknown: And did you get a sense
of, do you still have a sense of

148
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,740
the despite having spent so much
time that, in a way, you're

149
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,440
still only it's impossible. It's
so the vastness, the extra, the

150
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,180
still scraping the surface the
enormity of the all of

151
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,720
everything.

152
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,700
Chris Bache: So this was a major
change in my thinking. It took

153
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,260
place in the 50th session. So So
my background is I did four

154
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,520
years of work. I stopped for six
years, and then I did 10 years

155
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:24,080
of work. So 14 years of active
work over 20 years. But when I

156
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,760
was entering into the last five
years of work, or those years of

157
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,620
what I call the diamond
Luminosity work, and this was 26

158
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,280
sessions out of 26 sessions,
that's about a third of all the

159
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,400
sessions in the book. Four of
those sessions took me into this

160
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,140
diamond Luminosity, an
unbelievably beautiful,

161
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,620
ecstatic, empty consciousness
that was just clear, just clear

162
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,940
beyond imagination, just so
clear, so hyper clear that once

163
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,920
you touch it, nothing else
matters except returning to it.

164
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,580
Nothing else I had entered in
earlier stages mattered in the

165
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,320
least compared to connecting
with this. And this is what the

166
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,520
Buddhists call, I think the
closest thing I could find is

167
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,280
what they call Dharmakaya. You
know, they have three

168
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,280
dimensions, or three modalities
of existence, Dharmakaya,

169
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,800
sambhogakaya and nirvanakaya,
Dharmakaya being the deepest and

170
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,180
Dharmakaya the absolute, the
light of the clear light of

171
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,260
absolute reality, just kind of
the light out of which existence

172
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:39,140
emerges. I'm sorry I got so
involved in the description. I

173
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,100
lost track with the the the
original question focus.

174
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,960
Unknown: Well, I think I know
where you're going though,

175
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,620
because we were talking about
the vastness and scraping the

176
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,600
surface, and you said,

177
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,559
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah. So I
was 50 sessions in. I was in the

178
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,359
second of the four diamond
Luminosity sessions. I was as

179
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:03,779
deep into ecstatic diamond
consciousness as I had ever gone

180
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,219
and would ever go, it was the
deepest penetration in that way.

181
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,239
And toward the end of the
session, I had this experience

182
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:17,879
where my visual feel flipped 90
degrees. A huge space opened up.

183
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:22,039
And beyond where I was there was
another reality, worlds upon

184
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:25,939
worlds beyond me. And there was
a light there, and a beam of

185
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:31,219
this light hit me, and it
shattered me. And I called the

186
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:34,099
light the absolute light, just
to give it a differentiating

187
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:38,299
name from the diamond Luminosity
light. But what it showed me was

188
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:43,059
that there were worlds and
worlds beyond where I was, as

189
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:46,779
far beyond where I was as the
diamond Luminosity was beyond

190
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:52,419
time and space. So that told me
that an idea that I had taken

191
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:55,299
into this work, that the purpose
of this work was to get to an

192
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,919
end point, an end stage, a
destination to go home some.

193
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:05,219
Thing like this, that that was
just not an accurate assumption.

194
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,959
You do repeatedly have a sense
of going home. You do enter into

195
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:14,879
deep, deep experiences of
Homecoming. And for me, the

196
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,159
diamond Luminosity was my actual
practical destination. I did not

197
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,459
go deeper than that. It totally
satisfied me in all respects. I

198
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,479
continued to do the session
work, but for the next 23

199
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,139
sessions, it wasn't going deeper
into the diamond Luminosity, but

200
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:37,579
it was internalizing diamond
Luminosity, soaking deeper and

201
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:41,919
deeper into my physical and
psychological being. But it's,

202
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,659
it's an infinite ocean, and I
don't, I gave up completely the

203
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,459
idea of ever getting to the end
of it. I.

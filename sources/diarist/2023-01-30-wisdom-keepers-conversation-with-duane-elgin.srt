1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,280
Bas de Cock: Thank you all for
joining. I will give a short

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,000
outline of tonight that you know
we have two and a half hours

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,140
together, which is a great
amount of time, and you will see

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,980
the time will pass as fast as
you entered now. So tonight, we

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,765
start with an achievement and
meditation to just settle in

6
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:31,605
with the theme we, yeah, we just
program for this, for this

7
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:35,925
wisdom, keep us gathering. And
of course, we're gonna, we're

8
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:41,385
gonna look ahead to the upcoming
hour to hour and a half with

9
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:46,830
Chris and Duane. So what are
their backgrounds and why

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,390
they're here? And you're gonna
see they're coming from two

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,450
different angles, two different
perspective, two different

12
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,070
paradigms, I would say. And this
is a beautiful dance we're going

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,630
to encounter. What are the
possibilities, especially

14
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,655
creating a new mindset as
humans, a mindset of the whole

15
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:18,075
universe. Because it's not about
the technological evolution of

16
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:22,695
the world leaders. You're going
to create a diminishing of

17
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:26,415
greenhouse gasses. You're going
to drive your electric car.

18
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:31,935
You're going to put more trees
in the ground. You are more kind

19
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:35,700
to your neighbors, where that's
the start, where the mindset

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,520
starts. And after an hour and a
half a dance with Chris and

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,960
Duane sounds like music in my
ears. We have the last 45

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,080
minutes, half an hour, to look
ahead for creating more circles

23
00:01:56,025 --> 00:02:01,125
as a as a community, as a human
family, to create and to

24
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:06,165
practice this new mindset. So
we're gonna we're gonna guide

25
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:11,385
you through this step by step,
and please sit in your

26
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:18,405
comfortable chair. Have a good
evening. And before we start, I

27
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:25,650
would like you to close your
eyes, trust us as hosts, we're

28
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:33,990
good people. We came with a good
mission. And ask you the

29
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:40,590
question, so why are you here
tonight? What's your real

30
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:49,515
intention of your presence
during this gathering with

31
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:52,995
Dwayne Chris and all this human
family.

32
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,140
Are you here out of curiosity?
Are you here to learn? Are you

33
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,100
here to thrive?

34
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,520
Whatever your attention is
doesn't matter or really sense,

35
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,412
the reason why you're here
that's already in here in this

36
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:24,952
moment,

37
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:39,352
visualize your intention for
this evening as if

38
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:41,860
Unknown: it's the present time.

39
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,080
Bas de Cock: What's your
contribution to this beautiful

40
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,040
world we're living in.

41
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,300
What do you sense from your
core, from your heart, why

42
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:19,140
you're here to contribute as a
whole, as a whole human family?

43
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:29,932
And if you have a

44
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:42,280
deeper understanding why you
contributed tonight, then try to

45
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,260
remember this for the rest of
the evening,

46
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:54,040
and please feel guided from a
meditation we're going to start

47
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,460
now.

48
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,920
And before we start this
meditation, take some deep

49
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
breaths,

50
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
just to settle in to

51
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,560
you allow yourself to open up to
this visualization. I'm going to

52
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,460
guide it now for you

53
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:48,920
sense that you are floating. In
a galaxy, and you have a clear

54
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,340
and bright view on Mother Earth,
it

55
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,620
Unknown: feels at home

56
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,680
Bas de Cock: floating in this
universe and seeing our common

57
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,300
ground, Mother Earth,

58
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,520
you Feel at peace and deeply
connected to this beautiful

59
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,240
planet in a sky full of stars,

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,140
you can deeply feel you made
this journey before, And now you

61
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:45,880
feel so grateful to see Planet
Earth from this perspective

62
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,360
again,

63
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,960
Unknown: excitement,

64
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:01,860
Bas de Cock: ecstasy And tears
of joy are felt over in this

65
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,720
privacy present moment,

66
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:15,060
you feel a pool of Mother Earth
pulling you towards her body,

67
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,240
and

68
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,620
you can sharply feel and see all
the continents and the oceans of

69
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,740
Mother Earth coming into your
view,

70
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,460
pulled more closely, you have a
clear view on your own

71
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,240
continent.

72
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:55,180
You see your country, where you
live, you see more sharply your

73
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,140
province,

74
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:05,460
and you zoomed in to your own
city. You can feel your

75
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:11,220
neighborhood, your neighborhood,
you know so well,

76
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:26,120
instantly you see your house.
And the interiors of your house,

77
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,800
the inside the furniture, and
you see your loved ones sitting

78
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,600
in your beautiful house.

79
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:48,460
And then you sense your back in
your body. You can feel your

80
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,060
skin.

81
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,020
You can feel your organs. You're
in your bones. You are aware of

82
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,740
your breath.

83
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:13,140
You are aware of the heartbeat
of your beautiful heart, you

84
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:22,820
feel instantly at home, the same
feeling when you watched Mother

85
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,860
Earth From above,

86
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,700
Unknown: what a journey, a
journey

87
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,280
Bas de Cock: from beyond. You

88
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,020
Unknown: nothing lasts forever.
No one lives forever. You. A

89
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,180
flower that fades and dies,
winter passes and spring comes

90
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,560
embrace the cycle of life that
is the greatest love.

91
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:24,200
Go beyond fear. Go beyond fear.
Beyond fear takes you into the

92
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,300
place where love grows

93
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,260
when you refuse to follow the
impulses of fear, anger and

94
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:41,980
revenge beyond means to feel
yourself start every day singing

95
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:50,440
like the birds. Singing takes
you beyond, beyond, beyond

96
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:01,140
beyond. We need a repeated
discipline, a genuine training

97
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:09,000
to let go our old habits of mind
and to find and sustain a new

98
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,800
way of seeing go beyond the
rights and the wrongs. Prayer

99
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,320
clears the head and brings back
peace to the soul. Go beyond to

100
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,880
feel the oneness of the unity.

101
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:40,420
Sing, singing, take you beyond.
Beyond. Go beyond.

102
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,900
We are all the same, all the
same, looking to find our way

103
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:57,040
back to the source, to the one,
to the only one. Go beyond

104
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,660
revenge. Greatest moment in our
lives is when we allow us to

105
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:11,220
teach each other go beyond, to
feel the oneness of the unity

106
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,300
singing. Singing takes you
beyond, beyond, beyond. Beyond.

107
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:32,360
Take the journey. Take the
journey inside of you, to become

108
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,060
quiet, to hear the beyond,

109
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,300
to become patient, to receive
the beyond, to become open, to

110
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,240
invite the Beyond and be
grateful. Be grateful, to allow

111
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,960
the beyond be in the present
moment, to live in the beyond.

112
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,380
Start every day, singing like
the birds, singing takes you

113
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:10,980
beyond, beyond, beyond. What
does love have to do with it?

114
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,120
Love grows when you trust, when
you trust, love heals and

115
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,680
renews. Love inspires and
empowers us to do great things

116
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,500
and makes us a better person to
love. Love makes us feel safe

117
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,000
and brings us closer to God.

118
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
When you go beyond,

119
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,520
is where you find True Love.

120
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,280
Keep singing. Singing takes you
beyond. Beyond.

121
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,760
Bas de Cock: You make connection
to your breath again, deep in

122
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,720
your breath,

123
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,940
and take your own time to open
up your eyes and going external

124
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,740
to all people who joined this
gathering, feel free to make

125
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,880
some contact with the people.
Look at the thumbnails the faces

126
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,720
and before we gonna introduce
Chris and Dewayne, I want to

127
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:55,240
thank you for all the donations.
There are a beautiful amount of

128
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,920
the donations done as a gift for
the choosing life project and.

129
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,180
We're gonna hear, hear more
about it from from Dwayne, I

130
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,940
think so. Thank you for that.
And I also want to take a moment

131
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:16,680
to introduce mayo, my co host
during the wisdom keepers every

132
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,500
month. And I want to say that
also Melanie is one of the

133
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,660
hosts, but she can't contribute
tonight because she has a course

134
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,800
running. So mayo, before we go
to Dwayne and Chris and we're

135
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,060
going to open up, please feel
free to share something from

136
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:45,280
your side. Dwayne, your
microphone is still off,

137
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,900
Unknown: everyone. Thank you so
much for taking the time, for

138
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,520
being here with us. Can you hear
me now?

139
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,100
Bas de Cock: Fantastic.

140
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,600
Unknown: It is so important to
have these conversations within

141
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,040
ourselves, but imagine the power
of sharing our ideas and

142
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,360
connecting from a human stance.
And these conversations,

143
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,080
although they're mediated
through this platform, right a

144
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,520
technology that is provided us
the sense of community, even

145
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,500
though we may be continents away
or as bosses, beautiful

146
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,980
depiction of our neighborhood,
in our house and wherever we may

147
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,440
be, this what we are doing and
what we just did through that

148
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,780
guided meditation is truly
beyond it is combining our

149
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,980
energies into one essence, into
this consciousness. So it is so

150
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,360
important to have this meeting,
to have more conversations in

151
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,200
your neighborhoods with those
around you, so you can share

152
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,820
your reality and how we can co
create that reality together. So

153
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,460
thank you so much for being
here. We look forward to growing

154
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,320
with you, to having perhaps a
meeting that is face to face one

155
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,200
day a wisdom keepers face to
face. But for now, let's sit

156
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,260
tight and enjoy the ride.
Tonight's competitions are going

157
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,960
to be very much expanding our
universe into what we can do as

158
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,800
human beings here, now and
today, so that we can come

159
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,920
together as one species in order
for us to thrive as a whole. So

160
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,900
thank you so much for being here
taking the time.

161
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,359
Thank you, Maya.

162
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,879
Bas de Cock: Yes, before we
gonna start with Chris and

163
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:34,759
Duane, and we're gonna introduce
them, of course, and I'm gonna

164
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:40,179
also highlight why we are here
together, also with Chris and

165
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:46,359
Dwayne, I invite you if you have
the feeling you want to write

166
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:49,959
something down, something like a
question, something like

167
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,719
something coming up, an emotion,
or something you feel in your

168
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:56,379
system, you want to write it
down. Feel comfortable to do so.

169
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:02,639
It's handy. The second part of
the wisdom keepers gathering,

170
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,719
that we have a Q, a and a
sharing part, where these things

171
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:11,579
can be shared, and feel open to
do so, and feel that this

172
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:15,719
environment is reliable and you
can trust this environment. So

173
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,859
we're here with a good heart.
That's what I want to say. We

174
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,299
were going to see if we're going
to use a whiteboard to share all

175
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:28,099
our information or to have more,
like an integration of the

176
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:32,239
things coming up, and we're just
going to feel organically if

177
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:35,239
this is going to happen. So if
I'm going to show up a

178
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,359
whiteboard, I'm going to explain
how we're going to use the

179
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:47,799
whiteboard, but we're going to
see, okay, before this idea of

180
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:54,399
asking initially, Chris and
afterwards, Dwayne came up as

181
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:59,739
well, in my mind, in our minds,
and It's, it's a beautiful

182
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:04,079
coincidence, they're both at
this gathering, and would like

183
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,539
to introduce them, both from
from the heart and from

184
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,019
perspective, but I want to say
something personal, because

185
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:17,939
since I started, I'm a
background medical doctor, an

186
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:22,819
ENT doctor, trained an ENT
doctor, and then I'm more like

187
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:27,559
opening up, which is, I think,
more like a calling into into

188
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,359
life, more in integrative
medicine. And now I'm into the

189
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:37,219
Grof legacy training for
Transpersonal psychology and

190
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:42,639
psychedelic therapy. And that's
where I met Chris. Chris, I was

191
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:46,899
at your beautiful course from
the shift network, LSD in the

192
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:52,419
mind of universe, and it opened
something up about how we going

193
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:55,479
to take care of this planet and
of this universe, because it's

194
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:02,039
all integrated and it's all it's
a one life. System, or one whole

195
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:06,419
world system. So that's thank
you for that. That's what I want

196
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,639
to share personally, and it
until now and after my own

197
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:15,419
psychedelic experiences, it's
getting deeper and deeper, and

198
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,979
feels like we're creating a
tribe where these important

199
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:23,179
things can be shared, but it's
creating a mind shift by itself.

200
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,979
So thank you for that, and maybe
it's it's beautiful to start

201
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:33,799
with you, Chris, because the
initial outreach was via email

202
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,239
to you, and then Dewayne came
in, Chris, you're a professor

203
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:42,939
emeritus in the department of
philosophy and religious study,

204
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:47,739
and you're specialized in
Buddhistic studies of the

205
00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:51,879
Youngstown State University. But
you're also related to the

206
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:57,699
California Institute of integral
studies and also in the Advisory

207
00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:02,459
Council of my training, Grof
legacy training. And then you're

208
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:05,759
also related to the Institute of
Noetic Sciences. So you're

209
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:11,459
you're not retired or emeritus
professor at all. You're full

210
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,499
alive and contributing to the
mind shift which is which is

211
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:21,859
happening. You're an author of
several books, the latest. It's

212
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:26,719
on my desk every day. And I
would really recommend, if

213
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:30,919
you're not in LSD, or you're not
in psychedelics, you have to

214
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,999
read it because it's it's very
much important information,

215
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:38,059
which is in the book. You wrote,
several books, I'm not going to

216
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:40,839
highlight them all, but LSD, in
the mind of the universe, your

217
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,439
latest book, and for me, was
transformative. So thank you for

218
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:50,439
that. And in this book, you
described your empirical

219
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,499
research. You did it on your own
with your former wife, with 76

220
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:03,539
deep, high dose LSD sessions in
which you entered the non other

221
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,279
narrative states of
consciousness and you

222
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:12,179
encountered a vision of our
impending global crisis and also

223
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:16,919
the birth of the future human.
So these visions are of

224
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:23,239
importance, because this come
from a field which we are not so

225
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:26,419
much aware of. This is beautiful
information. So thank you for

226
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:30,559
being here, and thank you for
contributing to to this gallery.

227
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:40,759
It's a pleasure to be here boss
and then Dwayne during the

228
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,999
course of Chris LSD, in the mind
of the universe, you already

229
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:50,139
mentioned Chris Dwayne's work,
and after the course, I went

230
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:56,199
through it. And your last book,
Dwayne choosing Earth, was mind

231
00:22:56,199 --> 00:23:00,359
blowing for me. It's so full of
information. And you're an

232
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:03,719
author of several books which
are all important for us humans,

233
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:08,579
but choosing Earth. And you can
find in the chat box already the

234
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,179
link to choosing Earth website
and also the book, and you can

235
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,079
just download it by PDF. So
thank you for that, and thank

236
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,739
you for opening up Dwayne in the
early 70s. You worked as a

237
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:26,179
senior staff of the member of
the Presidential congressional

238
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:36,919
commission on the American
future of Yeah, of the last 30

239
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:43,659
years of the last century. So
the 70s until 2000 an important

240
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:49,179
position. And you were also
acknowledged for this deep work

241
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,039
as a social visionary exploring
the deeper trends that are

242
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:57,939
transforming our world. And you
were recognized for this for an

243
00:23:57,939 --> 00:24:02,639
international award, a Peace
Award, a recognition of this,

244
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:06,299
this global vision and
consciousness of lifestyle that

245
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:10,139
contributes to a more
sustainable and spiritual

246
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:17,759
culture. So it's an honor having
you here. I would like to open

247
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:24,079
up the field for you both to
start with our Yeah, main

248
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,899
question of the evening, how can
we create, as humans, a new

249
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:37,219
mindset, which transforms our
global crisis? Or can we, can we

250
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,959
transform the global crisis? Or
have, do we have to go through

251
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:45,579
it with a new mindset. So can we
start from there, and then we'll

252
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:49,599
see how the dance will evolve.
Thank you for being here. You

253
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,019
both.

254
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,000
Chris Bache: It's a pleasure to
be here, everyone. Baz, thank

255
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,680
you for the invitation. You hear
my voice is a little rough. I've

256
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,840
just. Him down with the cold. I
wouldn't have canceled, except

257
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,380
this material is just too
important to let go of the

258
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,180
opportunity to talk about and I
wouldn't pass up an opportunity

259
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,100
to talk with Dwayne. I'd have to
be near dead to pass up this

260
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:23,300
opportunity. We've been friends
for over 20 years, 25 years now,

261
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,220
and it was first our research
and our writing which brought us

262
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,520
together, but then, as we got to
know each other personally and

263
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,920
understood the human being
behind the research, the

264
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,620
friendship has just deepened
into a deep, lifelong

265
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:42,340
brotherhood. Now, how Duane and
I have thought about today is

266
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,420
basically, first of all, I want
to say a talk is just an

267
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,660
opportunity to get to the Q and
A, because the Q and A is where

268
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,540
the juice really is. And I'm
really looking forward to that

269
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,000
that part of our discussion. And
I know Dwayne is too, but in

270
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,460
terms of the talk, we see this
is basically a conversation, an

271
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,080
opportunity for Duane and I just
to sink into conversation and

272
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,200
have the kind of conversation
that we have sometimes when we

273
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:17,760
get together. And so I thought
we might begin by just kind of

274
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,020
affirming some common ground
that Dwayne and I share first,

275
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,260
I'm a philosopher of religion.
I've been an academic all my

276
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:30,860
life in Northeast Ohio. Duane is
a social activist, a visionary

277
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,240
social activist. We've both
written books. We've both been

278
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,660
completely committed to our
lives project, and we both share

279
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,760
coming at it through overlapping
means. We both share, I think, a

280
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,000
common vision of the universe
that can be reached

281
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,560
intellectually and can be
reached experientially. And that

282
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,280
is a vision of the universe that
is saturated with intelligence,

283
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,160
orders and orders and orders of
intelligence, and also the

284
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,020
intelligence behind the manifest
universe, the intelligence out

285
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,860
of which the universe sprang in
the Big Bang and continues to

286
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,760
unfold and be nourished by this
fertile ground of existence.

287
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,320
This is Common Ground for Duane
and I also common ground is the

288
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,600
sense that our is our nature,
our consciousness. If you just

289
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,220
sit quietly, or if you amplify
consciousness, if you sink into

290
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,300
consciousness, you sink into
your personal unconsciousness.

291
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,880
And then you sink into what Jung
called the collective

292
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,620
unconscious. And if you just
keep going, you sink eventually

293
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,060
into a level, levels of
consciousness so deep they go

294
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,620
beyond the species. They go
beyond time and space, and one

295
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,600
can enter into deep communion
with, I think, what both of us

296
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,620
think of as the mind of the
universe, both the manifest

297
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:02,760
universe and the universe behind
the manifest universe. And Dean

298
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,580
and I both share the conviction
that this intelligence is

299
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,020
profoundly wise. He asked me,
before we got started, how would

300
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,680
you describe the IQ of the
universe? Boy, that was that

301
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,480
stumped me for a bit, and I had
to think in terms of an IQ on

302
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,800
order of millions and billions.
Because, I mean, look at this.

303
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,820
Is the intelligence which has
manifested everything we see

304
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,440
around us, as far as we can see
and as deep as we can see. How

305
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,140
could we possibly measure the
depth of that, of that

306
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,260
Bas de Cock: intelligence?

307
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,580
Chris Bache: And compassion, and
that's a kind of get to the

308
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,080
tricky point part, because it's
easy enough to see the the

309
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,320
intelligence. When we just look
at DNA and we look at the

310
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,420
structure of stars and galaxies,
we can see layers and layers of

311
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:05,100
intelligence manifesting, but
compassion on the surface, life

312
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,420
is hard. Life is and one could
easily conclude, and I

313
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,260
understand you could conclude,
that life is basically generated

314
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,120
by a mean son of a bitch. I
mean, it hurts us so much. It

315
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,480
just hurts so terribly. And in
order to see the wisdom of the

316
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,040
universe and to see the
compassion behind this, the hard

317
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,660
conditions in which we live, you
have to look very deep. You have

318
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,080
to look much deeper than sensory
consciousness. You have to much

319
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,160
deeper than the workings of the
personal and collective psyche.

320
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,280
You really must look very, very
deep, deeply. I think it was

321
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:52,000
Ramakrishna, when he was asked,
when he said, once, in order to

322
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,840
see God, you must be willing to
look evil in the face, and in

323
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,340
order to see the wisdom. Wisdom
of the universe, you must be

324
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,980
willing to sit deeply with the
pain of existence. And there's

325
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,720
nothing Dwayne or I will say
today that would dilute, set

326
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:21,680
aside sublimate, or in any way
sidestep the deep suffering that

327
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,080
it takes to live fully an
embodied, spiritual existence,

328
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:34,520
right? So this is just a warm up
exercise, and I want to do is

329
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,060
toss it to Dwayne, and we're
going to toss it back and forth,

330
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,100
and then we're going to move
towards this topic of the times

331
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,180
that we're living in, the
crisis, that we are coming into

332
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,860
the depth of that crisis, and
what we might do to move through

333
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:00,960
this crisis with courage and to
actually accelerate our way

334
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,200
through it, so we can get
through it with in with

335
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,920
intelligence and with compassion
and exploring what the universe

336
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,840
wants of humanity at this hour,
what humanity what the universe

337
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,200
is inviting humanity to become.
Because both of us share the

338
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,580
vision that we are coming to a
trigger point, a triggering

339
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,720
point. We are coming to a
bifurcation point where humanity

340
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,100
either makes the next step in
its long evolutionary journey,

341
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,440
or we probably go extinct
because we can't survive on this

342
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,120
planet in these conditions,
staying at the level of

343
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,080
consciousness that has brought
us here. We either grow up, as

344
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,780
Dwayne says, or we die, and that
means this extinction or

345
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,320
potential extinction, is an
enormous evolutionary

346
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,240
accelerator. So with that, let
me hand it over to my brother,

347
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,660
Dwayne.

348
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,860
Duane Elgin: Thank you, brother,
Chris. Chris is one of my

349
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,500
dearest, dearest brothers and
friends, and I am so grateful

350
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,260
for the lifelong the journey
that we have shared with our

351
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,800
mutual interest depth looking at
the nature of the universe and

352
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,240
where that is leading us as we
move into this dangerous and

353
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,120
transformative time for humanity
and creative time and the

354
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:39,980
passions that are present are
really compassions. The presence

355
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,680
of suffering in the world as a
catalyst for our pushing back on

356
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,180
ourselves and awakening freshly
to where we are and where we

357
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:56,140
might be going from here. So I
appreciated boss saying that he

358
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,080
was a doctor by training, and
early on in my life I was going

359
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,020
to become a doctor, but I
encountered the violence of the

360
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,060
Vietnam era, and I shifted over
a period of time, from physical

361
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:18,000
healing to now social healing,
and that's one theme I would

362
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,460
really like To explore, and
underneath the social healing is

363
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,780
our connection with the
aliveness of a living universe.

364
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,680
And that is where Chris and I
have found common ground and

365
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:36,200
common passion in our mutual
explorations of that

366
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,100
possibility, that reality. So
let's, let's begin.

367
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,980
Chris Bache: Chris, right. Where
do you want to start? Dig in?

368
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,880
Duane Elgin: Well, I think it's
important just to acknowledge

369
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,840
where we are right now, that the
crisis of transition isn't

370
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,880
something that's in the future.
It is happening right now. The

371
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:04,200
head of the United Nations
recently said, humanity is on a

372
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,760
climate Highway to Hell. We're
on a climate Highway to Hell,

373
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,700
and that's just looking at the
climate crisis. We're also on a

374
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:21,440
an extraordinary path of
extincting a huge proportion of

375
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,780
the plant and animal species on
this earth. It's estimated by

376
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,980
the end of this century, a
million species, different

377
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,480
species, a million species will
be extinct. We're impoverishing

378
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,600
the earth right now. It's
extraordinary. We're also in a

379
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,280
time of overshoot, we're way
overshooting the resource base

380
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,720
of the earth. We can't continue
as we have. It's estimated that

381
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:55,240
the earth will carry roughly 2
billion people into the far

382
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,660
future, and right now, we have 8
billion people. So if we. We

383
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,440
take that to heart. It means
that we're roughly 6 billion

384
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,920
people over the carrying
capacity of the earth. And so we

385
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,860
are in for a rough ride, a rough
initiation, if you will, moving

386
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,980
from our current condition of
overshoot and collapse, the

387
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,780
extinction of species, the
climate catastrophe, resource

388
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,520
depletion and all the rest, and
come to some new healing and

389
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,740
some new healthy relationship
with the earth and and our

390
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,780
ability to live into the far
future.

391
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:38,179
Chris Bache: So that's a Yeah.
Let me ask you a question that I

392
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:41,559
know is on people's mind, and I
know your answer to it, I

393
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:46,299
suspect. But the question is
this, can we avoid this crisis

394
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:50,139
now, if we really get off our
butt and mobilize, can we stop

395
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:53,919
what's happening and bring this
under control? What do you

396
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,339
think?

397
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,960
Duane Elgin: No, it's too late.
Had we started a half century

398
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,880
ago when I began my research on
all of this, in the early 1970s

399
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,620
there was an opportunity that
time to pull back, take a look

400
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,940
at where we were headed, and
choose a new pathway. But we

401
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,720
have used up that half century
to just consume ourselves into a

402
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,120
corner, if you will. And so now
we're up against it, and we do

403
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,600
have the forces, the factors
that I was just mentioning,

404
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,680
overshoot of the Earth's
resource base, a climate

405
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,980
catastrophe that's growing,
species being extincted at an

406
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,140
extraordinary rate, and so on
and so on. Now is the time for

407
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:47,740
our decision. Now is the time
for choice. And so this is where

408
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,660
we're looking at at this, not as
theoretically in the far future,

409
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,560
but as right now we're up
against it and and now is the

410
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,200
time for a new understanding of
who we are. Where are we? Who

411
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,980
are we? Where are we going from
here? Those are the core things

412
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,180
we need to begin digging into
now, not only philosophically,

413
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,520
but But practically,
realistically as a species. So

414
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,160
let's begin that inquiry.

415
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,840
Chris Bache: Yeah, so the depth
of destabilization that's coming

416
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,200
at us has already started. We
see a deep unraveling in many

417
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,280
areas of the social fabric. We
see our political discourse

418
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,180
becoming increasingly polarized.
We're moving in the direction of

419
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:38,000
fascism on one side,
totalitarianism on other sides,

420
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:45,280
repression of discourse, denial
of facts, of science, it's

421
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,580
getting harder and harder to
assume any kind of common

422
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,720
ground, which are all symptoms,
I think, of the fact that the

423
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,480
ground is shifting out from
underneath our feet. It's like

424
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,840
we're in a slow moving
earthquake that's building up

425
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,880
year by year, and it's just
shaking our systems to its

426
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,780
foundations. And if you're if
you just look at the research,

427
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,740
as Dwayne has done, and many of
you have done, if you look at

428
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,740
the research, you can just see
that the foundations of our

429
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,180
culture are just going are
shaking, beginning to shake more

430
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,160
and more, and we're going to
live through this, our

431
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,700
generation, my children's
generation, your children's

432
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,420
generation, your grandchildren's
generation. It will still be

433
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,340
deepening during these decades
ahead. It's hard to envision

434
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:40,540
just how bad it's going to get.
When I think about this, my

435
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,860
heart explodes with pain.
Everyone I sit with who really

436
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:50,800
looks hard at the data, their
heart explodes in pain, and they

437
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,640
would do anything to not have to
go through this. But this is

438
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,180
what we're this is what we're
going into and that means, I

439
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,868
think it's particularly
important that we understand

440
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:05,108
what is happening that because
if we don't understand this at a

441
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:07,628
deep structural level, if we
don't understand the

442
00:39:07,628 --> 00:39:10,868
evolutionary challenge that
we're facing, we're going to

443
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:16,928
give way to despair. We're going
to give way to theodicies, which

444
00:39:16,928 --> 00:39:21,200
are which are really deeply
demonic and problematic, we're

445
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,820
going to give way to political,
destructive philosophies. So we

446
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,520
have to understand this deeply.
Pass it to you, brother, yes.

447
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,840
Duane Elgin: Okay, here's what I
have encountered over the last,

448
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,200
oh, roughly 40 years speaking to
people around the Earth, and

449
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,060
often, before I give a talk, I
will ask an audience one simple

450
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:53,320
question. And the question is
this, if you look at the entire

451
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,360
human family and you look at our
behaviors, what is the life

452
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,760
stage of the human family? Being
expressed by those behaviors,

453
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,600
and I give the audience four
possibilities. One, that we're

454
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,800
behaving like toddlers. Two,
that we're behaving like

455
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,460
teenagers, like adolescents.
Three, that we're behaving like

456
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,320
early adults, and four, like
elders. Four possibilities,

457
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,680
toddlers, teenagers, adults or
elders. And I've asked this, and

458
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,080
I've been very surprised that
around the Earth, it doesn't

459
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,080
matter who I speak with. It
might be a church group, it

460
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,680
might be a college audience, it
might be a business community,

461
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,840
and so on. It doesn't matter.
One response comes back again

462
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,820
and again and again. Roughly
three quarters of every audience

463
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:47,500
I've spoken to over decades has
one response, and they say we're

464
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,120
behaving like adolescents and
like teenagers. There's no

465
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:57,940
hesitation regarding that, that
answer. And so if we are in our

466
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,880
adolescent stage as a species,
what will it take us to move

467
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,140
then into our early adulthood?
And in many ways, that's what

468
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,680
we're looking at right now, the
fire of initiation that will

469
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,660
push us into a new sense of
ourselves, a new sense of the

470
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,480
universe in which we live, and a
new sense, importantly, of the

471
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,140
evolutionary journey in which
we're involved. So that is one

472
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,360
key framing for me. It's that
we're in a rite of passage. It's

473
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,260
a time of initiation of our
species, and all the suffering,

474
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,680
all the pain that we're
experiencing right now as a part

475
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,940
of that pain that every
adolescent as an individual goes

476
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,260
through in different ways, but
nonetheless, we don't move into

477
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,100
early adulthood without going
through the fire of initiation.

478
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:57,640
And so Okay, let's accept that
that is how evolution works. We

479
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,700
are pushed outside of the nest
of our comfort zone and into

480
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,780
this transforming future, and
it's an extraordinary future

481
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,760
that lies before us, and without
a sense of where we might be

482
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,240
going, we're going to be
reluctant to go there. So one

483
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,840
thing that I appreciate about
Chris and his look at his

484
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:24,200
exploration of the birth of the
future human, and my own work,

485
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,160
that's what we're looking at.
What is the maturation of the

486
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,760
species, about where does that
take us in terms of our

487
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,300
relationship with the universe,
our relationship with other

488
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,240
humans, our relationship deeply
within ourselves? So that's a

489
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,180
conversation that Chris and I
have had again and again over

490
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,860
the years. So clear, Chris,

491
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,540
Chris Bache: your turn. Well, to
give a deeper context to

492
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,920
Dwayne's observations, I want to
point to his second book,

493
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,440
awakening Earth, where he
describes the the the stages of

494
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,880
human evolution in terms of the
conscious capacity, so the

495
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,840
levels of consciousness that
human beings have evolved over

496
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,400
our long evolutionary story. And
I think if I have this right,

497
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,560
Dewayne, you correct me. You say
in the book, and by the way, if

498
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,040
you get the book, read the book,
start at the Epilog. Read the

499
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,480
Epilog first and then read the
book, because the Epilog gives

500
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,940
you the experiential insight
into where the book came from.

501
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,940
But late in the book, he says we
could go through these last

502
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:41,080
three evolutionary stages in as
little as 500 years, and given

503
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,320
that we're talking about 10s and
hundreds of 1000s of years

504
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,960
leading up to that point we're
talking about that would

505
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,380
represent an enormous
acceleration, an exponential

506
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,120
acceleration, that we're
entering into so very intense,

507
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,620
but exponentially sped up. Yes,
Duane,

508
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:03,840
Duane Elgin: indeed, we're
moving into a time, obviously,

509
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,100
of intense compression. This is
going to be heated journey, a

510
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,660
heated compression of humanity
in the fire of initiation that

511
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,800
we're already beginning to
experience right now as we look

512
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,060
beyond our nation state
boundaries to the earth as a

513
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,900
whole system, and we're seeing
this will not hold this will not

514
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:30,260
carry us even to the end of this
century. So we are in

515
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,120
compression times, and we are
going to be pushed outside of

516
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:42,520
our usual circumstances and into
new conditions as a species, not

517
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,320
simply as nations, but as a
species as a whole. And that's

518
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,640
already beginning to happen
right now, and so that will be

519
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,700
the catalyst, I think, for rapid
acceleration of the evolutionary

520
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:02,580
potentials that are already so.
Surfacing, and this gathering is

521
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,900
one expression of that the role
of psychedelics, for example, in

522
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:13,080
being a catalyst for awakening
us to a new domain of

523
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,120
understanding of ourselves and
the human journey. So here we go

524
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,280
as a species, into the fire and
into the initiation and

525
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,800
hopefully into our higher
humanity.

526
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,460
Chris Bache: Yeah. And in that
context, I want to put on the

527
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,360
table one fundamental axiom of
my thought. I know Dwayne shares

528
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,120
this axiom, and I suspect
probably everyone in this group

529
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,500
does too, and that's the concept
of reincarnation. And so this

530
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:45,100
was my first book on which I
chose to write on reincarnation,

531
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,800
starting with the empirical
evidence, which I believe is

532
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,820
just overwhelming. And I came to
this conclusion as a philosopher

533
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:56,680
of religion. So when I look at
the world and I see human

534
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,920
beings, I don't see them the way
that most people see them. I

535
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,160
don't see old people as old
people and young people as young

536
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,920
people. I tend to see souls. And
there are old souls in small,

537
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,160
young bodies, and there are
young souls in old, withered

538
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,180
bodies. But the important key
here is understanding that

539
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,920
evolution, that reincarnation is
is a higher order of evolution.

540
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,180
It's one of the fundamental
truths of an self, manifesting,

541
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,960
self, evolving universe. And so
far, we've been telling the

542
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,020
story of of reincarnation,
saturated by the perspective of

543
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,520
theologies and philosophies
which have been individually

544
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,000
oriented. So we tell the story
of reincarnation terms of

545
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,660
individual evolution, the soul's
evolution over countless

546
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,800
lifetimes, the soul's awakening
eventually into individual

547
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,820
enlightenment, but it's
basically been strapped to a

548
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,400
metaphysics which focuses on
individual individual human

549
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,220
beings. And that's not that
that's false. I think that's

550
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,360
really true, but we're missing
something deeply if we think, if

551
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,580
we stop there, when we
understand that not just we and

552
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,240
everyone we see around us is
evolving, but every human being

553
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:23,840
on the planet is a reincarnating
essence, then we begin to

554
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,520
understand that reincarnation is
a collective driver. It is not

555
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,340
just an individual driver. It's
not just about personal

556
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,220
salvation or personal
transformation. It is an

557
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,840
evolutionary driver of the
highest magnitude. And I'll

558
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:44,740
shift just for a second and say,
if you ever read my book,

559
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,460
diamonds from heaven, or as the
publisher named it, LSD, in the

560
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,840
mind of the universe, there's a
section there where I report, I

561
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,160
record the experiences that kept
opening up and tearing me Open

562
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,340
and showing me the entire
universe, the entire species

563
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,220
pulsing in and out of time space
every 100 years or so, just the

564
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:13,260
entire species pulsing and
evolving together all of our

565
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,960
individual karmic agendas being
woven skillfully, intelligently

566
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,840
into a collective karmic agenda,
and the collective karmic agenda

567
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,980
be informing all of our
individual karmic agenda, so

568
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,820
that it became impossible to
separate the evolution of the

569
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,120
individual and the evolution of
the collective. And that became

570
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,380
one of the fundamental core
themes of my second book, dark

571
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,660
night, early dawn, where I'm
talking about the dark night out

572
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,020
of the individual soul of the
end of you know, the dark night

573
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,560
that the mystic goes through
before spiritual awakening, but

574
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,600
the dark night of our collective
soul. So that we I began to

575
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,380
understand from my sessions that
all of our individual work

576
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,840
serves not only our individual
development, but it also serves

577
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,460
directly, immediately, our
collective development. And

578
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:13,320
there are no such things as
personal problems which are not

579
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,400
also collective problems. Try
and think of one. Think of any

580
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,220
personal issue that we may be
dealing with, and try to find

581
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:27,800
one that isn't echoed or
reflective of a collective issue

582
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,300
in our culture. So I'll just
pause there. Hand it back to

583
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,060
you. Duane, Well, Chris,

584
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,059
Duane Elgin: Chris held up a
book or two. I, you know, I

585
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:44,799
can't let that just pass without
holding up one of my own and it

586
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:47,859
relates very directly to what
Chris is speaking about right

587
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:52,719
now that a reincarnational
perspective. How can that

588
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:57,279
happen? Well, here's a book that
I worked on for 30 years, the

589
00:49:57,279 --> 00:50:03,359
living universe, the. Universe,
according to modern science, and

590
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:07,019
I have encountered this so many
times, is it considered non

591
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:11,759
living at the foundations, dead
at the foundations. And as far

592
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:15,539
as modern consumer society is
concerned, it's all just dead

593
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:19,739
matter and empty space. And
people like Chris Bache come

594
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:23,599
along and they say, Wait a
minute. No, I've, I've explored

595
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,899
the deeper reaches of the
universe. It's a living system.

596
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:32,659
In that living system, life can
re connect with itself. It can

597
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:37,759
evolve with itself, and
reincarnation, then is is not

598
00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:43,179
losing the thread of our
existence as we move through

599
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:52,959
multiple cycles of life in this
larger aliveness. So we can,

600
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:56,799
after a bit, maybe begin to
explore the foundations of a

601
00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:01,979
living universe and that
perspective. But I want to give

602
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:05,759
Chris a chance to perhaps
integrate that connect the

603
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:10,079
Living Universe with the
evolution of life through that

604
00:51:10,259 --> 00:51:11,279
living system.

605
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:15,059
Chris Bache: Well, in that
context, I just want to sort of

606
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:20,779
say something which is hard and
consoling at the same time, and

607
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:24,679
that is from a reincarnation
perspective, we're always

608
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:29,239
popping into time space. And we
pop out of time space into a

609
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:34,099
spiritual meta universe. We pop
back into time space. We pop out

610
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:39,139
of time space. And from this
perspective, what is death? And

611
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,399
all of the Enlightenment
traditions, all of the you know

612
00:51:42,459 --> 00:51:45,999
the the awakening, spiritual
awakening traditions basically

613
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:51,039
say the same thing, birth is not
the beginning of our life. Look

614
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,419
carefully, and you will find in
your being, in your physical

615
00:51:55,419 --> 00:51:59,139
body and in your mind, the
evidence of a range of

616
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:04,919
experience that far predates
your physical body. Death is not

617
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:09,239
the end of our existence,
because we now, and particularly

618
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:12,779
if you study with people like
Michael Newton and his work in

619
00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:16,019
life, between life and past life
therapy, we have an abundance of

620
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:19,619
evidence that there is a
continuity of consciousness that

621
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:25,159
predates us and postdates our
individual life that we so when

622
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:29,839
we talk about the deaths that
are coming, I mean, we have to

623
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,619
really relate to it at two
levels, and both of them are

624
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:36,859
fundamentally true, and to
diminish either of them, I

625
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:40,279
think, would diminish the truth
of our situation. One of them is

626
00:52:40,939 --> 00:52:44,259
the death of a human being is a
painful, horrendous, terrible

627
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:49,599
experience. We are ending a life
cycle. Every death is the ending

628
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,179
of a precious cycle of life, and
that hurts like hell. And in

629
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:58,839
another perspective, we can also
say that in a deeper

630
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:04,499
perspective, no one dies, cycles
end, cycles begin, but the

631
00:53:04,499 --> 00:53:07,979
consciousness which is alive
within that organism, within

632
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:13,919
that being is not extinguished,
but simply paused. While we go

633
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:19,379
home, we recalibrate, refresh,
rejuvenate, and then we enter

634
00:53:19,379 --> 00:53:24,979
back into the fray. So this is,
on the one hand, consoling,

635
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:30,439
because it tells us that death
is not the end. On the other

636
00:53:30,439 --> 00:53:34,759
hand, if you look at it really
carefully, it means that this

637
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:40,099
pattern of leaving our loved
ones behind and coming back into

638
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:42,999
new configurations and leaving
and coming back into new

639
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:47,379
configurations, this very
difficult and demanding dynamic

640
00:53:47,439 --> 00:53:52,719
of constantly shredding, in some
ways, the social fabric, the

641
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,219
family fabric, our individual
fabric, is part of the ways that

642
00:53:57,279 --> 00:54:02,219
way that life works. We have to
look deeply to understand. And

643
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:05,879
when we look deeply, we begin to
sort of see that the universe

644
00:54:05,879 --> 00:54:09,779
thinks in very different terms,
and we do. It thinks on a time

645
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:14,399
frame much, much larger than we
do. It just thinks on a scale, a

646
00:54:14,399 --> 00:54:18,359
completely higher order of
scale. We have to learn to think

647
00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:21,979
as we have to learn to think
like a mountain. We have to

648
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:25,459
learn to think like the
universe. We have to learn to

649
00:54:25,459 --> 00:54:32,779
really kind of think large and
think deep and look at every

650
00:54:32,779 --> 00:54:40,099
human being we see as a precious
soul who is a companion on this

651
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:44,319
long journey, whatever our short
term relationship with them are

652
00:54:45,459 --> 00:54:50,559
underneath we stand together in
this long evolutionary

653
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,259
trajectory, working for the
collective good of our planet,

654
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:01,499
of an entire human family, and
if people. I don't have this

655
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:05,879
commitment to the human family
if they have only a commitment

656
00:55:05,879 --> 00:55:08,879
to their own personal life or
the even their own personal

657
00:55:08,879 --> 00:55:13,379
family. Understandable, but I
feel sorry for them at a deeper

658
00:55:13,379 --> 00:55:18,899
level, because to be committed
to something large is to is to

659
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:23,479
activate and to acknowledge that
in ourselves, which is large,

660
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,260
Bas de Cock: and therefore to be
committed

661
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,580
Chris Bache: to your species, to
be committed to your generation,

662
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,940
to be committed to the planet,
to be committed to the other

663
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:39,320
forms of life that share this
planet with us. These are an

664
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:46,180
expression of a maturing soul. A
young soul is small, right? A

665
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,080
maturing soul is large. When we
look at Gandhi, Martin Luther

666
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:55,120
King, great souls, which hold
large swaths of humanity in

667
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:59,920
their heart, thus are the
symptoms of a maturing soul.

668
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,484
Great gwayne,

669
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:08,844
Duane Elgin: well, so well said,
Chris, that's a part of growing

670
00:56:08,844 --> 00:56:13,764
up a maturing soul is to grow
into the reality that we do have

671
00:56:13,764 --> 00:56:19,824
a soul, and to keep the fire in
the soul alive so that we can

672
00:56:19,824 --> 00:56:23,960
grow into this future that
you're speaking about, and I

673
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:30,380
I've often wondered, why doesn't
the larger world recognize what

674
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:34,040
we're speaking about right here?
This is the wisdom that's known

675
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:41,140
through history and and across
cultures. Where is that wisdom

676
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:46,360
today, and you know, I'm
reminded from the American

677
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:51,940
Indian tradition of three
miracles. This helps to reveal

678
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:56,380
this. The first miracle is that
anything exists at all. Anything

679
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,660
exists at all. That's a miracle.
The second miracle is that

680
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:05,220
living things exist, like plants
and animals. And the third

681
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,780
miracle is that living things
exist that know they exist and

682
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,160
that have the capacity to
explore the nature of that

683
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,900
existence. Now we tend to get so
enamored with the third miracle

684
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:24,800
that's that really elevates our
capacities as a species, and we

685
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,340
tend to then forget the first
miracle that anything is here at

686
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:32,660
all. And one thing I appreciate
about what Chris is doing with

687
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,440
his life and his journey is not
only speaking and learning about

688
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,800
reincarnation and the individual
soul and our and our movement

689
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,040
through time, but also the
nature of the universe that

690
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,140
would carry that process, the
first miracle, and one thing

691
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,140
that we love to explore is the
nature of the first miracle,

692
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:59,200
that the universe is itself a
living system and And we are

693
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,120
beginning the the the
evolutionary journey of learning

694
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,480
how to live in that larger
aliveness. Now that's an

695
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,340
extraordinary transition from
living in a Dead universe, and

696
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:14,160
it's really dead matter, empty
space. Well, what do we have

697
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,400
here? Nothing more than our
physical body, a bit of

698
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,560
biological aliveness. It's here
for a short time. Well, what do

699
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,280
we do with that emphasis short
Well, we consume as much as we

700
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,120
can to get as much pleasure as
we can for a short while before

701
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:33,740
we're thrown into the mystery of
non existence. Chris is talking

702
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,860
about a different journey. He's
saying, wait a minute. Wait a

703
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,100
minute. We're alive. We're
deeply alive. The universe is a

704
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,180
living system we're moving
through that larger aliveness.

705
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,500
And what we're trying to do here
is move beyond the consumer

706
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,180
society that's over consuming
the earth, move into a greater

707
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:57,880
wisdom that says, Look at who
you are. Sure you are a physical

708
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,500
body. But beyond the physical
body is the Body of

709
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,580
Consciousness that lives in our
living universe. And that's who

710
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:10,740
you are, more deeply, more
profoundly. And by growing into

711
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,920
that, whether we encounter that
aliveness through the

712
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,100
psychedelic journey, the
meditative journey and so on,

713
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,400
that is who we are at a more
foundational level. And that is

714
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,000
what Chris is pointing to, and
that is what I am working with,

715
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,680
as well with my own life.

716
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,860
Chris Bache: Yeah, you're
pointing to me, Dwayne. But you

717
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,500
know, come on, brother, you
wrote the book The Living

718
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,400
Universe. You're the one who
really, really spent all those

719
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,260
years looking at the scientific
evidence, trying to marshal the

720
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:45,160
kind of evidence that would
convince my atheistic philosophy

721
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,280
department, where they just
reject all of this out of hand,

722
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,580
because they're committed to a
materialist perspective, and I'm

723
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,160
presenting them evidence for
reincarnation, they're saying,

724
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,040
oh, that's nonsense, because we
know it all reduces to brain,

725
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,740
and we know where that comes
from, and you know you're the

726
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:03,420
one. Who took that on and you
just laid out and just hammer

727
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:07,020
the evidence and the evidence,
and then also drawing upon cross

728
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,940
cultural testimony from multiple
continents that are basically

729
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,900
testifying that to the deeper
mystery, to the deeper

730
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,980
intelligence, which we can
experience. Yeah, that's what my

731
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,600
philosophical colleagues. You
know, they're so skeptical about

732
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:29,060
who experience, no, no, no. But
come on, I say, let's get

733
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,500
serious. A philosophical
revolution begins with the

734
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:38,240
question, what is it possible
for a human being to experience,

735
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,880
right? Yeah, yes. They're
telling me you can't experience

736
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,760
the things you say you're
experiencing, and I'm telling

737
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,320
them bullshit. Come on. I got we
have a method. We have hundreds

738
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,140
and hundreds of 1000s of people
who have used this method. Have

739
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:57,340
done LSD psychotherapy. We've
pushed these boundaries. We have

740
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,960
long now longitudinal studies
that are showing us what happens

741
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,560
when people do these things. You
can't dismiss that and say, Oh,

742
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,560
no, that couldn't be real,
because my metaphysical view

743
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,440
says matter is the only reality,
and you're talking about things

744
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,120
that are not materially

745
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:13,619
Bas de Cock: based, right?

746
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:17,339
Chris Bache: Yes, you know
you're knocking on their door

747
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:18,059
hard, brother,

748
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:24,199
Duane Elgin: I want to bring in
look. Let's look beyond

749
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:29,359
philosophy. Yes, Kali, that's
thinking a lot, Chris, let's

750
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,839
look at the direct experience.
Now, the psychedelic experience

751
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:36,259
is direct. It's immediate. You
don't think about it. You're

752
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:42,579
just overwhelmed with the direct
experience and encounter with

753
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:45,519
life in a different way, in a
different mode or different

754
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:53,019
manner. And so let me share just
briefly my experience in

755
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:57,879
Parapsychology almost half a
century ago, the US government

756
01:01:57,879 --> 01:02:04,019
began the very first research by
the government into psychic so

757
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:09,059
called psychic potentials, and
to me, they're not I don't like

758
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,419
the word psychic. I like the
word it's alive. And to what

759
01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:16,199
extent can we relate to and
experience the aliveness of the

760
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:20,299
Living Universe, and what does
that reveal to us? And there

761
01:02:20,299 --> 01:02:24,439
were two things that came back
after three years of involvement

762
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:30,079
in in depth research there at
the Engineering Laboratory of

763
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:36,259
the Sanford Research Institute.
So I had the extraordinary

764
01:02:36,259 --> 01:02:40,959
opportunity, just extraordinary
for over a three year period

765
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:46,359
funded by NASA, the space
agency, to begin to explore our

766
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:49,539
intuitive capacities. And they
wanted to know. They said, Look,

767
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:53,799
if there's an astronaut on the
far side of the moon, is there

768
01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:59,679
any way to intuitively
understand their situation? Can

769
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:04,799
our intuition reach behind the
far side of the moon and get

770
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,319
valuable and meaningful
information about their

771
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:11,159
condition. Well, that was the
premise that launched this three

772
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:15,239
years of inquiry, that after
three years, I dropped out

773
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:18,539
because it was taken over by the
CIA, because it was so

774
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:22,819
compelling the information
coming back that it was taken

775
01:03:22,819 --> 01:03:26,779
over by the Central Intelligence
Agency, and it continued for

776
01:03:26,779 --> 01:03:31,099
another 20 years. So but in the
first three years, it was public

777
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:36,859
information, and here's what was
learned from that. First is that

778
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:42,339
there are two aspects to our
intuitive potentials, one that

779
01:03:42,399 --> 01:03:47,859
we can receive information way
beyond what we can reach through

780
01:03:47,859 --> 01:03:52,419
our normal perceptual capacities
of the physical body. And then

781
01:03:52,419 --> 01:03:57,939
secondly, we can extend our
energetic impact on the universe

782
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:04,199
way beyond the close in reach of
our of our body as well. And so

783
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:08,699
the receptive side was what is
sometimes called remote viewing,

784
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:13,379
and that was interesting. But
the expressive side, which is

785
01:04:13,379 --> 01:04:17,339
sometimes called psychokinesis
of mind, manifesting in matter,

786
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:22,759
really took me into the realm of
a living universe, and exploring

787
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:28,099
the ecology of the living
universe and how we can do a

788
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:34,459
dance with that universe and and
expands ourselves to our really

789
01:04:34,459 --> 01:04:38,599
are the larger selves that we
actually inhabit. And so we have

790
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:44,859
a physical body, but that body
is a an anchor for an unbounded

791
01:04:44,859 --> 01:04:48,759
awareness, an unbounded
consciousness that reaches out

792
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:53,919
without bound, into the larger
universe and beyond. And so we

793
01:04:54,399 --> 01:04:57,879
are bounded for a short while.
Then, as Chris has mentioned,

794
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:03,479
that boundary gives way. We, the
body dies, but the consciousness

795
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:07,379
that was carried along through
the body does not it migrates.

796
01:05:07,379 --> 01:05:10,499
It moves into the into the
larger realms of the universe.

797
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:15,059
And I don't presume to know what
where we're going with that, but

798
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:21,679
I do presume to have unshakable
confidence that we are learning

799
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:25,279
to live in this larger
aliveness, and that is the core

800
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:30,079
journey that we're about right
now as a species. And to the

801
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,619
extent that we think what we're
doing here is, is learning to

802
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:37,159
consume more so we can be happy
with the material things that we

803
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:41,919
have. We're missing. We're
missing what this is all about.

804
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:46,779
We're you. This is a place to
learn about who we are, beneath

805
01:05:46,779 --> 01:05:51,279
and behind and beyond the
physical body, to recognize that

806
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:54,699
we're a part of a journey of
aliveness that, as Chris has

807
01:05:54,699 --> 01:06:00,099
said, has had infinitely deep
origins and that has infinitely

808
01:06:00,099 --> 01:06:03,299
deep potential is moving into
the further future.

809
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:10,499
Chris Bache: Boy, do I want to
jump on that hard. I want to

810
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:15,479
look at this idea of as we
develop our potentials, as we

811
01:06:15,479 --> 01:06:20,039
make this turning point as we
kind of mature as a species.

812
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:24,919
What kind of human being are we
becoming? What are the

813
01:06:24,919 --> 01:06:28,039
potentials that we are
activating? And I think it's

814
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:31,159
far, far beyond what we are
seeing even in the science

815
01:06:31,159 --> 01:06:34,099
fiction literature, which so
much looks like cops and robbers

816
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:37,939
in space, you know, software
beyond the traditional pictures.

817
01:06:38,419 --> 01:06:41,979
But I want to hold that for a
little bit, and I want to build

818
01:06:41,979 --> 01:06:45,099
up to that little bit, and so
I'd like to up the ante in a

819
01:06:45,099 --> 01:06:47,559
different way. I'd like to talk
more directly about

820
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:52,299
psychedelics. You ready to make
that pivot? Okay? Now this is

821
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:55,359
something that both Dwayne and I
share, and I suspect if we had a

822
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,479
show of hands, we'd get a pretty
high showing of people who have

823
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:02,279
used psychedelics responsibly in
this room as part of their own

824
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:06,239
personal history, part of their
spiritual practice history. Just

825
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:09,299
as we ask people, How many
people do yoga and I've done

826
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:12,179
meditation, we'd have the same
type of thing for our

827
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:17,039
generation. Psychedelics is part
of the the arsenal of spiritual

828
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:21,619
of not only spiritual healing,
healing the soul, but becoming

829
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:25,639
more aware of what our lives are
about and what life itself is

830
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:31,519
about. So let me just speak
personally for a minute. I was

831
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:35,839
brand new professor, fresh out
of graduate school, read Stan

832
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:40,839
grofs work immediately I felt
like I saw my life vocation in

833
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:44,439
front of me. I had to do this
type of work. It had been made

834
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:48,519
illegal. This was 1978 right? So
it had been made illegal in 1970

835
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:52,839
I loved teaching. I didn't want
to lose my job, so I basically

836
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:58,539
developed a sideline to my
career. I was a traditional in

837
01:07:58,539 --> 01:08:01,679
many ways, not, I hope, not too
traditional, but I was an

838
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,859
academic. I was teaching courses
at the University, sitting on

839
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:08,999
committees, writing papers,
doing all that stuff. But in my

840
01:08:08,999 --> 01:08:14,699
nighttime job, I began a
systematic course of using a

841
01:08:14,819 --> 01:08:18,059
psychedelic protocol that I
inherited from Stan Grof,

842
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:22,759
totally internalized,
internalized sessions, rigorous,

843
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:25,699
lying down, eye shades,
earphones, sitter, all that

844
01:08:25,699 --> 01:08:30,379
stuff. You know, you know the
drill. Unwisely. I will admit

845
01:08:30,379 --> 01:08:33,919
now I chose a protocol after
three sessions of working with

846
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:38,059
very high doses of LSD, because
I was in a hurry, and I thought

847
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:41,679
this would get me where I wanted
to go faster. I thought it was

848
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,979
about personal awakening,
personal enlightenment. Yeah,

849
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:48,519
come on, they'll be harder, but
I'll burn off my karma faster.

850
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:51,999
Let's get there. Let's put the
metal to the pedal to the metal.

851
01:08:51,999 --> 01:08:55,419
Let's go well, I turned out,
turns out that was completely

852
01:08:55,419 --> 01:08:58,539
wrong on so many points. The
goal was not personal

853
01:08:58,539 --> 01:09:02,159
enlightenment. And if you work
with very, very high doses, like

854
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:05,999
I did, and you do it in a
controlled burn situation, in a

855
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:10,259
very carefully situation, when
you start shattering the

856
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:15,419
boundaries. Within a few years,
I was dealing with experiences

857
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:21,139
where clearly, what was driving
my sessions and what was driving

858
01:09:21,139 --> 01:09:24,079
the purification and
transformational process in my

859
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,399
sessions was not my personal
development, was not my personal

860
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,699
healing or my personal
transformation, but my work had

861
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:34,939
gotten sucked into a larger
historical drama of our

862
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:38,539
collective development, and so
much of the healing that took

863
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:42,279
place in my sessions Were not
about healing Chris Bache or

864
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:47,199
even Chris bacheous soul, but it
was trying to engage and heal

865
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:52,179
some aspect of the human family.
And for years and years, has

866
01:09:52,179 --> 01:09:58,359
kept repeating itself, entering
deep into pains which are stored

867
01:09:58,419 --> 01:10:01,319
within the collective unsight.
Collective unconscious

868
01:10:01,619 --> 01:10:05,759
aggregates which are stored from
all the wars, all the all the

869
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:09,539
unhealed traumas of all the
wars, and all the abuse, and all

870
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,799
the droughts, and all the men
versus women violence and race

871
01:10:13,799 --> 01:10:18,359
versus race, violence and so on
and so forth. All of that trauma

872
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:22,999
which is not resolved at the end
of any one lifetime is

873
01:10:22,999 --> 01:10:26,599
accumulating in the human
psyche. And for us to make this

874
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:32,599
evolutionary pivot, we have to
heal humanity. We have to heal

875
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:39,199
the being which, for me, is a
single being, the human species,

876
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:44,139
as a single being in which we
are all cells. And in order for

877
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:47,799
this entire being to make the
transition that Dwayne has

878
01:10:47,799 --> 01:10:50,499
talked about from being an
adolescent stage of the soul

879
01:10:50,499 --> 01:10:55,059
development into a mature adult
stage of soul development, we

880
01:10:55,059 --> 01:10:59,859
have to heal. And healing is the
first step to establish a new

881
01:10:59,859 --> 01:11:05,519
foundation, a new platform where
we can then download deeper and

882
01:11:05,519 --> 01:11:09,899
more mature and richer energy
and light and insight from the

883
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:13,919
universe itself. It's like we're
we're too we're too dumb, we're

884
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:18,359
too fragmented to be able to
take advantage of all the wisdom

885
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:21,799
and all the healing that's
available to us. But as we heal

886
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:27,139
this work, as we do this work,
then we can take in more. We can

887
01:11:27,139 --> 01:11:32,119
take in we can take in more of
the light of the universe. Now I

888
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:37,099
mentioned that just to kind of
as a preface to where we go when

889
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:40,959
you start shattering the shells
that hold our awareness in their

890
01:11:40,959 --> 01:11:45,579
fixed and narrow confirmation,
we can shatter a shell, and

891
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:48,639
usually the first layers of
shells. People talk about ego,

892
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:52,359
death, right? Death of our
individual mind body experience.

893
01:11:52,779 --> 01:11:57,339
Then you wake up into you are
reborn into a deeper level of

894
01:11:57,339 --> 01:12:01,439
consciousness. And if you push
those boundaries, if you work

895
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:06,599
steadily at those boundaries,
eventually that process will do

896
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:10,379
the same type of purification
process. You'll hit limits, and

897
01:12:10,379 --> 01:12:13,379
you'll go through yet another
death and rebirth. But it's not

898
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:18,119
ego death repeating itself. It's
a deeper kind of dying. It's a

899
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:21,859
dying that takes place at the
species level. It brings you the

900
01:12:21,859 --> 01:12:26,479
rebirth that takes place,
pitches you not into your soul

901
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:30,559
level of individual awakening,
but into some aspect of

902
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:36,439
humanity's awakening. If you
continue to push hard, at least

903
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:41,019
it's been my experience that if
you continue this process

904
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,860
Bas de Cock: diligently, and

905
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,520
Chris Bache: we'll talk about
what that means, maybe. But if

906
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:52,000
you do this work systematically,
and you really take care of your

907
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,760
body, and I don't recommend
doing it the way I did it,

908
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:58,780
because it's a lot of wear and
tear, if I knew then what I know

909
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,860
now, I wouldn't do it the same
way again. Please don't I'd do

910
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:05,640
it differently. I'd be gentler.
But if you push like this, if

911
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:10,380
you keep on pushing those
boundaries, you begin to enter

912
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:13,680
into a communion with the
intelligence that's within the

913
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,220
species, that's driving the
species, and it begins to teach

914
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:21,980
you. It teaches you what's
happening. It teaches you where

915
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:27,260
humanity is going. Now, at this
point, I'll just inject one

916
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:33,320
point and I'm going to turn it
over to Dwayne again, one of the

917
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:38,660
things that began to happen
about eight, nine years into my

918
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:42,520
work, I began to have a series
of visions that just were being

919
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,720
poured into me. And I think of
Black Elk when I try to talk

920
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,560
about this, because Black Elk,
when he was 12 years old, he had

921
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,300
this visionary experience of the
fate of the Lakota people, and

922
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,540
it shook him so deeply. You
know, he almost died. He was out

923
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,500
unconscious for days and days
when he came back, he was

924
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,800
holding this vision. He was so
shaken, he didn't talk about it

925
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:11,160
for years. In my case, I was
downloading visions of what

926
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,760
appeared to be the fate of the
human species, but it wasn't

927
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:19,380
given to me all at once. It was
being dropped in piece in pieces

928
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:24,440
over a series of sessions
stretched over years and but the

929
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,460
fundamental teaching kept
repeating itself and deepening

930
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:33,080
itself. And the teaching was
this, humanity is coming to a

931
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,320
turning point. Humanity is
entering a very challenging

932
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,480
period, but a time of profound
spiritual fruition. We were

933
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,620
entering a time that would mark
the beginning and end of

934
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:49,000
history. It's a truly an
ethical, shifting experience. We

935
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,860
were coming into a time when we
would literally begin to wake up

936
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:58,120
collectively. It wasn't about
just individuals. This is a

937
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:02,580
species wide awakening. The
dynamics are species wide. The

938
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:07,080
time of individual salvation is
over. The time of collective

939
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:11,280
salvation is at our doorstep
right now, over and over and

940
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,780
over again, it was saying, this
is a massive turning point. This

941
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:20,820
is, this is where we had been
building to this transition for

942
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:21,920
ions.

943
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,020
Bas de Cock: It kept showing me

944
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:29,600
Chris Bache: a future that was
just ecstatic, a future, if you

945
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,940
can imagine of our entire
species being a species of

946
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:39,500
Buddhas and Christ and prophets
totally awakened from the soul

947
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:46,660
of our center. But in all these
four years, it never told me how

948
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:50,860
we were going to get there. I
had no insight, given how we

949
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:54,640
were going to carry make this
transition, travel as far as we

950
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,500
had to travel in as little time
as all the research was showing,

951
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,300
telling us that we had, because
really right extinction is

952
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,780
pressing down upon us, and it's
coming hard and fast. The crisis

953
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:13,320
is moving in on us right now. I
share this with you because as

954
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:17,220
I've talked about this, and it's
in my book and LSD in the mind

955
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:20,120
of the universe, and as I've
talked about this, I've had so

956
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,060
many people come up to me and
say, I've had the same kind of

957
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:25,580
visions that's been showing me
the same thing in my deep

958
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:29,480
meditation practice. We're
coming to a turning point. This

959
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,900
is a driving force. This is a
social, collective force. So

960
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,780
there's nothing private, there's
nothing personal about this

961
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:38,960
experience. It's not my unique
experience. I'm simply

962
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,560
witnessing to something which
many of us have been

963
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,800
experiencing, and I know that
you've been experiencing

964
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,220
experience that type of
material. Dwayne, yeah, yes,

965
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:53,080
indeed, yeah, I'm turning Well,

966
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:57,460
Duane Elgin: let me summarize,
from from my perspective, what

967
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:01,860
we've been speaking about. And
three elements of that come up.

968
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:08,880
Of that summary, we're a world,
a species, that's not really

969
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,500
recognizing what's going on
here. First of all, we're not

970
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,580
recognizing the nature of the
universe in which we live. The

971
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:22,880
universe is a living system, and
current science says, No, it's

972
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,460
just dead matter in empty space,
and we're ready to work with the

973
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:29,000
material dimensions of it all,
and so on and so on. But the

974
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,040
deeper aliveness is not
recognized. Secondly, we don't

975
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,060
recognize who we are. We think,
Well, okay, we're biological

976
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,920
beings in this Dead universe,
and we're making the best of it

977
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,900
in a consumer society. And no,
we're not recognizing that we

978
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,560
are part of that larger
aliveness. And thirdly, we're

979
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:56,200
not recognizing the evolutionary
journey. And it's dimensions

980
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:00,240
that we've been speaking about
we think, well, we die and the

981
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:05,280
lights go out, that must be
pretty much it. And no, we're

982
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,880
going on and on and on. As
Chris, you've been speaking

983
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,380
about the reincarnation
universe. We just need go on

984
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:18,180
evolving through it all. So
really, the transition that I

985
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:22,460
see is, first of all, three
fold, a new recognition of where

986
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:26,900
we are. It's a living system.
Secondly, a recognition of of

987
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,620
who we are as beings we're a
part of that larger aliveness.

988
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:35,360
And thirdly, where we're going
is way beyond consumerism and

989
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:39,500
such. It's learning to live in
that larger aliveness. What an

990
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:43,720
extraordinary journey that we
would be blessed with the gift

991
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,800
of entering into that kind of
journey. And you were bringing

992
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,100
up the good the question, Chris,
well, how in the world do we

993
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,220
make the transition, the three
fold transition, and

994
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:59,440
understanding the universe
freshly who we are, freshly and

995
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:05,700
where we're going? Well, a lot
of attention is being put right

996
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:11,400
now on material systems. Well,
it's a climate crisis, so it

997
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,160
means too much CO two in the
air, which means, well, we got

998
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:18,780
to cut back on on the cars that
we drive and so on. It's a

999
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:24,380
material response to a trans
material challenge before us.

1000
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,520
And so again and again people
say, Well, what are you going to

1001
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,880
do about it? And what? One of
the key things I've been working

1002
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:37,640
on for decades is media, and why
media? Media isn't that the

1003
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:42,580
problem we've got so much media.
It's it's consume is hypnotizing

1004
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:47,320
us into a materialistic mindset,
and all we have to show for it

1005
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:51,460
is more consumerism. No, this
goes way beyond that, because

1006
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:57,820
the mass media is the access to
the mass mind. Here we are on a

1007
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:01,140
call with people in different
parts of. World right now, and

1008
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:08,340
we're beginning to grow the
neurological structures of the

1009
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:13,980
species as we use the mass media
that we have right here to speak

1010
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,980
with one another and to grow a
new understanding, a new

1011
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:22,220
consensus, a new consciousness
of who we are as a species. So

1012
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:28,100
one of the critical elements I
feel of a transforming future is

1013
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:33,560
to transform our uses of media.
And this gathering now is an

1014
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:38,780
example, and there are so many
more, we're exploding into a new

1015
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:43,060
opportunity to use the media to
reflect, to use it to reflect on

1016
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:47,080
who are we, and then to
communicate back. Well, I've

1017
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:51,580
seen that mirror, and myself in
that mirror, and I see a new

1018
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:55,300
possibility out there, and let's
begin to evolve into that

1019
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:59,020
possibility. So we're on the
cusp. We're on the brink. We're

1020
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:03,900
on the threshold of using the
extraordinary media potentials

1021
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,540
that are out there right now,
two thirds of the people on this

1022
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:10,260
planet have one of these things,
a cell phone. Two thirds of the

1023
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:13,680
people on the planet, all we
have to do is pick up that cell

1024
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,220
phone and we have access to a
majority of people on this

1025
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:21,920
planet. By the end of this
decade, it'll be three quarters

1026
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,680
of the people on this planet
have access to the to the

1027
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:29,900
collective mind through one of
these so we are over endowed

1028
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:34,280
right now with a with the tools,
the capacities to communicate

1029
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:37,940
with one another and to and to
grow into A new collective

1030
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:43,300
consciousness of those three
dimensions of transformation

1031
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:47,920
that we're just right on the
threshold of pushing against and

1032
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:52,120
the world's pushing back against
us. And so it's a learning time

1033
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:55,120
for the species. It's an
awakening time, a learning time,

1034
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:59,560
a growing time, and we're way
over endowed with all the tools

1035
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,280
we need to go through that
learning journey.

1036
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:07,200
Chris Bache: Yeah, this is one
area where our work is

1037
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,760
complementary to the other,
because you are deeply

1038
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,060
committed, lifelong, committed
social activist, and you

1039
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:19,200
understand in ways that go
beyond me, far beyond my

1040
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:25,040
understanding of how this how
social transformation can take

1041
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,180
place. What are the roots of
that are holding us stuck? Where

1042
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:32,720
are the where are the
opportunities for facilitating

1043
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,540
deep social change at a
collective level, at a

1044
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:40,780
practical, tangible, manifest
level, my work has been much

1045
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:45,340
more internally focused. So let
me speak to the inside of this

1046
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:49,840
process. Because while my
psychedelic experience has been

1047
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,640
deeply collective, it takes
place in one room, you know, in

1048
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:59,020
one house, in on one street. So
it's a very different way to

1049
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:04,080
access the collective. Let me
tell you the next installment,

1050
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,080
or just point to the next
installment in my own journey,

1051
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,620
personal Death-Rebirth went
through that collective

1052
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:17,520
Death-Rebirth went through that
began to have these visionary

1053
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,320
experiences of where the human
species was being taken of this

1054
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,740
an extraordinary future, no
explanation of how we were going

1055
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:30,740
to get there. Carried me then
passed that into a series of

1056
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:34,940
profound mystical experiences of
Non-duality and Shunyata

1057
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:39,920
emptiness and, you know, sort of
deep, ecstatic joy. Then it took

1058
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,880
me into the diamond Luminosity
work, which occupied the last

1059
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,600
five years of my work. And in
the middle of those of those

1060
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,040
diamond Luminosity sessions
where I was expecting fully to

1061
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,740
be returned, because I was
coming back into the diamond

1062
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:57,460
Luminosity about once a year,
but every five sessions,

1063
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:01,560
purified, purify, purify. Bam.
Diamond Luminosity. Purify,

1064
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:06,000
purify, purify. Boom, more. But
diamond Luminosity and I was

1065
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,360
about, I was expecting, about
time to get back into the

1066
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,680
diamond Luminosity. But that's
not what happened in what was my

1067
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:19,380
55th session in 1995 coming up
on what, almost what, 2423 years

1068
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:26,900
ago, I went through a process
where I dissolved completely

1069
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:33,980
into the species I just I became
hard to imagine but hard to

1070
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:38,900
describe. I became dissolved
into the collective unconscious

1071
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:43,480
so deeply that my individual
consciousness was basically just

1072
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:49,300
a slow remnant, and I entered
into what I call deep time. I'd

1073
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:53,920
gone beyond linear time many
times before this dissolved me

1074
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,460
very, very deeply into deep
time. So I was it was a

1075
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,680
transtemporal experience. So I.
Had exploded the boundaries. It

1076
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:06,060
was trans spatial experience. It
was a transtemporal experience,

1077
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:10,380
and it took me into the future,
deeper than I had been taken up

1078
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:14,640
to that time. And suddenly I
began to experience

1079
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:20,420
systematically, methodically,
clear as a bell. I began to

1080
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:26,060
experience the death and rebirth
of the human family. It was like

1081
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:29,720
being able to experience a
thunderstorm where you can see

1082
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:33,740
the patterns, you experience the
patterns of the storm as a

1083
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:37,700
whole, and you experience all of
the individual drops in the

1084
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:43,000
storm simultaneously. So it's a
both an aggregate, but also

1085
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,980
collective. And I experienced
the entire human family moving

1086
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:52,420
into a period of crisis. The
ordinary structures of our world

1087
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:55,660
were being broken down and
stripped away. We were losing

1088
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:59,080
control. We were being
shattered. Civilization was

1089
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:03,240
being shattered. Lives were
being torn apart. It was just

1090
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:07,320
extraordinarily painful. The
whole human family was being

1091
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:13,860
shoved to the edge of apparent
extinction. And is built and

1092
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:18,240
built for a long time in the
session. And then just when it

1093
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,080
looked like that was it, this
was it. We were coming to the

1094
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,860
end of it all. It was like a
hurricane passing over an

1095
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:29,180
island, and the worst of the
storm passed, and things began

1096
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:33,620
to get lighter. They began to
get lighter. People began to

1097
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:37,880
pick themselves up. We began to
find each other after this. And

1098
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,460
many, many people had died, but
many survived, and as we began

1099
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:46,960
to survive, we realized we
discovered that we had been

1100
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,640
changed. This crisis tapped us
into something so deep. It drove

1101
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:56,320
us so deep into our being that
it opened. It unlocked something

1102
01:26:56,380 --> 01:27:00,600
in us. We shed things we just
literally we had stripped from

1103
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:05,880
us all sorts of assumptions and
accumulations that tapped us

1104
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:11,580
into what I came over time to
think of as the one heart, that

1105
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:15,960
all of our individual hearts are
aspects of the one heart, when

1106
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:20,840
we began to find each other and
meet each Other, there was a

1107
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:26,360
there was a creativity that was
catalyzing new social forms, new

1108
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,620
forms of cultural creativity.
And this created feedback loops

1109
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,040
where creativity fed new
creativity. And there was an

1110
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:39,440
exponential in growth in levels
of awareness that were grounded

1111
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,960
in new values, new perceptions
of the good, new understandings

1112
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:47,800
of human nature, new
understandings of nature itself,

1113
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:54,220
new understandings of the
Divine. This is what I think of.

1114
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:57,820
What I came to see was this was
a forecast, not a forecast,

1115
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:01,560
because I was in deep time,
which means I experienced this

1116
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,940
transformation from the
perspective in which it was

1117
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:09,780
already happening, and in the
end, I experienced it as

1118
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:13,800
something that had already
happened and something that was

1119
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:18,960
yet to happen. It was this not
confusing, but the kind of both

1120
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,760
and experience that sometimes
opens in very deep psychedelic

1121
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:30,860
experience. It took me about a
year to recover from this one

1122
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:35,960
session. What I the way I put in
the book, is when I walked

1123
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:41,200
around my town in Ohio and I saw
all these beautiful beings, all

1124
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,140
these souls who did not
consciously at an individual

1125
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:47,860
level, know what they were
coming into, but I knew that at

1126
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:51,100
a soul level, they knew what
they were getting into. At a

1127
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:54,220
soul level, they had chosen to
incarnate at this time in

1128
01:28:54,220 --> 01:29:00,280
history, I just felt myself
surrounded by courageous souls

1129
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:05,400
who were entering consciously
into this very, very intense

1130
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:09,360
century of transformation. It
was like walking around

1131
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:14,460
Hiroshima the week before the
bomb dropped. Everyone around me

1132
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:19,560
I saw was entering into this
terrible catalyst of pain, and

1133
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:24,380
yet they were deep and profound
spiritual warriors. It took me a

1134
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:30,620
long time to learn how to live
with that, to hold that, but I

1135
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:34,700
did, and eventually I brought it
into dark night, early dawn, and

1136
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:38,240
then I brought it more fully
into LSD, in the mind of the

1137
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:42,100
universe. And that's a
perspective that I know I share

1138
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:42,460
with you.

1139
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:46,000
Bas de Cock: Dwayne, yeah, it's
intense. Yeah, yeah.

1140
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:52,480
Duane Elgin: As as a long time
social activist and such, I want

1141
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:56,140
to bring a another note into our
conversation before we we

1142
01:29:56,260 --> 01:30:02,160
conclude, and that is, um. Hmm,
there are no guarantees here.

1143
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,840
We've seen the possibilities.
We've seen the potential. We've

1144
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,320
felt it in our souls and our
bones and our being. We know

1145
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,040
that's possible, but there's no
guarantee we're going to realize

1146
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:19,800
that as a species, as I look at
the world, I see three great

1147
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:23,420
possibilities for our pathway
ahead. One is what we've just

1148
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:28,820
been speaking about, extra
ordinary invitation into greater

1149
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:32,360
aliveness and possibility. But
there are two other

1150
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:37,700
possibilities that are very,
very real. One is the future of

1151
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:42,700
collapse and and really the
functional extinction, the

1152
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:46,300
species, not the complete
extinction, but the functional

1153
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:49,300
extinction. We're no longer a
force and evolution on the

1154
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:53,680
earth, nor are we connected well
enough with one another to make

1155
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:57,340
a difference in our collective
lives and build the kind of

1156
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:00,900
species body that you're
speaking about, Chris, that we

1157
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:04,620
could end up just so fragmented
and so diminished that we never

1158
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:08,940
have the opportunity to pull
that species body together in

1159
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:13,620
its learning potentials. That's
a second possibility, a third

1160
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:17,880
possibility, very real we can
see now is the authoritarian

1161
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:23,000
future. We can see that in in
Russia. We can see it in China.

1162
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,880
We can see it beginning in India
and other parts of the world. We

1163
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:29,180
can see it in the United States,
for heaven sakes, the

1164
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:35,480
authoritarian orientation is so
strong people are ready to

1165
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:38,960
surrender their freedoms. And
what you're speaking about, and

1166
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,060
what I'm speaking about, is
claim your freedom. Claim your

1167
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:46,540
freedom to be a living
participant in a living

1168
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:52,060
universe. Grow into that
freedom. Don't surrender it to

1169
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:56,260
the to the scientists that look
at only a material universe,

1170
01:31:56,380 --> 01:32:00,660
don't surrender it to the media
and the politicians that say no,

1171
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:04,080
it's just about more and more
material well being for all

1172
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:08,640
people on the planet. There are
three great paths before us, and

1173
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,040
the one that you've been
speaking about, and then that I

1174
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:15,540
have, as well, is a narrow
pathway I feel, into the future,

1175
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:19,140
and we're going to have to do
everything we can as a

1176
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,920
community, not just as
individuals, but as you say,

1177
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:26,300
Chris, as a community, to
elevate ourselves, to awaken

1178
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:31,040
ourselves to grow into that
future of evolutionary

1179
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:35,000
potential, to learn to live in
that larger aliveness. So bless

1180
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,520
you, brother and I. Thank you so
much for your life of

1181
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,960
contribution and service in that
and in that future.

1182
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:45,760
Chris Bache: Yeah, and you too,
brother, me before, as we

1183
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,660
transition soon into questions
and answers, which is going to

1184
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:53,920
take us into a whole other
journey. Right with this? There

1185
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:00,660
I have the view, and I think
Dewayne shares this view that we

1186
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:05,280
have entered this century is a
century of labor. We have been

1187
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:10,500
gestating the future human for
millennia, for 10s of 1000s,

1188
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,140
hundreds of 1000s of years,
we've been gestating it through

1189
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:17,220
reincarnation, over and over,
deeper and deeper, but now we've

1190
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:25,340
come into labor. Gestation is
long. Labor is short. Gestation

1191
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:28,280
can be gentle and take place
while we can keep other things

1192
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:33,680
going on. On the surface, labor
is not like that. Is it? Labor

1193
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:38,420
is intense. It requires complete
interruption of life as we have

1194
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:43,600
ordinary experienced it and we
turn deeply within, and we are

1195
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:49,060
in the process of giving birth
to collectively what I'm calling

1196
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,480
the future human. Many people
have seen this. They've felt it.

1197
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:56,200
They give it different names,
Homo spiritualis, Homo noeticus,

1198
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:00,040
all sorts of different names.
But the fundamental idea is that

1199
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:04,140
we are giving birth to a
different kind of human being, a

1200
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:08,580
different level, a different a
more evolved form of humanity.

1201
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:18,720
What might this future human
look like? What is the what is

1202
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:23,900
the substance of the future
human? And here I go back to the

1203
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,260
theme of reincarnation. I go
back to some of the experiences

1204
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:31,580
that I describe in LSD, in the
mind of the universe. And there

1205
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:35,540
was, you know, I've done past
life therapy before when I

1206
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:39,200
wasn't doing the LSD work, and I
know about, I've been

1207
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,940
familiarized with about a dozen
of my former lives, nothing

1208
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:46,720
special, no one special, just
ordinary, run of the mill,

1209
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,500
peasants, for the most part. But
I had a sense of that, you know.

1210
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,380
But what happened in this
particular session is that all

1211
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:56,860
my former lives began to come
back into me. They all just

1212
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:59,740
started coming in very fast and
furious. I'd already gone

1213
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:02,580
through. A tremendous
purification process and a

1214
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:06,420
Death-Rebirth process, but then
these lives started coming into

1215
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:11,760
me. It was like wrapping
filaments of light around a kite

1216
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:17,700
spool. Each wrap was one life,
and at a certain point they hit

1217
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:22,160
critical mass. And when they hit
critical mass, there was an

1218
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:26,900
explosion of energy, and I
experienced this explosion of

1219
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:31,820
diamond light blow out my chest,
catapulting me into a completely

1220
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:36,860
new state of consciousness. And
all those individual lives fused

1221
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:43,540
into one, into a singularity,
and then a teaching kept on

1222
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:47,080
holding and explaining what was
going on, first the experiences,

1223
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:50,680
then the illuminating of the
experience. But the basic vision

1224
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:54,640
that emerges is this. It's a
different vision of human of

1225
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:58,120
reincarnation than we find in
many of the Eastern cultures.

1226
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:01,260
The classical view of
reincarnation is okay,

1227
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,280
reincarnate, reincarnate,
reincarnate. Get better and

1228
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,460
better, more compassionate, more
intelligent, more this, more

1229
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:11,880
that, growing level by level by
level. And when you achieve

1230
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,300
enlightenment, when you achieve
a realization that you can

1231
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:19,320
understand and let your mind
sink into the essence of its

1232
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:23,300
source, and you come to that
shattering realization that the

1233
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:28,520
essence of your life is
absolute, is exactly the same as

1234
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:32,480
the essence of everybody else's
life, and the essence of life

1235
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:38,660
itself Atman is Brahman. Yes,
our nature is our Buddha nature.

1236
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:42,880
When we reach that point,
classic thinking is okay now we

1237
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,300
can leave. You've achieved
enlightenment. You have achieved

1238
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:50,620
moksha. Escape. You no longer
have to be entrapped within ego,

1239
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:53,560
but you no longer have to be
entrapped within time and space.

1240
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:58,300
You have permission to leave.
Your work is done. But that's

1241
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:02,100
not what came forward in my
session. What came forward in my

1242
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:07,740
session was the birth of the
diamond soul, which meant that,

1243
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:12,540
which was the phenomenon that we
are reaching a point in human

1244
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:17,820
evolution where we have, we have
been working in integrating and

1245
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:21,440
getting rid of all of our
negative karma, purifying

1246
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,560
ourselves, healing
relationships, healing the scars

1247
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:28,580
which have been torn into our
heart, healing the social scars,

1248
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:32,540
healing the civilizational scars
we're working and working that

1249
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:38,480
material there comes a time when
our entire history begins to

1250
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:42,640
coalesce, and The early stages
of that coalescing often takes

1251
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:46,420
this form of healing, purifying,
dealing, cleaning out the

1252
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:49,840
basement, so on and so forth.
But there comes a point when

1253
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,220
that work is done, and all of
those lives congeal, and there

1254
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:59,140
is an explosion of consciousness
where we no longer experience

1255
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:04,680
ourselves as a one generational
time space, 100 year old being.

1256
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:10,080
We experience ourselves as
100,000 year old being. We

1257
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:15,780
experience ourselves as souls,
and not a human being with a

1258
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:20,100
soul. We experience what a human
being actually is. We experience

1259
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,960
ourselves as souls. And this is
what I call the birth of the

1260
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:28,520
diamond soul, because we often
tend to use the word soul as the

1261
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:33,260
spiritual, non embodied, the non
physical counterpart to our

1262
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:36,740
individual personality. That's
not the soul I'm talking about.

1263
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:40,600
I'm talking about the
consciousness that holds all of

1264
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:44,680
our farmer lives, all of them as
one. And now what I think is

1265
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:49,600
happening is usually we
experience that diamond soul

1266
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:55,240
only after we die. You know, we
go small to big when we die. Ah,

1267
01:38:55,240 --> 01:39:00,360
yeah, come back to small. We
grow some more, then we die. Ah,

1268
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,080
yes, it feels so good to be big
again. But what's happening? I

1269
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:08,940
think if we keep that up, just
keep it up long enough, sooner

1270
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:16,200
or later, the soul wakes up
inside physical existence. And

1271
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:21,560
when that happens, Heaven
manifests on earth when that

1272
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:28,100
happens, Nirvana is Samsara.
When that happens, we realize we

1273
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:31,760
don't have to go anywhere to
experience absolute bliss and

1274
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,380
sheer joy. The goal of
evolution, of spiritual

1275
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:43,240
evolution, is not to spiritually
mature and then leave. I

1276
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:46,540
understand where that view came
from. I understand its

1277
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:51,460
historical context. It makes
perfect sense within a context

1278
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:56,080
of 5000 years ago, before we
understood how old the universe

1279
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:59,920
was, how big it was, and how
much intelligence had been sunk.

1280
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,340
Into building this universe. The
goal of our spiritual evolution

1281
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:05,820
is to

1282
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:07,800
Bas de Cock: awaken,

1283
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:12,419
Chris Bache: to truly awaken to
our soul consciousness, which

1284
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:15,839
opens us into a different
relationship with all other

1285
01:40:15,839 --> 01:40:19,139
beings with whom we share this
planet, and opens us into a

1286
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:22,819
different relationship to the
intelligence that is manifesting

1287
01:40:22,819 --> 01:40:27,199
time and space continuously
regenerating it. The goal is to

1288
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:31,939
awaken to that, to embody that
in our physical being, not a

1289
01:40:31,939 --> 01:40:35,779
disembodied, transcendental
awakening, but an embodied

1290
01:40:36,259 --> 01:40:40,659
awakening, and then to bring
that consciousness into the

1291
01:40:41,019 --> 01:40:44,679
making of history, into the
making of the planet, into the

1292
01:40:44,679 --> 01:40:48,699
making of a civilization, a
world which truly does work for

1293
01:40:48,699 --> 01:40:55,239
all. How far can we take this?
What will it look like? It's not

1294
01:40:55,239 --> 01:40:57,879
going to look like, just what it
looks like in the very beginning

1295
01:40:57,879 --> 01:41:03,479
stages. What our spiritual
traditions have told us over and

1296
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:09,599
over again is that mind creates
our destiny as the mind leads,

1297
01:41:09,599 --> 01:41:14,159
Destiny follows. We are creating
our reality with our mind. When

1298
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:17,159
our mind is fragmented and
conflicted, we live in a

1299
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:20,719
fragmented and conflicted
reality. Now this is we have to

1300
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:24,259
be careful, this is not simply
an individual story. It's a

1301
01:41:24,259 --> 01:41:27,439
collective story. There's a
dynamic feedback between our

1302
01:41:27,499 --> 01:41:32,059
individual manifestation, our
collective manifestation. But

1303
01:41:32,059 --> 01:41:38,299
basically, we are learning, I
think, how to control the

1304
01:41:38,299 --> 01:41:42,759
nuclear energy, which is the
soul, the fiery energy, light

1305
01:41:42,819 --> 01:41:48,999
energy, which is our essential
divine energy, cosmic energy. We

1306
01:41:48,999 --> 01:41:52,899
are learning how to be gods. And
I don't mean that in any

1307
01:41:52,899 --> 01:41:57,039
superficial sense. We are
evolving into a being which

1308
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:01,799
truly not only will be at peace
with ourselves and at harmony

1309
01:42:01,799 --> 01:42:06,599
with each other, but a being
which has capacity to manifest

1310
01:42:06,839 --> 01:42:12,119
creativity inside time and
space, the likes of which maybe

1311
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:15,779
today we only know in the
mystical literature, in the

1312
01:42:15,779 --> 01:42:18,959
spiritual literature, what the
Tibetans call The mahasiddhas,

1313
01:42:19,259 --> 01:42:23,299
The Great Beings, the great
beings around who have the

1314
01:42:23,299 --> 01:42:28,099
capacity to work miracles. They
have the capacity to manifest

1315
01:42:28,279 --> 01:42:34,459
consciousness in ways that
absolutely dazzle our mind and

1316
01:42:34,459 --> 01:42:37,099
don't make any sense within a
materialist scientific

1317
01:42:37,099 --> 01:42:41,439
perspective, because they have
gathered so much conscious power

1318
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:46,899
that they can manifest this in a
way that bends the laws of

1319
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:50,079
physics, so to speak. I suspect
what they're doing is

1320
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:55,299
manifesting a deeper set of laws
of physics than are manifest at

1321
01:42:55,299 --> 01:43:00,599
a lower energy level. This is
high energy physics, yeah. So I

1322
01:43:00,599 --> 01:43:03,299
think we're coming. We're giving
birth to the future human. We're

1323
01:43:03,299 --> 01:43:07,019
giving we're maturing. We're
growing into a mature adult. And

1324
01:43:07,019 --> 01:43:10,319
if we ask, well, what does a
mature adult look like? It's not

1325
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:13,379
simply a human being the way we
are now, with higher values and

1326
01:43:13,379 --> 01:43:18,479
better values. It's truly an
awakened human being, a soul

1327
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:22,159
centered human being that lives
at peace with themselves and at

1328
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:26,779
peace with each other, and now
we pivot. And of course, this

1329
01:43:26,779 --> 01:43:31,279
isn't, this isn't the end of the
story, right? Let's assume for

1330
01:43:31,279 --> 01:43:34,099
the minute we make this
transition. One century, two

1331
01:43:34,099 --> 01:43:38,239
centuries, three centuries, we
make this transition. Universe

1332
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:42,159
isn't stopping, right? We're
going to be here for millions,

1333
01:43:42,219 --> 01:43:45,999
billions of years, right? We
have at least 4 billion years

1334
01:43:45,999 --> 01:43:48,819
before the sun goes supernova.
We got to be off the planet in

1335
01:43:48,819 --> 01:43:53,259
about 2 billion years. That's a
lot of time you're going this is

1336
01:43:53,259 --> 01:43:56,079
just the beginning of a
transition. We're just waking

1337
01:43:56,079 --> 01:43:59,559
up. We're like children in the
crib created by the universe,

1338
01:43:59,559 --> 01:44:03,299
waking up into this beautiful
room. We're just waking up to

1339
01:44:03,299 --> 01:44:06,839
what we are, who we are,
activating our potential and

1340
01:44:06,839 --> 01:44:13,139
moving on, moving forward that
now I believe, with Dwayne, that

1341
01:44:13,139 --> 01:44:16,799
he's right. The note, there's no
guarantees here.

1342
01:44:17,939 --> 01:44:18,659
Bas de Cock: This is

1343
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:23,780
Chris Bache: we have to put we
have to everybody show up.

1344
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:26,660
Everybody has to maximize
everything they can do to

1345
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:29,840
possibly to make this, to get us
through this, to bring us

1346
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:33,200
through this whole transition. I
understand that, and I accept

1347
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:37,400
that, and I think that's true,
but I also would like to offer

1348
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:41,860
you a slightly different
perspective from within my

1349
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,620
psychedelic experience, and I
don't know how to reconcile

1350
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:47,860
these two, but from within my
psychedelic experience, I've

1351
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:53,020
been taken so deep into the
future so many times, and in my

1352
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:57,940
last deep vision, the 70th
session was my last, what I call

1353
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:04,080
the great visions, deep. Deep
into the future, and from that

1354
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:09,360
deep future, I experienced this
transformation as a given, as

1355
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,840
something that we had
accomplished, not something that

1356
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:17,340
was an open ended possibility,
but something which we had truly

1357
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:23,420
accomplished. So from my own
personal heart. I cannot doubt

1358
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:28,340
that we will make this
transition. I worry deeply about

1359
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:31,760
what it's going to cost us. How
many of our children will die,

1360
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:37,640
how many of our world's children
will die of starvation? And you,

1361
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:41,020
we know it's coming in that way.
That's what I'm worried about,

1362
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:47,320
and it's going to take every one
of us at maximum exertion to

1363
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:50,620
really pull this off. And yet
we're not driving this, right?

1364
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:55,120
Human beings are not driving
this. Nature is driving this.

1365
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:58,600
The creative intelligence of
nature is driving this. We

1366
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:02,580
didn't give ourselves the big
brain 100,000 years ago, we

1367
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:05,460
didn't give ourselves the
evolutionary qualities that are

1368
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:08,940
embodied in ourselves, in our
mind and in our physical body.

1369
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:13,500
Some larger process is driving
this process. The most we can do

1370
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:17,460
is cooperate with it, to
recognize, to wake up, to see

1371
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:21,560
what's happening, cooperate with
it and to become a collaborator,

1372
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:27,500
a co creator of this future
human, which we will then in our

1373
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:32,120
future incarnations, incarnate
into. But I think the shift that

1374
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:35,960
we're seeing taking place, it's
grinding its way forward, is a

1375
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:40,840
shift in the plate tectonics of
the collective psyche. It's a

1376
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:45,040
shift at the very, very deep
structure that after we make

1377
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:49,900
this shift, every human being
born will be operating out of a

1378
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:54,340
different collective psyche, out
of a different level of soul

1379
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:58,480
awareness. And that's the work
of the hour. That's what we and

1380
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,740
we all knew we were getting
getting into this. When we were

1381
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:06,240
born, we chose to be part of
this process. And with that

1382
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:10,980
knowledge, we can relax even
while we go to work, we can

1383
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:16,800
relax in that deeper way of
taking spiritual nurturance from

1384
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,960
the universe even as we go to
work and do our best.

1385
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:26,000
Unknown: So brother,

1386
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:28,640
Chris Bache: let's open it up
and see what these good people

1387
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:30,080
where they want to go.

1388
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,780
Duane Elgin: Yeah, thank you,
brother, this has been a delight

1389
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:38,720
to share this this hour with
you, and I'm so deeply grateful,

1390
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:41,080
I just want to say for our
friendship over these deck

1391
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,280
towns. Bless you.

1392
01:47:42,819 --> 01:47:44,619
Unknown: Yeah, likewise,
brother.

1393
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:52,300
Bas de Cock: As as said from
this place, what an amazing,

1394
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:57,520
deep words. It's not about the
words about the energy felt

1395
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:02,580
during your dance. It's
transformative by itself. So I'm

1396
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:07,740
really, I'm really honored,
honored by these words. And I

1397
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:12,540
have 1000 questions that I said
off your course, Chris, I gained

1398
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:17,700
1000 questions more, and now
I've got 2000 questions. But

1399
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:21,980
concerning the time, I want to
open up the or the microphone

1400
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:27,740
for the fellow, the fellow
wisdom keepers, people have

1401
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:34,340
questions, sharings, whatever
comes up wants to be shared now

1402
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:38,300
is the time and the place, and
our questions as hosts will

1403
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:43,120
come, maybe at The end. So if
you have a question, if you have

1404
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:47,260
one symptom to share, just open
up your microphone and feel

1405
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:50,020
comfortable to to to go.

1406
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,380
Chris Bache: I see Todd has got
his hand raised.

1407
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,660
Unknown: Well, it is lovely to
see you both, and I would offer

1408
01:48:58,660 --> 01:49:03,840
that your conjoined synergy is
part of that love that gives us

1409
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:07,740
great optimism for future. I'm a
painfully optimistic sort

1410
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:11,160
because of having taste of that
unconditional love and that

1411
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:17,220
complexity that's about and so I
my optimism. We unchanged,

1412
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:20,720
though we do know there's a
collective great n de coming for

1413
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,060
the species, but the
transformative power is

1414
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:26,960
wonderful. Just to offer some of
the small kernels that I see

1415
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,500
changing is just the fact that
we're talking about psychedelics

1416
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:33,860
are not a panacea for every
individual, but they are so

1417
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:38,240
quickly entering a wider
conversation, and to me, that's

1418
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:41,380
going to be one of the essential
tools to help change the

1419
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:44,920
consciousness individually and
then, of course, collectively,

1420
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:49,600
just as one tiny little nugget,
I received email yesterday of a

1421
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,840
group and some of the folks I
know that are deeply thoughtful

1422
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:56,080
and deeply committed toward a
holistic understanding of

1423
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:59,620
existence, and they're putting
together leadership schools,

1424
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,880
which. With a psychedelic
component, to those with a

1425
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:06,480
cohort goes through, thinks
deeply about all the things that

1426
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:11,820
you know, a planetary, holistic,
universal idea, but with the aid

1427
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:15,300
of having that transformative
discovery within and then going

1428
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:18,840
forth all together to a with a
greater understanding. And to

1429
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:22,280
me, that's was unheard of just a
few few years ago, let alone a

1430
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:25,580
decade or two. And so for those
to me, are those moments of

1431
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:29,180
showing that there are so many
folks working toward a greater

1432
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:31,820
understanding that that will get
here, even though there's gonna

1433
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:34,760
be great pain before that's
manifested on a wider scale. So

1434
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:38,840
anyway, thank you for your work,
and I share your optimism, and

1435
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:40,160
it's unshakable, dammit.

1436
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:45,699
Chris Bache: And how could we
not mention this great book by

1437
01:50:45,699 --> 01:50:50,379
Dwayne choosing Earth. And
there's a film that he and

1438
01:50:50,379 --> 01:50:54,339
Colleen have created, there's a
course which they have created,

1439
01:50:54,519 --> 01:50:56,679
there are a number of
initiatives and Dwayne, I'll let

1440
01:50:56,679 --> 01:51:00,539
you talk about this. But this is
an extraordinarily powerful

1441
01:51:00,539 --> 01:51:03,779
book. And one of the things I
love about it, he's given it

1442
01:51:03,779 --> 01:51:06,599
away. It's like too important to
try to make any money off it.

1443
01:51:06,599 --> 01:51:11,759
He's been giving it away. And if
you get it in the PDF form, all

1444
01:51:11,759 --> 01:51:15,899
the references are hot linked.
So you can pop right, right,

1445
01:51:15,899 --> 01:51:19,259
right into one article after
another, one Research Institute

1446
01:51:19,259 --> 01:51:21,919
after another. It's all hot
linked, and you can move right

1447
01:51:21,919 --> 01:51:23,479
into it and go very deeply.

1448
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:24,560
Unknown: Dwayne

1449
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:30,560
Duane Elgin: The one thing I
would say, moderating my

1450
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:37,940
optimism, this book looks, oh,
6070, years into the future, and

1451
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:42,940
I've been doing futures research
for a half century, truly. And

1452
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:50,980
this book is the accumulation of
that half century of work. And I

1453
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:56,560
want to be optimistic, but boy,
I tell you, It's fierce. The

1454
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:02,100
world is coming down on us now,
not 10 years from now, but no

1455
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:06,720
and we could run through the
elements once again. But the

1456
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:11,940
reality is, we're up against it
now, and it requires our courage

1457
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,820
now. It requires our collective
consciousness. Now it requires a

1458
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:21,800
new media to reflect back to us,
new possibilities, new

1459
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:26,060
priorities, new perspectives on
on where we are, who we are,

1460
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:30,080
where we're going now. So to the
extent that there are people

1461
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:36,440
watching and this program now,
get on with your work. Get on

1462
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:39,980
with your life. Choose the
freedom that you have off your

1463
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:43,120
creativity to our wounded world
to move into this more

1464
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:44,320
transforming future.

1465
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:50,800
Bas de Cock: So thank you. You
bet, yeah, I see a hand of

1466
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:52,600
Henrik. You can open up your
mic.

1467
01:52:55,720 --> 01:53:03,120
Unknown: Hey, thank you. So I
came here as someone who's

1468
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:08,220
curious, and so I am going to
ask a question at the risk of

1469
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:13,620
sounding flippant, because I
obviously don't have the

1470
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:19,500
experience that the three of you
have, but I'm just going to ask

1471
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:23,180
this question from a position of
curiosity and trying to get some

1472
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:28,640
clarity. So I've heard a lot of
things, reincarnation, karma.

1473
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:32,120
You know, the path of the soul
is taking the path of humanity

1474
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:38,300
going forward. We come from a
source and intelligence, and it

1475
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:43,360
sounds like it's a very profound
worldview, right? And I, I came

1476
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:48,220
from a Christian worldview. I'm
no longer in that world for you.

1477
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:54,640
And my question is, what makes
you guys so convinced this is

1478
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:59,260
actually reality, or this is
actually true? And it's not just

1479
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:03,300
the LSD messing with your hats.
To be I told you it was gonna be

1480
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:04,740
flip, but you guys

1481
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:10,560
Chris Bache: absolutely, good
question. Absolutely. Thank you.

1482
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:16,560
I'll take a shot, Dwayne, then
you take a shot. Yeah. Okay. Ken

1483
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:20,040
ring, founder of near death
episode studies, founder of the

1484
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:24,980
Journal of near death studies,
good friend, long friend. He and

1485
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:29,240
I. He asked the same question at
me and asked it hard and pushed

1486
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:34,040
it hard, and we had a back and
forth dialog, and it was so rich

1487
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:37,280
that we decided we'd publish it.
So if you were to go to

1488
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:42,040
medium.com There's an article
that you can track down by that

1489
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:46,780
it's an it's a dialog between
Ken and I, and the title is our

1490
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:51,640
deep psychedelic experiences,
trustable. How do we know that

1491
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:55,720
I'm just not picking up on the
echoes of my personal mind, or

1492
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:59,440
I'm picking echoes of the
collective psyche? What are

1493
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,820
their crap? Criteria that we can
use to evaluate these

1494
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:08,760
experiences, and I just lay it
out as clearly as I can. Ken

1495
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:13,500
punches at me. I respond. It's a
good dialog. It's a really

1496
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:18,600
important question, are they
trustable? Right? There's not a

1497
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:21,540
simple answer to that question.
You really have to kind of take

1498
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:25,160
it and look at it deeply as you
go through it, because it's not

1499
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:28,940
enough to say experientially,
they're trustable. There has to

1500
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:32,900
be more meat on those bones. It
has to be more substances. And I

1501
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:36,860
think there is. I think we do
have some empirical evidence

1502
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:41,260
that these experiences are
verifiable and are trustworthy,

1503
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:44,560
some of them, not all of them,
but then there are other ones

1504
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:50,560
which begin to look at cross
disciplinary coherence that adds

1505
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:56,380
another layer of trustability.
Yeah, it's an important

1506
01:55:56,380 --> 01:56:01,980
question, but what I would
emphasize is that I would never

1507
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:07,980
say the things that I said today
if I were speaking 30 years ago

1508
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:14,820
now, because if you take a look
at my scholarship, and I know

1509
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:18,540
Dewayne scholarship, it's not
just that We're sharing

1510
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:23,900
visionary experiences. We've
done our homework. I don't offer

1511
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:28,100
reincarnation as a philosophical
or theoretical perspective or

1512
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:32,180
based on an experiential
perspective. I did my homework.

1513
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:36,320
I looked at all the available
evidence for reincarnation. I

1514
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:39,740
looked deeply at Stan grofwork
and the available evidence and

1515
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:43,960
support of the hypotheses and
the cosmology that he's

1516
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:48,340
presented in many of his books.
So it's a combination of

1517
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:52,480
rigorous Scholarship, which has
lots of different aspects to it,

1518
01:56:52,720 --> 01:57:00,900
and then carefully recorded
offered psychedelic experiences.

1519
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:04,380
And what we find, of course, is
there's a the cosmology that

1520
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,980
emerges in psychedelic work is
essentially the same as the

1521
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:13,440
cosmology that emerges in other
deep, contemplative mystical

1522
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:16,440
traditions. It's not a new
cosmology, it's simply a new way

1523
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:20,580
of accessing that same
fundamental core worldview.

1524
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:26,900
Duane Elgin: Dwayne Yep. Let's
see. That's a really important

1525
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:32,720
question, really important. And
I raised, you know, the book The

1526
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:37,400
Living Universe. I spent 30
years looking across cultures,

1527
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:42,340
through different dimensions of
science and so on to ask that

1528
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:46,120
question, is there any
agreement, as we look around the

1529
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:49,360
world through different wisdom
traditions, that this is the

1530
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:53,200
nature of reality, or am I just
fantasizing that we're living in

1531
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:57,220
this living entity? Well,
indeed, there's a very strong

1532
01:57:57,220 --> 01:58:03,720
consensus, and a surprisingly
strong consensus. And if we had

1533
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:09,000
more time, I would love to get
into that. So first of all, if

1534
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,020
we look at the world's wisdom
traditions, there is a growing

1535
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:16,080
consensus about the nature of
reality, human identity and the

1536
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:21,740
evolutionary journey. Secondly,
if you want other evidence, as I

1537
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:25,940
said, I spent three years in a
laboratory setting with

1538
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:30,680
experiment after experiment
exploring the intuitive

1539
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:34,100
potentials of the human being.
And that's those are the

1540
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:36,920
potentials that are required for
us to reach into the larger

1541
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:40,540
universe and draw into
ourselves, the insights that

1542
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:45,100
Kristen is so beautifully spoken
of, and I assure you that the

1543
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:49,060
CIA would not continue. The
intelligence agency would not

1544
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:55,120
continue this work for 20 years.
After they declared it secret,

1545
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:59,500
they went for another 20 years,
unless they were getting

1546
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:04,560
meaningful, validated scientific
information about our expanded

1547
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:09,300
capacities as human beings. So
we can go to different sources

1548
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:15,420
of validation and verification,
but it's there, but we're just

1549
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:20,360
beginning to accumulate that
evidence now, and that is now

1550
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:24,260
being presented to us, and
whether through the psychedelic

1551
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:28,520
vehicle or through the
meditation experiences and so

1552
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:36,620
on, but the evidence is there,
and beautiful question, though.

1553
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:37,280
Thank you.

1554
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:42,040
Chris Bache: And in addition to
that article by Ken and I that

1555
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:47,080
dialog. You'll see a reference
there, and you can find it at my

1556
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:50,320
website, Chris bache.com, and
you can also see it in

1557
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:55,960
academia.edu, where I've put a
lot of my major articles posted.

1558
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:59,560
You just look up Chris Bache
there, and there is a section

1559
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:02,820
from the. First chapter of dark
night, early dawn, which really

1560
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:06,300
drills down on this question.
And the section is called the

1561
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:09,720
epistemic value of psychedelic
experience, right? The

1562
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:13,860
epistemological value, and I
really lean on that and hard.

1563
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:15,720
So, yeah, important question.

1564
02:00:15,899 --> 02:00:19,139
Unknown: Yeah. I appreciate your
answers. Thank you very much.

1565
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:24,740
Bas de Cock: I see a hand for
Sue, please open up your

1566
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:25,340
microphone.

1567
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:31,340
Unknown: Okay, I just want to
say a huge thank you to both

1568
02:00:31,340 --> 02:00:35,360
Chris and Dwayne, because I
think they have the most

1569
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:42,340
enormous courage, and I feel
encouraged to face whatever it

1570
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:46,480
is that may be coming away,
because they have the courage to

1571
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:50,680
go there in detail, both Chris
through I've read your book, so

1572
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:56,080
I know the detail of how much
pain you know, collective human

1573
02:00:56,140 --> 02:01:00,540
or other human pain that you
went through. And I just think,

1574
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:05,760
yeah, to have kept going with
that kept going is absolutely

1575
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:11,100
amazing. So thank you. And for
Dewayne to look into the future,

1576
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:16,680
to see really the terrifying
prospects there, and still to

1577
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:22,640
you know, be encouraging us and
going forward. So I just wanted

1578
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:26,420
to say, I wonder whether our
collective consciousness has

1579
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:31,160
gone down rather than up, which
with reincarnation, the idea is

1580
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:35,240
that you learn something and
come back. But I personally, I

1581
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:39,080
feel that the goddess culture is
going back to pre history had a

1582
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:43,300
lot of very high consciousness
going on, you know, the Minoan

1583
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:47,500
civilizations, etc. And I kind
of feel that through our

1584
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:51,520
materialism, our consciousness
has has kind of gone down,

1585
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:54,820
become more limited. So I
suppose I wonder whether the

1586
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:59,800
idea of reincarnation, taking us
forward, how that could fit to a

1587
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:04,740
kind of decline in consciousness
and awareness of who we are in a

1588
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:08,640
living universe. Because I think
there were cultures in previous

1589
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:12,720
times that had that. Sorry, I'm
going a bit crazy on this thing

1590
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:17,760
on my screen. Stop. But so just,
I'd be interested what you

1591
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:18,660
thought about that,

1592
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,040
Chris Bache: Dean. You want to
start in this one, and

1593
02:02:22,819 --> 02:02:26,659
Duane Elgin: I have a very
simple response to that. We have

1594
02:02:26,659 --> 02:02:31,399
just become a collective
species, civilization, only in

1595
02:02:31,399 --> 02:02:37,279
the last few decades, with with
the growth of the mass media in

1596
02:02:37,279 --> 02:02:40,779
the post, post World War Two
era, we are becoming a

1597
02:02:40,779 --> 02:02:45,639
collective entity, a collective
being, if you will. That's not

1598
02:02:45,639 --> 02:02:51,039
to diminish the wakefulness of
earlier people and

1599
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:55,299
civilizations, but it's rather
to recognize this is a new

1600
02:02:55,299 --> 02:02:59,679
epoch, a new era, a new
condition of the whole human

1601
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:04,679
family being pushed together by
multiple crises that, you know,

1602
02:03:04,739 --> 02:03:07,439
we went down the list, the
climate crisis, the species

1603
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:12,899
extinction, all the rest, we are
being compressed and squeezed as

1604
02:03:12,899 --> 02:03:16,619
a species to awaken in a new way
that and we did not have those

1605
02:03:16,619 --> 02:03:20,719
pressures in earlier times at a
planetary scale, and That's

1606
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:25,159
where we are now. So this is a
very unique situation. It's not

1607
02:03:25,159 --> 02:03:28,459
to diminish the past, but it's
rather to awaken to the

1608
02:03:28,459 --> 02:03:29,839
challenges of the future.

1609
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:31,040
Unknown: Okay,

1610
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:35,480
Chris Bache: I'd suggest a very
simple analogy. You can look at

1611
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:39,080
it in the context of meditation,
but also in the concept of

1612
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:44,080
physiology. If you fast for
health, if you go through an

1613
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:49,540
extended fast, a safe fast, and
you're doing so for health, what

1614
02:03:49,540 --> 02:03:53,620
we find is that after a day or
two, you begin to have all sorts

1615
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:57,220
of flu, like symptoms, you know,
you just feel miserable, you

1616
02:03:57,220 --> 02:04:00,840
feel terrible, your nose is
running, and all this stuff. And

1617
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:05,040
then, after several days, you
move through that, and then you

1618
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:08,580
enter a period where you begin
to feel better than you had when

1619
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:12,720
you started. Same thing happens
in meditation. You meditate in

1620
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:16,260
order to feel better. So you
quiet your mind. You get very

1621
02:04:16,260 --> 02:04:21,200
still, you fast your mind. What
happens? Your unconscious begins

1622
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:23,840
to throw up all its garbage. I
mean, it's just all the pain

1623
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:26,420
start coming up and all the
emotions start coming up. And

1624
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:29,240
you think, what the hell? Why
this is getting worse, not

1625
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:33,320
better. But if you hold it, it
eventually works its way

1626
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:37,280
through, and you begin to move
into a deeper state, a sense of

1627
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:42,940
well being, understanding that
reincarnation is happening not

1628
02:04:42,940 --> 02:04:46,720
just individually, but it's
happening collectively. One of

1629
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,320
the ways of understanding some
of the rhythm of the epics that

1630
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:55,060
we've moving into, or have been
moving into, is that humanity

1631
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:59,920
has begun to detoxify itself.
Literally, I think souls are.

1632
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,780
Taking into their incarnations,
into their current incarnation,

1633
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:08,940
and it has been for some time
more karma than they might have

1634
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:12,060
in earlier generations and
earlier centuries. They are

1635
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:17,160
literally stacking up more
collective and individual karma

1636
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:20,900
to work on in their lifetime.
And if you looked at this only

1637
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:25,220
from the outside, you would
think that these we are kind of

1638
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:29,060
devolving because we're dealing
with more and more basic

1639
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:33,260
problems and more elemental
problems. But again, from an

1640
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:36,800
evolutionary perspective, if we
hold this, if we hold a

1641
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:41,260
perspective like on meditation,
like on fasting, we are clearing

1642
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:45,580
this past. Humanity is clearing
its path. And it looks maybe

1643
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:48,700
like things are getting worse,
but I think what it is is we're

1644
02:05:48,700 --> 02:05:51,460
getting down to business. We're
getting down to some serious

1645
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:55,060
business, and we are healing
that past. But the only way to

1646
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:59,140
heal that past is to confront
it. Is to let it into your

1647
02:05:59,140 --> 02:06:03,720
awareness. We heal the past by
expanding our consciousness and

1648
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:07,500
embracing the consciousness of
it, and likewise socially

1649
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:12,600
manifesting states of states of
awareness in our culture, where

1650
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:16,020
we heal the racism, we heal the
gender is and we heal the

1651
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:20,720
speciesism by holding that in
our awareness and saying, No,

1652
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:23,000
we're not going to do that
anymore. We're not going to rape

1653
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,580
our daughters anymore. We're not
going to behave towards people

1654
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:28,640
of other cultures and other
colors the way we've done in the

1655
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:32,420
past. We're going to move into
this into a better world. So it

1656
02:06:32,420 --> 02:06:35,300
is a complex picture, but I
think from a deep enough

1657
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:37,160
perspective, it can begin to
make

1658
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:45,580
Bas de Cock: more sense. I i
would like to add something as a

1659
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:49,540
holistic doctor as well, because
from a biological perspective,

1660
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:55,900
as you see, our brain
developments during evolution, I

1661
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:59,140
think trauma has a major effect,
especially the collective

1662
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:03,420
trauma, which made us, during
evolution, less receptive for

1663
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:09,240
the collective view, instead of,
yeah, seeing life as separate,

1664
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:15,720
and we're now waking up of these
collective trauma and the

1665
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:19,380
healing, as you said. So I think
there are several aspects which

1666
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:23,900
are very coming together on a
biological but also on the

1667
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:26,600
social, but on the spiritual
level, which comes together

1668
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:31,880
which give us deeper insights of
these evolutionary swings during

1669
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:40,360
our last decades. Thank you.
David, saw a hand of you,

1670
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,800
please open up your microphone.
David, you're not audible.

1671
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:57,100
Unknown: You're Yeah, okay now,
yeah, I want to thank you both

1672
02:07:57,220 --> 02:08:03,720
so so much. That was so moving,
and I want us to be moved

1673
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:08,940
tonight. I mean, out of this, I
want us to be taking some

1674
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:15,360
action. I'm 80 now. I know I'm
in the final phase of my life.

1675
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:18,480
It might go on 20 years, or
whatever, whichever way you look

1676
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:23,300
at the mathematics, I'm in the
final phase of my life. I don't

1677
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:27,560
have children, so I haven't
passed on genes. But I've been

1678
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:32,660
thinking recently, it isn't only
genes. At this moment, the

1679
02:08:32,660 --> 02:08:36,920
important thing is passing on
memes. I'm going back to Richard

1680
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:41,800
Dawkins original formulation of
that he was looking for a

1681
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:48,160
sociological a social thing that
was transferred. And it's the

1682
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:53,080
means that we now pass on to
future generations that are

1683
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:56,680
important. And one of those
memes for me is unconditional

1684
02:08:56,680 --> 02:08:59,380
love. I can't go through the
story of how that's come up in

1685
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:04,620
my my life. I did my as a very
mature student. I did my masters

1686
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:07,800
in consciousness and
Transpersonal psychology on the

1687
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:11,340
title of from fear of the other
to unconditional love. I really

1688
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:16,560
looked into the nature of it.
But how do we move? How do we

1689
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:21,680
move from here we've got a
prevailing ecosystem of memes,

1690
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:27,980
which are separation, which, and
with separation comes you have

1691
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:31,340
to make up for this emptiness
somehow, as you say, we are, we

1692
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:35,300
are the one at our deepest
level. So separation leads us to

1693
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:39,140
greed and all all the things
that are happening. And so

1694
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:42,580
that's a prevailing ecosystem.
How do we change it? And

1695
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:46,000
sometimes, if you have a
prevailing ecosystem which

1696
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:51,160
dominates, there can be niches
in that eco system where new

1697
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:56,380
cells can form. And I see as a
and like this is a cell here

1698
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:59,800
tonight, and I'm a consciousness
only person. I think the nature

1699
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:03,660
of. Reality is consciousness,
and I think we underplay the

1700
02:10:03,660 --> 02:10:08,160
value of this Zoom meeting, for
example, we think we're all in

1701
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:12,360
separate places. We are, but
consciousness itself is non

1702
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:17,880
local. There's no separation
between our minds at this

1703
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:21,980
moment, if we were in the same
room, your words, Chris and do

1704
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:26,780
it? Do I they would be sounding
the same in our heads, whatever

1705
02:10:26,780 --> 02:10:30,740
the medium of transmission. So
right now, we're not separate

1706
02:10:30,860 --> 02:10:36,740
here. We're not separate now we
can communicate mind to mind,

1707
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:45,340
and sometimes species have
different phases of their, their

1708
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:50,380
E, of their individual
evolution. Like a fungus can

1709
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:53,860
have a phase as a spore, and
then it can come to earth and

1710
02:10:53,860 --> 02:10:57,340
then form, and I think there's a
great possibility in doing you

1711
02:10:57,340 --> 02:11:00,360
were talking about this, the of
the medium, right, like this,

1712
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:05,040
that we can form these cells of
spores at the moment, so we're

1713
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:09,360
ready to come to earth, and we
can begin to come to earth now.

1714
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:13,140
And I hope out of this meeting
tonight, there'll be a few

1715
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:18,120
people I want to be part of
cells now, looking at how we can

1716
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:22,820
transform. I I haven't had a
psychedelic path I took. I took

1717
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:29,300
acid once, 50 years ago, a new
girlfriend introduced me to it,

1718
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:37,280
and it blew my it blew my mind.
If I could have continued, if I

1719
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:40,600
could have got standardized
doses and proper supervision, I

1720
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:44,860
definitely would have continued,
but I probably wasn't ready for

1721
02:11:44,860 --> 02:11:50,140
it at that time. But I know that
the power come from one that one

1722
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:54,280
experience it, you know, it
changed a lot of things for me.

1723
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:59,080
So what I would like to do is
maybe the conveners of this

1724
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:02,220
meeting could do it. I'll put my
email address. And if anybody

1725
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:07,020
wants to form a cell tonight to
take up some of the themes we've

1726
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:10,020
been talking about, I would love
to be part of that cell, and I

1727
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:14,520
want it. I want us to move from
tonight. So thank you both very

1728
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,860
much for such a stimulating and
motivating tool.

1729
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:21,020
Chris Bache: Thank you, David.
And how do we change. How do we

1730
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:24,320
move forward? And when that,
when I'm asked that question in

1731
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:29,000
public lectures, I say, Read
Dwayne Elgin's book. Talk to

1732
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,760
Dwayne Elgin. So Dwayne, this
one's yours.

1733
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:38,960
Duane Elgin: Thank you both,
David. First thing I would say

1734
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:45,820
is that separation is, is, is
now breaking down, and like it

1735
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:50,800
or not, we're being pushed into
a sense of unity as a species

1736
02:12:50,860 --> 02:12:56,500
organism, and we need to step up
to take care of the emergencies

1737
02:12:56,500 --> 02:13:01,440
that surround us now. So first
of all, the separation is true,

1738
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:06,000
and it has been really amplified
by a consumerist, materialist

1739
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,960
mindset. But that mindset is
breaking down. It that is the

1740
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:13,920
mindset that's creating the the
crises that we're facing right

1741
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:19,140
now. So the first thing that
needs to happen is we withdraw

1742
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:23,420
legitimacy from that mindset,
that worldview, that paradigm,

1743
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:28,580
and and we are, we are
withdrawing legitimacy from that

1744
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:32,480
paradigm. If you look at the
young people on the planet,

1745
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:38,060
surveys show, a recent global
survey showed that 57% of young

1746
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:41,920
people feel we are doomed.
Quote, quote, we're doomed.

1747
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:46,780
That's what they were saying.
57% now the politicians are

1748
02:13:46,780 --> 02:13:52,240
certainly not saying that, the
the corporate people are not

1749
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:56,440
saying that. Typical academics
are not saying that, religious

1750
02:13:56,440 --> 02:14:01,140
leaders, traditionally are not
saying that. But it is surfacing

1751
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:04,740
in the world, nonetheless,
because that is the reality.

1752
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:07,860
It's breaking you know,
separation is breaking down, the

1753
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:12,060
legitimacy of the old
institutions is is declining.

1754
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:16,680
And so we have an opportunity to
choose new pathways ahead,

1755
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:21,500
personally, institutionally,
collectively. And so this is a

1756
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:26,660
an extraordinary time in human
history, when, when we do have a

1757
02:14:26,780 --> 02:14:31,160
we have freedom. There's this
interval of freedom that we have

1758
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:36,140
to make choices anew. And we
didn't have that like when I'm

1759
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:41,440
80 as well, David. And so when I
was young boy, there were not

1760
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:44,800
there wasn't the freedom to make
those kind of choices. But there

1761
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:50,380
is now, and so this is an
awakening, time for the human

1762
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:54,340
family, instead of time to use
the media and the computer

1763
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:59,140
systems and all the rest create
new memes. Create new memes for

1764
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:02,100
possibility. That's what Chris
is doing. That's what I'm doing.

1765
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:05,400
And it's clearly, it seems, what
you're doing as well. Keep

1766
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:09,480
going. We're just getting
started here. Keep going.

1767
02:15:11,279 --> 02:15:15,539
Chris Bache: Let me add a
footnote to that. When I was

1768
02:15:15,539 --> 02:15:18,959
doing my psychedelic work, I
never let my students know about

1769
02:15:18,959 --> 02:15:22,219
it, never talked about it. I
mean, I taught psychedelic

1770
02:15:22,219 --> 02:15:25,639
research, I taught Stan Grof
work, but I never let them know

1771
02:15:25,639 --> 02:15:30,019
that I was doing this work.
Personally, I only a few people

1772
02:15:30,019 --> 02:15:33,619
and a few friends in my
department knew what I was

1773
02:15:33,619 --> 02:15:39,619
doing. So I had these two
separate sides of my life. I had

1774
02:15:39,679 --> 02:15:42,939
a silo where I did my
psychedelic work, and then I'd

1775
02:15:42,939 --> 02:15:46,299
come to campus and I would be
doing my ordinary teaching work.

1776
02:15:47,139 --> 02:15:53,319
But what I found was that the
deeper I went in my psychedelic

1777
02:15:53,379 --> 02:15:57,999
work, the more the effects of
that work began to spill over

1778
02:15:57,999 --> 02:16:03,299
and show up in my classroom that
my students were being impacted

1779
02:16:03,719 --> 02:16:08,039
by my psychedelic journey. Even
though they weren't being

1780
02:16:08,039 --> 02:16:11,579
impacted, they weren't knowing
about it. They were I wasn't

1781
02:16:11,579 --> 02:16:14,579
talking about it. It wasn't a
physical impact. There was a

1782
02:16:14,579 --> 02:16:19,139
sort of a psychic impact. I
began to find that there was a

1783
02:16:19,139 --> 02:16:24,199
porosity, where I was beginning
to have access to aspects of

1784
02:16:24,199 --> 02:16:28,159
their life, where in my personal
experience, I was just answering

1785
02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:31,279
a question. I was reaching into
the fertile void of my

1786
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:34,699
imagination to answer a question
that a student was being asked.

1787
02:16:35,659 --> 02:16:38,539
But then I they would come up
and tell me that the answer that

1788
02:16:38,539 --> 02:16:43,479
I had given was an actual
reflecting, actually what was

1789
02:16:43,479 --> 02:16:47,619
happening in their life that
week, this time, and this was,

1790
02:16:47,679 --> 02:16:52,299
this was rattled me so badly
that I began to have to study

1791
02:16:52,659 --> 02:16:57,099
what the hell is going on here.
How can my personal work be had,

1792
02:16:57,099 --> 02:17:01,679
producing these collective
manifestations. And I worked on

1793
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:05,579
this for a long time, and
eventually I wrote to the book

1794
02:17:05,579 --> 02:17:09,599
The living classroom, which is
really not so much about

1795
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:12,479
teaching, it's about the
dynamics of the collective

1796
02:17:12,479 --> 02:17:17,759
psyche in groups. States of
consciousness. There is no such

1797
02:17:17,759 --> 02:17:21,619
thing as private realization.
States of consciousness are

1798
02:17:21,619 --> 02:17:25,459
inherently collective, an
awakened state of consciousness

1799
02:17:25,519 --> 02:17:29,599
naturally distributes out around
us. It's like throwing a rock in

1800
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:33,799
a lake. The ripples just spread
out when a person begins to

1801
02:17:33,799 --> 02:17:37,879
throw off the layers of
distortion and pain and begins

1802
02:17:37,879 --> 02:17:41,619
to enter into deeper and deeper
states of clarity, the people

1803
02:17:41,619 --> 02:17:45,939
around us are naturally,
spontaneously and inevitably,

1804
02:17:45,939 --> 02:17:49,119
are affected. Now, there are
things that we can do to

1805
02:17:49,119 --> 02:17:54,579
accelerate and intensify this
contagion. We can meet online.

1806
02:17:55,059 --> 02:17:59,199
We can we can dissolve distances
of 1000s of miles by bringing

1807
02:17:59,199 --> 02:18:02,039
our minds together in this one
space. And I believe

1808
02:18:02,039 --> 02:18:07,979
psychically, we energize the
field of this mind of this

1809
02:18:07,979 --> 02:18:11,819
collective space. If we did this
once a week, every week, for

1810
02:18:11,819 --> 02:18:15,839
several years, we would begin to
experience an even stronger

1811
02:18:15,839 --> 02:18:18,599
field, because it would be
influenced by Rupert Sheldrake

1812
02:18:18,599 --> 02:18:22,219
work and Morphic genetic field
theory, not just by the energy

1813
02:18:22,219 --> 02:18:26,779
of this particular group of
people, but by all the people

1814
02:18:26,779 --> 02:18:30,439
who had ever come together to
study or to discuss this

1815
02:18:30,439 --> 02:18:34,039
particular issue. And that's
what I found in my classes too,

1816
02:18:34,159 --> 02:18:37,999
that it wasn't just a matter of
my mind, kind of having a

1817
02:18:39,379 --> 02:18:43,779
derivative or an impact on the
present students, but the

1818
02:18:43,779 --> 02:18:47,439
students, in coming together to
study these things and to learn

1819
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:52,599
these things, were generating a
field, and the field persisted

1820
02:18:52,599 --> 02:18:56,499
after the students left, and it
was reinforced and deepened by

1821
02:18:56,619 --> 02:18:59,379
the field by the students who
came next semester, so that

1822
02:18:59,379 --> 02:19:01,739
there was A learning that was
taking place within the

1823
02:19:01,739 --> 02:19:04,859
semester, and there was a
learning that was taking place

1824
02:19:04,919 --> 02:19:10,199
across semesters over years and
years. So we have the psychic

1825
02:19:10,199 --> 02:19:16,139
reality that where one of us
goes, all of us go, to a degree,

1826
02:19:16,619 --> 02:19:19,979
but then we can reinforce that
by using the technology that

1827
02:19:19,979 --> 02:19:24,079
reinforces this collective
sharing, right? And it doesn't

1828
02:19:24,079 --> 02:19:27,019
have to be simply a psychic
distribution. It can be a

1829
02:19:27,019 --> 02:19:31,579
physical distribution and a
physical creativity, yeah, yeah.

1830
02:19:31,639 --> 02:19:32,419
Great question.

1831
02:19:32,420 --> 02:19:35,900
Bas de Cock: David, yeah. Thank
you. Thank you. I see through

1832
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:40,480
three questions, also question
the chat box will will serve for

1833
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:47,440
the end. And I want to say this
because David, I want to

1834
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:51,220
reassure you, this movement will
continue. And we, as wisdom

1835
02:19:51,220 --> 02:19:56,500
keepers, we already started this
trajectory of this movement. So

1836
02:19:56,740 --> 02:20:00,360
everyone has subscribed for this
wisdom keepers or the. Formal

1837
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:04,140
wisdom keepers will be invited
for our next wisdom keeper

1838
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:08,340
circle to keep this alive, and
doesn't matter where you want to

1839
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:14,400
share your Yeah, your your
future perspectives, or your

1840
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:19,260
ideas or etc, you were more than
invited in our next gathering.

1841
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:23,000
Our circle will be on the 18th
of February, that's on a

1842
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:27,500
Saturday, to have space for
everyone to want to be involved,

1843
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:32,540
to continue with the journey and
to learn to grow into maturity.

1844
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:35,900
So great question. David, thank
you.

1845
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:41,440
Unknown: Are they regular
meetings? How far apart are

1846
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:41,740
they?

1847
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:46,840
Bas de Cock: So we want monthly
because as youngsters, we and as

1848
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:51,760
youngsters, I feel I'm almost
50, a male, little bit younger,

1849
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:57,040
but you are youngsters. I do my
psychedelic training. I do my

1850
02:20:57,100 --> 02:21:01,200
psychedelic work. I'm a doctor.
I have a retreat center and etc,

1851
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:05,580
so monthly basis. But there are
a lot of groups where you can

1852
02:21:05,580 --> 02:21:09,780
share in, but you're more than
invited to to join and to to

1853
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:10,440
join together.

1854
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:15,480
Unknown: Yeah, I'll come. I'll
also put my email address in the

1855
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:19,440
in the chat box. Okay. Thank you
very much. I'll let the

1856
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:21,620
questions move on. Perfect.

1857
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:24,140
Bas de Cock: And I think it's,
and that's, that's an indirect

1858
02:21:24,140 --> 02:21:29,180
question. Council of Elders, as
we already discussed Chris

1859
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:33,560
during the LSD in the mind of
the universe. Course, I think

1860
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:36,560
it's wise to invite them as
well, just to open a space for

1861
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:41,200
wisdom keepers to to add their
wisdoms during the meeting so we

1862
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:46,060
can learn and thrive together.
So thank you for that. A

1863
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:48,940
question by Todd, please feel
open.

1864
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:54,700
Unknown: Okay, I'll be brief,
and already had my turn, but one

1865
02:21:54,700 --> 02:21:58,120
to mention to Dwayne. First of
all, thank you both again, for

1866
02:21:58,120 --> 02:22:01,140
everybody that shows up here for
being part of this living

1867
02:22:01,140 --> 02:22:04,680
classroom. But Dwayne, I had
captive here, and I might have

1868
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:08,040
shared with you previously, my
son is a college student and

1869
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:11,400
several of his friends for a
recent upper spring break, and

1870
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:14,520
we used your book choosing
Earth, and we had little

1871
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:18,300
assignments and play and deep
conversation. But I would offer

1872
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:23,240
is that, if we're not amongst
those of that age group, we're

1873
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,760
not realizing To what degree the
consciousness is already

1874
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:29,420
changing amongst those great
those folks. I mean, it's, it's

1875
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:32,360
palpably different, and the
questions that they're asking

1876
02:22:32,360 --> 02:22:35,360
are starting from a higher or
deeper level of consciousness.

1877
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:39,620
You know, I'm not to in any way
malign you two lovely 80 year

1878
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:42,520
olds, but I'm a great fan of the
actuarial tables. I mean, I

1879
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:48,520
think that's our our continuing
reincarnation blender. And so

1880
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:52,180
when you see these ones coming
up that are having the questions

1881
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:55,300
that they're grappling with have
already been answered in their

1882
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:59,080
line that previous generations
thought were not even questions

1883
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:02,220
were valid. So anyway,
appreciate CH, choosing Earth,

1884
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:04,800
and there are a lot of good
youth out there that are

1885
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:07,500
populating further and farther
and forward. So thank you and

1886
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:08,100
good night.

1887
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:11,160
Bas de Cock: Thank you. Thank
you. Tom,

1888
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:15,960
Chris Bache: aren't they just
amazing? They are so much

1889
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:19,200
farther along the young people
are than we were when we were

1890
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:22,160
their age. I mean, it's just,
it's like when, when the going

1891
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:26,060
gets tough, God sends in the A
team. You know, they are just

1892
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:29,360
extraordinary in their
capacities and their drive.

1893
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:32,840
Terry, you've got your hand up,

1894
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:38,240
Unknown: yeah, I do. And no
one's thanked the wisdom keepers

1895
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:42,580
yet. So thank you for putting
this on and thank you, Chris,

1896
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:47,560
I've been following you a bit
over the years. And Dwayne, I

1897
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:52,300
had never heard of you until I
read choosing Earth. So huge

1898
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:57,460
gratitude for giving that to us
for free. Really, really

1899
02:23:57,460 --> 02:24:05,040
appreciate that. And my question
has to do with the labor pains

1900
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:10,680
and the creative intelligence.
Is it is it in the realm of

1901
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:14,280
possibility that things like
like covid, like the climate,

1902
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:19,080
climate crisis, that they're
part of the labor pains to bring

1903
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:23,360
us into an awakening, an
awareness, a connection, a

1904
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:31,580
worldwide union of spiritual
souls, to know that, to know the

1905
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:35,120
truth and to move us forward
into a miraculous future.

1906
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:36,620
Bas de Cock: Yes,

1907
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:43,480
Duane Elgin: absolutely, yes,
indeed the trauma of the traumas

1908
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:48,340
of our time are catalysts for
awakening. And so a trauma is

1909
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:51,340
not something to avoid, but
rather to embrace, to learn from

1910
02:24:51,460 --> 02:24:57,040
and to rise above. And so we're
being pushed by the traumas of

1911
02:24:57,040 --> 02:25:01,440
our own creation. The this.
Region, extinction, resource

1912
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:05,940
depletion, climate crisis and so
on. These are these are things

1913
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:10,200
we're creating. But now we're
the our creations are coming

1914
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:15,720
back to impact us and and to
push us into a larger sense of

1915
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:20,100
who we are as a species, a
deeper sense of of what is going

1916
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:24,200
on here and where we're going.
So absolutely, this is a part of

1917
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:27,920
the labor pains of the birth of
a species, civilization and

1918
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:28,400
soul.

1919
02:25:28,580 --> 02:25:30,620
Unknown: Yes, thank you.

1920
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:37,700
Chris Bache: Yep, I really do.
Yeah. You don't need he got it.

1921
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:44,440
Yeah, you know what we're seeing
going into this century, where

1922
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:48,520
we are now, decade by decade,
things are going to be getting

1923
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:52,000
worse. It's going to be a deeper
unraveling, a deeper falling

1924
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,500
apart. We can see some of the
ways in which this is likely to

1925
02:25:56,500 --> 02:26:00,540
manifest. It's going to manifest
in ways that we can't anticipate

1926
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:03,900
quite yet, and it's going to
hurt like hell. But as Dwayne

1927
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:07,320
said, these are all. These are
problems of our own making.

1928
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:10,680
These are problems of our own
making. So we're going to have

1929
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:15,420
to confront that in us which has
made these problems. And I,

1930
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:19,980
again, I want to remind you who
is confronting this crisis,

1931
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:24,620
who's going to be going into
this global systems crisis, not

1932
02:26:24,620 --> 02:26:27,080
human beings, the way we
ordinarily think of human

1933
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:32,180
beings. Souls will be going into
this crisis. Each human being

1934
02:26:32,180 --> 02:26:36,140
carries multiple, multiple,
multiple incarnations woven into

1935
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:39,560
the fabric of their psyche and
into their body. That means that

1936
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:43,600
each human being is carrying
potentially 1000s of years of

1937
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:47,320
experience going into this
crisis. Some of those

1938
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:50,980
experiences are really negative
and kind of, you know,

1939
02:26:51,220 --> 02:26:55,960
destructive, but many of those
experiences are are mature,

1940
02:26:55,960 --> 02:27:00,400
wiser, and we, if we, if the
world is at odds with itself,

1941
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:04,440
our soul is also at odds with
itself. We're having to come to

1942
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:07,980
terms with our own limitations.
And the important point here is

1943
02:27:07,980 --> 02:27:12,360
that what's happening on the
world at large mirrors what's

1944
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:17,040
happening in the world in intra
psychically, the world is trying

1945
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:20,520
to become one, is trying to
confront the limitations of its

1946
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:25,700
past behaviors. But we carry
those, those behaviors. We carry

1947
02:27:25,700 --> 02:27:30,920
those tendencies inside our
psyches, so that as the world is

1948
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:34,700
struggling to become one, we are
struggling to become coherent

1949
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:38,300
within ourselves, to become one
soul. And I think there is a

1950
02:27:38,300 --> 02:27:43,780
synergy there, so that the the
the drivers of global systems

1951
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:49,420
crisis and global climate change
and and the various uh diseases

1952
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:53,800
that will be hitting us and so
on and so forth, those are

1953
02:27:53,800 --> 02:28:00,480
driving a global Awakening, and
simultaneously, they're driving

1954
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:05,100
an inner, internal awakening. So
it's a both hands situation.

1955
02:28:05,940 --> 02:28:09,180
Unknown: Thank you. Thank you
both. Thank you, Terry.

1956
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:15,300
Bas de Cock: It's amazing how
two and a half hours already

1957
02:28:15,300 --> 02:28:19,980
passed, and it feels like we're
just beginning. And that's it's

1958
02:28:19,980 --> 02:28:24,800
a beautiful thing. And I want to
create 10 more minutes for a

1959
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:27,440
rounding part. As we say,
psychedelics needs to be

1960
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:31,940
beautifully round before we go.
I want to invite someone didn't

1961
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,360
ask a question, but feel
somewhere deep inside itself.

1962
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:38,660
Want to ask a question, to think
about it, to have this

1963
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:43,240
opportunity to ask or to share
somewhat something. I want also

1964
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:48,460
to give the opportunity to Mayo,
to ask a question from whatever

1965
02:28:48,460 --> 02:28:54,880
sort it is. I go to the chat box
now, because I saw there was a

1966
02:28:55,480 --> 02:29:03,240
question Kim coming in, and I
have to see where it is. Sorry,

1967
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:20,160
so I can't find a question now,
okay, so please, so I can't find

1968
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:23,600
a question in the in the in the
chat box. Now if you have put

1969
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:27,440
the question in the chat box,
please feel open to to raise

1970
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:31,340
your hand and ask us the
question. Lively mayo, please go

1971
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:32,960
ahead and then Michelle, I saw
your

1972
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:36,860
Unknown: me. Okay, doing Chris,
I love you guys. There's nothing

1973
02:29:36,860 --> 02:29:40,220
more to say. But I love you guys
as much as I love everyone else.

1974
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:43,300
As David said, we are
consciousness. And even even

1975
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:47,200
though we are utilizing some of
the systems, some of the actual

1976
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:50,500
technologies that perhaps might
have brought us here, in this

1977
02:29:50,860 --> 02:29:55,600
time, in our world, faster than
in the evolutionary history, we

1978
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:58,540
are connected. And this is what
matters the most, for me and

1979
02:29:58,540 --> 02:30:02,520
hopefully for everyone else. My
question for both Chris and

1980
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:06,720
Dewayne, Chris, you mentioned
compassion, as well as Wayne,

1981
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:10,020
you mentioned suffering, and in
the other face of suffering,

1982
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:14,340
there's compassion, and with
that, there is beyond personal

1983
02:30:14,340 --> 02:30:18,300
compassion and beyond collective
compassion. But what are the

1984
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:24,980
three practical steps that we
can take today to gain this

1985
02:30:24,980 --> 02:30:27,920
sense of compassion for Chris
and Dewayne. What are three

1986
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:32,360
practical or at least give us
one practical application in a

1987
02:30:32,360 --> 02:30:36,260
sense, I'm looking forward to
what does communication? How

1988
02:30:36,260 --> 02:30:40,780
does that play a role in this
sharing, in this understanding

1989
02:30:40,780 --> 02:30:43,540
of compassion from our
humanness, not from the

1990
02:30:43,540 --> 02:30:46,960
individuality, but from the
humanness that ties us all into

1991
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:47,860
this soul,

1992
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:51,460
Bas de Cock: enriched life.
Yeah,

1993
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:57,700
Chris Bache: good question. Huh?
Dwayne asking us to put it on

1994
02:30:57,700 --> 02:31:03,900
the line here, yeah, give us
three specific things you want

1995
02:31:03,900 --> 02:31:05,460
to take. The first one, golly,

1996
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:09,120
Duane Elgin: I'm going to give
one that I think he would be

1997
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:14,520
surprised with. So what Heck, I
was going to be a doctor early

1998
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:18,780
on in life, as I mentioned at
the outset, and I was thinking

1999
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:23,900
about being a vet or a doctor.
And so one thing that I do when

2000
02:31:23,900 --> 02:31:28,100
I look at the world and how we
humans are creating it, I look

2001
02:31:28,100 --> 02:31:33,800
at animal rescue videos. And I
tell you, if you look at at the

2002
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:38,060
creatures of the earth and
different parts of the earth,

2003
02:31:38,300 --> 02:31:43,360
and you go online and say, well,
dog rescues or animal rescue.

2004
02:31:43,540 --> 02:31:47,560
And the videos start coming up,
and it just breaks the heart

2005
02:31:47,560 --> 02:31:53,320
open and and the the love for
the well being of all life, not

2006
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:58,360
just human life, all life is
just floods into your heart,

2007
02:31:58,360 --> 02:32:01,620
your soul, your mind, your
consciousness. If you look at

2008
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:05,880
the suffering of animals and and
say, well, it could be better.

2009
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:09,780
It doesn't have to be like that.
Why do they have to suffer so

2010
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:15,960
much? Well, it it pushes back
against us. So number one, I

2011
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:22,580
would say, go online and just
look at videos of animals and

2012
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:29,240
dogs and cats and so on and and
how they're suffering. And this

2013
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:32,840
is goes beyond whether we eat
meat or not. This has to do with

2014
02:32:32,840 --> 02:32:37,460
life and how it's being lived by
the rest of the creature on this

2015
02:32:37,460 --> 02:32:41,680
earth that we share it with. So
that would be one. It's really,

2016
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:42,640
really powerful.

2017
02:32:44,740 --> 02:32:47,860
Chris Bache: I agree. Dwayne,
the thing that came into my mind

2018
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:53,740
first was take some suffering
out of the world. Look at our

2019
02:32:53,740 --> 02:32:58,120
lives. Take some suffering out
of the world, not only just

2020
02:32:58,120 --> 02:33:01,980
between human beings, leading
towards a gentler life and a

2021
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:06,420
clearer life, but towards other
species. Look at how our life is

2022
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:10,500
impacting and causing suffering
in the world, and take it out in

2023
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:13,620
spiritual practice and in
Buddhist practice, for example,

2024
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:16,560
the first thing you do when you
begin any meditation, any

2025
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:20,600
practice is you cultivate
bodhicitta, which is the

2026
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:24,440
cultivating the desire to save
all sentient beings, which is

2027
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:27,860
you're doing this practice, not
for yourself. The last thing you

2028
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:30,380
do at the end of the practice is
you do what's called the

2029
02:33:30,380 --> 02:33:33,740
distribution of merit. You take
all the merit that you've

2030
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:37,100
generated with the practice and
you give it away. You give it

2031
02:33:37,100 --> 02:33:40,900
away to all levels of the being,
because this is an attempt to

2032
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:44,980
shatter the illusion of
individual enlightenment. We do

2033
02:33:44,980 --> 02:33:48,280
not do these practices for
ourselves. It's not about

2034
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:52,240
personal transformation. It's
about collective transformation,

2035
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:58,300
and in terms of taking suffering
out of the world. Dwayne, how

2036
02:33:58,300 --> 02:34:03,000
could you not mention your work,
voluntary simplicity, the first

2037
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:07,020
book you wrote, right? Yeah,
this is, this is common sense

2038
02:34:07,140 --> 02:34:11,880
for world that's living over its
means. Voluntary simplicity.

2039
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:16,680
Simpler, simple, not in order to
starve yourself or deny

2040
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:20,780
yourself, but simpler in order
to liberate yourself, in order

2041
02:34:20,780 --> 02:34:25,520
to integrate yourself, to give
yourself options that you don't

2042
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:30,380
have if you're committed to
complexity, affluence and so on

2043
02:34:30,380 --> 02:34:36,980
and so forth. So gentler, shared
and simpler.

2044
02:34:37,640 --> 02:34:42,460
Unknown: Yeah, yeah. Great.
Thanks so much. And with with

2045
02:34:42,460 --> 02:34:49,900
that, something that both of you
created a an important note on

2046
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:56,200
is using media as tool. Yes, how
can we utilize the media? And

2047
02:34:56,200 --> 02:35:00,660
David also spoke about circles,
besides watching video. Of

2048
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:05,220
animals, and also the suffering
that we have as as a world. What

2049
02:35:05,220 --> 02:35:08,580
are some ways that media can
impact what? What can we build?

2050
02:35:08,580 --> 02:35:12,000
How can we build these, these,
these real connections with

2051
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,360
other human beings through these
videos? Are there any projects

2052
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:19,500
that both of you are involved
that maybe we can jump on or or

2053
02:35:19,740 --> 02:35:23,240
expand on that Wayne,

2054
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:28,340
Duane Elgin: well, great
question. The choosing Earth

2055
02:35:28,340 --> 02:35:34,040
project, choosing earth.org
really is attempting to do this

2056
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:38,240
build networks of care and
compassion for the well being of

2057
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:42,280
all life that's explicit in the
work that we're doing. It's not

2058
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:46,780
just for we humans, it's for all
life. We all rise or fall

2059
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:52,600
together. And so let's build the
relationships of awareness, of

2060
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:57,760
compassion, of love, on behalf
of the well being of all life.

2061
02:35:58,060 --> 02:36:02,760
And it's just exploding onto the
earth right now, and they're

2062
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:08,700
just countless avenues for
tapping into the creativity, the

2063
02:36:08,700 --> 02:36:13,440
consciousness and the care, the
compassion, it's there and and

2064
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:16,320
we need to meet what the
opportunity that's now

2065
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:20,240
available, and I'm thinking of
young people as well At the same

2066
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:25,520
time and how far along this path
they are relative to we adults,

2067
02:36:25,580 --> 02:36:30,320
we olders. And by the way, I
don't think Chris is nowhere

2068
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:32,480
near 80. He's a kid on the

2069
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:34,580
Unknown: block. Oh, I'm only
7373

2070
02:36:36,320 --> 02:36:39,260
Duane Elgin: he's got a long
ways to go, so

2071
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:44,680
Chris Bache: in the broader to
sort of push beyond the sort of

2072
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:54,580
specific media question. I don't
think, to bring this revolution

2073
02:36:54,580 --> 02:36:57,220
about, to bring this
transformation about, it's going

2074
02:36:57,220 --> 02:37:01,500
to take just all of the skills
that we have all the capacities

2075
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:04,860
had. It's going to take doctors.
Can take social activists. Going

2076
02:37:04,860 --> 02:37:07,860
to take educators. It's going to
take politicians. It's going to

2077
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:11,880
take artists. It's going to take
musicians. It's if we start

2078
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:15,180
making an itemized list of what
we need to do, then we

2079
02:37:15,180 --> 02:37:19,620
inevitably shrink to some kind
something that reflects our own

2080
02:37:19,620 --> 02:37:23,840
personal strengths are on our
personal agenda. I think the the

2081
02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:30,800
issue is not figuring out what
we can do. I don't think that's

2082
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:35,060
the hard part. The hard part is
finding the courage within

2083
02:37:35,060 --> 02:37:39,200
ourselves to do with what we
know we can do. Right here,

2084
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:43,000
right now, we are already
standing on the spot where we

2085
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:46,480
have chosen to stand as our
awareness. As we come into

2086
02:37:46,480 --> 02:37:51,100
awareness, do we have the
courage to do what we know we

2087
02:37:51,220 --> 02:37:56,560
can do without delay, right now
or not? And everyone of us who

2088
02:37:56,560 --> 02:37:59,200
asks, Who is willing to do that,
we're going to do different

2089
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:02,520
things because we have different
aptitudes, different agendas,

2090
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:05,640
different karmic trajectories.
We don't need to do what

2091
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:09,180
somebody else is doing. We just
need to do what we have the

2092
02:38:09,180 --> 02:38:13,980
capacity to do, right here,
right now, as deeply as we can.

2093
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:19,980
And in that lies, I think, a
deep existential satisfaction in

2094
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:23,420
that we can come to the end of
our life and know we did our

2095
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:26,720
part, and that's what we want,
isn't it? We want to know that

2096
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:31,160
we did our part as deeply as we
could Yeah, right. Great

2097
02:38:31,160 --> 02:38:31,700
question.

2098
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:35,360
Unknown: Thank you so much, both
of you for existing and for

2099
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:38,960
showering us with Your wisdom
and all of your energy. We

2100
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:41,920
really appreciate who you are
and what you are for all of us.

2101
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:44,320
Thank you. You're very welcome.
Thank you,

2102
02:38:48,400 --> 02:38:52,180
Bas de Cock: Michelle. Michelle
adeby, you had a question.

2103
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:58,300
Unknown: Thank you, bass. Just
listening to the last two

2104
02:38:58,300 --> 02:39:02,580
answers has just brought up more
questions, so I'll hold those my

2105
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:05,640
original question really
projects far, far into the

2106
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:11,100
future and arises from some of
my own visions that I've had

2107
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:17,520
through meditation and at this
point in our this historical

2108
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:24,680
point as we are at the ends of
our experiment of separation and

2109
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:30,380
materialism, within that
context, we're held within this

2110
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:33,500
very dense physical body.

2111
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:35,660
So

2112
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:41,920
Chris, in your journeys, have
you journeyed to the point or

2113
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:47,020
seen that place where there's no
longer a need for this physical,

2114
02:39:47,080 --> 02:39:51,760
dense form, where we actually
are consciousness in our

2115
02:39:51,880 --> 02:39:56,500
etheric, emotional, causal
bodies. We don't need a physical

2116
02:39:56,500 --> 02:39:59,920
body anymore, but we are living
this experience.

2117
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,380
Bas de Cock: In this

2118
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:05,760
Unknown: altered reality, I
suppose it wouldn't be this

2119
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:07,080
dense physical reality.

2120
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:13,860
Chris Bache: Yeah, you know, I
don't question, but that that is

2121
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:16,560
a potential that can be
actualized, and may be

2122
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:20,460
actualized over the long course
of our evolutionary trajectory.

2123
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:26,300
But my focus has been different.
And I think that, I think that

2124
02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:29,360
we have, we're coming out of a
period of history about 5000

2125
02:40:29,720 --> 02:40:34,220
years old, where we have had a
kind of a transcendent

2126
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:39,500
orientation all the religions of
the Axial Age of about the last

2127
02:40:39,500 --> 02:40:44,140
three to 5000 years. I think
what happened was we began to

2128
02:40:44,140 --> 02:40:48,460
have experiential access to the
mother universe. We began to be

2129
02:40:48,460 --> 02:40:51,340
able to go deep enough with our
meditation, yoga, we our

2130
02:40:51,340 --> 02:40:55,420
psychedelics, began to tap into
the mother universe. And when we

2131
02:40:55,420 --> 02:41:00,180
did that, we expected joy,
bliss, ecstasy. Clearly, this is

2132
02:41:00,180 --> 02:41:04,560
home. This is where we belong.
This is where we want to be. And

2133
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:10,320
that leads, leads to a story of
the fall and then salvation to

2134
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:13,920
get home. The whole project is
to get home, to go back home,

2135
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:18,300
and that the ramifications of
that are to value Transcendence

2136
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:22,820
over immanence, and devalue
spirit over the physical body. I

2137
02:41:22,820 --> 02:41:28,400
understand that and that that we
have echoes of that. But I think

2138
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:33,260
now in the 20th century, 21st
Century, now that science has

2139
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:36,500
pulled back the curtain and
shown us how old the universe is

2140
02:41:36,620 --> 02:41:42,220
and how big it is, we measure it
in light years, 6 million

2141
02:41:42,220 --> 02:41:45,940
million miles in one light year,
and we measure it in billions

2142
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:51,640
and billions of light years, so
big, so old, and so filled with

2143
02:41:51,640 --> 02:41:55,600
genius that it doesn't really
have the same appeal to say the

2144
02:41:55,600 --> 02:42:00,600
goal is to leave it behind. And
so the My Work what? And it's

2145
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:05,040
not my work. None of my sessions
are my work. I just opened up

2146
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:08,520
and let the universe talk to me,
and what it talks to me about is

2147
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:13,680
embodying spirituality,
transforming the body, bringing

2148
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:16,260
it in deeper and deeper and
deeper into the body that

2149
02:42:16,260 --> 02:42:20,180
literally it changes our
biochemistry. It changes it

2150
02:42:20,180 --> 02:42:23,960
allows us not only to be
healthier, but allows us to live

2151
02:42:23,960 --> 02:42:28,340
longer. Sri Aurobindo thought it
would take, his calculation was

2152
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:31,940
it would take 300 years of
continuous spiritual practice

2153
02:42:32,060 --> 02:42:35,780
before we could begin to become
biologically self regenerating,

2154
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:39,980
and we could basically live
forever in a human body. It

2155
02:42:39,980 --> 02:42:43,000
doesn't need to break down, but
we have to increase the energy

2156
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:46,840
within it, but first, we have to
extend the life expectancy, to

2157
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:50,440
give us the 300 years to allow
us to do that type of practice.

2158
02:42:50,860 --> 02:42:56,140
His vision also is towards doing
more and more and more spiritual

2159
02:42:56,140 --> 02:43:01,140
stuff inside the beauty of the
physical universe, to become co

2160
02:43:01,140 --> 02:43:05,160
creators with the physical
universe. Now, whether there are

2161
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:09,360
some aspects of this whole thing
which are purely transcendental,

2162
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:13,800
sure, why not? You know how many
physical universes are there? We

2163
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:17,640
don't know. We have reasons. We
know. You know, we know. We

2164
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:22,940
don't know, so we don't know how
big the entire arena is that we

2165
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,260
can incarnate into

2166
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:30,560
Duane Elgin: I'd like to reply
to that as well. Wonderful

2167
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:37,280
question, very interesting
question. First of all, I would

2168
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:40,120
point out that our universe,
even though it's 13 point 8

2169
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:46,060
billion years old in cosmic
time. That's an just an instant,

2170
02:43:46,060 --> 02:43:52,000
a cosmic instant. And my guess
is that, in addition to, and not

2171
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:57,460
just my guess is that in
addition to our universe, we are

2172
02:43:57,460 --> 02:44:03,060
embedded within the life force
of a of a mother universe. So

2173
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:06,960
we're a daughter universe
embedded in the spaciousness of

2174
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:11,220
a mother universe. The mother
universe is completely unbounded

2175
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:15,000
in terms of dimensional
constraints. Here we are living

2176
02:44:15,360 --> 02:44:18,900
in the second, third, fourth
dimension, and that means we're

2177
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:22,460
just a couple of steps above a
black hole. We're just getting

2178
02:44:22,460 --> 02:44:26,480
started here, three dimensions,
four dimensions. That's nothing

2179
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:33,380
in in the scale and the depth of
the mother universe. And so a

2180
02:44:33,380 --> 02:44:37,760
body is very useful. If you're
going to be confined to 234,

2181
02:44:38,360 --> 02:44:44,080
dimensions, get a body for that.
But if you're living in the in

2182
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:49,060
the context of the mother
universe and the the aliveness

2183
02:44:49,060 --> 02:44:53,860
that goes vastly dimensionally
beyond 234, dimensions into 200

2184
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:59,380
300 400 dimensions, who knows
what kind of vehicle is most

2185
02:44:59,380 --> 02:45:03,780
appropriate? Fitting for that
journey. So but here we are,

2186
02:45:03,780 --> 02:45:06,480
though, we're just getting
started. We're early in the in

2187
02:45:06,540 --> 02:45:11,580
the evolutionary game, I think.
And so let's embrace the

2188
02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:15,840
physicality that we have,
knowing that deeper and further

2189
02:45:15,900 --> 02:45:20,280
in the evolutionary journey is
the transcendent possibility of

2190
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:25,460
hyper dimensionality and new
forms of being and learning and

2191
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:28,220
loving and living. So, yeah,

2192
02:45:30,140 --> 02:45:32,960
Chris Bache: great. Your hand
up.

2193
02:45:37,700 --> 02:45:45,520
Unknown: Yes. Thank you both my
dears, friends I would like to

2194
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:50,800
just build upon and add another
thought to the question that was

2195
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:55,480
posed about I think, what can we
do now? Whatever the masculine

2196
02:45:55,480 --> 02:46:04,680
three things a numerical
position and Chris, I loved what

2197
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:07,980
you said about each individual,
because we're all, you know,

2198
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:13,980
unique expressions of the great
whole will do something unique

2199
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:17,460
and different, all necessary and
all absolutely equal in

2200
02:46:17,460 --> 02:46:23,000
importance, absolutely and so to
that, I want to say that while

2201
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:27,140
we're thinking of media and ways
of doing hyper connectivity and

2202
02:46:27,140 --> 02:46:35,540
broad scale connectivity to to
understand that we are ourselves

2203
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:39,680
right between our ears is the
Greatest motherboard of all. And

2204
02:46:40,940 --> 02:46:44,260
any thought we have thought, I'm
not even talking about words

2205
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:49,240
now, but any thought we have
when we talk about morphogenetic

2206
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:53,920
fields is broadcast to these
reaches of the universe to which

2207
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:59,260
you were just referring, Dwayne.
There's no end point on this

2208
02:46:59,260 --> 02:47:04,800
stuff. So if you want to start
contributing as broadly and as

2209
02:47:04,800 --> 02:47:08,460
powerfully as you can at this
from this second on, become a

2210
02:47:08,460 --> 02:47:13,740
great student of your own
thoughts and learn to notice

2211
02:47:13,740 --> 02:47:18,120
them and check in. Is this
really what I want to be

2212
02:47:18,120 --> 02:47:23,240
contributing, both to this being
that's housed in this body, in

2213
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:26,660
terms of my physical, mental,
spiritual, emotional health, but

2214
02:47:26,660 --> 02:47:29,660
also, is this what I want to
project out to uplift all of

2215
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:34,940
humanity and beyond, and if, if
it is great, keep doing more of

2216
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:38,480
it. If it's not course correct,
do a tweak here or there,

2217
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:44,500
elevate just a tad. And know
that in that moment, you're

2218
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:49,480
doing a great and massive and
infinite contribution. And to

2219
02:47:49,480 --> 02:47:55,240
just add another thought, all of
our encounters, however random

2220
02:47:55,300 --> 02:48:00,120
or unimportant in quotes they
may seem to be. And again, we

2221
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:03,360
all go to the grocery store and
we say thank you to the clerk,

2222
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:08,820
if we're not scanning our own
groceries just for a beat, hold

2223
02:48:08,820 --> 02:48:12,180
that eye contact so that you
know you've touched soul to

2224
02:48:12,180 --> 02:48:16,500
soul, and trust that that
reverberates out infinitely

2225
02:48:16,920 --> 02:48:19,800
because that person we were both
nourished by that interaction.

2226
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:24,836
Both of us connected. We found,
you know, it's, it's what

2227
02:48:24,836 --> 02:48:29,936
Ubuntu, you know, it's, I see
you and you see me. Therefore we

2228
02:48:29,936 --> 02:48:36,596
exist. So yes, yes, all of the
big, loud and broad things we

2229
02:48:36,596 --> 02:48:42,340
can do, but never underestimate
that we can do all of that in an

2230
02:48:42,340 --> 02:48:45,520
instant from where we are with
what is in us right now.

2231
02:48:46,060 --> 02:48:49,180
Yes, amen. Thank you,

2232
02:48:51,100 --> 02:48:53,200
Bas de Cock: beautiful
contribution. Eve. Thank you so

2233
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:57,100
much, and it adds so much up to
to our first wisdom keeper we

2234
02:48:57,100 --> 02:49:01,420
had in our wisdom. Keep
scattering cute curve and oh

2235
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:06,900
yes, speaking about the hologram
and the information field, where

2236
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:12,240
we can add all our information,
what we transmit directly to

2237
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:16,620
this information field, and and,
and looking at the clerk, really

2238
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:21,260
sensing the souls, it's amazing
information adding up to to the

2239
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:24,080
mind of the universe. So thank
you for that. And if you want to

2240
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:29,180
see the former wisdom keepers
gatherings in the chat box, you

2241
02:49:29,180 --> 02:49:34,100
find the most upper parts the
YouTube channel. So if you want

2242
02:49:34,100 --> 02:49:39,260
to look look at back, feel free
to do so. I feel we don't want

2243
02:49:39,260 --> 02:49:41,920
to go home. We're already home,
but we don't want to leave this

2244
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:47,860
setting, and that's a beautiful
set of setting we created all

2245
02:49:47,860 --> 02:49:51,400
together. I invite one more
question, and then I have to be

2246
02:49:51,400 --> 02:49:56,620
strict as a moderator. So if one
feels very urgently want to ask

2247
02:49:56,620 --> 02:49:59,260
a question or to share
something, feel free to open up

2248
02:49:59,260 --> 02:50:02,880
your microphone. Home. It's on a
random occasion.

2249
02:50:04,980 --> 02:50:06,660
Chris Bache: Let me try
something. May I make a little

2250
02:50:06,660 --> 02:50:10,860
different suggestion? Boss, I'd
like to, and I'd like to just

2251
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:15,480
take this opportunity to the
end, to thank the group, because

2252
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:18,420
I know that Dwayne and I have
been carrying the weight of some

2253
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:22,160
of the discussion, but boy, what
an extraordinary group this is.

2254
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:26,900
Yes, all each one of you have
come into this moment in time

2255
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:33,080
with a long history, long series
of development and the minds and

2256
02:50:33,080 --> 02:50:35,660
the bodies and the awareness
which you brought to this

2257
02:50:35,660 --> 02:50:40,060
conversation made it the
conversation that it became. I

2258
02:50:40,060 --> 02:50:44,200
have expressed such deep
appreciation, not only to bass

2259
02:50:44,200 --> 02:50:48,340
and the mayo, but to all of you
for coming together, for holding

2260
02:50:48,340 --> 02:50:52,420
these questions, for for holding
this driving force which is

2261
02:50:52,420 --> 02:50:56,260
taking us all forward. Thank
you. Thank you so very much.

2262
02:50:56,440 --> 02:51:00,220
Bas de Cock: Yes, yes. Thank
you. Chris. Bye,

2263
02:51:05,160 --> 02:51:07,560
Unknown: I would like everybody
to put a heart up on their

2264
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:10,740
screen and share a bit of love
at the end.

2265
02:51:12,780 --> 02:51:14,040
I don't know how to do that,

2266
02:51:14,700 --> 02:51:17,100
under reactions, under
reactions,

2267
02:51:18,480 --> 02:51:27,200
Bas de Cock: or use your usual
hands, okay, sending love from

2268
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:31,880
this space to all, and it's all
felt as a community, dear

2269
02:51:31,880 --> 02:51:37,220
family. Thank you for your
contribution, the donation as a

2270
02:51:37,220 --> 02:51:42,340
gift, as you all contributed, as
it as a community. Beautiful

2271
02:51:42,340 --> 02:51:46,720
energy is coming to the choosing
Earth project, so send it

2272
02:51:47,860 --> 02:51:53,800
tomorrow, and let's go on
together as a family, and we see

2273
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:58,060
each other along. So thank you
for joining and love from this

2274
02:51:58,060 --> 02:52:04,140
space. Thank you. Chris Dwayne
for your work and for your

2275
02:52:04,140 --> 02:52:06,360
wisdoms. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

2276
02:52:13,380 --> 02:52:14,340
Bye, bye, everybody.

2277
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:19,020
Unknown: Namaste, everybody.
Ciao, ciao. Ciao,

2278
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:46,240
Bas de Cock: you Nice seeing you
again. Bridget David,

2279
02:52:48,580 --> 02:52:49,360
Unknown: let's talk.

2280
02:52:50,800 --> 02:52:51,940
Bas de Cock: It's long time go.

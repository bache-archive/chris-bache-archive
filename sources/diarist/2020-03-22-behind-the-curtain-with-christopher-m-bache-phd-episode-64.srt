1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:42,980
Unknown: Like a smile, another
side I truly live. All right,

2
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,120
are you doing good? Nice to meet
you.

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:54,160
Frank McCaughey: Frank,
likewise. All right. Well done

4
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,060
on the book.

5
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,420
Chris Bache: Thank you. Thank
you, pleasure.

6
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,500
Frank McCaughey: Not only
because obviously writing a

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,560
book, in and of itself is an
achievement, but the nature of

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,920
this particular book, yeah,
yeah, I'm almost exhausted

9
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,300
reading some of us, if you know,
I've read a good bit. I'm

10
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,920
exhausted because of the the
journeys. Yeah,

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
Chris Bache: yeah. It was quite
a journey. Always hard to

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,880
summarize in any meaningful way
in a one hour podcast or

13
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,560
whatever, but, but certainly a
message that I'm looking forward

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,760
to bringing into the world.

15
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,560
Frank McCaughey: Yeah, where do
you begin? I mean, you can begin

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,500
at the start, which is always
the easiest way. But I suppose,

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,920
well, actually, you know what we
but I might just ask it, because

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,500
it's, it's ongoing this before
we even get into the book, I

19
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,020
suppose ask you is, in a way, I
feel it's, it's a big part of

20
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,980
the book, just anyway. But how
are you now? How are things? How

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,420
is life now?

22
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,460
Chris Bache: Life is very good
now, especially now that I've

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
finally written the book and
finally I've gone public with

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,500
this, him going public with
this, that has been a very

25
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,840
healing and deepening
experience, actually, to claim

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,620
my memories, to claim those
experiences, and to begin to

27
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,440
speak about them without
inhibition, has has deepened my

28
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,400
integration of those experiences
in my life. And I don't know

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,960
where it's going, I suspect in
three years, I may be in a very

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,500
different place than I am now,
and I'm in a good place now.

31
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,620
Frank McCaughey: Okay, yeah, and
what we're talking about is, so

32
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,360
the title of the book is LSD and
the mind of the universe, and

33
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:04,020
it's basically a documentation
of 73 high dose LSD sessions,

34
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,400
trips, and everything that comes
with that, and all your

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:18,060
insights. So maybe let's begin
at start, because it's I think

36
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,560
anybody who's taken a
psychedelic will know,

37
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,140
especially one, if you've gone
on one big trip, you know, yeah,

38
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:36,440
73 is like 73 babies. 73
childbirth, you know, yeah. So

39
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,160
maybe let's start at the start.
Yeah, what? Okay, you didn't

40
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,240
know at the start that this is
what you what was going to

41
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,380
happen. It just you took a trip
and you documented it, but you

42
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,080
didn't know you're going to keep
going and going over this long

43
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,800
period of time.

44
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,359
Unknown: What happened was,
fresh out of graduate school, 29

45
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:59,079
years old, in the middle of my
Saturn Return. Didn't know that

46
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,479
yet, at the time, had finished
my dissertation. Was looking for

47
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,919
where to take my research. I was
a brand new professor of

48
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,399
religious studies at Youngstown
State University, and I read

49
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:14,399
Stanislav Grof realms of the
human unconscious had just been

50
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:19,739
published. To read it in 1978 I
saw that I thought, I got to get

51
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,879
in on this. This is just
fantastic. It's not only extra

52
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,659
ordinary for psychology, but
it'll have enormous implications

53
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:32,539
for philosophy of religion as
well. So I, I felt the draw. I

54
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:37,039
felt like I had found my life's
work. I started the work. I knew

55
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,119
that you had to, you know, to
write truly out of an

56
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:43,599
experiential basis. First you
had to do your work, and that

57
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,139
meant doing an unspecified
number of sessions. I started

58
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,299
with three low dose sessions. Me
about 200 micrograms, got my

59
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:55,779
bearings, got my feet wet, and
then I shifted in the fourth

60
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:00,359
session to high dose sessions. I
started I worked at 500 To 600

61
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,739
micrograms consistently all the
way through, which is not a

62
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:07,859
protocol that I recommend. And
yes, you know in the book, I

63
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:12,659
strongly do not recommend this
protocol for reasons I explained

64
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:17,579
in the book, but basically
recorded, documented as

65
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:22,459
carefully as I could, kept all
the variables as consistent as I

66
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:26,359
could. I think one of the things
that makes this story unusual is

67
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,739
not just the depth of where it
went, but the stabilization of

68
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:35,539
the variables in 20 years.
Always the same sitter, same

69
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,799
sentence, setting, same physical
location, Northeast Ohio, couple

70
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:44,499
places within Northeast Ohio,
same medicine, same dose, same

71
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:49,119
protocol for recovering memories
of the session. So I think that

72
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:54,459
established a very unusually
stable listening post as I

73
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,799
entered into this dialog with
the universe.

74
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,720
Frank McCaughey: Yeah, I always
admire works of patience. And 20

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:14,100
years is, is a work of is, yeah,
is patience. And I I like, in a

76
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,520
way, how, when you're
approaching the psychedelics at

77
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,340
the moment, obviously, you get a
huge amount of coverage there. I

78
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,180
suppose if you're into the
subject at all, it seems to be

79
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,480
everywhere, and in especially in
the last six or seven years,

80
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,960
it's in mainstream media, all of
the work, and then you have all

81
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,180
these conferences. But the harsh
side of, let's say, the dark

82
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,480
side of psychedelics are not
spoken about. Maybe they are. I

83
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,400
feel that they're not as well
documented in terms of the

84
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,840
levels to which the mind you,
the places you can go. And I

85
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,920
feel you really have captured
that so because that really

86
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,400
comes across very early on, and
we don't want to give away the

87
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,980
entire book, obviously, and
going through it, but it does,

88
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,760
you do capture the, yeah, I
mean, this is not like somebody

89
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,840
is going and getting high with
friends for 73 times. Obviously,

90
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,300
you've just said that you go
through your, you had your

91
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,000
rigorous sort of process, but
you are going into the depths of

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,700
suffering, living and being
suffering, and how to go, how do

93
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,380
you go back into that every time
knowing it's like, you know

94
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,800
you're getting suited and ready
for war, almost,

95
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,640
Chris Bache: yeah, in a way. I
mean, you have to go through the

96
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,660
same type of mental preparation
that a soldier does before

97
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,740
battle and a mother does before
labor, you just really be

98
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,340
focused, internalized and ready
for whatever the day may bring.

99
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,140
You know at the end of the first
chapter, I said the single

100
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,680
greatest concern I have about
bringing the story of my journey

101
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,880
forward is the amount of
suffering that it contains. And

102
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,140
so I take some time to try to
explain to the reader to prepare

103
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,200
the reader for what this
suffering, suffering represents,

104
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,280
and specifically the suffering
of death and rebirth. This is,

105
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,580
this is one of the natural
components of deep work with

106
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,720
psychedelics that in order to
move into a deeper state of

107
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,660
consciousness, a state of
consciousness where you can

108
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,680
experience things that the
physical consciousness cannot

109
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,420
experience. You must surrender
deeply your attachment to your

110
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,440
physical consciousness, to your
embodied identity, and you go

111
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,520
through a Death-Rebirth process.
It's that first level of death

112
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,360
and rebirth around ego. Death, I
think, is frequently discussed

113
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,360
and honored in the therapeutic
discussion. But what I think is

114
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,200
less attended to is the fact
that when you go into still

115
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,040
deeper levels of consciousness,
beyond the early levels and

116
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,880
beyond the middle levels, you
have to go through the same

117
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,200
process of radical surrender of
everything you've known to be

118
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,880
true up to that point in time.
So you have to surrender even

119
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,280
your own LSD experiences, your
psychedelic experiences, in

120
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,300
order to go through yet another
round of death and rebirth in

121
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,520
order to wake up to yet another
deeper dimensions of existence.

122
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,060
So if you're going to press the
journey hard or long as I did,

123
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,960
you're going to go through a lot
of purification, a lot of

124
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,140
detoxification, and a lot of
death and rebirth. And the

125
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,520
reason I think you go through so
much purification is I think

126
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,600
every time, every deeper level
of the universe operates at a

127
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,920
higher level of energy. So if
you're going to break through to

128
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,340
a deeper level of consciousness
and a deeper level of the

129
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,440
universe, you have to go through
a purification process so that

130
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,940
your consciousness can stabilize
effectively at that deeper level

131
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,200
of consciousness, so that you're
in. Awareness can remain

132
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,920
coherent there, and otherwise,
if you don't, your awareness

133
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,800
will always remain fragmented.
You won't be able to bring back

134
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,820
the coherent experience. But
there is a lot of suffering.

135
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,720
It's not like there's suffering
in the universe, but if you want

136
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,780
to explore the universe, you
must be willing to go through a

137
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,820
deep series of purifications,
purifications unto death, in

138
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,340
order to enter into that dialog,
that communion,

139
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,820
Frank McCaughey: and what do you
what do you think death is?

140
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:42,099
Chris Bache: Well, as I say in
the book, eventually you come to

141
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,099
a point. If you've gone through
many cycles of death and

142
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:48,939
rebirth, you come to a point
where the death loses its

143
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,179
meaning, because you've learned
from experience that you can

144
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:55,839
die. You can lose all your
reality reference points,

145
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:59,319
everything you know yourself to
be can be shattered and

146
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:04,979
destroyed, but the Phoenix
always rises. You always wake

147
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:11,939
up. You a changed you always
awakens in a deeper capacity and

148
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:15,659
a deeper level of reality. So
from this perspective,

149
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:20,299
eventually you learn that there
is no such thing as death. There

150
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:23,479
is only the shedding of one
particular set of parameters

151
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:27,919
within which awareness operates,
shedding those parameters and

152
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,459
letting consciousness expand to
a deeper experience of reality.

153
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,299
What we usually mean, and I
think death of the physical body

154
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,659
is something very similar what
you go through in an LSD

155
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:43,779
session, deep one that type of
death approximates what happens

156
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,139
when you go through physical
death. The body dies, you lose

157
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,919
your physical reference points.
Consciousness expands into a

158
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:56,259
deeper and broader universe, but
eventually the very concept of

159
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:59,439
death loses its meaning in this
respect.

160
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:08,700
Frank McCaughey: Yeah, yeah, it
was two ways I was going to go,

161
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,060
some I'll come back. I'll come
back to the way I was going to

162
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:22,580
go on that, the grueling impact
of that on like I spoke to

163
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,640
somebody, and in a way, it's
existent. It can be

164
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,160
existentially violent, a
psychedelic experience. Yes, is,

165
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,200
and there's moments. I mean, I
think that's a good it's a good

166
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,440
description, existentially
violent, fair description. And

167
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:50,020
what's like, and that, I don't
think also that you ever get

168
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,200
comfortable. It's not like you
suddenly go, Okay, I've done 50,

169
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,920
and this is going to be no
problem, because there's bigger

170
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,060
levels. Is that fair to say that
I

171
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:05,159
Chris Bache: thought that you
would go through a period of,

172
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,159
you know, Death-Rebirth and
purging and whatnot, and you

173
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,879
would get to a stable place, and
all all entries from that point

174
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,719
on would be clearer and easier.
I found that that's not true,

175
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,859
that the in the universe is
infinitely deep with an infinite

176
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:23,899
number of levels. And as long as
you keep pushing the outer edges

177
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,559
of your experience, if you're
willing to go farther, the

178
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:31,099
universe will keep taking you in
deeper. And it always will

179
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:35,359
require some deep surrender,
some death and rebirth process,

180
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,159
to move deeper into it.

181
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,720
Frank McCaughey: And when you
when you say, universe, what?

182
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,200
What do you? What's that to you?
What is the nice? What's that

183
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,160
word mean to you?

184
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,660
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, my
experience is, of course, when

185
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,440
you let go of consciousness at
the physical level, you enter

186
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,640
into a deeper dimension of
consciousness, and then later is

187
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,140
still a deeper dimension, and
still a deeper dimension, and

188
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,200
it's all coherent from top to
bottom, and it is all

189
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,400
fundamentally unified. For me,
it never took a face. It never

190
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,900
showed an identity as such. It
was always open ended and

191
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,080
perpetually fluid and invisible
and yet very deeply felt. So

192
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,900
what do we call this thing? What
do we call this consciousness,

193
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,980
which we dissolve into at
successive levels. Some might

194
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,460
call it the infinite, the
absolute. I call it both of

195
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,380
those things. I call it the
creative intelligence of the

196
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,660
universe. It feels to be the
creative intelligence that's

197
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,980
inside the universe and behind
the universe, different aspects

198
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:51,460
coming forward at different
times. In the end, in my heart

199
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,380
of hearts, I call it my beloved
because you do once you enter

200
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,680
into it, once you dissolve into
it, once you recover your true

201
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,100
idea. Entity within its
identity. Then it opens up

202
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,900
dimensions of love within you,
and it pours dimensions of love

203
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,940
within you that it becomes my
beloved. Sometimes I call it the

204
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,720
great expanse, something to
suggest the vastness, its

205
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,400
vastness, its power, its
creativity, its intelligence,

206
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,600
and of course, since compassion
is a mark of oneness, its

207
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,980
inherent oneness, so that
compassion is a spontaneous

208
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,040
manifestation of its innate
oneness.

209
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,459
Frank McCaughey: Yeah, it's
funny. I think he quoted some an

210
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:52,359
Indian guru who used the word
the beloved, and was the guy in

211
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,199
England he would refer to
oneness. So he would refer to

212
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:00,179
the Beloved. Tony Parsons would
talk about unconditional love,

213
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:07,079
that that it's, but not the love
that we would know it's, it's

214
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,379
love beyond conditions beyond
it's not a personal it's the

215
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:12,059
allowance of all things.

216
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,660
Chris Bache: Yeah, it's, it's a
deeper love than human love, but

217
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,920
I think it is alive in the best
of us when we experience love.

218
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,840
But it is. It is. It's a radical
love. It's a It's the love that

219
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,180
the Dao has for the 10,000
things. You know, it's, it is

220
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,800
the love that being has for its
own self, for its own being.

221
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,120
Because, in the end, from its
perspective, all of us and all

222
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,240
of creation is a manifestation
of its being. So how could it

223
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,600
not love itself? And therefore,
how could it not love us?

224
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:53,319
Frank McCaughey: So let's see,
can we? I'm going to go this

225
00:16:53,319 --> 00:17:00,299
route. Let's see where it goes.
Say the idea of my beloved and

226
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:07,139
who do you think is describing
when you say it's my who is

227
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:11,099
describing the beloved? You know
this sort of perspective,

228
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,479
because there is a perspective
that it cannot see itself, only

229
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:20,419
in reflections, and it because
it is already what's happening.

230
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,099
The Beloved is already what's
happening there. Yeah, it can't.

231
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:29,899
It can only ever appear as,
yeah, you know where I'm going

232
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:31,939
with that. Or do you have your
sense? Yeah, I'm going with

233
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:36,859
that? Yeah, I do. It's very hard
to objectify in a way, when that

234
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:42,639
objectifying is almost what is a
part of the Beloved is that

235
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:47,019
happening already? It's fresh
already. Yeah, it's already

236
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,539
complete. In other words, what
you're saying there, whilst

237
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:52,119
we're kind of talking about
experience that you've had and

238
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,819
you've written a book, it's, it
gives the impression of being

239
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:57,339
Once removed, but obviously it's
a part already.

240
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,060
Unknown: Yeah, you know, we have
all sorts of ideas and stories

241
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,440
we tell ourselves about what
this totality consciousness is

242
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,160
and isn't and what it can know
and can't know. And I think a

243
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,380
lot of that is just cultural
scripting. It's our best guess.

244
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,780
It's our best cultural guess,
and our best cultural guess is

245
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,560
not very old at this juncture,
we've been kind of making these

246
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,720
metaphysical guesses or
intuitions for 5000 years, but

247
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,940
this intelligence is 13.7 plus
billion years in the making and

248
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,960
unfolding, and we're just kind
of getting to the stop place in

249
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,200
our evolution where we can
really begin to engage it. So my

250
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,740
sense is I don't know whether
this intelligence is not self

251
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,900
aware, except through us that
seems kind of outrageously puts

252
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,960
enormous privilege of place on
us as to be the mirror of the

253
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,540
Divine Eye. Why should we assume
that this intelligence is not

254
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,720
self aware as it unfolds itself
with seeming pointed accuracy

255
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:16,140
through time and space? So what
I can say is this, when I lose

256
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,920
my boundaries as Chris Bache,
when I allow myself to dissolve

257
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,600
as Chris Bache and enter into
these deeper layers. There's

258
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
many, many layers of this
phenomenon. So some of the early

259
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,160
layers have to do with my
species consciousness, the mind

260
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,340
of the collective unconscious,
the mind of my species. Other

261
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,520
layers have to do with the mind
of our planet, Gaia

262
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,900
consciousness. And there are
multiple layers going right

263
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,460
through species mind, the
archetypal mind, archetypal

264
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:51,940
dimensions, the root causes of
some of the patterns inside time

265
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,320
and space, the root cause even
of time and space itself, moving

266
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,200
even deeper into dimensions of
oneness. Permutations of

267
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,480
oneness, even entering into the
primal void that appears to be

268
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,040
the formlessness out of which
all form emerges with the Big

269
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,140
Bang and subsequently, and then
entering beyond even that. And

270
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,900
at each level of entry, entering
into clearer and clearer and

271
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:28,700
clear states of being, states of
awareness. Now, yeah, that and

272
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,180
so it's hard for me to imagine
that the being or dimension of

273
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,360
being that I have been in it for
hours at a time, would not also

274
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,300
be self aware in its unfolding.
Now, it's also been the case

275
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,080
that I've had the experience
that this creative intelligence,

276
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,620
or an aspect of creative
intelligence, met me in my

277
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,460
sessions, took me on a cosmic
tour, you know, in that chapter,

278
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,780
initiation into the universe,
and it seemed to want to show me

279
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,220
its work. It seemed especially
pleased to have evolved

280
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,580
consciousness to the point where
some of that consciousness could

281
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,540
come back and be shown what has
actually been being worked on

282
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,760
for billions and billions of
years. So it seems to delight in

283
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,160
being known. But I wouldn't say
necessarily that it didn't know

284
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,260
itself before I knew it. You
know what? I mean. Yeah.

285
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,980
Frank McCaughey: And did you get
a sense of do you still have a

286
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:37,100
sense of the despite having
spent so much time that, in a

287
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,860
way, you're still only it's
impossible. It's so the

288
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,180
vastness, the extra, the
scraping the surface, the

289
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,040
enormity of the all of
everything.

290
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,020
Chris Bache: So this was a major
change in my thinking. It took

291
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,580
place in the 50th session. So,
so my background is I did four

292
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,860
years of work. I stopped for six
years, and then I did 10 years

293
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:08,820
of work, so 14 years of active
work over 20 years, when I was

294
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,140
entering into the last five
years of work, or those years of

295
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,940
what I call the diamond
Luminosity work. And this was 26

296
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,680
sessions out of 26 sessions,
that's about a third of all the

297
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,780
sessions in the book. Four of
those sessions took me into this

298
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,520
diamond Luminosity, an
unbelievably beautiful,

299
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,940
ecstatic, empty consciousness
that was just clear, just clear

300
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,280
beyond imagination, just so
clear, so hyper clear, that once

301
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,300
you touch it, nothing else
matters except returning to it.

302
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,960
Nothing else I had entered in
earlier stages mattered in the

303
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,700
least compared to connecting
with this. And this is what the

304
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,840
Buddhists call, I think the
closest thing I could find is

305
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,620
what they call Dharmakaya. You
know, they have three

306
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,680
dimensions, or three modalities
of existence, Dharmakaya,

307
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,000
sambhogakaya and Nirvana, Kaya
Dharmakaya being the deepest,

308
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,560
and Dharmakaya the absolute, the
light of the clear light of

309
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,640
absolute reality, just kind of
the light out of which existence

310
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,480
emerges. I'm sorry I got so
involved in the description. I

311
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,480
lost track with the the original
question, focus.

312
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:28,279
Frank McCaughey: Well, I think I
know we are going though,

313
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,999
because we were talking about
the vastness and scraping the

314
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:35,119
surface. And you said, yeah,
yeah.

315
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,320
Unknown: So I was 50 sessions
in. I was in the second of the

316
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,780
four diamond Luminosity
sessions, I was as deep into

317
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,700
ecstatic diamond consciousness
as I had ever gone and would

318
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,740
ever go. It was the deepest
penetration in that way. And

319
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,980
toward the end of the session, I
had this experience where my

320
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:02,700
visual feel flipped 90 degrees.
A huge space opened up. And

321
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,420
beyond where I was, there was
another reality, worlds upon

322
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,260
worlds beyond me. And there was
a light there, and a beam of

323
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,600
this light hit me, and it
shattered me. And I called the

324
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,420
light the absolute light, just
to give it a differentiating

325
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,700
name from the diamond Luminosity
light. But what it showed me was

326
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,440
that there were worlds and
worlds beyond where I was, as

327
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,160
far beyond where I was as the
diamond Luminosity was beyond

328
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,800
time and space. So that told me
that an idea that I had taken

329
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,680
into this work, that the purpose
of this work was to get to an

330
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,020
end point, an end stage, a
destination to go home,

331
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,940
something like this that that
was just not an accurate

332
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,620
assumption. You do repeatedly
have a sense of going home. You

333
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,420
do enter into deep, deep
experiences of Homecoming. And

334
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,000
for me, the diamond. Luminosity
was my actual practical

335
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,960
destination. I did not go deeper
than that. It totally satisfied

336
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,480
me in all respects. I continued
to do the session work, but for

337
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,680
the next 23 sessions, it wasn't
going deeper into the diamond

338
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,080
Luminosity, but it was
internalizing diamond

339
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,660
Luminosity, soaking deeper and
deeper into my physical and

340
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:29,780
psychological being. But it's an
infinite ocean. And I don't I

341
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,780
gave up completely the idea of
ever getting to the end of it

342
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,920
Frank McCaughey: unfathomable.
It's unfathomable everything.

343
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,200
Unknown: Well, in a sense, I
mean, I have a tendency that,

344
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,520
you know, what is the term we
use for not being able to

345
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,420
ineffable? You know, we like to
say the mystical is ineffable.

346
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,500
And I don't necessarily agree
with that. I think that's that's

347
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,220
true. I understand, you know,
language falters, but I think

348
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,720
making ineffability a primary
characteristic of mystical

349
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:08,100
experience. I think it cuts off
rather than opens up. I think we

350
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,660
should exhaust ourselves trying
to describe what lies at the

351
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,100
edges of our awareness, rather
than surrendering to the silence

352
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,460
so unfathomable in one sense,
but not unfathomable. In another

353
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,120
sense, I think I fathomed what I
entered. I mean, I went back

354
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,900
again and again and again, and I
stabilized consciousness and I

355
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,440
understood it, but there are
dimensions beyond which I

356
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,340
understood, and even my
understanding of what I

357
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,520
experience is admittedly
limited, okay, but I wouldn't

358
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,260
want to say that the reality
itself is innately unfathomable.

359
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,740
I think we can fathom, but it
takes hard work and discipline.

360
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,820
Okay?

361
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,500
Frank McCaughey: There's a part
of the book and it's, I think it

362
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,540
kind of describe the it's the
royal we. Let's just say, you

363
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,500
kind of describe it's us. You
say us creating everything the

364
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,980
royal us. No, you haven't used
the word the royal, but that's,

365
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,800
that's the sense of me. It's
kind of that, it's a generic

366
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:28,220
feeling of usness, but in that,
yeah, I was just curious a

367
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,980
little bit. What does that bring
back to you when I when I

368
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,020
mentioned that, that creation,
what does that say? Yeah, what

369
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,980
does that remind you of?

370
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,100
Unknown: First of all, this
reminds me to mention that this

371
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,500
book is not primarily a
therapeutic story, and it's not

372
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,660
a story about my personal
healing or my the work that the

373
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,320
advice or the counsel that I got
from the universe at a personal

374
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,980
level, for my personal life.
It's not that I didn't receive

375
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,760
those things. I did receive
those things, but I've dropped

376
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,780
them out for the most part, in
the story. In the story, I'm

377
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,280
focusing on what took place
during the peak hours of these

378
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,960
high, intense sessions. And it's
a fundamentally, a cosmic,

379
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,040
logical story. It's a story
about the universe and about the

380
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,320
aspects of these sessions that
have generalizable significance,

381
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,820
where we're touching dimensions
of reality, that are dimensions

382
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,820
that all human beings share in
one way or another. So sometimes

383
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,980
I speak about the we in the book
because I'm basically

384
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,260
acknowledging that what's
important in these experiences

385
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,620
is not that I experience them.
That's not the important thing.

386
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,860
The important thing is that
these dimensions are available

387
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,960
for all of us to experience if
we use sufficient technologies

388
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,740
and techniques to get into these
territories, including non

389
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,700
psychedelic techniques,
meditation, contemplation,

390
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,400
silence, so on, so forth. That's
the important story. So when,

391
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,800
when you enter these profoundly
expansive, encompassing states

392
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,640
of consciousness, you're, you're
not an eye when you go into it,

393
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,660
you're, you're, there's an eye
in the sense that you have

394
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,500
continuity of memory when you go
in and you come back, you can

395
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,120
remember it. So there is a sense
in which I is present in order

396
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,540
to facilitate recall. But what
this i has become in the point

397
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,860
of entry, you have ceased to
function as an individual. In

398
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,500
some of these, I cease to
function as a human being, per

399
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,500
se, when you're operating beyond
the species mind at archetypal

400
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:55,360
reality levels, you have to
cease to function as a human

401
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,720
being and you left. Have to
learn how to be conscious and.

402
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:03,756
Not as a human being is
conscious, but in a totally new

403
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:08,256
and unprecedented way, and the
universe will take you in and

404
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:11,316
teach you it mean you literally
will give you exercises and

405
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:15,936
disciplined exercises, which you
repeat. It repeats over and over

406
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:19,476
inside the sessions, and you
have to take the set the

407
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:23,720
assignments you're given in the
sessions after the sessions and

408
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,080
do your homework in order to
kind of enter fully consciously

409
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,180
into subsequent sessions. Yeah,
I've meander a bit on your

410
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,020
question, but you

411
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,900
Frank McCaughey: get, I mean,
it's kind of interesting,

412
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,920
though, even though you didn't
mention the personal journey

413
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,700
really in the book, like you say
it was the bigger, let's say or

414
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,080
the but it's funny how the
psychedelics seem to always

415
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,540
remind that element. And it's
kind of like, you know, it'll

416
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,600
give you this list of things.
Let's say ace will get but there

417
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,600
will be that will come up every
time. Yes, it's almost like,

418
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,840
have you been doing this, this,
this, this, or, you know, but

419
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,060
it's kind of like, your de,
your, I don't know what it is

420
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,800
exactly. Maybe it's eating well,
being nicer. It's all kind of

421
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,800
very personal things. Yeah,

422
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,580
Chris Bache: it's personal.
Yeah. I mean, I own the journey.

423
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,260
It was my journey, and it has
all my limitations into it, in

424
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,900
it, and what's important is
whatever I experience, that it

425
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,620
be placed on a table beside
other people's experiences. And

426
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,280
we look at lots of people's
experiences simultaneously to

427
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,720
find how they fit together.
What's the common ground, what's

428
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,100
idiosyncratic. You know, if from
a philosophical perspective, I

429
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,040
want to know what's real, and
one of the best ways to know

430
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,500
what's real is, you know,
compare lots of people's

431
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,160
experiences of this reality, so
we can see it through that

432
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,080
prism. But within my own
experience, I I own that it is

433
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,180
my journey. It's a personal
journey, and yet the most

434
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:08,220
important parts of the journey
didn't really involve me. In a

435
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:14,820
sense, let's say the filter of
Chris Bache was highly polished

436
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,600
away, shattered, deconstructed
at the most important parts of

437
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:18,960
the journey.

438
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,940
Frank McCaughey: And do you
think, in a way, the you know,

439
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:31,040
when you went through this
suffering, the humongous amount

440
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,900
of that suffering, the ocean of
suffering, the ocean suffering,

441
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:48,100
he called it, yeah, an ocean is
pretty big. And do you just talk

442
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,460
about the ego death a little bit
there, within that ocean of

443
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,260
suffering? Do you think that you
were there in that or there was

444
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,980
just the suffering, if you know
what I mean, there was Yeah. Or

445
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,360
were you in that suffering? Or
then every time it felt like

446
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,400
it's almost, I had to go through
all that to be it's like the

447
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,360
dying on the cross, that kind of
symbology of all that suffering

448
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,000
is almost to kill the
resistance, and then within that

449
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,920
the expansiveness can happen.
Yeah, is that true?

450
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,460
Unknown: Well, my understanding
of the ocean of suffering

451
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,380
deepened and changed over the
years. What happened is, after

452
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,380
about two years, two and a half
years of work, first 10

453
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,280
sessions, I went through what
Stan Grof describes as the

454
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,560
perinatal level of
consciousness, I felt like a

455
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,080
poster child for the perennial
severe seizures, existential

456
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,620
crisis, confronting the
meaninglessness of life so on so

457
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,640
forth, reliving aspects of my
birth and eventually went

458
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,420
through a deep and shattering
ego death experience, where

459
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,780
everything I knew myself to be
was turned inside out, and I was

460
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,560
forced to become the opposite of
what I knew myself to be. I I

461
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,520
was a male, highly educated,
white academic obsessed with the

462
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,540
meaning of life. I became women,
lots of women, women of color,

463
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,400
women who had no philosophical
interest whatsoever, and and

464
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,560
basically it just shattered me,
just shattered my identity and

465
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:28,940
then took me into a deeper
spiritual dimension. After one

466
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,440
transition experience, I went
then from that condition into

467
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,220
the ocean of suffering, which
was an expanding landscape that

468
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,500
was systematic, expanded year by
year for over two years of

469
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:48,700
active session work, 14
sessions, just horrendous planes

470
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,140
of human suffering, opening to
1000s and 1000s of beings, 1000s

471
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,300
of years, just unimaginable,
brutal, brutalities. And at

472
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,280
first I thought this. Was a
deepening of my ego death. I

473
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,720
didn't understand why I had to
go through this, but based on

474
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,300
the information that I was
working on at the time, I

475
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,960
thought it was a deepening of
ego death. But over time, I

476
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,340
changed my mind on that, and
that is now I understand that

477
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,100
there are different levels of
the universe, and what's

478
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,540
happening differs according to
which level you're operating on.

479
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,680
At this level of the universe, I
was operating in subtle level

480
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,020
reality. I was operating in the
context of the species mind, and

481
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,680
that these tremendous
purification processes, this

482
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,720
encounter and an opening to the
pain, and letting the pain in

483
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,500
that it moved through me was not
really aimed at my personal

484
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,960
transformation, but was aimed at
transforming some aspect of the

485
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,640
collective psyche, so that the
healing being generated here was

486
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,360
Gen was aimed at my species, not
at me personally. And this built

487
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,440
up for two years. Actually,
there was one year I stopped.

488
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,700
For six years I started, then
six years later, and the ocean

489
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,360
of suffering started exactly
where I had stopped six years

490
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,960
before. And it continued to
deepen and deep, and eventually

491
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,620
reached a crescendo of an orgy
of suffering and pain, and then

492
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,180
I was spun into archetypal
reality, and the ocean of

493
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,860
suffering never returned. So I
think that just as there was a

494
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,760
process of cleaning out the
personal unconscious leading an

495
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,140
ego death, there was a cleaning
out or healing of some aspect of

496
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,180
the collective unconscious, and
then being spun beyond the

497
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:45,400
species mind into archetype
levels of reality. The what,

498
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,180
what prevents this suffering
from being internalized in your

499
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,680
system is trauma. Is that when
you do this work, if you

500
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,280
surrender completely and let the
session take you wherever it

501
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,240
wants to take you, even though
it doesn't make sense at the

502
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,740
time, it will take you to a
culmination, a breaking point,

503
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,520
and then you will be spun
through that. You'll go through

504
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:16,860
to a point of reconciliation, of
ecstatic embrace. And then what

505
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,740
you internalize and love, what
you internalize then is the

506
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,460
whole cycle, the trauma, the
physical violence, or the

507
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,420
psychological violence,
breakthrough and reconciliation

508
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,040
harmony so that it doesn't
internalize as trauma. You learn

509
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,720
the cycle. You trust the cycle.
I was willing to go back into

510
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,940
the pain for two reasons. One,
because I felt a calling to it.

511
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,440
I felt a destiny calling me to
engage this pain for in ways I

512
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,800
explain in the book. But the
other one is that I really

513
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,460
wasn't a glutton for pain. I
hated the pain. I was a glutton

514
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,140
for what lay on the other side
of pain, or the insights and the

515
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,720
ecstasy that I got on the other
side one I started going through

516
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,080
on the second year of this ocean
of suffering, and I broke

517
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,680
through into these series of
sessions that I summarized in

518
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,040
that chapter, initiation of the
universe. One of the first

519
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,240
things it did was take me deep,
deep, deep in time back to what

520
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,940
felt to be the font of creation.
And there I was. I experienced

521
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:29,180
the beginnings of creation, the
Big Bang type of experience, and

522
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:35,480
I experienced it as a choice
that in some strange way, I and

523
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,300
all of us had participated in
that we chose to participate in

524
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,920
creation, we chose to
participate voluntarily in the

525
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,240
act of creating a universe,
galaxies, solar systems, the

526
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,720
human species, that the
suffering that we've encountered

527
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,920
on this agenda, on this
adventure, is not being

528
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:03,480
inflicted on us. It's something
we chose as kind of a passage, a

529
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,220
rite of passage to participate
in the creation, or the self

530
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,300
expression, the self
manifestation of our universe.

531
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,200
Chose, chose, yeah, hard to say
what that means at the level of

532
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,040
soul that we're talking about,
but we're, but there are no

533
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,980
conscripts here we are
volunteers

534
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,120
Frank McCaughey: during the
book. There is a part you

535
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:41,680
mentioned. Think he's, I think
you said the sense of no

536
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,400
beginning,

537
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:52,780
Chris Bache: no beginning. Have
to think about that. I you know

538
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,340
that doesn't ring a bell. I'd
have to,

539
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,780
Frank McCaughey: yeah, well,
say, say this. Idea, it does

540
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,280
explode time.

541
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,300
Psychedelics, explodes the sense
of duration, or, let's just say,

542
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,440
this idea of the infinity or
eternity or timelessness, maybe

543
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,100
more. So

544
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,340
Unknown: there's different
modalities in which time exists

545
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,780
that you experience in
psychedelic states. There is an

546
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,920
experience of timelessness, or
moving beyond time, moving

547
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:33,140
outside of time and space.
That's I've had that experience.

548
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,460
I've gone there. But there's
another more subtle dimension of

549
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,520
time, experience that I call
deep time. Deep Time is moving

550
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,340
into temporal envelopes, where
different spans of time can be

551
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,620
experienced as simultaneously
now, so in one of the early

552
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:59,560
sessions and teens, I
experienced stably in seven

553
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,680
consecutive sessions my life
from beginning to end, all the

554
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,000
experiences of my life as
simultaneously taking place now.

555
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,520
So I experienced what it felt
like to be old in a distilled

556
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,160
essence kind of way. Later on, I
was taken into larger segments

557
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,620
of deep time, what I would call
collective deep time, where I

558
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,240
was being taught or shown
aspects of human evolution that

559
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,080
required a larger time landscape
in order to show them to me,

560
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,780
maybe a landscape of 100,000
years or so, and at the very end

561
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,740
of the journey, in The 70th
session, and what I call the

562
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:48,340
final vision, I was taken into a
temporal landscape. Who knows,

563
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,280
hard to describe the scale, but
somewhere on the order of maybe

564
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,900
a million years. So what I've
come away with is the conviction

565
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,620
that there, there are different
modalities of time operating

566
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,160
within the universe, and I don't
be begin to understand how this

567
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,460
is possible. I've had some
interesting conversation with

568
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,620
some physicists who are
exploring different temporal

569
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,940
dimensions within the universe.
I'm not a physicist. All I know

570
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:23,060
is that I've been taken in and
out of time multiple ways, in

571
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,800
multiple frames of reference,
only one of which is a negation

572
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,420
of time in itself. Most
frequently it allowed to

573
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,540
experience different modalities
of time or different

574
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,520
aggregations of time.

575
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,100
Frank McCaughey: Yeah, I suppose
the answer, the idea, if I said

576
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,920
to you, there is no time, what
would

577
00:42:47,919 --> 00:42:50,739
Unknown: you I would I would say
there are dimensions of

578
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:55,539
existence in which that's true.
Time comes into existence with

579
00:42:55,539 --> 00:43:01,199
space. Time and Space is a sort
of a fundamental unit. So when

580
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,399
one moves, in a sense, to the
edges of space, you move into

581
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:10,019
domains where time behaves
differently. So within space,

582
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:13,859
time, this time is very
convenient. You know, the arrow

583
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:17,939
of time is generally true. But
that doesn't seem to exhaust the

584
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:21,499
whole of the universe with
respect to time. We now know

585
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:25,459
that what 96% of the universe is
dark matter and dark energy,

586
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:29,419
which we don't know what the
hell is going on there. So we're

587
00:43:29,419 --> 00:43:32,779
now getting used to
understanding that time space is

588
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:36,439
really just like the skin of an
apple. There's a lot going on

589
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:39,979
underneath the skin of the
apple. That's true for space.

590
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:41,799
It's also true for time, I
think.

591
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,920
Frank McCaughey: And do you
think time is related to the

592
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,480
sense, this sense of, I an ego
would say, or a sense of this

593
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,440
that when there is a center in
the universe, let's just say,

594
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,360
you know, when you're location
based, and then sometimes during

595
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,700
the trip, you can be exploded.
It can be just gone, gone gone,

596
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,240
gone, gone, gone.

597
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,380
Unknown: And

598
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,000
Frank McCaughey: in that even
this idea of any time, that it's

599
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,540
almost a requirement of a
separate human who lives in

600
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,160
time, and is certain amount of
finite. And who knows the world

601
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,540
knows this is earth, and this is
2019 and all these pillars of

602
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:35,060
knowledge, and that's what's the
little piece in the center of

603
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,360
all of that is that holds it
together, this little me and

604
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:44,860
this world, and that when that's
say gone, that there's just

605
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,180
timelessness and in that it's
whatever appears. So, yeah,

606
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,800
whatever is appearing here in
this conversation is all of

607
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,060
everything. And whatever appears
in the vastness of one of those

608
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,620
trips is all of everything.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,

609
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,820
Chris Bache: you describe very
nicely. I like your description

610
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,660
of how individual awareness kind
of anchors our sense of time,

611
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,400
and when individual awareness is
shattered or blown out, then our

612
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,260
sense our experience of time
changes. Now I don't know

613
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,960
whether for everybody, when
individual awareness becomes

614
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,160
transparent, or Shunyata
emptiness or is blown out. I

615
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,060
don't know whether everybody
necessarily flips into pure

616
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:37,100
timelessness. My sense, I'd
rather say there are different

617
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:42,820
modalities of time that we can
move into when we are don't are

618
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,420
not so heavily grounded in our
physical body, sense of

619
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:52,780
identity, okay, but yeah, time
becomes porous. Times becomes

620
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,820
well, becomes porous, and we can
experience we can have insights

621
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:02,580
that have to do with future, so
called future time. We can have

622
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,420
insights of what's going on that
violate the patterns of space.

623
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,060
We can know something that's
going on that's outside of our

624
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,380
physical senses, that's
happening now, but far away in

625
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,160
space. We can have experiences
of something that's happening

626
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,680
far away in time. So time does
get permeable,

627
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,320
Frank McCaughey: yeah, yeah. And
not, you did speak a bit, a bit

628
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,260
about this, somehow being able
to see futures, and I'd be

629
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,320
familiar with that, and I've
heard it in a good few places

630
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,920
too. It's, yeah, it does
collapse a lot of things. What

631
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,440
was I going to ask? You the I
suppose,

632
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,740
yeah, in that kind of say, Yeah,
I'll just describe something to

633
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,380
you. One thing that I and I
think you've definitely you

634
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:05,220
touched a big bit in the book is
this idea that you come out of

635
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:12,960
this trip having, let's just
say, tasted the infinite, and

636
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,340
then you're gone from that's
gone, and you're back to being

637
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,020
Chris In the world, having to
get up and do taxes, whatever,

638
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:31,880
and that sense of loss, that it
wasn't a feeling of it, not for

639
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,660
you now, it wasn't ever present,
or was that true is there's a

640
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,100
big bit about that kind of loss,
of the Feeling that you lost,

641
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,660
the beloved, that Sacramento is
almost coming back.

642
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,840
Chris Bache: Yeah, when one
does, allows one's egoic reality

643
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,380
or Body, Mind identity to
dissolve and experiences that a

644
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,220
deeper landscape of the
universe, some aspect of the

645
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:03,960
universe, it's a it's an awfully
exciting and affirming and

646
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,660
empowering experience, just to
have that experience of some

647
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,740
aspect of the intelligence that
runs through all things, that is

648
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:19,920
alive in all things, to have
insights that convince you that

649
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,260
you yourself participate in that
intelligence, and you yourself

650
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:31,460
are alive in time in a way that
expands beyond your traditional

651
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:38,960
ways of thinking. In my case, I
press so hard and so deep into

652
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:45,940
the fabric of existence into the
fabric of the creative

653
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:53,200
intelligence I pushed into the
diamond body of I'm hesitant to

654
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,260
speak about God and the divine
because that has those words

655
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,380
have so much cultural baggage
around them I don't Want to

656
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:04,620
import. But inevitably, I you
have to speak about a purified

657
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,640
or cleaned up vision of the
divine in order to that's the

658
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,420
closest vocabulary our culture
has for pointing to these

659
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,960
extreme facets of existence. I
pushed so deeply into that

660
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,640
touched it so intimately that
when I stopped my sessions, not

661
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,240
until I stopped my sessions, as
long as I was going back and

662
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,200
touching this reality
periodically through the years,

663
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,040
I didn't have this sense of a
deep sadness that took came over

664
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,260
after I stopped my sessions, I
stopped my sessions, and in the

665
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:50,380
years following, I began to miss
this dimension of existence.

666
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,900
There were good reasons, which I
explained in the book, why I

667
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,160
felt I had to stop my work, but
the consequences of stopping the

668
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,840
work was not being able to. Have
even a few hours at a time, a

669
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:09,420
few times a year, of exquisite
intimacy with this reality. Now

670
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,160
there are beings who, because of
their spiritual practice, are

671
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,800
able to maintain some type of
version of this intimacy with

672
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,480
Transcendence, with the divine
in their daily life, and I

673
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,860
understand that all power and
honor to the great masters,

674
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,600
they're my heroes. They're my
guiding lights. I knew that in

675
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,620
my case, I did not have the
capacity at this stage in my

676
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,420
life to stabilize these extreme
states of consciousness. It

677
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,320
would take not only years and
years, but lifetimes of

678
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,340
spiritual practice to succeed in
doing that. So there was a sense

679
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:54,340
of true sense of loss. I had to
content myself with having had

680
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:59,140
these experiences, but not being
able to abide continuously in

681
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,520
those experiences. And that
took, that took a while. I mean,

682
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,900
I basically went into a sadness
that was so deep that I found

683
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,920
that I was just waiting to die.
I was I was taking care of my

684
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,700
children, I was lecturing, I was
doing my my work, but in my

685
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,000
heart, I was just waiting to die
so that I could return to the

686
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,820
light. And that, over time, I
began to realize, you know, that

687
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,180
was really not a good way to
live. I really had to see what

688
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,720
was at the bottom of this, and
what was at the bottom of this,

689
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,100
I think, is an imbalance that I
allowed to develop between

690
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,180
Transcendence and imminence.
It's all the divine. The

691
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,500
physical world is the divine,
but there's a transcendent

692
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,000
divine and the imminent divine.
And I had plunged so deep into

693
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,320
the joy of the transcendent
divine that to a certain degree

694
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,880
I lost my footing inside the
imminent divine, and I had to

695
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,340
really recommit myself to
grabbing my physical existence

696
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:07,680
and being what I was as I was
here, incomplete, as I was for

697
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,380
the remainder of my life. And I
did, and I have kind of I'm

698
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,600
fully grounded here, and I do my
spiritual practice, and I hope

699
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,540
that my sessions will continue
to absorb themselves into my

700
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,980
body. And my transformation is
not over yet. It's work in

701
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:28,700
progress.

702
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,659
Frank McCaughey: And so if I was
you mentioned about the Masters

703
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:41,379
having arrived almost or can I
ask you what what

704
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,120
do you think that would look
like at that place of arrival,

705
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,180
that in daily life?

706
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,120
Chris Bache: Well, again, there
are many, many levels

707
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,720
Frank McCaughey: to say, these
masters that you mentioned, the

708
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,980
masters that you mentioned,

709
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:02,579
Chris Bache: but even the
Masters, I mean, there are many

710
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,599
levels of the gradients of
masterhood, and which these

711
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,039
traditions articulate with great
detail. I think the first kind

712
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,239
of point of entry into this
spiritually transformed

713
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:19,919
existence is one second. Let me
take care of something that's

714
00:53:19,919 --> 00:53:22,459
just popped up on my screen,
which is getting in the way.

715
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:26,659
Okay, we'll have to let it be
one of the love the point of

716
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:32,719
entry is, I think, transparency.
We become transparent, we dis we

717
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:37,159
let go of our ego
identification, and we are able

718
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:42,579
to be transparent to the larger
flow of life, the larger matrix

719
00:53:42,579 --> 00:53:49,659
of cause and effect, and to the
sheer immediacy of presence

720
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:54,879
inside the physical existence.
And then from there, they're

721
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:58,839
just degrees of deepening and
deepening and deepening, so that

722
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:05,159
some masters have exist in such
a deep intersection of time,

723
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,839
space, reality and spiritual
reality, that they can literally

724
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:14,159
leave their fingerprints in
stone. I mean, that's how much

725
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:17,819
energy they're carrying. That's
the level of consciousness that

726
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:22,819
they're living in. 24/7, so
they're they're very beings. Are

727
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:26,059
surrounded by what we would call
miracles. But they don't call

728
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:29,479
them miracles. They call them
the natural consequence of

729
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:32,899
integrating spirit, reality and
physical reality into their

730
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:36,919
physical into their precious
body. So there are levels and

731
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:41,559
levels of mastery I can envision
and imagine what the lower

732
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:44,679
levels might look like. I mean,
I've taught courses and

733
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:49,599
comparative mysticism. I've
studied the mystics, but what it

734
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,619
would be like to actually
stabilize what I call the

735
00:54:53,619 --> 00:54:57,399
diamond Luminosity, to live in a
perpetual awareness of diamond

736
00:54:57,399 --> 00:55:02,099
Luminosity, that's hard for me
to. Imagine, likewise, it's hard

737
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:09,719
for me to imagine being living
in conditions which have

738
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:14,579
radically transcended time, as I
have experienced for a few hours

739
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:18,359
at a time here and there. I
mean, that's just a radical

740
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:22,819
state of consciousness. So I
think in my psychedelic work, I

741
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,839
started it with an eye towards
spiritual awakening,

742
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:29,959
accelerating my spiritual
enlightenment, personal

743
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:35,359
transformation, things like this
that quickly fell away as a not

744
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,079
worthy goal for the work that I
was doing. Collective

745
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:42,579
transformation, collective
enlightenment took its place,

746
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:47,079
and then later the journey
became a cosmic, logical

747
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:50,859
adventure, an adventure in
exploring the deep fabric of the

748
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:56,379
universe its successive levels.
It did not become, did not

749
00:55:56,379 --> 00:56:02,099
retain its role as just trying
to awaken spiritually, awakening

750
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:08,099
spiritually was is a perfectly
good goal and agenda, but what

751
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,179
happened in my sessions was
about something different than

752
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:15,959
just awakening spiritually. It
was about exploring the deep

753
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:19,619
fabric of the universe. And you
don't have to explore the deep

754
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:23,479
fabric of the universe, to
awaken spiritually and even to

755
00:56:23,479 --> 00:56:30,019
be God realized, even to be kind
of fully saturated with divine

756
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,539
awareness, this is a different
agenda,

757
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:45,760
Frank McCaughey: Okay, and you
see a part of me when I've I

758
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:50,860
didn't like the idea that there
was here, and there this idea in

759
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,940
psychedelics, that there was
this realm, and this was not

760
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,440
this realm and that. And so I
always felt a sort of a

761
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,960
dissatisfaction, one way or
another for a period of time,

762
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,960
anyway, that it was kind of
okay. It was hugely

763
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:14,940
experiential, humongously. But
it's almost it could become

764
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,840
another path. And the path is
endless, in a way, yeah, the

765
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,840
path of this idea of becoming
now that seemed to all fall away

766
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:32,540
this and in the end, yeah, I
suppose what I'm trying to say

767
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:37,340
is that, I suppose in the end,
I'm just curious about the first

768
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:41,560
question I asked at the Start,
and back to here, back and in

769
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,760
your book, during the trips, it
felt like everything was during

770
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:52,120
the trips, bringing you back to
this every time it seemed to be

771
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,900
this, which I kind of liked
that, because I felt, well, has

772
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,420
to be this, has to be completely
what's happening as well as

773
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,200
anything else. And I'm curious
what's your sense of that,

774
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:09,300
because it did seem to go full
circle in everything. And I like

775
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:15,120
that you went to the depths of
hell and the highest heavens.

776
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,960
But every time at the end of the
trip, always you returned. But

777
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,460
even during the trip, it felt
like, towards the end of your

778
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,640
journeys, it felt like you were
brought back to what's

779
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:31,040
happening. Yeah, and I liked, I
really liked that, because for

780
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,500
me, it has to be, this has to be
within the grasp of a child.

781
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:40,420
Can't be ugly. It has to be,
this has to be what's happening.

782
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:45,880
And I kind of liked that in the
book that to give it felt like

783
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,760
everything brought you back to
this is that

784
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,360
Chris Bache: you catch the arc
of it well, and you describe it

785
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,220
well. In the early sessions, the
early years, there was an acute

786
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,500
sense of going out, experiencing
a universe that was sense going

787
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,980
out, coming back, always coming
back to right here, right now,

788
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,880
learning the lessons, but going
out deeper and deeper into the

789
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,260
universe. And then late in the
sessions that changed. There was

790
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,980
less of a sense of going
anywhere, and more of a sense of

791
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,840
being here, right here, right
now. Clear, clear, cleaning,

792
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,100
cleaning, cleaning, right here,
right now. It was as if, after

793
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,940
taking me, excuse me so deep,
and giving me the sample, deep

794
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,240
into the universe, deep into the
diamond Luminosity, and then

795
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,180
showing me that there was a
world among world upon world

796
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:39,620
beyond that, even still, at that
point, everything shifted in the

797
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,380
last 23 sessions or so, we're
really about cleaning, cleaning,

798
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,460
cleaning, right here, right now.
And the arc of the sessions arc

799
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:54,040
back towards something alike
classical spiritual awakening to

800
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,280
the here and now, to the
consciousness, which is the ever

801
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:03,872
the ever pure. Effervescent
source out of which your moment

802
01:00:03,872 --> 01:00:07,952
to moment awareness springs, out
of which the universe springs

803
01:00:07,952 --> 01:00:11,612
moment to moment, bringing back
to here and now, here and now.

804
01:00:13,052 --> 01:00:17,432
Yeah, in the end, I think
everything we do in all

805
01:00:17,432 --> 01:00:20,132
spiritual practice, and
including all psychedelic

806
01:00:20,132 --> 01:00:23,960
practice, is all about
purification. In the deepest

807
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,860
sense, we end up where we
started, except that where we

808
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:32,540
started our mind was encumbered
by all sorts of conditioning and

809
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:37,220
obscure obscurations. And in the
end, hopefully those

810
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,980
obscurations are gone and you
have the opportunity to

811
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:46,600
experience what the Buddhists
call the nature of mind, or your

812
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,280
mind in its natural condition,
or Atman, our Satchitananda,

813
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:56,500
Frank McCaughey: yeah, and on
that. Then if I said to you that

814
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,500
the beloved never left you, that
this is the beloved happening.

815
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,140
And it's never left,

816
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,160
Chris Bache: never left. Oh, the
physical, the physical world is

817
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,700
the body of my beloved I know
that. It's just that on some

818
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,600
days, I can experience her more
completely than on other days,

819
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,380
and on the days when I can't
experience her completely, and

820
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,060
it's all my fault, only my
fault, only my limitations. I

821
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:27,980
missed the days when I could
experience her it in complete

822
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,620
transparency and her complete
beauty.

823
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,040
Frank McCaughey: Always say,
it's my fault. That's an

824
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,680
interesting they're interesting
words to say, it's my fault.

825
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,540
Chris Bache: Well, it's my
limitations. It's only my

826
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,800
limitations, you know? So the
limitations are not the

827
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,700
limitations of the substance
itself. They're not the

828
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,660
limitations of reality. It's
only the limitations of my

829
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:00,160
ability to experience the truth
of what is at any point in time.

830
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:02,980
Yeah.

831
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:10,560
Frank McCaughey: I could ask a
couple of sort of questions. You

832
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:16,380
allude to Alan Watts? Oh, you
can hear me. Sorry, you've got

833
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:21,440
wireless you allude to Alan
Watts and hanging up the phone,

834
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,280
yeah, this is what happens when
you don't hang up the phone,

835
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,300
which I think is a great, it's a
great way to describe the book,

836
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,140
Kid essence, this is what
happens when you don't hang up

837
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:38,600
the phone. Yeah. What's your
sense of that? Not really a

838
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,380
question, but it's, well, that
was a big thing like

839
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,560
Chris Bache: it is, I mean,
Huston Smith, when he wrote his

840
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,580
book cleansing the doors of
perception, which is his

841
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:52,900
collected reflections on a
lifetime of scholarship as a

842
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,720
professor of religious studies,
and one that I'm very close to,

843
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,740
because I taught out of Huston
Smith's books For decades in my

844
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:04,860
world religions course. So I've
internalized his mind a lot, but

845
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:08,880
when he wrote that collection of
essays, he had only taken LSD

846
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:15,000
six times, and he said at that
point, the bummers increased and

847
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,960
the benefits decreased, and he
took Alan watches adage

848
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,080
seriously, when you get the
message, hang up the phone. And

849
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,900
I said, this book is about what
happens if you don't hang up the

850
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,600
phone, and if you don't hang up
the phone, a long journey

851
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,840
begins, a journey that goes
deeper and deeper and deeper.

852
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,020
And I understand where the
bummer is increased. That's part

853
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:40,480
of the Death-Rebirth cycle. But
if you're willing to submit to

854
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,540
those bummers, or you're willing
to submit to that purification

855
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:48,220
process. The adventure begins.
The adventure deepens, and

856
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:52,420
you're just taking on layer
after layer this following the

857
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:58,360
cycle of death and rebirth into
deeper levels of initiation. As

858
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:02,280
a philosopher that was
extraordinarily valuable to me.

859
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:05,700
Now, when you say we get if you
get the lesson, hang up the

860
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:09,060
phone. What were they referring
to? I would assume that they're

861
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:12,780
referring to the lessons of
oneness, which is comes up often

862
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,960
early in the work, the truth of
oneness, the teachings of

863
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,680
oneness, the compassion of
oneness, the ethics of oneness,

864
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,840
the identity that one realizes
one, one realizes that the

865
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:28,400
entire world is one at its core,
all those things are very, very

866
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,320
good, but there's just so much
more that we can experience if

867
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:39,500
we if we jump into So my sense
is it's a subtle, interactive

868
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,720
dance between the mind doing the
exploring and the mind being

869
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:49,600
explored. So small mind, big
mind, and when we that the mind

870
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,900
being explored, that the
Universal Mind is an infinite

871
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:57,580
mind capable of infinite
experiences. So the mind we drop

872
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:01,500
into, it acts as a seed,
catalyst. A seed crystal that

873
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,340
cradle catalyzes a certain set
of experiences from its infinite

874
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:09,900
potential. Those experiences
change us. They illumine us,

875
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:14,040
they purify us. They help us
face our conference, confront

876
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:19,560
our restrictions, so that the
next time we drop that mind into

877
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:23,120
the infinite ocean, it's a
different seed, tree seed

878
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:27,440
crystal, it's a different mind,
and it elicits a still deeper

879
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,280
set of experiences out of the
infinite potential. And if we

880
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,840
keep this up, we keep this up,
we are changed by the journey.

881
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,900
We the journey deepens. We're
changed. The Journey deepens

882
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,980
that the universe reveals itself
multiple multiple layers of the

883
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:49,780
universe will systematically
reveal itself in an organized

884
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,380
fashion. My experience, at
least, was that it paid a great

885
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:57,700
deal of attention to making sure
that I understood every lesson

886
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,280
as it was being given me. There
were some sessions which were

887
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:06,000
retroactive and really kind of
going back in the past to

888
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,300
explain what I had experienced.
There were some sessions which

889
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,800
were more showing me where we
were going, but they were always

890
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:19,260
in conscious dialog with this
creative intelligence. So the

891
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:25,340
journey to me is it's much more.
I mean, right now we're just

892
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:27,680
getting started on the
psychedelic Renaissance. You

893
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,880
know, very important work. So
important. The ambitions right

894
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:37,880
now are modest. Get us getting
it legal, learning the biology

895
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:41,680
of psychedelics more clearly
they're how they do, the work

896
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,760
they do, and healing, healing
the personal psyche, healing

897
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,840
from post traumatic stress,
healing from depression, healing

898
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,700
death anxiety, really, really
important work, but healing the

899
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:59,380
personal unconscious is just the
first stage, or the early stage

900
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,160
of a much, longer journey of
exploration,

901
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:09,300
Frank McCaughey: yeah, yeah,
that's for sure.

902
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,400
It's huge. I suppose what I'm
saying and that, I think, in a

903
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,120
way, the person that a lot of
you see, for me, the first of

904
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,940
all, this idea of the hang
hanging up the phone, or not

905
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:36,140
hanging up the phone, I think
that's just a it's just a

906
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:40,780
sentence. It oneness is doing it
73 times, and oneness is doing

907
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:49,900
it once. So that's to me, it's
all happening and anyway, and I

908
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:54,040
suppose I what I'm in, I think
the message is this, that it's

909
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:59,980
a, it's, it's, it is doing the
trip 55 times, 73 times. And

910
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,420
it's, it's in the doing, and
that the hanging up the phone is

911
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:08,700
that it's, it's, you can't hang
up really, because that's who's

912
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:13,920
going to hang up, in a way, and
that, that this is the only

913
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,420
message is that this is it, but
it's not a kind of A fixed it.

914
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,080
Yeah, yeah. That's

915
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,660
Chris Bache: the things. It's
things, it turns out, is when

916
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,420
you go in and out of
Non-ordinary states of

917
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:34,160
consciousness repeatedly, you in
this way, you just, you really

918
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,980
have to face that terrible
moment when you realize that

919
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:41,080
everything you've experienced in
your sessions is taking place.

920
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:47,320
24/7, you're just not tuned into
it. So the joy, the beauty, the

921
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:53,200
work, the clarity, all of that
is taking place continuously.

922
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,640
Oneness does not stop being
oneness just because you start

923
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:01,560
being amount of paying attention
to it. It's all taking place

924
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,220
seriously, so that you begin to
realize, my God, I'm living in

925
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:11,400
heaven. If I pay attention, if
I'm if I'm not paying attention,

926
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,960
then I'm living in the hell of
Samsara, where where we are just

927
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,500
pieces bumping around in a
meaningless universe. But if I'm

928
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,480
paying attention, the innate
oneness of the world springs

929
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,120
into flower around us.

930
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,359
Frank McCaughey: So, yeah, well,
you see, I think that's that

931
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:38,419
shimmering line between what's
happening and stories from the

932
01:09:38,659 --> 01:09:42,759
past and from the future, but
within what's happening there's

933
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:48,279
no room for it's almost
objectifies the universe by

934
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:51,099
creating that separation that
I'm here and I can pay attention

935
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:54,279
to the world out there, and
that's that reinforces the

936
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:59,319
separation that really it isn't
separate anyway, there is no

937
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:00,419
separation. I. Away.

938
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:05,100
Unknown: Yeah, yeah. And in
these sessions, you don't study

939
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,660
the universe as if through a
microscope. You open up to that

940
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:13,560
part of your being where you are
already that part of the

941
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,900
universe. So it's always a
matter of dissolving boundaries

942
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,820
within your own awareness that
allows you to experience, as you

943
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:27,260
say, what is right here right
now. So you dissolve the part

944
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,740
that keeps you separate from it,
and when you then dissolve

945
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:36,320
completely into what's here
right now, you then experience

946
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,560
different aspects of what's here
right now. And so then

947
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,600
Frank McCaughey: beyond stories
and beyond thing, do you know

948
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,620
what you are?

949
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:58,300
Chris Bache: If I if I don't
know what I am right now, it's

950
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,440
not because the universe hasn't
beaten it into my head

951
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:08,100
repeatedly and just showed me
mercilessly the truth of my

952
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,000
being and the truth of all of
our being. So I'd say, Yeah, I

953
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,840
know what I am. That doesn't
mean I can always hold that in

954
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:25,040
my awareness. 24/7, but I've had
ample experiences of of what I

955
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:30,260
am, and that my identity is
essentially the identity of the

956
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:34,400
totality. And with that
experience, there's tremendous

957
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:41,020
relief, tremendous release. All
judgments are dissolved. All

958
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:45,100
judgments good or bad are
dissolved. There is just the

959
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:51,580
infinite joy of one's true
nature, one's true reality, and

960
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:56,800
then the joy of living
consciously in that reality,

961
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:01,740
rather than living unconsciously
in that reality, if we live

962
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:06,060
consciously in that reality, our
life gets better and better. If

963
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:10,080
we live unconsciously in that
reality, then we're subject to

964
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:15,600
the fluctuations of karmic
conditioning. We get caught in

965
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,120
all these scenarios. So the
trick is to stay mindful, to be

966
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,020
aware that we are always in
subtle ways, creating our

967
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:28,400
reality, and we can always
create a better reality if we

968
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:34,940
are more transparent to our
nature, which turns out to be

969
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,200
the same nature which is
bubbling up inside every Living

970
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,540
Thing, inside around us, every
person, every object, it's all

971
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:49,360
one nature, and in that, there
is tremendous relaxation.

972
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:54,040
Frank McCaughey: I think that's
a nice way to finish. I think

973
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:59,680
that's keep talking to you, but
we have so the book. Have a

974
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:04,080
couple of it's available. Is it
online? Now? I'll put a link.

975
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,160
You can send me a link.

976
01:13:05,759 --> 01:13:09,119
Chris Bache: Amazon, I can send
you a link. Amazon.com, in the

977
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:14,399
United States has it on. They'll
be releasing it November 26 I'm

978
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,659
told that England, Amazon will
not be releasing theirs until

979
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:23,179
January 2. I would assume that
Ireland probably is more linked

980
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:28,879
to Amazon com, so either
November 26 in America or

981
01:13:28,879 --> 01:13:30,559
January 2 in UK.

982
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,360
Frank McCaughey: Okay, very
good. And it's on, is it on

983
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,420
Kindle? Also it's, it's both
obvious,

984
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,820
Chris Bache: and there will be
an audio book that will be

985
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:45,400
released. I just finished
recording, and it's going to be,

986
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,900
I recorded it for inner
traditions, yeah, yeah.

987
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:54,220
Frank McCaughey: I mean, it's,
it's an epic journey. Epic is

988
01:13:54,220 --> 01:14:00,420
the only way you've gone. And I
like how, like I said, very

989
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:03,000
start. Also, I like how you
haven't, not necessarily

990
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,600
glamorized. You haven't. This
isn't a prescription. It's a

991
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:12,420
description of what you have
gone through and experienced and

992
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:16,440
you've managed. It's like you
when I was a kid, I used to go

993
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,980
into dreams, and I used to try
and take sweets out of the

994
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:24,380
dreams and bring them home, and
I'd wake up disappointed that I

995
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:28,100
couldn't bring the sweets out.
But in this book, I think you've

996
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:34,760
managed to bring a few diamonds
from heaven. So well done, fair

997
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,320
play. And I put the links up,
and I'll do a short version of

998
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,340
this, and then I'll do a longer
one great.

999
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:45,400
Chris Bache: Thank you, Frank,
thank you for helping me bring

1000
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,760
the book forward. I really do
appreciate it. Excellent

1001
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,860
questions. I enjoyed our
conversation a lot.

1002
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,500
Frank McCaughey: Yeah, likewise.
Thanks for the chat. Thank you

1003
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,020
and good luck with this. I hope
it does well.

1004
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,140
Chris Bache: Thank you. Thank
you very much. Bye, bye. You.

1005
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,120
Day,

1006

Jef Baker: Author and
psychedelic explore. Chris Bache

2
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:12,364
meticulously documented the
insights from 73 high dose LSD

3
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:16,024
sessions conducted over the
course of 20 years, drawing upon

4
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:19,564
his training as a philosopher of
religion and following protocols

5
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:23,300
established by Stanislav Grof,
Chris went on a life changing

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,260
journey to explore his mind.
What he discovered drew him into

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,760
deep communion with cosmic
consciousness. Chris Bache is

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,580
professor emeritus in the
Department of Philosophy and

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,960
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University, where he

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,680
taught for 33 years. Chris is
also adjunct faculty at

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,220
California Institute of integral
studies and a fellow at the

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,540
Institute of Noetic Sciences, an
award winning teacher Chris

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,380
work. Chris's work explores the
philosophical implications of

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,080
Non-ordinary states of
consciousness, especially

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,020
psychedelic states. Chris has
written four books, life cycles,

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,660
a study of reincarnation in
light of contemporary

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,800
consciousness. Research. Dark
Knight, early dawn, a pioneering

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,980
work in psychedelic philosophy
and collective consciousness.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,100
And the living classroom, an
exploration of teaching and

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,860
collective fields of
consciousness. And his new book,

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,320
LSD and the mind of the
universe, which I must say, is

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,020
absolutely brilliant and seems
to be getting really good

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,880
reception with everyone I know
that's that's reading it. It is

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,440
a different foam of, as you
said, the deepest states that

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,540
LSD gives us access to. It

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,900
Chris Bache: was a quite an
adventure, quite a long and

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,160
interesting journey.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,860
Jef Baker: How long did it take
you to write? Because there's

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,560
obviously years of notes, and
well,

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,020
Chris Bache: yeah, I had years
of notes, and all the in the 20

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,160
years that I did the work, and
then I digested that material

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,060
for more years, and then i i
condensed my sessions, took

33
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,360
notes and condensed them and got
prepared, and once I actually

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
started writing, it took five
years. Okay, so it's a long

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,700
project.

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,540
Jef Baker: I think it really
highlights the importance of

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,080
some type of integration. You
being a writer, obviously that's

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,520
your modality of integration.
For others, it's art. For

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,380
others, it's music. But yeah, it
really highlights the importance

40
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,920
of finding a way of making sense
of these experiences after the

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,160
facts. And I remember reading in
the book that you would take the

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,820
time to write as soon as
possible after such an

43
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,440
experience, and to use the music
that you had played during the

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,820
sessions as a trigger, as a
memetic device to or a mnemonic

45
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,120
device to those emotions which
can often get lost in the cloud

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,520
of the intensity of I guess,

47
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,519
Chris Bache: yeah, let me just
mention something about the

48
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,759
method. Just give a context,
because that was an important

49
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:17,219
aid in solving a problem. A
challenging with work. Doing the

50
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,859
work the way that I did, what I
did was to work after three

51
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:25,819
medium dose sessions, always
following Stan Grof protocol. So

52
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,019
I was always totally isolated,
always working with the sitter,

53
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,319
always working with eyeshades
and music. Totally internalized

54
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,159
sessions. After three
preliminary sessions, I did all

55
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,379
the rest of the session. 73
sessions, total, high dose

56
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,979
session. So I was working at,
essentially, I aimed at 600

57
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:50,139
micrograms, so between 506 100
micrograms. So when you're

58
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:54,579
working with doses that high,
and you're going as deep in

59
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:59,679
serial sessions over many years,
recall becomes a serious issue,

60
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:03,179
because you're just pushing the
boundaries of consciousness so

61
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:08,699
deeply. So I found that to
record the sessions, it was

62
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,259
important to record them within
24 hours, and recording them

63
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,979
often had me writing at the very
edges of my comprehension,

64
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,299
because I was trying to describe
experiences that were deeply

65
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,619
mysterious to me at the time, so
I found it was a help if I

66
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:28,879
listened to the music that was
played in the session in exactly

67
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,119
the order in which was played.
And I would play a piece of

68
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:35,359
music over and over again while
I was trying to record the

69
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:39,739
session after the day after, and
then when I was done with that

70
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,279
section, I'd go on to the next
piece of music all the way

71
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:45,519
through, and that really, you
know, because the day after a

72
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,939
session, you're kind of horse
around the edges, but your

73
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:52,779
verbal functions are back, so
you're one foot in, one foot

74
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:57,579
out. And I found by listening to
the music, I could get into a

75
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:02,579
state where. I called it
standing at the edge of the

76
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:07,319
well, where I would basically
get back in the edge of it and

77
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,419
enough that I could get it down
on

78
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,560
Jef Baker: paper. Yeah, still a,
still a liminal stage. Yes, I

79
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,500
remember. I remember you writing
that some of the things you'd

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,660
written down during the session,
it might have been like reality

81
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,640
is, which, at the time, can be
so profound and meaningful, and

82
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,740
you read it back later, and you,
of course, it is safe, is

83
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,840
obviously sifting through that
stuff to to get your teams that

84
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,320
can really

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,280
Chris Bache: be applied. And in
general, General, I didn't try

86
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,500
to make notes or record anything
during the session itself,

87
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:51,700
because I was so far removed
that, you know, I just wasn't

88
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,720
even in touch with my own body,
let alone with anything going on

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,380
in the room

90
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,540
Jef Baker: interesting. Because
that's, that's something I've

91
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,040
been thinking a bit about
recently, is recording sessions

92
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,660
in the moment, particularly with
five Meo DMT and Toad medicine,

93
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,380
because people seem to be
channeling stuff. Things are

94
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:17,160
coming through languages and and
vocalizations that are the quite

95
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,680
simply out of this world, which
there is almost no way of

96
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,760
recollecting afterwards. And so
there does to be some merit in

97
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,320
recording in the moments to
catch up things that might come

98
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,460
through when your vessel is
empty and universal.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,480
Chris Bache: Maybe it may vary
by substance and agenda the

100
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,860
course. The tricky part about
the five Meo experience is how

101
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,160
fast it is. It's short and it's
incredibly fast. And the LSD

102
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,400
experience is very, very long.
It's an eight hour window. So it

103
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,460
each of them pose distinct
challenges for recall and

104
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,240
integration

105
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Jef Baker: as and as generally
applicable across all all

106
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,200
psychic medicines, I think they
all have their own unique

107
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,800
challenges. Defines Grof
protocol, what's I guess, the

108
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,540
key question to begin with is,
what made you decide to do such

109
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,680
large doses, given that Dan's
general in his protocol,

110
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,000
Chris Bache: yeah, well, you
know, in Stan's early work, he

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,360
clearly differentiates between
psycholytic or low dose therapy

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,680
and psychedelic high dose
therapy. And the protocol for

113
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,020
psychedelic therapy was, they
developed this in Spring Grove

114
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,140
Hospital, and they were trying
to trigger a near death episode

115
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,300
experience with patients who
were terminally ill. So and it

116
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,040
was limited to three sessions, I
thought, well, if you could go

117
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,340
into high dose session space
three times, you could do it

118
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,680
more times. If you could do it
safely three times, you could do

119
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,400
it safely multiple times. And I
guess in the beginning I did

120
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,060
high dose sessions simply
because it was hard to find time

121
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,240
to do sessions in a dual career
marriage. And soon there were

122
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,080
children involved, just to get
in both of our schedules, to get

123
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,980
a day where we could give the
entire day over to this work.

124
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,640
And so I thought I was still
thinking in terms of a personal

125
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,520
model of therapeutic engagement.
So all the Eastern sources that

126
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,060
I had, you know, I'm professor
of religious studies, teaches

127
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,180
religion, psychology of
religion, and these eastern

128
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,940
sources basically said your
karma is ultimately finite, over

129
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,360
even with many lifetimes, your
karma is finite. And I thought

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,660
that I could just work through
mine faster by working with high

131
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,320
doses. I knew the sessions would
be hard, but I thought if I

132
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
could just stay grounded and
stay focused and confronting the

133
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,040
shadow, I could just work
through my shadow faster that

134
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,820
way, eventually that that whole
protocol was shattered when I

135
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,720
began to realize that what was
happening in my sessions went

136
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,140
far beyond anything that
concerned only my personal

137
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,440
psyche and my personal karma, my
personal soul,

138
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,020
Jef Baker: even after that
point, sorry that would be At

139
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,840
the point of the ocean of
suffering that you experienced

140
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,460
where, yeah, was quite honestly
hard to read that that

141
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:34,040
experience of the entire
collective human pain throughout

142
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,120
all of history,

143
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah, it is
hard to read. I had to really

144
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,300
give some careful thought of how
much to expose that because I

145
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,760
know it's challenging for
readers to go into that

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,940
material, but just to finish
that other topic, even once I

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,660
let go of that personal model, I
found that I developed I liked

148
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,700
where the high dose work took
me. Me, and it took me farther

149
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,620
than I imagined, and I developed
a taste for it. Now I don't

150
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,380
recommend this protocol. I
really don't. I would do it

151
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,100
differently if I were doing it
over again today, I would be

152
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,140
much gentler on myself. I would
balance high dose work with low

153
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,040
dose work. I would balance LSD
with Psilocybin, Ayahuasca, more

154
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,640
organic psychedelics. But at the
time, I mean, this was really, I

155
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,400
started in 79 so I did this work
between 79 and 99 when I was 30

156
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,620
to 50 years old. So at the time,
Ralph, I just, I ended up

157
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,680
pushing myself harder than I
would recommend other people to

158
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,140
push themselves. It's really not
necessary.

159
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
Jef Baker: I also got in the
book too, which is good, yeah,

160
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,580
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah. I
thought that the goal was to get

161
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,760
somewhere, you know, to get to
some end point that would be

162
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,580
enlightenment or oneness with
God or the primal void, and I

163
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,940
came to realize that that was a
naive expectation late, I mean,

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,240
50 sessions in, I had
experiences which convinced me

165
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,800
that the universe is infinite
and the Divine is infinite.

166
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,640
Well, it's not a matter of
getting to the end or some

167
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,960
ultimate state. It's a matter of
opening ourselves as deeply as

168
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,840
we can to the intelligence of
the universe or to the

169
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,740
intelligence of the Divine,
letting as much of it into us as

170
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,460
possible, and stabilizing it as
deeply as possible.

171
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,739
Jef Baker: So you would have
known that, at least on a

172
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:45,819
theoretical level, from Eastern
Studies, that that

173
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:49,359
enlightenment, you know, is,
isn't a destination, it's it's a

174
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:55,179
journey, as cliche as that may
sound. So you would have gone

175
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:59,799
into into the sessions with
that, at least in mind as a

176
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,879
conceptual

177
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,740
Chris Bache: Mm, hmm.
Conceptual, yeah, but I found

178
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,120
even even the Eastern models
that I was familiar with and

179
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,120
working with did not
encapsulate, or did not profile

180
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,140
the full scale of the
experiences that opened in this

181
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,520
journey, because I found that,
yes, you can work through

182
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,540
multiple layers of the Bardo,
the inter the after death

183
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,320
states. You can go into extra
Samsara reality, into spiritual

184
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,400
dimensions beyond the Bardo. But
whereas Buddhism, particularly,

185
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,060
which is kind of the the Eastern
traditions that I was most

186
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,240
familiar with and most
comfortable with, even that

187
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,160
tradition sort of stops at that
point and says it invokes the

188
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,560
grand silence. You know, when
the Buddha was asked the

189
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,860
ultimate questions, he invoked
the grand silence. He wouldn't

190
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,720
describe it, and I found that
there were realities that would

191
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:11,940
open at that dimension that were
just well so beyond that

192
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,200
Jef Baker: grand silence is
correlated with ineffability,

193
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,280
which is often thrown about in
The psychedelic world,

194
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,840
particularly in relation to
these large doses. And I

195
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,200
remember noting the concept of
ineffability in the book that,

196
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,620
yeah,

197
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,360
Chris Bache: well, as I say in
the book, I think ineffability

198
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,720
is overrated, as it's a
category. I mean, it really

199
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,260
comes from William James in
discussing this talk, one of the

200
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:48,940
qualities of mystical experience
is ineffability. And I of

201
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,220
course, ultimately our rational
mind and our verbal mind fall

202
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:01,440
silence when confronting the
infinite. But I work very, very

203
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,440
hard to put language to things,
and I believe in pushing

204
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,880
language as far as humanly
possible repeatedly before

205
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,320
surrendering to the ineffable.
So because if we, if we

206
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,720
prioritize ineffability as one
of the primary features of

207
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,820
mystical experience, it almost
as is, is as if we're saying the

208
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,520
divine wants to be not known.
And my experience is that the

209
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:38,120
divine wants to be known. And so
ineffability, I think, often is.

210
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,200
It's a symptom of hitting our
experiential limits. But if we

211
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,480
it, when we break into a new
level of consciousness, we can't

212
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,140
bring all of it back. There are
gaps in my notes. We just can't

213
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,380
bring it all back. But I found
that if you go back to that same

214
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,540
level of consciousness again and
again and again, I. The

215
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,720
experiences that were
undigestible or unrecognizable

216
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,360
or ineffable in the beginning
become comprehensible with

217
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,300
repetition and with experience.
So to me, if you can't say where

218
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,620
you went, this a little harsh,
but if you can't say where you

219
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,720
went, you probably just got
lost.

220
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,400
Jef Baker: And it reminds me of
McKenna's saying about bringing

221
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,140
back a middle sized fish that
bring something back for the

222
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,760
community. You know, you've been
living in the realms of, you

223
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,520
know, extraordinary
consciousness. You need to bring

224
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,140
back something useful.
Otherwise, what's it for? At

225
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,620
least you can I go bring it back
and articulate it and express

226
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,160
it. And particularly for me,
that's creative. And Devon seem

227
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,020
to have a real sort of purity
about them, that you can create

228
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,440
something beautiful, the
painting or a sculpture, that

229
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,020
others can see and appreciate.
It's one of the it's a true gift

230
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,040
to be able to articulate this
like experience and a creative

231
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,400
manner. Yeah, writing certainly
falls into that category. Yes,

232
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,660
yeah,

233
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,140
Chris Bache: I found it just
takes time. I mean, I've really

234
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,900
had to sit with my experience
for years and years to

235
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,760
understand, in fact, it's a
general rule of thumb, I would

236
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,560
never talk about an experience
till five years after I'd had

237
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:34,160
it, because it just takes a lot
of time to fully digest and to

238
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,120
understand. In fact, I had the
narrative. Man had recorded my

239
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,640
experiences all the way through,
but I was still learning things

240
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,720
about the journey in the process
of writing the entire journey

241
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,140
down.

242
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,440
Jef Baker: Yeah, I've noticed
that too, when you start to

243
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,700
write things down, other things
fall in it so like, it creates a

244
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,560
space for those perhaps
otherwise forgotten aspects to

245
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,180
drop back in and there's even
aspects of this Amazon shamanic

246
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,020
tradition that say you shouldn't
speak like sharing circles are

247
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,220
not a thing simply because you
by sharing your experience the

248
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,660
next morning, it dilutes it.

249
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,439
Chris Bache: Yeah, I had to
really in Buddhism also, one

250
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,559
does not speak about one
spiritual experiences except to

251
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,159
one's teacher. And I had to sit
with that for a long time,

252
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:31,819
because Buddhism is, you know,
an important tradition for me,

253
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,839
as all the traditional spiritual
traditions are, but particularly

254
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:41,499
Buddhism, and I really had to
ponder whether I should even be

255
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:46,959
talking about these experiences,
but in the end, my experience

256
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:52,119
was that the universe wanted me
to share what it was that she or

257
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:57,459
it had allowed me to experience.
I didn't I didn't program my

258
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:00,899
experiences. I didn't choose
what I experienced. Something

259
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:04,619
else. Was entirely in control of
my experiences through the

260
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:10,079
entire journey, and at the end,
you know, the universe made it

261
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:15,299
clear that said you didn't give
yourself those experiences. We

262
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,359
gave you those experiences.
Those experiences were never

263
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,039
meant for you by yourself. They
were always meant for you to

264
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:26,419
share with others, and I think
we it's basically no one

265
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,839
person's experiences are really
important, but when all of our

266
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,159
experiences are shared together
in the circle, then we begin to

267
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,839
have a deeper understanding of
this mysterious universe that

268
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,479
we're Exploring. Yeah, and

269
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,440
Jef Baker: can build a cultural
picture that then yeah as a

270
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,640
context for it, yeah. Just to go
back with what you said earlier

271
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,180
about if you were to do it
again, differently, that you

272
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,480
would use different plants,
almost like, and, you know,

273
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,860
different compounds, almost like
building a house. You use

274
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,760
different tools for different
parts of the construction. Do

275
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,580
you work with other plants now?
Or did you end your experiences

276
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,620
at that 73 photos sessions, if
they saw much personal

277
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,460
questions?

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,280
Chris Bache: Yeah, no, not at
all. No, I still use medicines

279
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,220
from time to time, though, much
less than I used to. I mean,

280
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,420
somewhat, it's a young man's
game, a young person's game. I'm

281
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:35,120
70 years old now, so if I
haven't learned by now, yeah,

282
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,840
yeah. So you know, after I
stopped my work, the LSD work in

283
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:46,240
99 and after that, from time to
time, I would do light sessions,

284
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,820
or I would do Psilocybin
sessions, and a few times

285
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,020
Ayahuasca sessions, or salvia
divinorum. So I, you know,

286
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,100
broaden my experience by working
with those substances. But the

287
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:03,180
LSD work was in a category unto.
Itself, and I found one of the

288
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:10,500
things I found was that my body,
my system, was storing energy

289
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,740
over time. So when I was doing
multiple sessions, my system was

290
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,020
storing energy of those sessions
and then using that stored

291
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,700
energy periodically to trigger
breakthroughs into new levels of

292
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,920
consciousness, so that I if I
were to even take a massive dose

293
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,880
of LSD today, I would not be
able to get back to where I was

294
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,080
working regularly when I
finished my work in 99 it would

295
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,800
take years for me to develop the
energy, the power, to be able to

296
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,660
access those deeper dimensions
of of the universe. My

297
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,700
understanding over time that
developed was every step into a

298
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,380
deeper level of consciousness is
a step into a higher energy, a

299
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,540
higher energetic

300
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,720
Jef Baker: state really stood
out that line, yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,860
Chris Bache: And it just takes a
long time to develop the power

302
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,300
to access these very, very
highly energized states of

303
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,380
consciousness.

304
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,420
Jef Baker: And I think that's um
working with, with integration,

305
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,740
particularly with five Meo, I
noticed this, a lot of people

306
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,260
can be quite depersonalized,
disassociated after a very high

307
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:33,200
dose toe session. And one of the
things we advise as embodiment

308
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,460
is to bring that energy back
into the body and to ground it

309
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,520
through the earth, not to go
into meditation, which is going

310
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,180
to get you more into the
ethereal realms, to bring it

311
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,900
back and into the earthly realm,
almost to discharge it. It's

312
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,280
like your body becomes a
capacitor for this energy. Yeah,

313
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,160
it's been an empty vessel to
accept it. You're right. I think

314
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,720
it was a good, good point to
jump into the three other two

315
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,100
phases. You spoke about the
cleansing and the ecstatic

316
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,760
phase.

317
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,619
Chris Bache: Yeah, basically
working the way I did, I found

318
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:20,419
that my sessions basically had
two phases. Though, at the

319
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:23,659
beginning of every phase there
was some type of intense

320
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:28,639
cleansing or purification
process. And if you surrender to

321
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,459
that, if I surrender to that
completely, that would

322
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:35,119
eventually come hit a peak
threshold, and then there would

323
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,259
be some type of Death-Rebirth
process, and then the rest of

324
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:43,599
the session was sent in an
ecstatic state, in some type of

325
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,379
transcendent experience of some
form or another. And that

326
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:51,999
process kept repeating itself
over and over through the years.

327
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,340
Jef Baker: You know, you think
goes all down to the nature of

328
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,060
the compound itself. I guess
just the way LSD works is a

329
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,120
turnaround point halfway at
those days?

330
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,700
Chris Bache: No, I don't think
so. I think we're looking at

331
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,540
it's one of the dynamics of
consciousness that when you are

332
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,800
opening to deeper levels of
consciousness. These deeper

333
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:19,620
levels of consciousness require
a just to enter them triggers a

334
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,060
purification, a spontaneous
purification of your of your

335
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,200
system, purification of your
thoughts, of your emotions,

336
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,960
purification of your body. And
so just when you're when you're

337
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,500
entering into these very, very
intense, very, very pure states

338
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,400
of consciousness, you just start
a spontaneous detoxification

339
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,580
process. And there's so many
concepts and belief systems and

340
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,740
emotional complexes that we all
carry that have to be taken

341
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,280
apart, have to be undone, if
we're going to experience the

342
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,020
universe at that deeper level.

343
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,280
Jef Baker: On Ayahuasca as and
then obviously the Purge is very

344
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,520
much associated with Ayahuasca,
but as you point out it, it's

345
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,940
applicable to all psychedelic
medicines in which you need to

346
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,380
remove the blockages in your own
system, be they psychological,

347
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,700
emotional, energetic, before you
can open up and then be open to

348
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,780
those levels. And so you
extrapolated three factors from

349
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,980
those two phases to

350
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,579
Chris Bache: refresh me on which
particular ones are you plugging

351
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,479
into there?

352
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,800
Jef Baker: So there's the
cleansing and ecstatic phase

353
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,720
with a sliding line between two
functions of the larger whole

354
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,700
which was influenced by three
factors that related to each

355
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,100
planetary setting,

356
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,540
Chris Bache: yeah, and the and
then first, the depth of the

357
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,440
ecstatic portion of the session
would be was influenced by

358
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,700
several. Factors as I came to
understand it. One of them was

359
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,880
the depth of cleansing that had
taken place in the first part of

360
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,900
the session. So usually, the
deeper the cleansing, the deeper

361
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,100
the ecstatic revelation,
ecstatic entry. The second one

362
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,820
was the depth of cleansing that
had taken place in all of the

363
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,040
sessions up to that point in
time. So naturally, I say in the

364
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,700
book, you expect a deeper
experience 50 sessions into a

365
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,780
journey than on the first couple
of sessions into a journey. And

366
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,800
the third has to do with this
energy quality, the quality of

367
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,000
the massive amounts of energy
that's involved. So when you

368
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,800
work in serial sessions, and I
was doing, on average, about

369
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,720
five sessions a year. So I
worked for four years, I stopped

370
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,460
for six years, and then I worked
for 10 years, and on average, I

371
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,820
was doing about five a year. So
when you're working

372
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,780
systematically like that, you're
taking your body and your mind

373
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,480
into those states. It you build
up this energetic momentum. It's

374
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,180
like an athlete in training. You
know, the more you train, you

375
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,140
build up this, this energy,
which then carries you through

376
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,080
new performance levels. And I
think that happens with the

377
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,960
universe too. It just, it
carries you into deeper levels

378
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,300
of consciousness. I found that I
because these sessions were so

379
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,340
intense and they were so
demanding, psychologically and

380
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,400
demanding physically, I really
had to prepare myself for days

381
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,480
before every session physically,
yoga wise, chiropractic wise,

382
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,560
making sure my body was
carefully aligned, and then

383
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,240
spiritually, dietarily,
spiritually, I would there were

384
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,900
certain practices that I would
do before a session and other

385
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,540
practices that I would do to
integrate the session

386
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,660
afterwards. So yeah, because
it's just so extremely intense.

387
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,880
Jef Baker: It was interesting.
You use the term breadth there

388
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,860
as well, not only depth, but
breadth like width, like a

389
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,000
bandwidth, which is first time
I've heard it sort of referred

390
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,600
to that way.

391
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,399
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, in
certain specific experiences,

392
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:27,199
the breadth has is a is a
metaphor that describes the ways

393
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:31,099
in which we connect with
humanity, we connect with other

394
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:35,179
persons, we connect with nature.
We can enter into states of

395
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:39,379
consciousness who are extremely
wide. So to speak. Depth is

396
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:44,199
something different. Depth is
entering into contact with

397
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,419
deeper levels of reality, other
systems of reality, other

398
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:55,239
beings, archetype of reality,
void, the pure void, cosmic

399
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:58,839
void, types of reality. Those
are different, different

400
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,399
categories of experience.

401
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,180
Jef Baker: Okay, that might be a
good point to talk about

402
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,320
archetypes.

403
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,540
Chris Bache: Hmm. Well, let me
just kind of lay out some of the

404
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:14,580
sequences the categories when I
when I got to the end of the

405
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,540
journey, well, I went through
what I experienced as a series

406
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,560
of punctuated death and rebirth
experiences. So I would break

407
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,440
into a new level of
consciousness. I would then

408
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,580
stabilize at that level over
multiple sessions, and I'd

409
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,240
become more familiar with that
level, and I'd get to understand

410
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,720
it more and become more
cognitively how it works and

411
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,680
energetically. Would be purified
by the process of engaging that

412
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,780
level of consciousness. And then
over time, if I kept pushing, I

413
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,680
would come to a threshold, and I
would go through another death

414
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,740
and rebirth process, and that
would drive me into yet another

415
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,020
level of reality, and it would
start all over again, having to

416
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,380
stabilize my consciousness at
that level, having to learn how

417
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,940
to manage the factors at level.
So when I got to the end of the

418
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,800
journey, and I was looking back,
I asked myself, well, how many

419
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,300
levels of consciousness did I
enter, how many fundamental core

420
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,060
platforms did I go through? And
I basically boiled them down to

421
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,960
five. So there was a level of
work at the personal level of

422
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,020
consciousness, and then there
was a level of work at the

423
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,980
collective level of collective
mind, which is where the, you

424
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,160
know, the ocean of suffering,
work, and where the purification

425
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,660
was really aimed at the
purification of the collective

426
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,740
psyche, more than the personal
psyche. And after that, there

427
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,760
was the archetypal dimension of
consciousness, entering into

428
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,220
archetypal consciousness, and
then entering into oneness, or

429
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,300
causal consciousness, and then
entering finally, into what I

430
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,040
call the diamond Luminosity.
Which is what Buddhism would

431
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,220
call Dharmakaya, the clear light
of absolute reality. So for me,

432
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,500
after I went through death and
rebirth at a personal level, and

433
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,340
then after I went through that
took about two years. And then

434
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,680
after two years of work at the
collective level, working at the

435
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,460
in the purification part,
working in the ocean of

436
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,960
suffering work and then
experiencing successive deeper

437
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,260
initiations into the universe,
and a chapter that I call

438
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,940
initiation of the universe. Then
I was spun into archetypal

439
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:43,480
reality. My experience was when
I entered archetypal reality, I

440
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,500
had the extraordinary sensation
that I was entering a level of

441
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:53,020
reality that was more real than
time and space was. It was more

442
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:58,420
real than our lives here was,
and it took me a long time, you

443
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,200
know, several sessions, to
stabilize and to be able to

444
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,800
enter that level of reality. And
the nature of death that was

445
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,600
required to enter that reality
was different than ego death. I

446
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,580
had to literally die as a human
being in order to enter

447
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,400
archetype of reality. So I found
that there was a level of

448
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,680
identity that we all have as
human beings. It's our it's our

449
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,340
humanness. It's our human
identity that's deeper than our

450
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:31,760
personal identity, and the human
identity had to die in order to

451
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,660
function at a level of
consciousness that allowed me to

452
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,500
have access to levels of reality
beyond human consciousness,

453
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,300
beyond the collective psyche
began the and entering into

454
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,160
archetype of reality. And there
I basically, I only spent about

455
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,060
a year and a half at that level,
I mean, which is not much time.

456
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,120
That just the tip of the
iceberg, in a way, but I

457
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,240
experienced sort of two levels
of archetype reality, one which

458
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,620
you might think of as a more of
a platonic level, I encountered

459
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:11,940
beings phenomena that were vast.
I mean, they were just huge. I

460
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,320
could not wrap my mind around
them. I mean, I just they were

461
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,340
just staggering that they are,
they were the forces of nature

462
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,200
that were responsible for
creating time and space and for

463
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,500
orchestrating the events that
were taking place in time and

464
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,460
space, and then at a lower level
of consciousness, at what I

465
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,900
would call a Union level of
consciousness, I entered into

466
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,900
repeated experiences of
experiencing the the psyche of

467
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,940
the human species, or the
literally the collective

468
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,460
unconscious, how, how the system
works, that the human species

469
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,720
lives as a single entity,
psychologically, even

470
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,920
physically, that our minds are
cells within our collective

471
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,900
mind, and our bodies are cells
within the collective body of

472
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,980
humanity. I learned that our
healing of our individual

473
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,360
diseases contributes to a
healing of those conditions

474
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,280
within the body of humanity as a
whole. So it was just over and

475
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,064
over again being taken into the
dynamics of wholeness, the

476
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:27,804
wholeness of our species. And I
think these these experiences,

477
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:31,704
which were always there, it was
like I was being educated one

478
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:34,824
after another, first stabilizing
at this level, going to another

479
00:33:34,824 --> 00:33:38,124
level, going to another level.
And I think these experiences

480
00:33:38,124 --> 00:33:43,120
were teaching me what I needed
to know in order to receive the

481
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,920
visions that came later on,
where humanity is going, the

482
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,980
birth of the future human, the
crisis that we're coming to in

483
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,380
history. What that's all about?

484
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,100
Jef Baker: Great, yeah. I think
what that really shows too, is

485
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:04,140
the fractal nature of of
reality, describe the different

486
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,500
levels as being parts of the
whole. And it's interesting you

487
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,380
mentioned entities, because it's
something that we tend to

488
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:15,300
associate with DMT more than
anything, even though we know

489
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,320
from those experiences that,
yes, you have to die and there

490
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,420
has to be death of the self, in
order to open up to those, those

491
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:29,480
larger realms, I just wanted to
acknowledge things I just

492
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,020
noticed in my notes. Um, Kalin
de e, were you aware of

493
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,500
Chris Bache: his work? I'm sorry
say again we. Were you

494
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:44,200
Jef Baker: aware of Kalin D E,
who was a large advocate for 30

495
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,420
grams of dried mushrooms, plus,
and he was entering some very,

496
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:54,940
very deep realms of Psilocybin.
He passed recently. Last week, I

497
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,000
just started my notes and then
shooting logic there before I

498
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,200
forgot.

499
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,720
Chris Bache: Um. No freight.

500
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:07,620
Jef Baker: Now, did you have a
teacher during all of this? You

501
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,180
give me no practice

502
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,580
Chris Bache: a spiritual
teacher. Are Well, no, I

503
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,540
consider the universe my only
teacher. See one of the things

504
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,720
that maybe is a little unusual
about my experiences compared to

505
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,340
other people I've talked to is
that I didn't have a lot of

506
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,780
contact with individual beings,
which are so common in the DMT

507
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:38,720
experience. And I, over time,
I've really pondered why that

508
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,320
was the case, and basically, I
kept being dissolved into levels

509
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,380
of being, and then being
dissolved into deeper levels of

510
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,060
being, and kind of opening up
into vast expanses of

511
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,960
consciousness and vast
dimensions of and learning how

512
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,400
the universe works, but not in a
way which engaged, involved

513
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,500
engaging individual beings who
live on those levels. And about

514
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,680
the closest I could come to
encountering beings as such,

515
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,120
like that is when I described
archetypal reality. But these,

516
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,580
these realities were so large, I
the best my mind could do to

517
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,000
image them was to image them as
galaxies. I saw them as

518
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,780
galaxies, billions and billions
of light years wide. They were

519
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,160
so foreign. But in general, I
mean, I have had contact with

520
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,800
beings, with Psilocybin, or with
Ayahuasca, things like that, but

521
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,720
the LSD work just kept
dissolving me into deeper and

522
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,420
deeper into being itself, so
that there was always I would

523
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,080
encounter an intelligence, and
an intelligence would guide me

524
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,640
and orchestrate and teach me and
talk to me. And it was an ever

525
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,840
deepening, cascading deepening
of this intelligence, but I

526
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,980
never had the sense of
encountering or experiencing

527
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:15,120
discrete intelligences. So to
me, the universe is a is an

528
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:24,080
infinite potential, and I
experience a dialog or rapport

529
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:29,000
or dissolving into deeper and
deeper and deeper layers of this

530
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,600
infinite ocean. And so I
consider, I mean, I consider the

531
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,380
universe, my teacher and the
universe was always there

532
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,940
articulately at the other end,
but the nature of the

533
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,960
intelligence that I was
encountering kept changing, kept

534
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,580
deepening as it went, as it took
me deeper. So it's, I think

535
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:57,160
Jef Baker: there's a little
different lots about LSD itself

536
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,860
in relation to the other
compounds. I think that there is

537
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,280
a kind of resonance between the
form of the subs or compounds or

538
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,560
plants, and the experience, to
me, LSD has always been a very

539
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:21,020
human centric experience from,
you know, the therapeutic levels

540
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,620
of the individual self and the
cleansing right through to our

541
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:33,260
place in the largest Cosmos we
can imagine. But as you noted,

542
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,500
it's not about sort of beings
from other realms or other

543
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:43,900
realities or other dimensions.
It seems to be very grounded in

544
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:51,520
the human psyche and what it's
infinitely capable of. And I

545
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,860
don't know, I'd love to get your
thoughts on this, whether that

546
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,300
has anything to do with the
synthetic nature of it being,

547
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,180
you know, discovered by Hoffman
in a laboratory, as opposed to

548
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,000
occurring in the deep jungles or
Daniel bush. Yeah.

549
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:13,979
Chris Bache: Well, you know,
people, a lot of people, have a

550
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:17,279
lot of convictions around the
difference between synthetic

551
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:23,359
psychedelics and organics. Yeah,
and I don't really have a big

552
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,639
investment in that distinction.
I don't have enough data points

553
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,019
to really draw a lot of
conclusions, but I would do have

554
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:42,159
this observation substances. The
longer humanity has worked with

555
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,519
a substance, I think there are
energetic fields like Rupert

556
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,779
sheldrakes, morphogenetic fields
that develop around a substance.

557
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:53,919
So when people have the
experience of encountering the

558
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:59,679
Ayahuasca deity or the
Psilocybin deity, I cannot but

559
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,359
think. That in some ways, the
substance, the experience we

560
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,319
have with Psilocybin or with
Ayahuasca, which humanity has

561
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:11,279
been using for 1000s of 1000s of
years, that there's a certain

562
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:15,239
way in which all of humanity's
experiences with this substance

563
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:19,379
create a field surrounding this
chemical. So when I take this

564
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:23,419
chemical, it's not just putting
a chemical into my body, in some

565
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:27,019
sense, I am opening myself to
the field of humanities

566
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:31,999
experience with this substance.
LSD is basically a new

567
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:37,159
substance. It's only a few
decades old, and 60s and 70s is

568
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:41,139
nothing compared to the length
of time that human beings have

569
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:45,399
been using Ayahuasca. So I have
always experienced LSD to be a

570
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:49,539
very clean substance in that
respect, without a lot of

571
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:53,679
cultural baggage around it,
using it the way that I did, and

572
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,759
to me, it just, it just shatters
me. It dissolves my

573
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:00,959
consciousness over and over and
over again at deeper and deeper

574
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:06,299
levels, and takes me into
territory which felt kind of

575
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:11,099
from an evolutionary
perspective. It felt fresh. It

576
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,579
there were places that I went
that did not feel like there

577
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:19,379
were many footprints on them
from other human beings, and I

578
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:22,639
don't have that experience when
I worked with Psilocybin or with

579
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:29,299
Ayahuasca, where the those
territory feel more frequently

580
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:31,039
traveled, so to speak.

581
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:34,039
Jef Baker: Well, it's
interesting that you also note

582
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:37,939
the experience of perceiving the
universe as feminine.

583
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:44,679
Chris Bache: Yeah, for a couple
of reasons, two reasons that I

584
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:49,179
talked about in the book. The
first reason is simply because

585
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:53,199
of the tremendous love that the
experience of the universe

586
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:58,419
triggered in me and just awoke
within me, and the deep heart

587
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:04,079
felt opening and the the depth
of passion that I felt for the

588
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,419
universe that was taking me in
that love, which for me, had a

589
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:14,579
feminine quality to it. But the
other reason was because of the

590
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:20,959
specific cosmology that emerged
in my sessions. And this

591
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:24,739
cosmology surprised me. It
wasn't one that I had

592
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:27,979
internalized or taken in from
any of the sources that I had

593
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:31,519
read. And the cosmology
basically there was an

594
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,579
experience, a series of
experiences, that took me back

595
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:39,379
to the beginning of creation,
back before the Big Bang, and I

596
00:42:39,379 --> 00:42:44,499
experienced the universe as
basically emerging out of this

597
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:49,059
primal oneness, which you know,
the oneness becomes the two yin

598
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:59,079
yang. And the experience was
that out of that primal two, one

599
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:03,239
of those consciousness stayed
outside of time and space and

600
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:08,099
stayed intact. And the other
consciousness began a journey of

601
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:12,659
manifesting time and space and
manifesting everything that has

602
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:17,759
evolved in time and space since
the Big Bang. And so the

603
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:21,859
consciousness that stayed
outside of the entire

604
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:27,259
evolutionary or creation project
felt more to me, felt more,

605
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:32,839
quote, masculine, and the
consciousness which created felt

606
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:41,019
more feminine, so that it's felt
congruent with me, To in to I

607
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:44,319
had, I just had repeatedly the
experience of the universe

608
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:51,699
itself as more feminine than
masculine. And I mean, I just

609
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:55,599
has that quality to me. So the
Great Mother lineage is very

610
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,439
strong in me. I've always
understood myself to be deeply

611
00:43:59,439 --> 00:44:01,439
connected to the Great Mother
lineage

612
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,180
Jef Baker: as what I consider in
many cultures around the world.

613
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,380
As you would know, no, yes, of
the earth being the great

614
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,900
mother. Yeah, yeah.

615
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,840
Chris Bache: I consider my work
always in service of the great

616
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,200
mother.

617
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:28,460
Jef Baker: Yeah. So as I noted
earlier, I got to, I'm just up

618
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,380
to the point of deep time in
your book, yeah, perhaps you

619
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:37,460
could give us a little insight
into the nature of deep time,

620
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,220
yeah, and well,

621
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,180
Chris Bache: early on in my
work, when I entered into the

622
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,480
ocean of suffering during the
cleansing part is really, really

623
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,920
intense, collective cleansing,
when I would come through each

624
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,860
session, I would be spun into a
reality that was so foreign to

625
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,840
me that in the beginning I came
back from the My 11. In session,

626
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,320
and I couldn't remember it. I
mean, I I couldn't remember

627
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:09,000
where I had gone. Took me months
to begin to fully remember it.

628
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,660
And what had happened is I
entered what I later came to

629
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,460
call deep time for year and
seven, a total of seven

630
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,740
sessions, I experienced my life
as a completed whole, start to

631
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,540
finish, all the days of my life
as a simultaneously present now

632
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:35,120
and I experienced the totality
of my life beginning to end that

633
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,860
require that was so hard for my
mind to hold on to, because my

634
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:44,200
mind is trained to operate
within linear conditions where

635
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,460
time flows one moment at a time,
but to experience all of the

636
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:52,960
moments of my life as a
simultaneous present. It took

637
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,380
literal It took me an entire
year to learn how to stabilize

638
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,360
consciousness at that condition,
I kept going back and back and

639
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,220
back into the same condition. So
the universe was teaching me how

640
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,540
to be conscious at that
condition. In that condition,

641
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,820
later, I began to enter more
radical dimensions of time. I

642
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,200
entered not personal deep time.
I entered evolutionary deep

643
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:27,740
time. I had experiences of it
wasn't eternity, it wasn't

644
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,100
timelessness. That's a different
experience. It was different

645
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:41,860
swaths of time. It was I would
experience different patterns

646
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,500
within time on a scale of
100,000 years, or within a scale

647
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:53,620
of a million years, either
simultaneously present or in an

648
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,820
accelerated fashion. So I could
sometimes I would experience

649
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,420
centuries going by in seconds,
but I was experiencing life in

650
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:08,640
terms of the rising and falling
of way of generations, just

651
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,720
generations coming and going,
generations after generations in

652
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,160
order to understand or to be
taught, what was happening

653
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,940
underneath the evolutionary
dance. So I just experienced so

654
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,560
many variations on time that I
came to call it deep time,

655
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,200
different. The deep time is
entering into a different

656
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:37,640
modality of time consciousness.
I do think that there in the

657
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,840
universe, there are multiple
envelopes of time, multiple

658
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,940
modalities of time. Linear time
is how the world behaves inside

659
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,080
time space. But as you move to
the edges of space, you move to

660
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:55,660
the edges of time, and they're
between linear time and

661
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:59,440
timelessness, where you're
outside of time altogether. In

662
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,300
that intermediate domain, there
are multiple modalities of time,

663
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,120
and you can learn to stabilize
consciousness at those levels of

664
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:13,320
time. And it seemed that the
universe wanted to teach me

665
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,880
certain things. And the only way
it could teach me certain things

666
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:23,600
was to teach me how to stay
conscious in these unusual

667
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,420
temporal modalities. In fact,
the last of the what I consider

668
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,660
the great visions. The last of
the great visions took place in

669
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,660
the 70th session, and it was one
of the most extreme strip down

670
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,880
that I went through in any of my
sessions, and it moved me into

671
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,700
the most radical experience of
deep time in all of my sessions.

672
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,780
In fact, after this vision, the
universe basically wrapped it up

673
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,540
the next three sessions that
kind of wrapped up our work

674
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:00,040
together. This was the dominant
vision, and it took me far, far

675
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,720
into the deep future, into
humanity's evolutionary future?

676
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,700
Jef Baker: Yeah, yes. I was just
going to ask you, what that that

677
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,100
window of deep time into the
evolution of the human species?

678
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,820
What? What insights that gave
you about our future direction?

679
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:22,159
Chris Bache: Yeah, well,
starting at around the 23rd

680
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:28,399
session and repeating itself in
a punctuated way over the years,

681
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:36,199
the universe kept on taking me
into giving me teachings about

682
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:42,519
the human story. It was
basically giving me the outline

683
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:46,779
of you, what you might call the
master story. And I apologize

684
00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:50,679
for the arrogance of that
concept. I don't mean it as

685
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:54,459
such, but it just kept taking me
over and over again, showing me

686
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:58,359
certain things about humanity.
It kept emphasizing that we were

687
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:01,903
coming to a crescendo. Our
evolutionary journey. We're

688
00:50:01,903 --> 00:50:06,403
coming to a turning point, a
true before and after point, and

689
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:13,063
we after 1000s and hundreds of
1000s of years of struggling and

690
00:50:13,063 --> 00:50:17,083
of course, with reincarnation. I
believe in reincarnation. My

691
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:20,203
first book was on reincarnation.
I've had lots of experiences

692
00:50:20,203 --> 00:50:24,499
around reincarnation. So when I
talk about humanity evolving for

693
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:28,879
100,000 years, this within a
reincarnational framework, not

694
00:50:28,879 --> 00:50:34,219
just a genetic but a
reincarnational development, it

695
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:38,959
kept emphasizing that humanity
was growing, coming to a turning

696
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:43,179
point in its larger evolutionary
story. And it was a turning

697
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:47,259
point that was so decisive that
we would mark history in terms

698
00:50:47,259 --> 00:50:52,359
of the before and after of this
point. And then in the 55th

699
00:50:52,659 --> 00:51:00,119
session, it, it took me it. It
kept showing me that there was a

700
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:10,139
profound opening that was in the
process of emerging in the human

701
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:14,219
heart, a profound change in the
human psyche that was taking

702
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:19,559
place in history. But it didn't
show me how it was going to

703
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:24,019
accomplish this. It never showed
me how, until the 55th session,

704
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,979
and at that session, it took me
deep into the future, deep into

705
00:51:27,979 --> 00:51:32,599
deep time, and it took me into
the death and rebirth of our

706
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:37,579
species. It literally gave me an
experience, not as Chris Bache,

707
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:41,559
but by this time, the boundaries
of Chris Bache had been

708
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:47,619
shattered so many times in so
many ways. It took me into how

709
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:53,679
the species as a whole was going
to experience this death and

710
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,279
rebirth, so that just as
individuals go through death and

711
00:51:57,279 --> 00:52:00,599
rebirths, and a mystic goes
through the dark night of the

712
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:04,259
soul, and then the birth into
spiritual reality. The entire

713
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:08,339
human species was going to go
through a death and rebirth

714
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:14,279
process. And it it gave me that
experience where we it just we

715
00:52:14,279 --> 00:52:20,099
went through a series. This is a
process that takes generations

716
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:25,819
to actualize, but a process
where we it got so bad, where

717
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:31,279
there was a falling apart, a
loss of control, a an unraveling

718
00:52:31,339 --> 00:52:36,739
of the assumptions that we make
in life and we just broke us

719
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:39,799
down, just like in a psychedelic
session when you die and are

720
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:44,199
reborn, the entire species was
going through a loss of control,

721
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:47,859
a breakdown. And just when it
looked like we would all be

722
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:51,399
dead, just when it looked like
we were coming to an extinction

723
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:59,079
event, the worst of it passed,
and we began to emerge and pick

724
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:04,559
ourselves up and go forward. And
when we emerged, a different

725
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:09,659
humanity was in its place.
Something happened in this

726
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:12,719
Death-Rebirth process and this
collective Death-Rebirth

727
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:17,519
process, we were changed
profoundly, a tremendous opening

728
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,439
of the heart, an opening of the
mind, so that the humans that

729
00:53:21,439 --> 00:53:26,899
were coming out of the other
end, this was a shift that took

730
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:30,199
place in the depths of the
collective psyche. It wasn't

731
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:33,739
taking place at the surface of
the individual psyche. This is a

732
00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:37,339
pivot at the core of the
collective unconscious, and when

733
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:41,499
this pivot takes place, all
other all subsequent human

734
00:53:41,499 --> 00:53:46,779
beings will be born within the
contracts or the matrix of this

735
00:53:46,779 --> 00:53:52,539
changed collective psyche. And
it really was literally, I

736
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:57,279
think, an enlightenment of our
entire species, a death and

737
00:53:57,279 --> 00:54:01,619
rebirth and a spiritual opening
of our entire species. Later, I

738
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:05,399
came to understand this in terms
of what I call the birth of the

739
00:54:05,399 --> 00:54:12,719
diamond soul. My understanding
of reincarnation is when we die,

740
00:54:13,439 --> 00:54:19,319
our consciousness expands into
deep spiritual reality. And when

741
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:23,599
we're born, we get small, we
become male female. This that

742
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,879
you know, and then when we die,
we get big. When we're born, we

743
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:32,899
get small. It's like going to
college. When you go to college,

744
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:36,139
you choose specific courses for
the semester. That's your

745
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:39,139
semesters work. Then at the end
of the semester, you go on

746
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:43,359
spring break, summertime, then
you get back small again. So you

747
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,679
just over and over, over and
over, we get big, we get small,

748
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:51,399
we get big and we get small. And
if we keep this up for a few

749
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:57,159
100,000 years, sooner or later,
the large consciousness, which

750
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:00,179
is the consciousness of the
soul, the consciousness. It

751
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:05,039
holds all of our experiences for
all of our lifetimes. That

752
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:08,279
consciousness, which we
naturally return to when we die

753
00:55:08,879 --> 00:55:14,879
in the Bardo condition, that
consciousness, I think, awakens

754
00:55:14,939 --> 00:55:19,379
inside time and space. And this
is what I call the birth of the

755
00:55:19,379 --> 00:55:25,279
diamond soul. We literally wake
up to our entire identity and

756
00:55:25,279 --> 00:55:29,659
our entire history inside time
and space, so that we're no

757
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:33,859
longer even tempted to think
that our present body and the

758
00:55:33,859 --> 00:55:37,879
little bitty consciousness of
ego is our true identity. The

759
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:42,699
soul wakes up on Earth. And I
think that's what's happening

760
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:47,979
for the entire human race, the
crises that we're experiencing

761
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:51,399
that and we're moving into with
global systems crisis and the

762
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:57,099
global ecological crisis, we're
we're experiencing the ending of

763
00:55:57,099 --> 00:56:00,239
a world that was built by the
ego. And the ego is a

764
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:05,459
magnificent like a magnificent
phenomenon, but ultimately it's

765
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,279
it's cut off from each other.
It's cut off from itself. It's

766
00:56:08,279 --> 00:56:11,879
cut off from the other beings.
The culture that we're living in

767
00:56:11,879 --> 00:56:15,899
is a culture that was built by
the ego, and in order to solve

768
00:56:15,899 --> 00:56:19,439
the problems which we are
confronting in this generation,

769
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:23,239
this century, we have to
transcend egoic consciousness.

770
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:26,839
We can't solve these problems at
the level of egoic

771
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:29,299
consciousness. And I think
there's a tremendous

772
00:56:29,299 --> 00:56:34,759
evolutionary drive for us to
give to wake up to our soul, to

773
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:40,039
that soul reality, and literally
give birth to soul consciousness

774
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:44,919
inside time and space, and if we
can imagine what it would be

775
00:56:44,919 --> 00:56:49,539
like to have an entire species
that is awake to their soul

776
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:55,539
reality. Now we're talking about
a turning point in history, and

777
00:56:55,539 --> 00:56:57,459
that's what I think is
happening. I think we are

778
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:02,879
entering a process of labor, and
labor is a, you know, a

779
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:07,799
gestation last a long time.
Labor is fast and short, very,

780
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:12,659
very intense, very, very painful
Day. Humanity has been just

781
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:18,419
dating, developing this capacity
of soul for 1000s and 1000s and

782
00:57:18,419 --> 00:57:22,519
1000s of years. I think we are
entering labor now, this

783
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:26,179
tremendous unraveling, this
tremendous pain of history that

784
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:29,839
we are entering and will
continue to enter for decades,

785
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:36,079
still is not an end an
apocalypse. It's not an end of

786
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,139
existence, an end of life, but
it's giving birth to the future

787
00:57:41,139 --> 00:57:45,159
human. And I think the future
human is the diamond soul.

788
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,180
Jef Baker: Yes, well, Apocalypse
is revelation that's to lift the

789
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:54,640
veil and to reveal the hidden,
the unseen, the new. So you get

790
00:57:54,700 --> 00:58:01,380
the feeling that this time is
now, that this rebirth takes

791
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,540
place. I mean, when we look out
of what's going on at the

792
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:08,400
moment, it certainly feels like
a dramatic catharsis is taking

793
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,200
place. And either go it's like
the forces of freedom and

794
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,300
control are dominating the
battle. And we can either go in

795
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:23,120
two directions, you know,
increasing control and

796
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:27,380
totalitarianism, or increasing
freedom and autonomy and

797
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:32,900
sovereignty. And it's
interesting, because I wonder

798
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:37,520
how much of that is a sort of a
grand narrative, collective

799
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,260
story in the spiritual world
that, because I hear it a lot

800
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:46,240
from many different circles that
you know, we are birthing into

801
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:53,920
the new age, into the new man.
And yeah, and that would be

802
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,820
absolutely beautiful if that was
the case, and indeed is the

803
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:05,100
case, that the painful birth
that we need to go through in

804
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:09,000
order to transition into a
better, more functional, more

805
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,960
balanced species. Elaborate on
that?

806
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,360
Chris Bache: Well, there's a
chapter in the book called The

807
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:22,040
Birth of the future human. And I
discussed this in a chapter

808
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,560
called The Great Awakening in
dark night, early dawn, this

809
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:33,620
book that I wrote in in 2000 and
I go into a deeper in LSD, in

810
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:37,280
the mind of the universe, the
birth of the future human. And I

811
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,600
was first very uncomfortable
going into this territory,

812
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,080
because I'm not comfortable with
what some would call think of as

813
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,280
historical speculation, and I
had begun this work really

814
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,060
thinking in terms I was doing
this work for my individual

815
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:55,900
healing, my individual
transformation, my individual

816
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,600
enlightenment. And that just got
blown away. You. Within a few

817
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,620
years, and everything,
everything the work, the

818
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:08,220
purification, the accessing the
information, the knowledge,

819
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,880
everything seemed to be in
service of the species as a

820
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,120
whole. That's it's like, that's
what the Divine is really

821
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,780
interested in right now, not
that our species is special in

822
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:24,920
the universe, but but the scale
of what the Divine is focused in

823
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,260
on this planet is species wide.
It's not so much individual

824
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:36,020
species wide. And so this was
repeated so many times and so

825
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:42,820
strongly that the entire gist of
my 20 year journey ended up

826
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,320
being focused on this collective
story of death and rebirth. So

827
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,520
every I mean, I have deep
convictions about I think we've

828
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,880
entered the dark night of our
collective soul. We've entered

829
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,180
the dark night, which is a
period of purification we

830
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:02,700
basically are confronting in a
very accelerated manner, the

831
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,940
sins of the past, we would say,
the sins of our fathers, except

832
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,520
we were our fathers. We are our
mothers. You know, so

833
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,120
reincarnation wise, we're
confronting our history. We're

834
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,240
confronting the choices that
we've made and the consequences

835
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,660
of those choices, and we are
purifying ourselves of the

836
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:22,700
toxins left over by those
choices in order to open

837
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:28,220
ourselves up into new dimensions
of our being. Because when we

838
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:35,300
when we open to our soul, it
opens. It has two immediate

839
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:40,780
effects, an enormous expansion
of compassion, because we, we

840
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:44,080
have relationships. I mean, we
haven't met each before, right?

841
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:49,180
You and I are new to each other,
but how many times has your soul

842
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:53,380
and my soul, you know, in
different times in history, made

843
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,800
contact and the people that we
have, our friends and our

844
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,560
enemies, and we have such a
deep, deep history on this

845
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:06,540
planet. So when, when you wake
up as a soul, in a sense, you

846
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:10,860
wake up to that history, and it
has the effect of unleashing an

847
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:16,800
enormous compassion for not only
human beings, but all being, for

848
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:22,100
all life forms. And then there
is when you wake up to that kind

849
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,900
of depth, it also opens up a
deeper experience of communion

850
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:30,500
with cosmic intelligence,
because it's like the ego is

851
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:35,600
operating under a cloud of
obstruction, but when the soul

852
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:41,320
awakens, then It's easier to
enter into conscious rapport

853
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,160
with the consciousness of the
universe itself. So there is

854
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,840
literally an awakening to trans
to transcendent consciousness,

855
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,140
as well as awakening to
tremendous breath of

856
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,680
consciousness. That's where I
think we're heading,

857
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:00,160
Jef Baker: yeah, and I think
your your, um, your description

858
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,600
the ocean of suffering, of
experiencing the pain of every

859
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:09,420
woman that it every that it ever
existed, exemplifies that, that

860
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:15,660
when you experience
empathetically emotionally with

861
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,740
all the beings that you have
been in this model of

862
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:24,440
reincarnation, then it by
accident, has to lead to

863
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,400
something larger. It has to, you
know, resolve into a higher

864
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:36,080
level. So when did you when did
you write dark night early dawn?

865
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,540
In relation to to this book,

866
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:45,640
Chris Bache: I wrote dark night
early dawn. I wrote it in 9596 I

867
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:50,440
stopped my work in 99 when I had
already entered the diamond

868
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,040
Luminosity years. The last five
years of my work were centered

869
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,700
on what I call the diamond
Luminosity work. But I

870
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,680
deliberately when I wrote dark
night early dawn, I deliberately

871
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:06,180
restricted myself, for the most
part, to analyzing only the

872
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:10,200
sessions that emerged in the
first half of my journey. I did

873
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,060
not discuss what was happening
in the second half. I needed

874
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,980
more time to digest them. So in
LSD, in the mind of the

875
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:22,880
universe, I go back to the very
beginning. The whole structure

876
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,600
of the book is just start in the
first session. Take it all the

877
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,780
way through. Every chapter deals
with a certain number of

878
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,840
sessions. Just do it layer by
layer. This is where it started.

879
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:36,860
This is where it went. This is
where it ended. So dark data

880
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:40,960
Ladon was written basically
about three quarters of the way

881
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,280
through the journey itself.

882
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,040
Jef Baker: Okay, that's
interesting because I had not

883
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:48,220
read it, and so I asked one of
our team members Andre to just

884
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:52,240
throw some questions out about
that book, which, which he had

885
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:58,480
read. And he asked him a few,
actually, um. One that stands

886
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,480
out to me here is, um. As a
teacher of comparative religion,

887
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:07,500
your take on the problem of
theodicy, the problem of

888
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:13,080
reconciling a beneficent
intelligence with the radical

889
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:18,180
examples of evil in history, in
present day. Is there a solution

890
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:22,220
to the destructive phenotype
within human minds,

891
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:27,560
Chris Bache: the problem of
suffering and or some people

892
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,380
would say, the problem of evil.
I don't use that category

893
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:34,160
because that's just a
theological interpretation of of

894
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,540
the experience of suffering and
pain. You know, I think

895
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:42,640
Ramakrishna was right.
Ramakrishna said, if you want to

896
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,360
understand God, you must be
willing to look suffering in the

897
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:50,740
face, because suffering doesn't
come from any secondary source.

898
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:56,020
It's not a demonic you know,
agency that you have to you have

899
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:01,080
to look deeply into the logic of
the universe and the logic of

900
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:07,560
creation, if you want to
understand how to reconcile the

901
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:11,940
intelligence of the universe and
the compassion of the universe

902
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,540
with the fact that existence
hurts so much. There's so much

903
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:19,980
pain and suffering here. And I
think the key is understanding

904
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:27,920
that creation or evolution or
the manifestation of life, we

905
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:31,760
are very It's incomplete. We're
not finished. We are we're

906
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:39,200
building something and and the
what we are building is

907
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,900
something which is evolving and
developing over billions and

908
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,820
billions of years. So the
universe, as we find it now and

909
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,140
as we measure it in the last
10,000 years, say, is just a

910
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:56,380
drop in the bucket compared to
the billions of years that

911
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:01,380
preceded it and the billions of
years that come after it. So

912
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,400
it's clearly, there's a great
deal of pain and suffering in

913
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,540
life as we experience in its
current form, but we are

914
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,660
evolving and developing and
becoming more consciousness.

915
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,300
We're learning from our choices.
We're getting more and more

916
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,660
control over our bodies and our
mind, and we're going to keep

917
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:22,340
this up, not for another couple
of decades, or a few more 100

918
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:26,240
years, or even a few 1000 years,
we're going for millions and

919
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,680
millions and billions and
billions of years. So to me,

920
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:35,960
suffering, the scale of
suffering has to be understood,

921
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:40,600
or the logic of suffering has to
be understood, not necessarily

922
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,560
in terms of just what has been
accomplished up to now, but we

923
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,440
have to understand that we are
in a process. We are in

924
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,600
developmental process, and it's
an incomplete process, and so

925
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,840
it's kind of like when you're
building a house and you just

926
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,300
have the stud walls up and you
have the trusses up, but you

927
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,800
don't have the roof on, and the
rain comes and it gets wet

928
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,560
because there's no roof, because
you haven't built the roof yet.

929
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:11,280
But humanity hasn't achieved
levels of capacity that would

930
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:17,160
allow us to stop the suffering,
and it's and it's not because

931
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,280
we're bad and it's not because
we're being forced or

932
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:24,560
manipulated by dark and demonic
forces. It's just a radically

933
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:29,120
incomplete process. We're trying
to continue the process as fast

934
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:29,900
as we can

935
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,900
Jef Baker: now. Do you? Do you
believe within this sort of

936
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:38,000
model of yin and yang, of there
being perfect balance and dual

937
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,660
forces throughout the universe,
that that suffering is balanced

938
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:49,900
equally by pleasure and good in
the world, that for every you

939
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:54,460
know starving child experiencing
the pain of hunger, there is a

940
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:58,660
person experiencing the beauty
of a sunset. Do you think it

941
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,560
exists in that kind of balance?
No, I

942
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,380
Chris Bache: don't think so. I
don't think so, because that

943
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:08,880
would mean if, in the long term
wise, if we were ever going to

944
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,940
continue or deepen our joy, we
would be deepening and

945
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:15,660
continuing our suffering. And I
don't think that's where we're

946
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:22,580
going necessarily. I think we
are. You know, I asked my

947
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:26,780
classes sometimes, when I was
teaching, if I draw a line on

948
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:31,700
the board and the evolutionary
line, and so I would ask, how

949
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:38,780
far are we on the evolutionary
line? Are we, like, 90% along

950
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:43,420
this line? Well, and if you're
90% along the line, then we have

951
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,180
a certain set of conclusions
that would seem to follow when

952
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,420
we look at life and try to
understand it. But what if we're

953
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:54,640
only 1% on this line? What if
everything that we've developed

954
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,580
is really just a little bitty,
bitty bit of this entire

955
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:02,940
process? Then that opens. Up the
picture enormously, up until

956
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:07,560
just a few decades ago, a few
100 years ago, yeah, it opens up

957
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,580
hope. We used to think the
universe was 6000 years old

958
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:16,980
because we added up all the age.
Yeah, now we understand it's

959
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,980
billions and billions of years
old just since this first Big

960
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,880
Bang. And we don't know whether
they had been bangs before. If

961
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,280
it's an expanding and
contracting universe, it may

962
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,660
have been there may have been
other universes that feed into

963
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:33,140
the intelligence of this
manifestation of this universe.

964
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:39,080
So the challenge here is to is
to engage and comprehend the

965
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:44,120
scale of the project that we are
involved in, or to put it a

966
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,480
different way, if you want to
speak within divine terms, is to

967
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:52,700
understand the scale of the
agenda of the Divine. It's like

968
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:57,620
we're literally just children.
We only became self conscious a

969
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:01,080
few 1000 years ago. We only
dropped beneath the level of our

970
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:04,740
individual consciousness to
discover the dimensions of our

971
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:10,020
mind which are universal. Well,
maybe four or 5000 years ago,

972
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,820
we're just beginning to wake up
on this planet, and this planet

973
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:19,440
has been four and a half billion
years in the making, 13 point 7

974
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,620
billion years in the galactic
scale of things, and we're just

975
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:28,820
waking up. We're just getting
started here. And so it's not

976
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:31,280
surprising from that
perspective. And of course,

977
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,360
suffering is the great, great
challenge. I mean, as you say,

978
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,900
the children who are dying, the
children who are suffering from

979
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:44,980
hunger, the injustices that that
surround us completely. I'm not

980
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:49,060
making light of any of those
things in saying this. We have

981
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:52,540
to address those things. We have
to expand and continue to work

982
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:57,160
on those things. But
philosophically, we have to sort

983
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:03,240
of understand that we're just
beginning to wake up to the

984
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:08,820
scale of the universe that gave
birth to us and is continuing to

985
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:12,960
give birth to us. From that
perspective, we have a lot of

986
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,360
work to do, but we have a lot of
hope. I really do think we're

987
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:23,900
becoming a species of Christ, a
species of Buddhas, a species of

988
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:30,920
the Prophet. We are becoming an
entirely higher order of species

989
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,280
over time, and this is going to
be what we're doing. Is

990
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:38,660
extraordinarily important this
time in history, but very, very

991
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,160
hard work. But when we go
through this process, when we

992
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:46,840
give birth to the future human,
like a mother who gives birth to

993
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:52,240
a child, when she holds her
child, she doesn't forget the

994
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:56,080
pain, but she knows that the
pain was worth it in order to

995
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,160
deliver this child. And when we
give birth to the future human,

996
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:04,680
we will look back at all of the
suffering of all of history, and

997
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,580
we will say it was worth it for
where we are and where we're

998
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,060
going.

999
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:12,240
Jef Baker: So so if I'm to
redirect the balance, the

1000
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:18,240
balance of Yin and Yang and pain
and joy is laid out on this

1001
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:23,180
scale of deep time, which which,
I recall you, you referring to

1002
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,720
Bakti in relation to that
concept of, you know, loving

1003
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:34,820
devotion and, you know, yeah,
leaving all beings of pain and

1004
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,560
suffering, yeah,

1005
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:44,200
Chris Bache: Yin Yang. Yin Yang
is a an attempt, by a particular

1006
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,320
culture to articulate some of
the deep structure of the

1007
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:51,940
universe and to point to this
primal duality which then

1008
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,840
divides into the 10,000 things,
becomes the 10,000 things the

1009
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,100
complexity of the evolving of
life. But I don't think, I think

1010
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:05,040
we have to be careful not to
hang too much on the primary

1011
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:10,260
polarity, good, bad, male,
female, things like this. But

1012
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,860
the bhakti is a different issue.
And this was a surprise to me.

1013
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:18,780
In Hinduism, there are four
systems of spiritual work, four

1014
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:25,580
yogas, this, Yana, yoga, the the
yoga of meditation, Karma Yoga,

1015
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:33,980
the yoga of action. Blanking on
bhakti is the is the yoga of

1016
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,420
emotion. It's loving. God is
becoming awakened through love.

1017
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:44,500
I had always been attracted to
more the mental forms of

1018
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:50,080
spiritual practice of all the
various yogas in Hinduism. I was

1019
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,040
least attracted to bhakti, the
emotions, the cultivation of

1020
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:57,940
emotional relationship with the
divine, and yet I found in the

1021
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:04,500
psychedelic work of. Well,
Bhakti was activated. Bhakti was

1022
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,180
very powerfully activated, so
that I had not only a mental

1023
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:14,820
relationship with the universe
and a cognitive experience of

1024
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:17,460
the universe, but an
overwhelmingly powerful

1025
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:20,900
emotional connection to the
universe and experience of the

1026
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:24,920
universe so that it just it
became a love relationship. And

1027
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,740
that's why, for me, I mean,
everybody has to develop their

1028
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:33,080
own vocabulary for the ultimate
reality, but my vocabulary for

1029
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:38,660
ultimate reality, I call the
absolute My beloved, the

1030
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:42,340
beloved, just because it that's
the bhakti quality

1031
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,120
Jef Baker: touches my heart.
Yeah, I've noticed that with

1032
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:50,800
with five Meo, when, when
everything is stripped away, and

1033
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:57,580
there is that zero point
singularity, that everything is

1034
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:02,040
fused into one point, the only
thing left is love. Yeah, the

1035
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:07,560
only thing that can exist, or
the only thing left to exist, is

1036
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:12,060
this universal love. And it's,
it's quite interesting. I mean,

1037
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,060
I guess from a neuro
reductionist perspective, you

1038
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,580
can say that's because your
serotonin receptors have been

1039
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:23,540
completely flooded. Yeah, it's
love.

1040
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,060
Chris Bache: Love is the quality
of the the experiential quality

1041
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:34,820
of oneness. Oneness and love are
two different sides of the same

1042
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:39,800
coin, because when you dissolve
into oneness, then instantly,

1043
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,440
love is the experience that the
universe has for itself. There

1044
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,820
is no division in oneness. So
oneness is all embracing. So we

1045
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:52,840
might experience this as
compassion or love, but the

1046
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,700
logic of love is the logic of
oneness. Everything short of

1047
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,740
oneness is fragmented.

1048
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:03,419
Jef Baker: Okay, so would you
agree with this perspective that

1049
01:17:03,539 --> 01:17:07,559
I see a lot in the psychedelic
community, that the universe

1050
01:17:07,559 --> 01:17:13,079
creates separation in order to
experience itself, in order to

1051
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:18,599
experience the you know, the joy
and the pain, because one cannot

1052
01:17:18,779 --> 01:17:23,599
experience itself alone. Do
Yeah,

1053
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,140
Chris Bache: it's, you know,
that it really presses the

1054
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:30,920
question. I mean, when we're
asking the question, why

1055
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,900
existence? Why is there anything
went when there was the primal

1056
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:40,780
void, when, let's say, to use
God language, when the divine

1057
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,020
was whole and complete in
perfect equanimity within

1058
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:49,480
itself, why did it manifest the
universe? Knowing what would be

1059
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:53,020
involved, knowing all the pain
and suffering that was involved.

1060
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:59,680
What was that about? And one of
the proposals is, well, this is

1061
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,840
a way of the Divine knowing
itself. This is a way of

1062
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,620
learning itself. Personally,
I've always I've never found

1063
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:11,640
that very persuasive. I mean, I
understand it, and I think this

1064
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:18,540
is a truth to it, but to me, to
make creation an exercise in

1065
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:25,040
self knowledge, I think this
that never, had never, was very

1066
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:32,300
satisfying to me. Another aspect
of it, I think, is that creation

1067
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:37,460
is a way for the divine to share
its being. So all of us, from my

1068
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:41,200
cosmology, all of us are sparks
of light that emerge out of the

1069
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:45,100
primal light. So all of us are
aspects of the Divine, little

1070
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:49,660
bitty pieces broken off out of
the primal one. And those little

1071
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:53,560
bitty pieces grow and grow and
grow and grow. And as they grow

1072
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,500
and grow, they're actualizing
their innate potential. They're

1073
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:01,740
actualizing their divinity. And
in the end, it is as if you have

1074
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:06,900
a one light, which is growing
millions and billions of light

1075
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:12,660
out of its own one light. So
it's sharing of its being, a

1076
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:16,320
cascading of the sharing of its
being, which I'm sure is an

1077
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:20,820
inadequate model by itself, but
I've asked the universe

1078
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:26,900
Jef Baker: simile and in the
form of the universe, being this

1079
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:31,880
diamond with infinite facets
each face, yeah, being an

1080
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,140
individual human, you know,
showing a piece of light that is

1081
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:40,840
part of The whole, yeah, yeah.

1082
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,960
Chris Bache: And we always, of
course, always have to remind

1083
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:49,000
ourselves that what has emerged
up to this point in time is just

1084
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,080
the tip of the iceberg. It's
just getting started. So we have

1085
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,520
to kind of imagine ourselves a
million years from now, which is

1086
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,500
nothing in evolutionary time but
a million. Years from now, what

1087
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,280
we might be envisioning the
answer to this question to be,

1088
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:11,940
what is the purpose of creation?
Why is why is this happening? A

1089
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:15,120
million years from now, we're
going to understand it and have

1090
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,420
a much deeper answer to that
question, and a million years

1091
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,840
after that, we're going to have
a deeper answer to that

1092
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:29,240
question. So I just there's a
certain way in which I caution

1093
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:33,860
closure on these questions. I'd
rather be agnostic, somewhat

1094
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,960
open ended. I do think it has to
do with self knowledge, self

1095
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:44,140
expression. I think it has to do
with sharing nature open up

1096
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:49,240
opportunities for life to breed
life, life to grow life.

1097
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,060
Jef Baker: We're seeing so much,
particularly the moment. We've

1098
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:59,800
seen a lot of people fall into
the trap of certitude, of

1099
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:05,880
knowing that there's some grand
design behind it all, whether it

1100
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:09,000
be, you know, hidden, sinister
cabals, but in this time of

1101
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,220
uncertainty, people seem to be
really struggling with with

1102
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:18,300
that, and looking for answers
that that resolve some kind of,

1103
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:21,080
you know, provide some kind of
strategy,

1104
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:28,100
Chris Bache: good luck. Yeah,
exactly when we dissolve into

1105
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:31,640
the universe, when we just die
and die and die and dissolve

1106
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:37,100
into the universe, we tap into
this. So many of us tap into

1107
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:42,880
this condition where we
experience the intendedness of

1108
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:48,520
it. We experience the
meaningfulness of existence, and

1109
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,940
we walk away, come away with it,
saying, there is a plan, there

1110
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:56,260
is a purpose, there is a project
here. But then when we try to

1111
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:00,960
describe exactly what is the
plan, what is the purpose, I

1112
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,820
think we very quickly reach the
limits and and it's the limits

1113
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:09,300
are simply the limits that are
built into our evolutionary

1114
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:14,880
condition of this moment, for
this species, in this planet, in

1115
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,860
this evolutionary period. Mean
we literally, I don't think we

1116
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:24,800
have a brain big enough to begin
to comprehend mystery scale,

1117
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:29,360
yeah. So a certain we can feel
it, we can affirm it, we can

1118
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,480
assert it. But closure is

1119
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,760
Jef Baker: it steps to our
fingers, our nation, our sort of

1120
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:45,280
drive to to find the answers and
pin them down. Yeah, it's, it's,

1121
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,980
you know, rather futile. Perhaps
that is what gets us into so

1122
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:48,520
much trouble.

1123
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,880
Chris Bache: Yeah, certainly one
of the things

1124
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,880
Jef Baker: you mentioned in dark
night, early dawn, Homo

1125
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:04,500
noeticus, yeah, and, and the
widespread use of antigens, as

1126
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,740
you know, a condition for the
evolution of humanity.

1127
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:14,520
Chris Bache: Well, the concept
of Homo noeticus is simply a way

1128
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:19,080
of putting language and and if
different people have different

1129
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:23,840
ways of languaging homo
spiritualist, the future human,

1130
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:28,340
the diamond soul. This is just
different ways of articulating

1131
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,860
what I think is a very, very
widespread collective intuition,

1132
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:38,900
perception, and that is that
that humanity is growing into

1133
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:42,820
something new, that there is an
evolutionary development. So we

1134
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:48,280
go from Homo habilis to homo
whatnot, Homo sapiens, and

1135
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:52,420
there's something after what we
are now. There's something

1136
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:56,860
coming, and we generate
different words for it, but the

1137
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:00,780
and certainly this is so strong
in psychedelic experience that

1138
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:04,500
we are an unfinished species,
that we are developmental

1139
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,880
species, and we're not just
getting we're not just getting

1140
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,980
smarter or more compassionate in
incremental ways. I think there

1141
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:18,420
are major turning points where,
like, the rules change. When we

1142
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,520
go through these thresholds,
we're coming into a bifurcation

1143
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:26,060
point in history. We either make
it across this threshold or we

1144
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,440
probably go extinct. I
personally believe that we will

1145
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:34,400
make it across this threshold.
We will make this jump. And when

1146
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,760
we make this jump however long
it takes us, 1000s of years,

1147
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:41,680
hundreds, whatever, however long
it takes us, that's not going to

1148
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,920
be the end point. That's just
going to be the new platform,

1149
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:48,580
and we will eventually reach the
end of that platform, and we're

1150
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:52,360
going to make a jump into yet
another because that's the scale

1151
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,820
of what we're engaged in, of
what we're involved in.

1152
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:59,320
Jef Baker: So how do you how do
you see psychedelics as a

1153
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:03,360
catalyst? In this moment,
obviously, there's a huge push

1154
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:08,220
for them to be used only within
the medicalized model as

1155
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:12,000
therapeutic tools for trauma.
And then there's, you know, the

1156
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,540
proposal of modern day Mystery
Schools, which I personally

1157
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:25,160
think is greatly under, under
focused, yeah, where do you see

1158
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,880
psychedelics playing a role in
this evolution?

1159
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:35,960
Chris Bache: Well, I understand
the in the psychedelic

1160
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,220
community, the very strong
emphasis on demonstrating the

1161
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:44,020
therapeutic effectiveness of
psychedelics. I think it's

1162
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:47,680
really important that we that we
not blow this opportunity we

1163
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:51,940
have. We kind of blew it in the
60s, you know, it blew up in our

1164
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:55,660
faces. We lost the right to use
these things. We had to go

1165
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:59,200
underground to use them. And
it's really important that we

1166
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,460
have this new opportunity, that
we document things, that we

1167
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:06,000
demonstrate their effectiveness.
And right now, their

1168
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,100
effectiveness is being
demonstrated in their

1169
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,420
therapeutic potential. But if we
do this, if we keep going, it's

1170
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:17,160
only going to be a matter of
time before mainstream thinkers

1171
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:22,040
begin to understand that the why
is it that psychedelics are so

1172
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:25,880
therapeutically effective?
Because they open up a communion

1173
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:30,860
with the deeper, with the deeper
dimensions of mind, and in the

1174
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:35,120
early stages, this encounter
with the deeper dimensions of

1175
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,660
our own, of our consciousness,
unconsciousness, is very

1176
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:41,800
cleansing. It's very healing.
It's very therapeutically

1177
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:45,580
efficacious. Can be
demonstrated, but if we but

1178
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:48,820
that's just the tip of the
iceberg. We go deeper. We go

1179
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,760
deeper. We go deeper. It opens
up our relationship to each

1180
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,160
other. It opens up our
relationship to the to the

1181
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:57,880
planet, other life forms. It
opens up our relationship to

1182
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:02,520
spiritual reality. Personally, I
was trained as a philosopher of

1183
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:05,940
religion. It's always been the
philosophical import of

1184
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:08,520
psychedelics which has
interested me. I'm not a

1185
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,480
clinician, I'm not a therapist.
I've always interested in the

1186
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,920
philosophical or cosmological
opportunities, and I think in

1187
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:22,460
that perspective, we're coming
to a critical moment in history.

1188
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:27,680
And it's not enough just to heal
us at this moment in history. We

1189
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:31,040
have to heal not simply the
personal unconscious, though

1190
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,040
that's important, it's very
important. But we have to heal

1191
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,180
the soul. We have to heal the
fundamental human condition we

1192
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:42,640
have, and that means recovering
an understanding of what we are,

1193
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:47,500
who we are, where we are, what
existence is about. And I think

1194
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:53,440
psychedelics are coming at a,
you know, the rediscovery of

1195
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,960
psychedelics in Western
industrial cultures, because

1196
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:00,180
indigenous cultures have had
them, you know, long time. But

1197
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:04,020
in this culture where we have
lost contact with the deeper

1198
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:07,200
levels of our own psyche, we've
lost contact with the

1199
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,560
consciousness of the earth.
We've lost contact with the

1200
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:15,960
consciousness of the creator of
galaxies. Psychedelics have this

1201
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,800
opportunity to awaken us quickly
jar us into an awareness of this

1202
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,000
deeper dimension at exactly the
time when we need it, because we

1203
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,360
can't get through this period of
history with the limited

1204
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,540
understanding of ourselves that
have grown out of 19th century

1205
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:36,140
science, this materialist,
mechanistic, reductionistic

1206
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:42,040
understanding, which is just an
absolutely devastating worldview

1207
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:46,480
to try to live in. You know that
you that existence comes into

1208
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:50,500
exist. We come into existence by
accident. It's all random. It

1209
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,080
has There's no meaning to it.
There's no meaning to our

1210
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:56,860
individual challenges. There's
no meaning to history. That is

1211
01:28:56,860 --> 01:29:01,440
an absolutely devastating
worldview, and it leads to the

1212
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,860
kind of planet that we've
developed now where we just

1213
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:08,100
basically try to eat it all
alive and get as many

1214
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:11,520
experiences and as much of
experience as we can possibly,

1215
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:15,780
because when we die, it's all
over, and it was all an exercise

1216
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:20,220
in futility anyway. Well,
psychedelics and help us

1217
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:24,620
understand that that's not true.
It's a very different agenda.

1218
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:28,399
Jef Baker: It's almost like they
are the perfect tools for the

1219
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:32,479
human condition at this point in
time. They really are. And yeah,

1220
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:37,219
it feels like you know, there is
a grander scheme playing out

1221
01:29:37,879 --> 01:29:41,259
with the Renaissance. How do you
think we get psychedelics? Or

1222
01:29:41,259 --> 01:29:43,599
what do you think is a good,
pragmatic way to get

1223
01:29:43,599 --> 01:29:45,939
psychedelics and field of
philosophy more

1224
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:50,740
Chris Bache: Well, I think the
therapist have to do their work.

1225
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,920
You know, they have that. That's
what's really going to open the

1226
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,340
door. They have to do their
work. They have to study the

1227
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:00,660
physiology of psychedelics. They
have to de. Demonstrate the

1228
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:04,080
therapeutic efficacy of
psychedelics, but the Mystery

1229
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,280
School aspect, the philosophical
aspect that's there,

1230
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:21,800
I think that the key to opening
to this deeper dimension in

1231
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,800
mainstream society. If you're
working at the fringes of

1232
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,340
society, the edges of society,
we're already open to the

1233
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,820
mystery school use of
psychedelics, but for mainstream

1234
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:38,180
culture to begin to open to this
dimension of psychedelic work, I

1235
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:41,920
think the therapists have to
lead the way into it. Once we

1236
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,580
see that that's being
demonstrated, then I think

1237
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:50,860
society will be more open to the
more exotic qualities of

1238
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:54,340
psychedelics. But we have a lot
of maturing to do there. We have

1239
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:57,100
so many psychedelics which
unleash so many different

1240
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:01,380
experiences. It's an
overwhelmingly complex maze. If

1241
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:07,020
you go from five Meo to salvia
divinorum to Psilocybin in Iowa,

1242
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:12,000
so many different experiences,
it takes a huge expansion of our

1243
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:17,040
cosmology to understand even to
begin to understand how all of

1244
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:23,540
these experiences can co exist
within a meaningful framework of

1245
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:28,880
a deeper understanding of
existence. Even just to begin

1246
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,900
that understanding, we have to
be highly motivated. And I think

1247
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,980
the therapists are the ones that
are opening that door for us.

1248
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,300
Jef Baker: I think a good way to
understand it is that these are,

1249
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:45,040
these are plants that have, for
whatever reason, Evolved Human

1250
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:49,240
neurotransmitters. And the
plants being much older than us

1251
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:53,320
and the evolutionary scale of
things are almost trying to

1252
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:55,600
teach us,

1253
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,440
Unknown: yeah, a

1254
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:04,860
Jef Baker: simpler way of being
one of a better description, but

1255
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:11,520
to to look back throughout, you
know, historical lineage, and to

1256
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,440
perhaps examine where we went
wrong,

1257
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:19,200
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah, where
we went wrong again, we don't

1258
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,120
blame a first grader for being
first, being six years old, you

1259
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,600
know, it's just like, you know,
they didn't do anything wrong.

1260
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:30,380
They're just six years old, you
know. And humanity, you know,

1261
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:33,200
we've made mistakes. We've done
dumb ass things. We've done this

1262
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:37,400
and that the other terrible
things. But in a larger sense,

1263
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:43,480
we're just young, inexperienced,
not understanding, and because

1264
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:47,440
we didn't all understand, we
make mistakes. You know, in

1265
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:52,360
Eastern traditions, they say the
core problem, the core problem

1266
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,020
is not that we're evil, the core
problem is that we're ignorant.

1267
01:32:56,140 --> 01:33:00,480
We literally don't know, and
because we don't know, we make

1268
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,080
bad choices. And because we make
bad choices, those have bad

1269
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:07,440
consequences. But the more we
understand and

1270
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:12,060
Jef Baker: they sell, we can
make them too. Yeah, I like the

1271
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:18,180
analogy to get you. I like the
analogy of people don't judge a

1272
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:21,500
tree because it grew a little
bit this way because it didn't

1273
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:26,660
get enough light from the other
side. It just is. It's just, you

1274
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:31,220
know, we accept it much more
easily than we do with people,

1275
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:31,520
yeah,

1276
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:37,760
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah,
exciting times we live in. I

1277
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,080
want to ask, I know we're coming
sort of towards the end of the

1278
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:46,600
discussion. So I want to mention
something at the end. The last

1279
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:52,480
chapter of my book is called
coming off the mountain, and I

1280
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:57,160
basically discuss what happened
when I stopped my sessions in

1281
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,660
the years after I stopped the
sessions. And I just want to

1282
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:05,400
mention that, because I think
we're it's getting easier and

1283
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:09,900
easier with the substances that
are available to us to break

1284
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:13,080
through consciousness, to break
into intimacy with the universe,

1285
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:20,540
to break into Transcendence, you
know, to access information. My

1286
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:25,280
experience was when I stopped my
sessions in the years that

1287
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:30,200
followed, I thought that since I
had been given so many gifts,

1288
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:34,520
and since I had been had so many
mystical experiences, and so

1289
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:40,360
many experiences of intimacy
with the being of existence and

1290
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:45,460
dissolving into, you know, the
primordial light of existence. I

1291
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:48,340
thought that would be easy to
stop my sessions and just step

1292
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:51,820
away and I would be able to be
nourished by those experiences.

1293
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:58,840
And what I found was that in the
end, there was such a deep

1294
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:04,620
existential. Longing to return
to those dimensions of

1295
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:09,540
existence, and I knew that I had
to stop for reasons I explained

1296
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:12,780
in the book I had to stop this
work. I came to a point where it

1297
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:18,000
just I knew I needed to stop and
slow things down, and I knew

1298
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,820
when I stopped that I would
never go back into such intimacy

1299
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:27,080
with the divine during my
lifetime. It would only happen

1300
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:32,000
with death that I would return
to such depth of place, and I

1301
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,880
found myself slowly entering a
condition where I was just

1302
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,800
waiting to die. I was, you know,
taking care of my children,

1303
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:45,460
teaching my classes, doing the
things that I do. But in my

1304
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:48,700
heart of hearts, I was just
waiting for this life to be

1305
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:53,740
over, so that I could return to
the full intimacy of the Divine.

1306
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:57,820
And in time, I began to realize
this, this is not right. This is

1307
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:01,500
not the way this work is
supposed to end. And I had been

1308
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:05,760
so careful to integrate every
session, to integrate all of my

1309
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,420
work as I went, and not get
ahead of myself, that I It

1310
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:14,040
wasn't clear to me what, where I
had gone wrong. My life was

1311
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:18,960
screaming failure to integrate,
but it wasn't clear how I where

1312
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,500
I had failed to integrate,
because I had paid so much

1313
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,680
attention to integration, and I
learned that integrating a

1314
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:28,400
session is different than
integrating an entire journey.

1315
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:33,320
And my journey had taken me so
deeply into Transcendence that I

1316
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:37,640
sort of lost my footing in the
world of imminence. It's all the

1317
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:41,380
divine. The physical world is
the divine. But I had entered so

1318
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:50,080
deeply into the transcendent
divine that I had become I was I

1319
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,860
lost my footing inside the
immanent divine, and it took

1320
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:59,560
years. It took me about 10 years
to get really grounded back in

1321
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:03,600
space, time reality, so that I
could live the remainder of my

1322
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:08,940
years within the joy of space
time reality. And I mentioned

1323
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:13,560
this because I think many
people, as we have more

1324
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:19,200
experience of Transcendence, we
naturally want to go there or

1325
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,580
let there come in here more
completely, I think it's really

1326
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:26,240
important to address the issue
of integration. While we are

1327
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:29,300
going into these states to
integrate, integrate, integrate.

1328
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,360
And integrating a journey is
different than integrating

1329
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:36,800
individual sessions. It's a
really delicate process. And so

1330
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,620
I mentioned my own mistakes in
order to encourage other people

1331
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,780
not to make those mistakes,
right?

1332
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,820
Jef Baker: And thank you for
mentioning that. That's that's

1333
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:49,180
quite pertinent. After this goes
to air, the Australian

1334
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:54,520
psychedelic society is running a
large integration workshop. And

1335
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:57,520
as saying before, with people
having difficulty integrating,

1336
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,140
say, such a peak experience like
five Meo, that embodiment, that

1337
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:06,840
eminence, that experience of the
divine in everyday life and the

1338
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:12,480
small things and being in
nature, you know, eating clean

1339
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,920
and just looking after the
presence rather than constantly

1340
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:21,200
seeking these transcendent
experiences. Yeah, that's a

1341
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:25,160
beautifully pertinent way to
perhaps around the interview.

1342
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:28,700
Off there's a couple of quotes
that really jumped out at me

1343
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:33,200
from the book. And I think one
that fits quite well here too,

1344
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,940
is you said, it's all too easy
to think that because we have

1345
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:44,140
had a deep and profound
experience, we have become deep

1346
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:48,520
and profound ourselves. This is
a false delusion, I think I may

1347
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,740
never Yeah, describe that right?

1348
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:55,840
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah. The
greatest danger, I think, of

1349
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,800
working with psychedelics is
psychic inflation, and we can,

1350
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:06,960
we can overvalue the temporary
experiences and undervalue and

1351
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:12,240
undervalue the stable platforms
of our day to day consciousness.

1352
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:16,320
It's in Maslow's terms, we can
overestimate the value of our

1353
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:20,040
peak experiences and
underestimate the value of

1354
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:24,860
plateau experiences, so we can
have a very, very profound

1355
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:29,720
spiritual experience on Saturday
and still be an asshole on

1356
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,260
Monday.

1357
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:35,780
Jef Baker: Yeah, it's certainly
visible within, you know, some

1358
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:40,360
aspects of this community,
certainly. But yeah, we're all

1359
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:45,340
growing and we're learning,
yeah, yeah, if you're, if you're

1360
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:49,480
happy to leave it there. Chris,
thank you so very, very much. On

1361
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:52,840
behalf of the Australian society
and everyone that's viewing

1362
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,520
this, thank you for your time.

1363
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,740
Chris Bache: Pleasure to have
the Congress. Thank you. Good to

1364
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,120
have this conversation.

1365
01:39:58,539 --> 01:40:02,399
Jef Baker: Yeah, I recommend
everyone. Do you read? Read your

1366
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:03,179
latest book,

1367
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,060
Unknown: and you very much. Let
us

1368
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:09,180
Jef Baker: know where, where
readers can people get hold of

1369
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:10,800
the book?

1370
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:14,880
Chris Bache: Well, I've just
been told that Amazon isn't

1371
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:20,100
delivering to Australia now, so
probably the easiest way is

1372
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:23,420
through digital forms. Amazon
will, you know, deliver digital

1373
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:28,880
forms. I I'm very late in
getting my website up. I don't

1374
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:33,500
it isn't finished yet, so it'll,
it'll be there within a couple

1375
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:38,840
of months. I hope so. Easiest
way to get it is through inner

1376
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:42,880
traditions, or through Amazon or
other booksellers and get it

1377
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,020
digitally if it's not being
mailed in a hard copy. Great.

1378
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:53,139
Jef Baker: Thank you for that.
And stay safe. And these strange

1379
01:40:53,139 --> 01:40:54,999
and interesting times,

1380
01:40:55,959 --> 01:40:59,259
Chris Bache: they say, Thank you
for your work. One day, I hope

1381
01:40:59,259 --> 01:41:04,199
maybe I'll be able to get to
Australia and person, yeah, and

1382
01:41:04,799 --> 01:41:09,179
look forward to having
conversations with your larger

1383
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:11,099
psychedelic society. Be a
pleasure.

1384
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:14,219
Jef Baker: Absolutely, yeah. And
we'd love to have you speak it.

1385
01:41:14,879 --> 01:41:19,499
You know, when the larger
conferences here, if you're so

1386
01:41:19,499 --> 01:41:20,959
inclined and believe you come

1387
01:41:20,959 --> 01:41:25,339
Chris Bache: out. Be great. Be
great. Thank you, Chris, all the

1388
01:41:25,339 --> 01:41:26,059
best. Yeah.

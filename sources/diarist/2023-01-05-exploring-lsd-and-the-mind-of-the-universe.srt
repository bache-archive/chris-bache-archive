1
00:00:00,096 --> 00:00:03,156
Chris Bache: And all of a
sudden, my visual field pivoted

2
00:00:03,156 --> 00:00:07,176
90 degrees, and I saw reality
Far, Far in the distance. Again.

3
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:11,616
It looked kind of like galaxies.
And out of that reality, a beam

4
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:16,656
of light came and hit me, and it
absolutely shattered me. It just

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:20,660
it was a more powerful light
than even the diamond Luminosity

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,920
that had become my ultimate
reality, 50 high dose sessions

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,260
in and just in that one second,
it completely changed my

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,720
understanding of reality.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,900
Luc Briede-Cooper: Thank you,
Chris, thank you for being

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,860
willing to hop on with me.

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,920
Chris Bache: Glad to be here
today. Luke, cool, everyone.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,460
Luc Briede-Cooper: This is
Christopher M Bache. He's a PhD

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,520
and professor emeritus in the
Department of Philosophy and

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,400
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University, where he

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,340
taught for 33 years an award
winning teacher and

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,400
international speaker. Chris's
work explores the philosophy

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,660
philosophical implications of
Non-ordinary states of

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,660
consciousness, especially
psychedelic states. And today,

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,620
we'll be primarily discussing
ideas related to his book, LSD

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,320
and the mind of the universe,
his story of 20 years of his

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,700
journey into the mind of the
universe through 73 high dose

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,940
sessions of LSD. Welcome Chris.

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,120
Chris Bache: Thank you, Luke,
it's good to be here with you.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,900
Awesome.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,640
Luc Briede-Cooper: So I thought
I'd figured I'd start by just

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,460
sort of tracing the path that a
lot of people may explore with

27
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,940
psychedelics, first being that
the first encounter people may

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,180
have, at least now today, is
they may encounter psychedelics

29
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,380
for biohacking or for
productivity, say, with like

30
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,960
micro dosing. And then once
they've experienced that, maybe

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,980
they'll discover the therapeutic
power of psychedelics. And then

32
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,380
in those therapeutic journeys,
maybe they'll discover that

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,620
psychedelics are powerful tools
for spiritual awakening. But

34
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,080
there's a level even deeper than
the level of spiritual

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,540
awakening, and it's the path
that that you took. Could you

36
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,620
tell us about that?

37
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:03,839
Chris Bache: Well, that path I
call cosmological exploration,

38
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,519
and it's a path which clearly
overlaps with the healing

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,599
capacity of psychedelics and the
spiritual awakening capacity,

40
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:19,019
but it's different. I think the
spiritual awakening basically

41
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:24,619
invites us to clean our
consciousness and clean our

42
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:29,899
system in a way that allows us
to abide more comfortably and

43
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:35,899
consistently in a transparent
condition, transparent to what

44
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:39,679
the Buddhists would call one's
essential nature, one's Buddha

45
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:43,779
nature, or other traditions
would call one's divine nature.

46
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:47,799
Cosmological exploration is
different than that. It really

47
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:53,379
is seeking to explore the deep
structure of consciousness and

48
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:57,039
the deep structure of the
universe, to basically

49
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,759
understand at a deeper
philosophical level, how reality

50
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,939
works. Why are things the way
they are? What are some of the

51
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,019
deep structures of cosmic
reality? Awesome?

52
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,999
Luc Briede-Cooper: And I'd love
to ask you more in a bit about

53
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,499
reality itself and those and
those layers. But could you tell

54
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:21,019
us a bit more just about what
the path, the sort of protocol

55
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,879
you followed, and what that path
looked like as he

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,660
Chris Bache: went along. Well, I
was just out of graduate school

57
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,120
back in ancient history in 1978
and I read Stan Grof first book,

58
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,540
realms of the human unconscious,
which had been published in 76

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,380
and immediately I recognized the
significance of Stan's work for

60
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,920
my discipline, which is
philosophy of religion. I'm not

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,040
a psychologist, not a therapist.
I've never been particularly

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,180
interested in the therapeutic
applications as Stan has, but

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm really have been interested
in its philosophical

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,940
applications. So recognizing
kind of a call I began my work,

65
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,960
which ended up lasting 20 years.
I did four years of very intense

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,580
work. I stopped for six years,
and then I followed that with 10

67
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,680
years of very intense work. I
chose to work with high doses of

68
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:24,200
LSD, and by high doses, I worked
at 500 to 600 micrograms. This

69
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,020
is a regimen that I don't
recommend today. I seriously

70
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,660
don't recommend, and if I were
doing it over again, I would do

71
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,280
it differently. I would be much
gentler use, lower doses and a

72
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,300
wider distribution, a wider
spectrum of psychedelics. But I

73
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,320
chose to work with high doses of
LSD for couple of reasons. One's

74
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,740
first LSD, that was the
substance that Stan had done

75
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,340
most of his research on, and I
trusted that research. And

76
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,660
again, this was 1978 so this is
pre Ayahuasca, pre, some of the

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,220
early. Uh, appreciation of
organic and shamanic tradition,

78
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,780
organic psychedelics used by
shamanic traditions. And I, I

79
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,400
worked with high doses because I
was still thinking within a

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,520
model of personal
transformation, our personal

81
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,760
spiritual awakening, and the
spiritual traditions basically

82
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,800
taught that our karma is finite.
And if I understood LSD

83
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,880
psychotherapy as a process of
cleaning up one's karma, so to

84
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,080
speak, you know, basically
unearthing problematic material

85
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,360
from one's personal unconscious
and clearing that material, I

86
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,600
thought by working with high
doses, I could basically clear

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,240
up my karma in a fewer number of
sessions, essentially taking a

88
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,080
bigger bite out of the apple in
every session. Turns out that

89
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,840
that assumption was completely
wrong, because the assumption

90
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,300
that that the human psyche, that
this process was primarily

91
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,380
focused on human transformation
was a mistake, a personal

92
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,280
transformation. The collective
dimensions of the psyche surface

93
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,020
in my work very quickly on after
just a couple of years, and the

94
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,860
broader ramifications of
entering into communion with the

95
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,240
universe at large presented
itself soon thereafter. So what

96
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,900
I basically did, I worked in
therapeutic protocol. Stan's

97
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,160
therapeutic protocol outlined in
his book LSD psychotherapy,

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,960
which means working in total
isolation with a sitter, lying

99
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,420
down, eye shades, headphones,
carefully curated playlist of

100
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,640
music, staying internalized all
day long, I would work in the

101
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,780
early morning through to
evening, staying internalized in

102
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,140
the session, and then making
detailed records of my

103
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,860
experiences the day after. So
that was the that was the

104
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,540
protocol.

105
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,940
Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it
awesome. And of course, reading

106
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,840
the book, I know a little bit
about where that went in the

107
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,900
end, but I'm curious. So I know
in another interview, you

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,620
mentioned that you had since
partaken in Psilocybin and

109
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,080
Ayahuasca journeys, and at one
point in the book, you mentioned

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,220
that one of the advantages of
LSD being sort of a longer

111
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,860
acting substance around eight
hour journeys that it kind of

112
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,200
buffs the diamond more in that
time, so to speak. I know

113
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,580
there's other psychedelics that
are now entering the potential

114
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,140
use for people in society, and
Ibogaine is one substance that

115
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,840
has a very long active time
about like 24 to 48 hours. And

116
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,900
we could contrast that with like
five Meo DMT, which is an active

117
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,800
period of like 1520 minutes,
something like that, would

118
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,160
eyeball game potentially be a
better contender for that

119
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,120
reason, if not for cosmological
exploration, but for spiritual

120
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,780
awakening. And what might the
protocol look like if you were

121
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,760
to use something like five mu
DMT?

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,260
Chris Bache: Well, first of all,
I've never used Ibogaine, and so

123
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm not really qualified to
speak to that in terms of

124
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,220
comparing its function or values
just looking at the window

125
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,240
issue. There are other issues
with psychedelics. Every

126
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,980
psychedelic has a mind
amplifying quality, but the

127
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,420
texture, or the nuance, the way
it opens consciousness, the

128
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,620
spectrum of consciousness that
it opens us into varies from

129
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,760
psychedelic to psychedelic. But
just looking at the window, the

130
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,440
reason I think the window is
significant, and this is

131
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,240
basically reflecting on people's
experiences with DMT initially,

132
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,440
which is a relatively short
acting psychedelic. And Rick

133
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,360
Strassman, in his book DMT, the
spirit molecule, basically found

134
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,280
that his his clients were not
really changed very deeply by

135
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:06,240
very having very significant DMT
experiences. And in looking at

136
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,340
his experiences in his data,
comparing it to my data, I think

137
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,960
what happens is, you know, in
order to explore the universe,

138
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,920
you're you're going, you're
using your small mind to explore

139
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,700
big mind, you're using your
individual, personal

140
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,800
consciousness to explore this
vast field of consciousness. And

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,940
when you have a long window, it
gives more time for the large

142
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,380
field to interact with the small
field and do the cleansing and

143
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,220
purification that's needed in
order to have deep experiences

144
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,500
of this cosmic reality. If you
have only a very short acting

145
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,760
psychedelic, you don't have much
time for the large consciousness

146
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,800
to impact and be absorbed by the
smaller consciousness, which

147
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,760
means it has less of an of an
activating effect, less of a

148
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,320
transformative effect. You.
There are other variables, of

149
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,260
course, in the
psychopharmacology of

150
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,640
psychedelics, but just the
window is, I think, an

151
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,660
interesting variation. The short
acting psychedelics have been

152
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,120
like five Meo are. It's a
remarkable psychedelic. It gives

153
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,940
us quick access if you use it in
high doses to very deep cosmic

154
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:30,140
realities, but our time there is
short. Again, I don't have a lot

155
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,740
of experience with five Meo, and
I certainly don't work with it

156
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,380
clinically with other people.
I've talked with a number of

157
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,480
therapists who work with five
Meo at different levels of

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,320
intensity for working with
clients. I know it has

159
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,200
remarkable transformative value,
but I not really too comfortably

160
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,100
comparing its transformative
potential with the

161
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,960
transformative potential of LSD,
other than to make this simple

162
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,700
relation between a time window
and opportunity for

163
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,840
transformation.

164
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,540
Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it
awesome. Thank you. Yeah, and

165
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,820
one of the things that stood out
about the book was how very, not

166
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,700
exaggerative. You know what I
mean? Like, it isn't you don't

167
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,260
necessarily go too far from the
experience itself, and maybe

168
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,040
that's your inclination as a
philosopher and academic, but I

169
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,940
really appreciate that.

170
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:28,999
Chris Bache: So I tried to just
truly, it's a huge challenge, of

171
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:33,919
course, to try to document or to
present 20 years of such

172
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,899
dramatic experiences. So the
choice I made was really try to

173
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,819
keep close to the phenomenology,
keep close to the experiences,

174
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:47,439
because the experiences were, to
me, much more valuable than

175
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:50,979
anything I would say about them,
any interpretation I might

176
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,799
offer, just the raw experiences
themselves.

177
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,420
Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it so I
got a question. Now you don't

178
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,720
recommend that people do what
you did. And reading the book,

179
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,940
initially, I was feeling
inspired. I was seeing your

180
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,520
courage. I thought, wow, this is
amazing. Maybe this is something

181
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,140
I could explore by the end. That
sort of shifted. But overall,

182
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,400
psychedelic, psychedelic use for
spiritual awakening is basically

183
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,160
inevitable at this point, at
least for many people in

184
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,260
society. So for someone who
might use psychedelics for

185
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,320
spiritual awakening and not
necessarily cosmological

186
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,400
exploration, what might you
recommend as a protocol or

187
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,100
structure for people who want to
do like a slower psychedelic

188
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,160
path, and how might that
integrate with the slow burn

189
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,880
traditions?

190
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,640
Chris Bache: Well, I'll make a
suggestion. But again, I want to

191
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,240
emphasize that I'm not a
clinician. I don't work I don't

192
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,840
have a history of working with
other people. I basically have

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,220
made a self conscious choice not
to work with other people, but

194
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,760
to be simply a solitary
explorer, pushing my system

195
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,100
hard, making basically a map of
the dimensions that I entered

196
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,580
into, but I don't that doesn't
give me a lot of experience

197
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,880
working with other people to
answer your question. But

198
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,880
basically, as I've read the
literature and process my own

199
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,320
experience for spiritual
awakening, I would recommend

200
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,180
very low doses. Basically,
spiritual awakening is about

201
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,680
dissolving the glue that holds
the ego in place, dissolving the

202
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,980
structures that keep us fixed in
these repetitive patterns of

203
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:37,400
thoughts and emotions. And so
you've got to kind of ferret out

204
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,680
the ego where it lives in the
world. And I think this is done

205
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,680
well with low doses of LSD, low
doses of LSD combined with

206
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,560
sustained meditative practice,
once in a while, doing more in

207
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,480
order to challenge the
boundaries of consciousness. But

208
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,100
basically, if the goal is
spiritual awakening, I think low

209
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,520
doses of a psychedelic would be
the way to go.

210
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,240
Luc Briede-Cooper: Cool,
awesome, awesome. Thank you for

211
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,460
that. Something that was
interesting that I think some

212
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,280
people do get a sense of from
their own journeys, whether or

213
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,640
not they've had just a few over
time, is there, there seems to

214
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,620
be a kind of effect of having
just the right amount of

215
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,740
experience as they needed at the
time. In that journey, you

216
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,320
experienced something similar in
in your journeys, in your book,

217
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,840
could you tell us about like
that sense of guidance?

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,720
Chris Bache: Well, in all of my
work, I always felt myself

219
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:49,000
engaging and being engaged by a
larger consciousness. This

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,560
consciousness did not take
concrete form. It never took

221
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,500
personified form. It never took
concretized form and it changed

222
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,880
or the core. Qualities of this
consciousness change the deeper

223
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,440
I went, so that I began to
understand the way I think of it

224
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,700
is the consciousness that we
enter into communion with in

225
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,840
psychedelic states, is an
infinite consciousness that's

226
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,360
capable of generating any number
of different types of

227
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,620
experiences, or types of
awareness within us and our mind

228
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,240
acts as a seed catalyst, a seed
crystal that catalyzes a certain

229
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,300
set of experiences from this
infinite consciousness.

230
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,600
If you do this repetitively over
repeatedly, the experiences that

231
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
you have and you integrate,
internalize and go through the

232
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,100
various purification processes,
it changes your consciousness,

233
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,040
and therefore the consciousness
that you take into the next

234
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,640
encounter is a different
consciousness that catalyzes a

235
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,620
deeper set of experiences from
the infinite potential of

236
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,500
consciousness. And that means
that the what you experience as

237
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,580
this guiding intelligence, the
this massive intelligence that

238
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:19,260
you meet at different levels is,
in a way, a consciousness that

239
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,420
arises at the intersection
between your individual mind and

240
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,040
this universal mind, and as you
change, the intersection changes

241
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,980
so that, from my experience, the
consciousness, which I felt was

242
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,860
always guiding my sessions, was
always invisible To me, but was

243
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,740
always felt it didn't adopt
concrete form, or very seldom

244
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,880
adopt concrete form, because the
form would change as the

245
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,120
experiences deepens. So you know
that formless quality is, I

246
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,960
think, something innate to do
with the consciousness itself,

247
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,980
and then in going beyond the
collective level of

248
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,760
consciousness, between beyond
the collective psyche and even

249
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,500
beyond human history. When
you're pushing so deep, you're

250
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,060
going beyond Jung's category of
archetypal consciousness, you're

251
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:23,360
letting you're going beyond
human history altogether, all of

252
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,280
the interpretive frameworks, all
the images, all the concepts

253
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,060
that we associate with our
religious and spiritual history,

254
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,000
they just fall away. Basically,
if several 1000 years or five or

255
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,340
10,000 years of religious
history just fall away and

256
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,780
you're moving into states of
consciousness that go beyond any

257
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,840
category of gods or deities or
angelic beings, you're in a

258
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:00,180
completely different world. So
yes, always guidance, always an

259
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,380
intelligence engaging me, but
formless.

260
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,660
Luc Briede-Cooper: Yeah, yeah,
amazing, amazing. I have yet to

261
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,720
get to that level in my
particular journeys, but perhaps

262
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,640
some day. And I'd like to ask
more specifically about sort of

263
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,500
the forms that can appear,
partly because I know from

264
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,480
YouTube, a lot of people are
searching that I can see the

265
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,480
analytics that entity encounters
is a very popular and

266
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,260
interesting point of
conversation. And you mentioned

267
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,000
you explored a little bit more
in the book, and you speak about

268
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,320
how devotion is related to these
entities. But let me ask this,

269
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,780
like a guy I was speaking to an
integration circle in Victoria

270
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,620
here not too long ago, he
mentioned he had a mystical

271
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,800
experience where he encountered
none other than Ganesh, the

272
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,360
elephant god of Hinduism. And
when people have these

273
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,020
encounters, they may ask a
question that you asked in your

274
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,800
journeys, which was, you know,
what is the meaning of what I

275
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,200
experienced? So, for after your
journeys, how would you reflect

276
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,840
on sort of the meaning of
encountering, say, a particular

277
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,200
form of a deity or or something
like that?

278
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,760
Chris Bache: First of all, let
me qualify. I don't consider my

279
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,200
experiences normative, you know,
in any generalizable way, you

280
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,220
know there are so many different
medicines, so many different

281
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,040
ways of using those medicines,
and so many different

282
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,760
personalities that are using the
medicines to engage this

283
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,840
infinite depth of consciousness
that it would be foolish to

284
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,240
think that any one person, their
experience would be a map or

285
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,840
chart for other people's
experiences. So I just I begin

286
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,440
my position is to be very
interested in other people's

287
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,060
experiences in a very non
judgmental and supportive way.

288
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,060
So whatever I say here, please
take it in that context. Uh,

289
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,580
when we experience realities
that are beyond us or

290
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,700
consciousness dimensions of
consciousness that are beyond

291
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,980
our own, and when we're tapping
into those qualities that are

292
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,560
like infinite compassion and
infinite intelligence and

293
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,600
infinite creativity, these are
qualities that we tend to

294
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,560
associate historically with
various deities, and it's not

295
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,720
surprising that our mind would
put together the qualities of

296
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,800
the phenomenology of the
experience with the qualities of

297
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,080
the deities which we may or May
may have had experience exposure

298
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,660
to intellectually and sometimes
we counter deities that we

299
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,140
haven't they're not part of our
own personal lineage and may not

300
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,480
have been part of our they may
not have been something even

301
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,140
that we knew about. It comes
completely out of left field,

302
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,980
and yet it bears the form of a
culture's form of this deity

303
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,960
like Ganesh or Jesus or Mary or
the Prophet Muhammad or

304
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,220
something like that. So my
understanding of it is that when

305
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,160
you are working or when you are
engaging, entities or forms that

306
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,360
have this quality of an entity
that is identifiable in our

307
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:33,500
historical traditions, my sense
is that we are engaging a

308
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,480
collective thought form, or a
spiritual being that is wearing

309
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,980
the clothes of a collective
thought form. And by collective

310
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,380
thought form, I mean if you have
millions and millions of

311
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:53,860
devotees that meditate and pray
and offer devotions to a

312
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,980
particular deity, form which has
been identified in their

313
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,320
scripture, which is painted in
their culture, statuary is all

314
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,320
of this form. If you have
millions and millions and

315
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,880
millions of being over 1000s of
years, in devotional attachment

316
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,560
to these forms, or devotional
focus on these forms, I think it

317
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,480
creates a certain structure in
the collective psyche, a

318
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,000
collective thought form. And I
don't minimize those forms, I

319
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,780
think they're extraordinarily
powerful, including secular

320
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,500
thought forms like greed, power,
anger, those you know, very

321
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:37,220
powerful in our system. So when
we encounter the deity in a or a

322
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,240
deity in a particular form, we
are either encountering a

323
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,620
spiritual principle which is
beyond form, which is wearing

324
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,960
the form of this collective
garment, or we're experiencing

325
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,580
the collective garment straight
out in itself. Either way, the

326
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,440
collective psyche is implicated.
The collective psyche is part of

327
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,620
our experience, which is all
perfectly normal and perfectly

328
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:11,580
well and good. I think at the
same time, I would hold out that

329
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,860
it is possible to go beyond all
collective thought forms and to

330
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:22,760
go beyond human history in one's
experience, and when one does,

331
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:29,540
those forms tend to fade away. I
know there's a lot of discussion

332
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,420
of entities, because
particularly DMT and DMT

333
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,580
derivatives often expose people
to entities. And I'm not

334
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,660
suggesting that those entities
aren't real or the entities

335
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,640
don't exist, but to me,
personally, and again,

336
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,100
limitations, but personally,
those entities reflect different

337
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,260
levels of reality, that as you
go deeper those level that that

338
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,080
kind of granular quality of lots
of individual beings tends to

339
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,840
yield to levels of reality which
are less granular, fewer

340
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,980
individual beings, kind of
constituting the population of

341
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,900
those levels of reality and
opening up into vast tracks of

342
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,420
consciousness which are less
individual, less entity, like at

343
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,400
least it is, in my experience,

344
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,280
Luc Briede-Cooper: got it
awesome? Totally, yeah, that

345
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,580
definitely seems to resonate in
terms of it being sort of a

346
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,680
matter of levels, and after
seeing sort of where you go in

347
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,200
those levels, it makes a lot
more sense that at some point

348
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,760
even those dissolve and become
something different. So speaking

349
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,440
of levels, you mentioned that
there's sort of a transition

350
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,320
that you make, and relatively
quickly, I think you said two

351
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,920
years for a young person, maybe
that's a lot, and that one of

352
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,720
the transitions that happens is
a sense of. The Journey, sort of

353
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,540
being about yourself, to being
to be about the individual, to

354
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,800
being about the collective. And
you speak about Well, I'll let

355
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,960
you speak about it. And part of
that transition, certain things

356
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,900
became obvious to you, and one
of those being the sort of fact

357
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,200
of reincarnation and past lives.
And I'm curious, could you let

358
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,660
us know, sort of what the
different levels were and how

359
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,960
your experience changed as you
went up or deeper into them?

360
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,080
Chris Bache: All right? Those
are sort of two questions rolled

361
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,980
into one. So let me take the one
on reincarnation first and then

362
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,160
bring me back. If I don't come
back to the first question,

363
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:46,720
bring me back to it. Got it when
I finished graduate school and

364
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,760
was beginning my academic life.
Two people's work changed my

365
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,760
life. One was Stan Grof, and
that's what we're talking about

366
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,360
today. The other person whose
work changed my life was Ian

367
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,760
Stevenson, professor at the
University of Virginia, who is

368
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,300
the Charles Darwin of
reincarnation. He basically has

369
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,680
generated the data. He's tracked
down the data small children who

370
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,180
have spontaneous recall of their
former lives in sufficient

371
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:22,400
detail and that we can basically
exclude natural or physical

372
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,160
explanations for how they would
have these memories, and he's

373
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,720
done this in book after book
after book. So Stevenson

374
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,160
convinced me that reincarnation
was a fact of life, and he

375
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,940
convinced me before I was really
very deeply involved in my

376
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,340
psychedelic work, but that
concept was affirmed and

377
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,900
expounded and deepened as my
psychedelic work deepened. So it

378
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,320
was already part of my
intellectual furniture, but it

379
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,160
just I began to understand it
more and more deeply as we went

380
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,960
now, in terms of levels. Again,
I was working at very high dose

381
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,860
levels. So you can count it in
terms of years, or you can count

382
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,600
it in terms of sessions. It took
me about 10 sessions to go

383
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,440
through what Stan calls the
perinatal level of

384
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,160
consciousness, which is that
level of consciousness which is

385
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,780
right at the interface between
personal consciousness and

386
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,100
Transpersonal consciousness,
where they overlap is this

387
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,160
level, which is at the one hand,
the basement of the personal

388
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,380
psyche and the doorway into
spiritual reality. So that one

389
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,780
goes through many experiences of
death, experiences of sometimes

390
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,160
reliving your own birth,
confronting all your anxiety

391
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,300
about whether there's anything
good in reality beyond physical

392
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,900
existence, tremendous
existential pain, quandary, and

393
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,940
eventually this culminates in
ego, death. And so the ego is

394
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,780
shattered, and you're
transcended. You move into

395
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,060
levels of consciousness that go
considerably beyond anything

396
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,760
that could be explained in terms
of your personal history. It was

397
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,720
at that point when I was
expecting actually to be get

398
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,040
granted, more comfortable access
to spiritual reality, what I

399
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,780
found was that the entire
Death-Rebirth cycle repeated

400
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,400
itself again, but this time at a
completely different level. I

401
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,180
began to have tremendous
collective experiences,

402
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,840
experiencing collective rage,
collective anguish for a long

403
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,500
this went on for another two
years and another 10 or so

404
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,580
sessions to another 12 sessions.
In the beginning, I thought this

405
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,200
was simply another variation, a
deepening, of ego death. I was

406
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,800
still thinking in terms of a
personal model. I thought that

407
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,200
somehow this collective ego
death, this collective death,

408
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,420
represented a deepening of my
personal death. But in time, it

409
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,760
went on for so long and it
lasted for it was so the content

410
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,180
of the experiences was so
inherently connect collective

411
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,180
that eventually I came to a
different conclusion, and that

412
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,200
is the conclusion I came to, is
that the patient in these

413
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,480
sessions wasn't me personally,
but in some way, the patient had

414
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,520
become my human family, the
collective species of humanity,

415
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:45,220
and that I was being drawn into
collective Coex systems that

416
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,860
held the pain and suffering of
human history, that just as my

417
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,300
individual psyche collects my
individual trauma in Coex

418
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,620
systems, the memory of our
species collects its collective

419
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,200
trauma. Lama in these vast
collective COIC systems that I

420
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,400
call them meta matrices, so that
eventually what I came to

421
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,280
understand took me a long time,
because this was so paradigm

422
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,100
breaking, and it was so foreign
to and it sounded so arrogant,

423
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,020
that somehow something I was
doing in my sessions was somehow

424
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,920
impacting the the psyche of
humanity. Mean, my God, that

425
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,840
just looks like megalomania. But
it's not that. It's simply

426
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,140
following the natural course of
the deepening of the

427
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,720
Death-Rebirth cycle, so that it
churns at the personal level,

428
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,200
and in my case, then it churned
at the collective level for

429
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,580
another two years, and
eventually it culminated in this

430
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,800
orgy of of pain and suffering,
of the ocean of suffering. And

431
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,100
then it spun me into archetypal
reality, and it the collective

432
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,300
the ocean of suffering never
returned after that point, it

433
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,800
just stopped. There were still
very intense purification

434
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,840
processes to come, but this
particular quality of collect,

435
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,680
this collective ordeal, stopped,
and I went into a whole nother

436
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,560
cycle of death and rebirth. So
yeah, that's basically the the

437
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,880
driving force behind my book,
dark night, early dawn, is

438
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,620
basically to understand the
relationship, or why, why these

439
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,960
collective experiences were
showing up in my therapy. When I

440
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,320
thought I was individual
therapy, what were all these

441
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,020
people doing in my therapy?
Turns out it wasn't that at all.

442
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,460
Luc Briede-Cooper: Right, that's
funny. Oh, and also, for people

443
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,380
who don't know, Coex system is
termed from Stani Grof and is

444
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,140
sort of the collection of
biographical traumas, going down

445
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,720
to perinatal traumas around
birth, and then going deeper in

446
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,320
the Transpersonal in that stack
of that pattern, stack with a

447
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,680
similar feeling tone, is a Coex.
So then the meta coexist,

448
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,060
interesting concept.

449
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,140
Chris Bache: Thank you for the
clarification a system of

450
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,400
condensed experience, an
aggregate that's compiled of

451
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,820
many experiences and memories
and fantasies around a

452
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,560
particular theme, around an in
the individual so meta matrices

453
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,340
suggest that the same dynamic
happens at the collective level.

454
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,460
Luc Briede-Cooper: Yeah, got it.
Do you relate that to the idea

455
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,920
of ancestral healing? Or maybe
that's different, actually, than

456
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,420
sort of like family trauma,

457
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,000
Chris Bache: interesting, uh,
variations on a theme, aren't

458
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,880
they? Both of them are trans
individual, ancestral still is

459
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,420
working within the lineage of
the individual, some type of

460
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:04,080
biographical lineage, right?
Whereas, I tend to focus, I

461
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,620
mean, I haven't done a lot of
work with ancestors in the work

462
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,480
that I've done, so I don't want
to presume to be able to speak

463
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,680
on that area. For me very we
very quickly I go into the soul,

464
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,780
reality. And the soul, of
course, jumps historical

465
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,320
lineages all over the place the
soul is. We've been every race,

466
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,520
we've been every culture, we've
been every occupation that's

467
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,440
available through history. So to
me, it broadens out very quickly

468
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,540
into the human story, the human
family. But other people have

469
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,600
had an experience of working
with their personal trauma,

470
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,100
ancestral trauma, you know, in
that kind of directed, linear

471
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,700
fashion. And so, yeah, I think
there, there should be some

472
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,420
relationship between what I
experience as these meta

473
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,960
matrices of human trauma and
what other people experience as

474
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,180
ancestral trauma gatherings at
an ancestral level.

475
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,460
Luc Briede-Cooper: Yeah. I
wonder if maybe the difference

476
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,420
is so the soul capital S, soul
being the collection of your

477
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,080
experiences, of your awareness
across multiple past, all your

478
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,860
past, reincarnated lifetimes. I
wonder if maybe the it speaks to

479
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,240
a differentiation between like
biological trauma and passed

480
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,480
down, also socially passed down
from parent to child. Maybe

481
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,120
that's sort of where that comes
from. And then the soul is like

482
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,340
a different thing. I don't know.
Does that resonate with you?

483
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,180
Chris Bache: Potentially, here
it does. And I think one day we

484
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,900
will understand this much more.
I mean, we basically are right

485
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,340
at the edge. We're collecting
the phenomenology the

486
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:47,020
experiences, but actually
interpreting this complex, new

487
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,900
complex of experiences is going
to take some time.

488
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:54,879
Luc Briede-Cooper: Yeah, got it
totally right. Interesting

489
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,319
question. So you mentioned
species mind and coming into

490
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:04,019
this call. Ocean of suffering,
of collective pain. Where do

491
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,459
animals fit into this?

492
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:13,560
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, of
course, many psychedelics have

493
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,620
very powerful experiences with
animal species, with the various

494
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,580
totems of various species. They
have powerful experiences of the

495
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,700
planet filled with the minds of
these species, not just the

496
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,120
individual species, but the
minds of these species and

497
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:42,700
aggregates of mammalian mind and
so on so forth. That hasn't been

498
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,880
the thrust of my experience. The
thrust of my experience has

499
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,020
really been working with human
consciousness, but the nature of

500
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,020
my experience of human
consciousness completely opens

501
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,560
me to the reality of animal
consciousness in all sorts of

502
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,240
different forms. I think the
reason I've been focused on

503
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,680
human consciousness, for reasons
not of my choosing, just count

504
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,980
being driven at a deeper level,
is that humanity represents the

505
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,880
greatest danger to life on this
planet. We are the We Are The

506
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,900
Life destroyers. We are the
driving force of the Sixth

507
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,060
Extinction. If we can heal
humanity, then all the other

508
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,840
animals, all the other mammals
and life forms on the planet,

509
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,840
will be safe. And that has been
the focus of my work. Seems to

510
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,680
have been vocally focused on
that human story. Other people

511
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,140
have been retrieving the
consciousness story of other

512
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:49,060
life forms, even rock life forms
and insect life forms and animal

513
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,440
life forms, bird, fish life
forms, absolutely important

514
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,340
work, essential work, it just
hasn't been my personal work.

515
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,340
Luc Briede-Cooper: Yeah, got it?
Yeah. It's very interesting, and

516
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:08,640
maybe it's that I read this
book, levels of energy by David

517
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,920
Hawkins. I don't familiar with
it, but basic point is, he uses

518
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,540
a method to, in his framework,
identify a number to the level

519
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,360
of consciousness, or the level
of energy of a being or an

520
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,380
object or a mineral or whatever,
and he and interesting enough,

521
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,320
like a bacteria, lands on the
scale somewhere they're very low

522
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,180
three or something I don't know,
and I don't know what might come

523
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,460
first is the acknowledgement of
the consciousness of, say,

524
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,880
animals and working our way
down, or the acknowledgement of,

525
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,260
say, consciousness above us. But
it seems either way, it sort of

526
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,560
they, they, yeah, make the other
aware, something like that.

527
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,120
Chris Bache: Let's imagine that
there are as as many levels of

528
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,720
consciousness as there are,
quote, below us, simpler and

529
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,260
simpler and simpler, you know,
moving all the way down through

530
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,460
the evolutionary tree. Imagine
that there are that many levels

531
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,360
of consciousness above us, and
that we're not, in any way, the

532
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,960
top of the chain, but we're
maybe somewhere in the midpoint

533
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,900
of that chain totally.

534
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,340
Luc Briede-Cooper: And an image
comes to mind of, I think you

535
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,440
mentioned at the end of the book
of the idea that an ascension of

536
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,380
us in consciousness is sort of
like a pulling down of something

537
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,960
from a higher level. And I
thought, Oh, hey, how does that

538
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,580
work? For like, like, our our
tissue cells, like, if they

539
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,120
they're sort of reliant on us in
some way, and we're also reliant

540
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,040
on them, and there's this, like,
bottom up, top down

541
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:47,200
relationship, but so I'd love to
ask you speaking about levels

542
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,340
again, I think we touched on
breaking through to archetypal

543
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,000
what you the best language you
could find being archetypal

544
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,340
reality, and something you
mentioned experiencing at that

545
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,560
Jump was a shift in your sense
of the realness of everyday,

546
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,620
ordinary life and ordinary
states of consciousness. I'm

547
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,060
curious. Did Did your sense of
reality change continuously? Did

548
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,700
it change in certain jumps, or
maybe just that one jump? And

549
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,560
how did your sense of reality
shift?

550
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,820
Chris Bache: My sense of reality
changed repeatedly at different

551
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,560
levels, when everything was said
and done, when I was processing

552
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,580
all the experiences and trying
to organize them in some form,

553
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,640
to present them and share them
with other people, I

554
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,720
differentiated five different
levels, core levels of

555
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,440
consciousness, personal mind,
collective mind, archetypal

556
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,200
mind, causal oneness, so the
causal mind and then diamond

557
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,040
Luminosity overlapping levels,
and it's somewhat arbitrary

558
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,000
where you draw the lines, but
basically those divisions so

559
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,220
that the jump from personal.
Consciousness into collective

560
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,920
reality was a significant jump
into it's like, this is how

561
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,440
reality is organized at a higher
altitude, right? And then when

562
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,340
that culminated and I was spun
into reality, into arc, what I

563
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,260
called archetype of reality,
this was a quantum step into a

564
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:27,500
still deeper modality of
consciousness. And in this, one

565
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,960
of the striking features was I
repeatedly had the sense over

566
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,380
this next year and a half of
work that I had entered a

567
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,440
reality that was more real than
time and space, and I was

568
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,260
dealing with phenomena that were
more real than my personal

569
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,060
existence inside time and space,
or even time space itself. And

570
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,900
this, of course, touches on an
ancient idea that we trace back

571
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,660
to Plato, that there are
structures. He called them

572
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,400
archetypes. There are arche
structures that in create and

573
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,500
inform time, space, reality, all
right. And he conceived these

574
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,940
structures as eternal ideas in
the mind of an eternal

575
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:19,200
unchanging ideas in the mind of
an eternal Deity, an eternal

576
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,660
Divine Principle. That's not how
I experience them. I experience

577
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:28,880
them as living entities, as
moving in time, but on a

578
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,980
completely different scale of
time. So an analogy that came up

579
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,280
in my sessions, if you think of
the earth spinning around real

580
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,980
quickly, and then spinning
around the Sun pretty quickly,

581
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,260
but then you look at that in the
context of the galaxy, which is

582
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:49,660
moving incredibly slowly, but
vast. It's always moving. And

583
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,320
inside you have the sun moving.
It's kind of like that

584
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,920
archetypal reality. These
archetypal beings, to the extent

585
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,140
that I was able to experience
them clearly at all, were vast

586
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,800
living structures on a
completely different order of

587
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,840
causality, in a different order
of time. I could not I could not

588
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,400
wrap my mind around them. I
could not see them cognitively

589
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:21,140
coherently. I experienced this
enormous living intelligences

590
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,760
and the best my mind could do to
give them some type of

591
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,740
representation was to see them,
ask galaxies. So we've all

592
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,320
looked at the Hubble telescopes.
We've all looked at these

593
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,800
galaxies. We've seen the
pictures we if we really sit

594
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,860
with them and meditate them, we
understand more deeply what

595
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,000
we're looking at and these
things are billions of light

596
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,360
years across, containing
billions and billions of stars

597
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:52,000
and so on so forth. That's what
my mind did, just to frame this

598
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,200
experience in some way. But I
could not penetrate beyond that.

599
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,080
They were just too big and too
foreign to me to give them form.

600
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,820
At a lower level of archetype
reality, I entered what I would

601
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:11,220
call sort of a Jungian level of
archetype reality, where I

602
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:19,560
experienced repeatedly the human
psyche and the human species as

603
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:24,500
a single organism, a single
integrated organism. And I

604
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:30,740
experienced networks, physical
and mental networks connecting

605
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:36,500
this organism, kind of like the
neurology of this organism. And

606
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,700
I was shown repeatedly how the
individual is hardwired and

607
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,020
soft, wired into this matrix of
consciousness of the species

608
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,980
mind and the species mind how it
informs our individual

609
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,400
consciousness, and how our
individual consciousness reaches

610
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,140
out and informs and structures
future species consciousness. So

611
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:08,940
I saw things like each one of us
carry a holographic, fractal

612
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,340
piece of the diseases of our
time, of the mental diseases, of

613
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,300
the physical diseases, and as we
heal ourselves of these mental

614
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,440
and physical diseases, we
actually contribute to the

615
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,100
healing of the collective
psyche. So the collective

616
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,180
psyche, in a sense, you would
say it's more real than the

617
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,780
individual psyche, but I would
give it maybe a little different

618
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,740
vocabulary. The individual is
real, the collective is real.

619
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,720
They have different kind of
scales of their reality, and

620
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,320
they are mutually implicated in
each other, and both of these

621
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,000
are transcended by the platonic,
archetypal levels of reality,

622
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,700
which are radically beyond our
human. Collective psyche, yeah,

623
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,280
perfectly understood, yeah. From
that point on, from archetypal

624
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:14,220
reality and beyond, everything
was about going into deeper and

625
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,740
deeper levels of what is real in
the world. And we're not used to

626
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,500
thinking of physical reality
being on surface real, and that

627
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,800
there are structures that are
more deeply real. But I think

628
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,740
that quantum theory is
comfortable with that. String

629
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,260
theorists are comfortable with
that we should be able to be

630
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,720
comfortable with that in
psychology.

631
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,120
Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it? Yeah,
I was just going to say

632
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,380
perfectly understood. Can
visualize it perfectly,

633
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,000
understand completely. But
there's something really

634
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,880
intuitive about it that
resonates. And actually, people

635
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,480
do have experiences of a sense
of degree of reality sometimes.

636
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,780
So just sticking to the reality
point, just for a minute,

637
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,300
there's, I don't know if you
ever heard of this, but there's

638
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,180
this condition called
depersonalization, de

639
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,140
realization disorder. Now, as a
disorder, it's relatively rare,

640
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,380
but the experience of de
realization is something that

641
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,500
that, I think, something like,
upwards, more than 50% of people

642
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,080
at some point in their life
experience at least a moment or

643
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:25,940
something of de realization. And
that dpdr, the acronym is, of

644
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,360
course, a like a DSM mental
illness. There's also the

645
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,660
condition schizophrenia, which
has some kind of interesting

646
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,320
relationship to mystical visions
that Carl Jung noted, and at

647
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,020
least psychedelics themselves
can induce or worsen

648
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,640
schizophrenic cysts, symptoms
and the visions that people

649
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,460
might have in schizophrenia can
overlap with sort of the visions

650
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,680
people might have with
psychedelic stuff. So there's a

651
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,900
there's a connection there
between there's some kind of

652
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,560
connection there. I'm just
curious if your sense of just

653
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,500
bouncing off those, if your
sense of mental illness has

654
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,940
changed after your journeys.

655
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,400
Chris Bache: Well, that's a
complicated topic, isn't it? And

656
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,020
better answered by someone with
psychedelic experience who is a

657
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,740
clinical psychologist or a
psychiatrist, who has much more

658
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:16,200
training than I do in pathology
and in our psychological makeup,

659
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,620
it has changed some was it
Huston Smith who said a mystic

660
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,340
learns to swim in waters that
the psychotic drowns

661
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,860
Luc Briede-Cooper: in? I think
that was Joseph Campbell, I

662
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,840
believe, yeah, yeah.

663
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Chris Bache: So what's what we
have in common is opening up

664
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,700
into a reality that is beyond
the private reality or the

665
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,420
personal reality, we open up to
a larger expanse of reality,

666
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,940
which can be very destructive if
you're not ready for it. It can

667
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,240
be very injurious. It can be
very traumatic. It can be very

668
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,440
tumultuous. It can churn things
up inside of you, just opening

669
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,320
up to collective dimensions. And
that's why I really like all

670
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,220
psychedelic therapists, I
emphasize the importance of

671
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,120
accessing these dimensions and
very carefully controlled

672
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,320
circumstances with therapeutic
support. You know, when you go

673
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:22,520
into them, and this is work
that's not not advisable for a

674
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,060
wide range of people. I mean,
this is not necessarily, it's

675
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:30,740
not universally safe. It really
depends upon a lot of variables.

676
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,440
There are screening criteria
which have been developed to

677
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,680
help screen people who are good
candidates for working with

678
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,280
psychedelics and those who
aren't. Nothing unusual here.

679
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:47,860
It's just part of the regimen.
I'm less interested in trying to

680
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,120
refine my understanding of
disease and pathology, other

681
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,920
than in very broad senses,
understanding that people can be

682
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:03,660
having legitimate access to
Transpersonal reality, but in a

683
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:08,280
way which is fractures or
injures their ordinary their

684
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,580
ability to function in the
ordinary world. What I'm more

685
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:18,300
interested in is differentiating
those confusions, those kind of

686
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,580
lower level confusions between
individual experience and these

687
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:29,600
larger planes of reality from
those breakthroughs where we

688
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:36,200
begin to enter these larger
horizons, but either because our

689
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,620
original equipment was
sufficiently strong or because

690
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,440
our methodology is sufficiently
rigorous and focused. We don't

691
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,680
experience it as traumatic. We
don't experience it as

692
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,480
confusion, confusing. We
experience it as clarifying, and

693
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,480
not the clarifying of an
illusion or a delusion, but

694
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,920
truly, truly, metaphysically
clarifying, so that these be.

695
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:06,000
Become great spiritual and
philosophical initiations into

696
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:10,200
the deeper fabric of reality,
the sensation of that

697
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,820
experience, I think, is very
different than the kind of

698
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:21,560
tumultuous confusion that can be
generated in a in a pathological

699
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,140
context, yeah.

700
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,400
Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it
totally Yeah, and yeah, when you

701
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,460
get to the collective level,
then it becomes something very

702
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,260
different. So that's so thank
you for that. You mentioned the

703
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,620
sort of five levels that you lay
out that there's the personal,

704
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,780
the collective, the archetypal,
the causal oneness and the

705
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:50,440
diamond Luminosity. And just
curious, if you could take us up

706
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,860
through to those levels. I know
in another interview, you said

707
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,680
you hate that question, because
it's so challenging to talk

708
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,980
about. I don't press you too
hard.

709
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,040
Chris Bache: We've gone into
archetype of reality with the

710
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,820
collective dimension. And that,
in my experience, what happened

711
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:16,080
was, after about a year and a
half, which is 1112, sessions,

712
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,860
not very much time. I mean, it
really wasn't a lot of time,

713
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,360
because this is a reality.
Archetype of reality is so vast,

714
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,680
it's so huge, that I basically
kind of went through it very

715
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,620
quickly, not experiencing the
breadth of it, but just

716
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,880
penetrating through it pretty
quickly, and then entering going

717
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,600
through yet another death and
rebirth, kind of dying out of

718
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,280
the greater real into an even
greater, greater real this

719
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:50,200
letting go of another level of
set of assumptions and entering

720
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:57,940
into a year of tremendously
powerful experiences, which I

721
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:02,760
kind of grouped together into
this category of causal oneness,

722
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:09,720
because that when you when you
first enter Transpersonal states

723
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:15,000
of awareness or first enter
spiritual levels of reality, our

724
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,080
experiences there are highly
conditioned by our Time space

725
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:24,200
experience, so that in time and
space, we all exist as separate

726
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:29,720
individuals. So when you move
into spiritual reality, you

727
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,680
often tend to experience
spiritual reality as composed of

728
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,220
separate individuals, but
they're without a body. They're

729
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,460
just but they have that granular
quality of individual psyches or

730
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:48,220
individual souls or individual
entities. If you go deeper into

731
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,600
from psychic level to subtle
level of reality, using Stan

732
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:58,480
Grof categories, the units of
consciousness become larger,

733
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,400
you're still in levels of
consciousness which are

734
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:10,020
dualistic in the sense is more
than one of you present. But the

735
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,640
cons, the the entities are
become increasingly large, so

736
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,880
that it becomes species
consciousness, or earth

737
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,700
consciousness, are angelic
realms, they become just very,

738
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,740
very large. So you move from a
level of consciousness, such as

739
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,100
highly conditioned by time,
space consciousness, into a

740
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,700
deeper level of consciousness,
which is less conditioned by

741
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:40,600
time, space consciousness. And
then when you move into causal

742
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,500
level reality. The distinctive
quality of that is that the

743
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:50,260
entire universe is experienced
as a single organism. Now there

744
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,400
oneness is a core, core truth,
of course, and it it manifests

745
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,920
at many different levels. I
don't mean to over

746
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,140
differentiate, you know, these
levels and suggest that it's a

747
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,520
it's literally climbing a ladder
of consciousness. But my

748
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:11,520
experience is basically unfolded
in this kind of fashion. When

749
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,480
you experience the world as one,
it's it's not like experience

750
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,320
intuiting the oneness of life.
So that's part of it, but you

751
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:26,180
literally dissolve into the
universe as it appears to be

752
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,800
experiencing itself, and as the
universe experiences itself at

753
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,760
that level, there are no
separate objects. There are

754
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,840
separate there are gradations
and differentiations, but all of

755
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,580
those start taking place within
the tapestry, within the matrix

756
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:48,520
of oneness. And that's what I
mean by causal oneness, that I

757
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,120
entered into a reality that I
experienced as being, in some

758
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:57,640
ways, beyond the archetype,
beyond those divisions in which

759
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:04,020
I experienced the world as a
sea. Painless fabric of reality

760
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:08,280
and all other realities, Star
realities, Galaxy realities,

761
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,040
personal consciousness
realities, collective psyche

762
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,000
realities, all took place as
organs within this larger

763
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,720
oneness. In that context, I had
experiences of deep experiences

764
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,740
of what the Buddhist call
Shunyata, emptiness, emptiness

765
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:29,480
of form, transparency, where the
experience, the way it's put in

766
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,380
Buddhist scriptures, the Buddha
awoke, you know, in his

767
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:39,740
meditation and saw self, no self
in himself, and no self anywhere

768
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:44,200
in the world. So the way we
usually experience the world is

769
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,140
composed of separate entities,
and we are one of those

770
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:50,860
entities. But when you
experience the world in the

771
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:54,520
causal perspective, you don't
experience yourself as a

772
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,700
separate self, and you don't
experience a separate self

773
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:02,460
anywhere in the world. Now, what
is the world if there's no

774
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:07,020
separate self in it, no separate
molecules, no separate trees, no

775
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:12,480
separate life forms, it is a
living, thriving singularity, a

776
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,580
oneness and a one organism. So
there were experiences of that.

777
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:22,160
There were experiences of cosmic
love. And love, of course, is

778
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,540
the, in a sense, the emotion of
oneness. When we experience

779
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,260
love, we are experiencing the
emotional counterpart to the

780
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:37,400
fact of oneness, experiences of
the void, the primal void out of

781
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:43,060
which the universe arises in the
Big Bang. And experiences for

782
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,480
part of me at this period was
the birth of the diamond soul,

783
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:51,220
which was a long lesson where
reincarnation is taking

784
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,000
humanity, where is this singular
consciousness taking this little

785
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,880
bitty species on this little
bitty planet in this little

786
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:02,580
bitty solar system. That's what
I mean by calls a reality, the

787
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,760
fundamental, a deep, deep
encounter with the oneness of

788
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,380
life. And then for me, after
about a year and a half at that

789
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:15,420
level, I went through yet
another Death-Rebirth process,

790
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,440
which is, it's not ego death
again, it's it's not collective

791
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,820
ego death. It's a deeper layer
of dying and being reborn. And I

792
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:29,840
was brought into states of
consciousness, which I

793
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,460
experienced as being hyper,
hyper, hyper, hyper, Crystal,

794
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,700
clear, clear, beyond
imagination, just clear.

795
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,740
Experiences of light, but I had
known light, you know, many

796
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:46,780
times up to this point, but this
was an exceptionally clear form

797
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:51,340
of light, Mark, just striking. I
know I'm saying the same word

798
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,420
over and over again, but that
was the quality. It's like my

799
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:03,420
ordinary mind felt gauzy and
shadowy compared to this, even

800
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,040
collective mind and even
archetypal mind felt like

801
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:13,080
shadows compared to this, which
was clear beyond imagination.

802
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:18,480
Over the next four years, I
entered this state only four

803
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,140
times. So in 26 sessions, I
entered this reality only four

804
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:29,420
times during in between those
real in between those four

805
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,920
sessions, lots of episodes of
cleansing, lots of episodes of

806
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,520
healing and purification.
Purification, because if you're

807
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,820
going to maintain clear
cognition at these deeper levels

808
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:47,500
of consciousness, you must go
through a purification process

809
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,360
that allows your entire system
to acclimate to the levels of

810
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,440
energy and the levels of reality
that you're entering and so it's

811
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,260
it's just a natural course that
I've discovered that every time

812
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,040
I entered into a deeper level of
reality, I was entering into a

813
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,180
higher level of energy, and so I
had to go through this

814
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:13,860
purification process, otherwise
my experience at this new level

815
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,340
would not be clear. It would not
be I would not be able to

816
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:21,680
remember my experiences clearly,
and you literally have to train

817
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,520
yourself. I know this a little
off the point, but you have to

818
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,260
train yourself to maintain
cognitive coherence in these

819
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,920
deeper levels of reality.
Otherwise, you may get glancing

820
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,400
insights, or, you know, short
glimpses here and there, short

821
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:44,920
touches. But your mind in order
to truly stay that this reality

822
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,180
for hours and hours at a time,
you have to go through this

823
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,560
deep, transformational process.
So for me, I went into the

824
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,640
diamond Luminosity and went
deeper into it for two of these

825
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,440
four sessions, and then things.
Changed. I had a particular

826
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,400
experience, and from that point
on, things changed. I wasn't

827
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,700
going deeper into diamond
Luminosity. The diamond

828
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,240
Luminosity was crunching itself
more and more deeply into my

829
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,920
physical body, into my mental
body, into my psychological and

830
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:24,140
emotional body. And then I had
one last, what I consider one of

831
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:29,840
the last big visions of my
entire journey, and then it was

832
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,980
wrapped up two more sessions,
the universe has kind of wrapped

833
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,880
it up, and said, sayonara, since
see you so

834
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,320
Luc Briede-Cooper: Wow, amazing.
And the breath of life, the

835
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,440
expansion, the contraction. You
see that in your journey, it's

836
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,120
everywhere. And one of the two
thoughts, one of the striking

837
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,600
things that I took away from the
book personally, was the shift

838
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,840
in understanding of
ineffability, and that different

839
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,720
levels being hard to find
language for is a matter of

840
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,340
stabilizing and familiarity and
not necessarily a complete

841
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,660
inherent lack of understanding
that. So that's one takeaway,

842
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,720
and then the other one, maybe
even a bigger one. I just opened

843
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,500
up a page to the book here,
where you mention it is one

844
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,980
small little section called
Beyond the diamond Luminosity

845
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:22,700
and the humor of the failure of
language, you know, going from

846
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:27,440
clarity beyond clarity to all
capitals, hyper clarity and

847
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,880
beyond the light of all light,
better than more light than the

848
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:36,920
other light, going to absolute
light. And you're understanding

849
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,940
that this points to there being
more than just there, being like

850
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,140
infinite number of levels,
potentially as being the

851
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,580
takeaway from that.

852
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,000
Chris Bache: Let me say
something about that, because it

853
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,140
does it that did represent as
major turning point for me. So

854
01:01:56,140 --> 01:02:03,180
setting the stage. I'm now 15
years into this journey, I've

855
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:07,140
gone through the ocean of
suffering. I've gone through ego

856
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,840
death. I've gone through
archetype of reality. I've gone

857
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,740
through lots of experiences of
causal of reality, and then i i

858
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:19,440
get dropped into this communion
with this infinitely satisfying,

859
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:26,300
clear diamond Luminosity, what
Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the

860
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:31,760
clear light of absolute reality.
So I get back into that the

861
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,260
second time, which is the 50th
session. Second time I'm in that

862
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:41,440
reality. I'm as deep into the
universe as I've ever been

863
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,320
before, I couldn't ask for
anything more than I was being

864
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:52,660
given at the time. And all of a
sudden, my visual field pivoted

865
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:56,680
90 degrees, and I saw reality
Far, Far in the distance. Again,

866
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:01,140
it looked kind of like galaxies.
And out of that reality, a beam

867
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:06,180
of light came and hit me, and it
absolutely shattered me. It just

868
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:10,140
it was a more powerful light
than even the diamond Luminosity

869
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:15,480
that had become my ultimate
reality, and just in that one

870
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:22,880
second, it completely changed my
understanding of reality in that

871
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,740
I had adopted the belief from
multiple sources that there was

872
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:31,520
an end point to this work. You
know, you want to get to the

873
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:36,140
goal. You do this become one
with God, or to dissolve into

874
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:41,440
the void, the primal void of all
existence. And I had become one

875
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,580
with God in many different
variations, and I had entered

876
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:51,220
the primal void, but I I still
had this sense that there was an

877
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:54,700
end point to this journey, and I
was pushing so hard to get to

878
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,360
the end point. I don't know what
was I was expecting to be

879
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,960
waiting for me at the end point,
but I knew it was going to be

880
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,580
good. And what this session
showed me was that it is an

881
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,620
infinite universe I'll never get
to the end of it. It's just too

882
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:15,900
vast, too huge. And it's 50
sessions in, 50 high dose

883
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,960
sessions in and I was shown this
glimpse of a reality far, far

884
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,700
beyond anything that I would
reach in this lifetime. And at

885
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:32,180
that point, I let go completely
of the idea of reaching a deeper

886
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:38,720
or an end point reality, and it
changed into trying to absorb

887
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,800
the reality that I was being
opened into as deeply as I

888
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:48,100
could, into my into my personal
being. So yeah, that was a major

889
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,100
turning point, and that's one of
the reasons I would if I were

890
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,400
doing this over again, I would
be gentler with myself, because

891
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,120
one of the reasons I was pushing
so hard was because I had

892
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,820
adopted a false belief. There is
an end point. Now I should be

893
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,020
careful. There are homecomings.
You go through experiences of

894
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:10,560
coming home, and there's a
tremendous sense of return and

895
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:18,060
tremendous sense of ecstasy and
joy of Homecoming. But even

896
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,840
those, I don't think they are
not ultimate. At least they're

897
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,920
not. In my experience, they are.
They're markers on longer

898
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,240
journey. And that's why I would
be gentle. I would have a

899
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,800
different orientation for what
the purpose or what the value of

900
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,600
these exercises are

901
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,800
Luc Briede-Cooper: totally,
totally and I think my shift in

902
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,400
understanding through the book
too. Also, that one paragraph

903
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,860
changed everything for me in
similar way. I thought, yeah, I

904
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:54,340
want to reach the end point too.
And then that changed that so.

905
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,220
So I guess following that
thread, coming back down the

906
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:01,140
mountain, as you've gone through
these experiences, you had a

907
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:06,960
vision of the future and of the
of what may be coming in the

908
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:12,060
future. And could you tell us
about what that was like, what

909
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:16,440
that looked like, and how that's
evolved for you since, I know,

910
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,840
since you published the book,
The covid pandemic happened.

911
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:25,280
Chris Bache: Yeah. Well, this is
not so much coming down the

912
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,280
mountain, but still climbing the
mountain. It actually started

913
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:32,960
when I was in the end stages of
the ocean of suffering work.

914
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,920
When I was in the chapter the
initiation of the universe, I

915
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:42,760
started being given visionary
initiations into the human story

916
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:48,460
and the stages of human
evolution, and in particular,

917
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,560
the story that I was being
initiated into was the story

918
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,560
that humanity was coming to a
turning point in its

919
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,900
evolutionary development. It was
coming to a major transformative

920
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:04,860
pivot that would change the
nature of life on this planet.

921
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:10,200
And I just had a series of
visions over four years in the

922
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:16,140
early to mid 1990s of what I
call the visions of awakening,

923
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:21,800
was that the that there was an
historical process that was

924
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:26,060
trying to awaken not just
individuals. It was trying to

925
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:30,740
awaken the entire species. That
was the historical work at hand,

926
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:36,860
a transformation that was truly
collective, a transformation not

927
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:40,600
simply of our psychological well
being or some levels of

928
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,540
psychological truth, but a
transformation of the

929
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:47,200
fundamental plate tectonics of
the art of the collective

930
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,180
psyche, the archetypal structure
of the deep psyche, was in the

931
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:57,100
process of undergoing a
revision, a transition. So this

932
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:01,080
for four years, these visions
kept coming into me, and this

933
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,440
completely surprised me,
because, again, I was at the

934
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,620
tail end of thinking this. My
work was about personal

935
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:12,180
transformation, and yet these
visions were consistently about

936
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:18,900
collective transformation.
Nowhere was I shown how nature

937
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,980
was going to pull off this
transformation nature, or

938
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,300
divine, or whatever you think of
it's the driving force. How are

939
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,220
we going to undergo this
profound transition that I was

940
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:37,520
being shown? And then in 1995
when I was in the middle of the

941
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,020
diamond Luminosity work, and I
had entered the diamond

942
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:44,500
Luminosity twice, and it had
that experience we just talked

943
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,120
about, I'd done a year's worth
of more purification, and I was

944
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,660
expecting, given the rhythms of
what had gone on before, I was

945
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:57,040
expecting to be taken back into
the diamond Luminosity material

946
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:02,400
again. But that's not what
happened. What happened was,

947
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:09,480
first I dissolved radically into
the species mind. I'd gone into

948
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,060
that territory before I had
learned how to go through this

949
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:16,200
process. So I dissolved into the
mind of our species, and I

950
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:22,220
ceased to function as Chris
Bache and I began to function in

951
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:26,600
somehow. I know this sounds
extreme, but in somehow, I was

952
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,760
functioning as the species of
humanity. At some core level, I

953
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:36,740
had become the human species.
And then I was also I was taken

954
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:41,140
deep into deep time. I'd gone
into deep time many times

955
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:45,460
previously. This took me deeper
into deep time than I had gone

956
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:50,620
before. And basically in that
session, I experienced the death

957
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:55,720
and rebirth of humanity. I
experienced a global crisis that

958
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:01,260
we were coming into, and I
experienced it at. Species will

959
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,800
experience it. It didn't give me
the details. It didn't tell me

960
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,060
when, where, how, exactly it
told me. It showed me the fact

961
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,500
of this crisis. It showed me
that we would make it through

962
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:18,960
this crisis, and it gave me
certain key insights in how of

963
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,160
the mechanisms of transformation
that were involved in this

964
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:28,640
crisis, but basically what I
experienced in this session was

965
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,260
humanity coming to a turning
point in its history and a

966
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:38,420
profound unraveling, a deep de
construction of reality as we

967
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:41,920
had known it, an undoing of all
the assumptions that we were

968
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:49,960
making, it seemed as if this was
a global systems crisis that was

969
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:55,300
being driven by a series of
ecological crises at the time. I

970
01:10:55,300 --> 01:11:00,300
should say this is 25 years ago,
right? I didn't know. I knew

971
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,540
next to nothing about the global
systems crisis. I didn't know

972
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,480
about ecological crises. I
didn't you know this was I was

973
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,980
totally naive about these
things. But what I experienced

974
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:15,420
was humanity came to a point
where we basically lost control

975
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,320
of our lives. We were not able
to control the reality of our

976
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:26,240
lives. We basically were on an
extinction trajectory, and just

977
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:32,300
when it reached its peak, we
went through a threshold, and

978
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:37,520
the danger began to subside, and
we began to, as it were, pick

979
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:43,720
ourselves up on the other side
of this years, decades, long

980
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:49,240
series of crises, and when we
picked ourselves up and when we

981
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:56,080
began to reorganize ourselves
after this crisis, we found that

982
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,680
we had been profoundly and
deeply and permanently changed

983
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:06,420
by this crisis we had, it led to
we were changed at the core

984
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:11,760
level of our essential psyche,
of our of our collective psyche.

985
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:18,540
This crisis opened up our heart
to one another and opened up our

986
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:22,820
mind to the universe in a way
that was collectively

987
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:28,340
unprecedented, and as we began
to interact in this post crisis

988
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:36,140
reality, there was a synergistic
feeding off of patterns and

989
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:40,900
trends and feeding back and
forth All circulating around new

990
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:44,500
values, new perceptions of the
good, new understandings of

991
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,680
life, new understandings of
ourselves, new understandings of

992
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,860
the universe, new capacities
that were opening within the

993
01:12:50,860 --> 01:13:00,760
human heart and the human mind.
Then in the 70th session, one

994
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:04,140
that what I refer to as this
last visionary experience. I was

995
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:09,960
taken deeper into deep time and
given one last Coda on this

996
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:15,780
trajectory. But the net result
of all of this is that I came to

997
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:20,480
see or what I was being shown,
was that humanity was in the

998
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:25,520
process of giving birth to its
next evolutionary form, to the

999
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:31,460
next higher form of being, a
human being. And if you ask,

1000
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:34,940
what is the form of the future
human? What will the future

1001
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:41,860
human look like? I think the key
is understanding reincarnation.

1002
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:46,420
This refers to another series of
lessons that I was given where I

1003
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:51,400
was shown experientially,
personally and experientially,

1004
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:55,480
where reincarnation is taking
humanity, where are we going?

1005
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,320
And this was different than the
Eastern traditions that I had

1006
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:03,900
assimilated in graduate school
that that vision is you grow and

1007
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,680
you grow and you grow and you
change. You achieve some type of

1008
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,920
spiritual breakthrough to your
individual essence. You know,

1009
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:16,560
Atman is Brahman. We are divine.
And when you have that spiritual

1010
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,020
breakthrough, you achieve what
the Hindus call Moksha escape,

1011
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,800
which means you escape Samsara.
You no longer have to be

1012
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,740
incarnated. You achieve
realization, you achieve

1013
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:31,700
enlightenment, and then you
enter parin nirvana. You leave

1014
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:37,280
the physical universe behind.
What was paramount in my

1015
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:42,340
sessions was not that. It was
the vision that we grow and we

1016
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:44,680
grow and we change and we grow
and hopefully more

1017
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,200
compassionate, more
understanding, more talent, so

1018
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,920
on, so forth. But there comes a
time. Well, the way I understand

1019
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,820
reincarnation,

1020
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,100
we die, we expand to our soul
consciousness. We make a choice

1021
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,920
to incarnate. We contract into
egoic consciousness.

1022
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,240
Consciousness, we expand into
soul consciousness, come back

1023
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,740
into egoic consciousness, and
we've been doing this for 10s of

1024
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:12,420
1000s, possibly hundreds of
1000s of years. And if we do

1025
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:18,780
that, sooner or later, soul
consciousness wakes up inside

1026
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,360
individual historical
consciousness. So that my

1027
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,740
experience was, I had an
experience where, at a critical

1028
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:31,460
point in one journey, all of my
former lives started to come

1029
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:36,260
back into me. And I had known I
had done, you know, past life

1030
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:40,040
therapy. I knew a dozen or so of
my former lives in detail, but

1031
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,960
all of my former lives started
to come back into me, and at one

1032
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,340
particular point they seemed to
reach a critical mass, and they

1033
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,720
there was an explosion of
energy, and this energy fused

1034
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:58,360
all those individual lives into
a single consciousness, and I

1035
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,560
was catapulted into a state of
consciousness that was

1036
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:06,300
individual, but a form of
individuality beyond anything

1037
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:11,040
that I had ever understood. And
I think that's what's happening

1038
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,960
to us on this planet. We, and we
have been gestating the future

1039
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:20,660
human for 1000s and 1000s of
years. We are about to give

1040
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:25,460
birth to that future human in
history. In the century, I

1041
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:33,200
believe gestation is long, birth
is very short, traumatic. I

1042
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,440
think that we're entering a time
of history which is going to be

1043
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,500
traumatic. It's going to be very
painful. It's going to be very

1044
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:44,620
difficult, the way labor is
difficult, but I believe, based

1045
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:48,400
only on my psychedelic
experience, that we do make it

1046
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,780
through, and we are deeply
changed in the process. And we

1047
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,640
grow up. We grow up into our
next evolutionary form, the

1048
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:02,700
future human. And on those few
occasions in my sessions when I

1049
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:08,040
was allowed to experience the
future human, they were deeply

1050
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,900
and profoundly ecstatic
experiences, just totally

1051
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:22,040
humbling and just, you know,
just a radically transform

1052
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,540
humanity coming out of this
process. And I think that this

1053
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:30,380
chapter, the birth of the future
human in the book, is the most

1054
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:34,340
important chapter in the book,
because it if it's true, it

1055
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:38,360
concerns your children, my
children, our grandchildren, our

1056
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:42,100
grandchildren's grandchildren.
It concerns all of us, what's

1057
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:45,100
happening at a very, very deep
level. And it also helped me

1058
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:50,260
understand some of the
historical currents that were

1059
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:54,220
taking place in this context.
Covid is, to me, it's like a

1060
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,160
little shot across the bow. You
know? It's like a little

1061
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,840
overture. It's not the real
symphony. It's just the overture

1062
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:07,200
to the symphony. It's just, it's
a taste of how vulnerable we are

1063
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:12,420
to deep and profound disruption
and how quickly the entire

1064
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:16,440
structure of our society can
pivot. That's what we should

1065
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,500
have. Should be learning from
covid and our interdependence

1066
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:23,120
and how much we have to work
together to rise to the

1067
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:27,320
challenge that's coming at us.
The challenges will be much

1068
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:32,840
deeper than covid and much
longer lasting and much more

1069
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,820
serious and life threatening, I
think.

1070
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:39,620
Luc Briede-Cooper: Yeah, thank
you. Yeah, the vision is very

1071
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:44,080
powerful, and I didn't have the
vision. I can't speak to it

1072
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,480
directly, but there are
obviously signs of that

1073
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,980
happening, you know, ecological
signs. And I know there's tons

1074
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:54,340
of literature on systems crisis
and vulnerability, and we see

1075
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,680
that financially, that's for
sure. We've seen that play out

1076
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,440
when covid happened, one of the
things we saw here in Canada was

1077
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:05,460
just toilet paper ran out.
Everyone was doing the rush for

1078
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,920
toilet paper. A little hint at
what can happen, right? How

1079
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:13,080
quickly it can happen. And what
comes to mind is the, I think

1080
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,420
it's Chinese proverb, I don't
know. Maybe Einstein said it.

1081
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:18,780
Maybe something, it was
something like, you know,

1082
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:24,380
society will be good, or the
world will be happy when people

1083
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:28,520
are willing to plant trees that
will only be seen by the next

1084
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:32,900
generation. So the idea that it
seemed so intuitive, something

1085
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,660
clicked when he said about the
souls fusing together, about

1086
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,960
being able to understand and see
that we'll have reincarnations

1087
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,620
in the future, and so we'll
actually be on this planet when

1088
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:46,300
we die again. So something very
intuitive

1089
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:50,020
Chris Bache: change, isn't it?
Yeah, American traditions of

1090
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,320
making your decisions based upon
how they impact seven

1091
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:58,120
generations, recognizing that we
will be those generations. So

1092
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,380
the earth we leave is the earth
we inherit. Spirit, and it just

1093
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,580
it broadens our sense of
responsibility. And grant

1094
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:09,240
Ellison says this, basically, we
have to move from being a

1095
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:13,680
species stuck at the adolescent
level to the mature adult level.

1096
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:18,360
And when you're at the mature
adult level, you you look at the

1097
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,120
broader impact across society
and through history, of the

1098
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,840
decisions and the choices that
you're making. And my sense is

1099
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:31,520
we no longer can afford to try
to run this planet based on

1100
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,360
egoic consciousness. The culture
that we have created, the

1101
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:39,080
history that we have lived, is a
history that has been created by

1102
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:43,720
the ego. Now, I know the ego
gets a bad rap in spiritual

1103
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,900
traditions, and I think the ego
is beautiful to me. It's an

1104
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:53,080
exquisitely beautiful structure
of consciousness, but it's

1105
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,800
fundamentally isolated. It
doesn't really experience the

1106
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:03,000
deeper fabric of our connective
tissue we can no longer afford

1107
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,660
to run this planet by or have
this planet run by human beings

1108
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:10,080
who are operating only out of an
egoic level of consciousness,

1109
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:14,220
because that inevitably creates
push pull, that creates wars. It

1110
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:17,220
creates upper classes and lower
classes, those who have and

1111
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:20,960
those who don't, the privileged
and the unprivileged. We need to

1112
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,280
grow up. And we need to
basically grow up into our soul

1113
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,660
consciousness, knowing that now
our soul ahead, we have

1114
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:33,800
experienced lives as all the
races on the planet, all the

1115
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,220
nations on the planet, all the
classes on the planet, all of

1116
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:42,520
those are alive within us and
making our choices out of that

1117
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,960
level of consciousness?

1118
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:48,400
Luc Briede-Cooper: Yeah, can
only imagine what that would be

1119
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:53,320
like. So I've, I've got
something for you, Chris, I've

1120
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:58,240
got a gift for you, because that
when you you share the vision in

1121
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:01,140
the book, I'll just read it, you
say, I saw the future human

1122
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,840
standing up, and this seems
significant against the

1123
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,380
background of many seated
Buddhas, this being was standing

1124
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:14,520
upright. So you mentioned that
your form of art is writing, and

1125
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,760
that's beautiful. Some people,
they use visual art, like Carl

1126
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,160
Jung, for visualizing their
visions. Well, one tool that we

1127
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:25,940
have available to us now is the
tool of AI art, where you can

1128
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:29,360
put in prompts and receive
images and things. So I just

1129
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:34,580
emailed to you just right now, I
just hit send an AI art image I

1130
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:39,800
generated. Of that image as best
as I could represent it.

1131
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:43,960
Chris Bache: I see it, yeah, I
see it. That's beautiful. That's

1132
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:52,060
beautiful. Yeah. So my sense is
that in history, we've hit

1133
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:56,080
basically the meditating Buddha.
The meditating Buddha, or any

1134
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,780
meditating being in an awakened
condition, gets quiet and quiet

1135
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:05,160
on the outside in order to still
the mind, so the mind can

1136
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:08,400
penetrate through the layers and
touch the deeper sense of

1137
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:14,940
reality. And a standing Buddha
is someone who incorporates the

1138
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:20,160
clarity of that sitting monster,
but the dynamism of standing and

1139
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:24,560
walking and acting. And I think
that's that's where we're going.

1140
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:30,800
It's not about simply awaking
up. It's a waking up and acting

1141
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,860
on that awakened consciousness
and bring it forward. Thank you

1142
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:35,600
for that image. That's really
beautiful.

1143
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:39,260
Luc Briede-Cooper: Yeah,
awesome. Yeah. It's a very large

1144
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:42,160
scaled one, so feel free to do
whatever you want with it. Yeah,

1145
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:48,820
awesome. So awesome. So we're
shifting more so I've there.

1146
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:51,340
I've got some specific things I
want to ask you about two and a

1147
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,500
half. I'm glad that we've
covered all this so far, because

1148
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:59,680
now it contextualizes it. I'm
very interested in I love that

1149
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,460
it's sort of bringing back
those, those concepts and

1150
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:05,880
experiences, back down to here
and now, like on earth at this

1151
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,600
level of consciousness and
operating here. And some of the

1152
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,840
things that we contend with here
are the reality of needing to

1153
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,320
operate in the world that we
have sort of traditions from the

1154
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:20,780
past that we have handed down to
us. Edward was born in in this

1155
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:23,900
life, and we see that there are
religions that we can certain

1156
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,540
paths that we can follow, and
there's certain deities that can

1157
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:29,900
be worshiped, and there are many
choices in how to how to

1158
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,540
navigate this world. And that's
been a very strong question for

1159
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:38,000
me personally, at least, and how
do I want to walk in life? Now,

1160
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:41,140
I guess maybe the first question
is, so how is your understanding

1161
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:45,580
of God and religion change
through your journeys, and how

1162
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:50,920
might that relate to the lack of
one ultimate level and meta

1163
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,580
coexistence?

1164
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,780
Chris Bache: That's a big
question. Yeah, that question. I

1165
01:24:55,780 --> 01:25:04,920
need to drink some water. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, you know, I was a

1166
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:10,620
religious studies professor, and
I started, I mean, I, my first

1167
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:15,300
vocation in life was my, I
wanted to be a Catholic priest.

1168
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:18,000
I was raised in the Roman
Catholic tradition, and I was in

1169
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,460
the seminary for four years, and
the Catholic tradition treated

1170
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:25,220
me well. I didn't get any
trauma. And it was, you know, it

1171
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:32,300
was a good shake, but, and then
I did my masters. I did a

1172
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:36,680
degree, undergraduate degree in
Theology at Notre Dame, and then

1173
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,380
I did a master's in New
Testament criticism at

1174
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:43,420
Cambridge. And then I did
philosophy religion at Brown and

1175
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:46,900
by the time I finished graduate
school, I had pretty much

1176
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:50,500
studied my way out of religion
altogether. I kind of had

1177
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,760
recapitulated the transition
from medieval theology in the

1178
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,300
Catholic tradition to the
scriptural Revelation, the

1179
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:02,460
scriptural revolution in
Protestantism to the scientific

1180
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:06,840
critique of religion in the
modern mind. And basically, I

1181
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:12,120
finished essay pretty
sophisticated agnostic with very

1182
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:19,800
high standards for any
possibility of conceptualizing

1183
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:24,140
beyond something beyond time and
space, something approximating

1184
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:33,080
God's dimensions. So I had let
go of concepts of God I and I,

1185
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,740
since I had studied not just one
religious tradition, but I had

1186
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:39,200
studied multiple religious
traditions, I began to

1187
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:43,000
understand the common threads,
but also the differences in the

1188
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,280
world religions. And I also
studied how religions came into

1189
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:54,100
existence, and they say that
dogma is like sausage. You

1190
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:57,280
really don't want to see it
made. And when you really watch

1191
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,140
how dogma is created
historically, it's so filled

1192
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:04,680
with human errors and human
foibles that you just don't want

1193
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:08,580
to eat that kind of stuff. So I
had gone through that, and I

1194
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:13,260
pretty much had scrubbed my mind
of all things having to do with

1195
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:19,440
theology and deities and things
like that. And that's that was

1196
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:27,080
the mind that I started the
psychedelic work. And what

1197
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:31,700
happened was, of course, the
psychedelic work initiated me

1198
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,960
into the reality that was behind
those concepts, and it took me

1199
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:41,740
into the spiritual reality that
had given birth to these

1200
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:47,020
approximations through history,
but it took me into it. On the

1201
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:53,200
one hand, it led me to affirm
the reality of the deeper

1202
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:57,760
intelligence that lies behind
the physical existence, but it

1203
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:06,300
did not lead me to to affirm any
individual lineage of deity or

1204
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:12,360
teachers and even collectively.
The nature of my experience was

1205
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:17,760
to transcend even the collective
religious enterprise so that it

1206
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:24,260
entered it drew me into the
reality, a reality of the

1207
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:28,400
Divine, which is so far beyond
our historical attempts to

1208
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:34,340
conceptualize the divine in
history that truly, you know, we

1209
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,820
say I'm spiritual, not
religious. It's that's a trope I

1210
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:43,240
know, but it's kind of like
that. I did not relate, and I do

1211
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:48,640
not relate in any devotional
sense, to any of the religions

1212
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,220
on the planet, while I respect
them enormously, and I

1213
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:55,960
understand them and I respect
the polishing that they can give

1214
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:00,720
human nature. My psychedelic
experiences took me in a world

1215
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:07,560
beyond that world. So on the one
hand, I I affirm a divine

1216
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:11,940
intelligence, while I don't like
the word divine, and that's why

1217
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:15,720
I talk about the mind of the
universe, because I'd rather

1218
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:21,260
speak in those categories than
in theological categories, but

1219
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:25,400
that there is an extraordinary
Infinite Intelligence and

1220
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:29,540
infinite compassion that gives
birth to existence and that

1221
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:34,100
embodies that the physical
universe is the body of this

1222
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:37,760
being, of this manifest being,
and there might be other

1223
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,860
universes. And you know, our
universe is not necessarily the

1224
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:45,340
only universe in existence, but
there are other universes with

1225
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:50,800
all the levels and complexities
that ours has. So it's, it's,

1226
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:55,360
it's a complex answer, isn't it?
It, on the one hand, it affirms

1227
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:59,740
a spiritual reality. It affirms
divine reality. And I also don't

1228
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:08,340
feel. People inclined to narrow
my love of this intelligence to

1229
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,520
any historical religious forms.

1230
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,540
Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it very
tough topic, 100% and I

1231
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:20,040
definitely see the hesitation to
or not hesitation, the very

1232
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,540
clear sense of not wanting to
start your own thing, bacheism,

1233
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:31,700
the psychedelic path, what a was
doing that. And so there it's

1234
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:34,760
interesting, one hand, people
speak about the meaning crisis

1235
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,520
that we face in the West, that
scientific materialism is sort

1236
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:43,360
of gras hold, and we've
completely wiped out any higher

1237
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:48,040
realms from our sense of
reality, and in, you know, the

1238
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:51,400
coming just challenges that
we're going to face, if that

1239
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,640
culminates in a, in a in a
global crisis, as you describe,

1240
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,940
or otherwise that we have to
contend with the world and we

1241
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:01,680
need to navigate in the world
and a sense of meaning and

1242
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:06,300
purpose and self understanding
as part of that leading up to

1243
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,120
this future human we have
decisions and actions that we

1244
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,180
can take as individuals, and not
everyone can. Can walk the

1245
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:15,120
psychedelic path to necessarily
realize these things themselves.

1246
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:21,500
How do you see people preparing
themselves or moving forward in

1247
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,200
light of this understanding of
the Great Awakening?

1248
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:29,540
Chris Bache: Well, you're
absolutely right. We are living

1249
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:34,880
in a time of a crisis of meaning
because the materialism of early

1250
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,300
science, not post quantum
science, but of early science,

1251
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,500
which still tends to dominate
humanities and the social

1252
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:45,520
sciences. Is a world that's
stripped of meaning. It's a

1253
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,760
world that has no meaning, and
there is nothing beyond physical

1254
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:53,800
reality, and physical reality is
seen as evolving by pure chance.

1255
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,460
So there's no existential
significance your life has no

1256
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:00,340
meaning associated with it.
There is no existential

1257
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:02,940
significance to the challenges
that you may be facing

1258
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:07,920
psychologically or physically or
socially. It's just pure,

1259
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:14,940
random. Nature is blind, it's
violent. And I all my life, I've

1260
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:18,720
been working with students at
university campuses, and that's

1261
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:21,140
the philosophy that they've been
taught in all their other

1262
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:25,580
courses. You know, that reality
to be real, you have to face the

1263
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:28,940
meaninglessness of existence,
and then you push on from there.

1264
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,140
That is one of the great values
of psychedelics, because that

1265
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:36,680
psychedelics can pop that
bubble. You know, it doesn't

1266
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:40,180
take too long to pop that
bubble. You know, give me one

1267
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,500
weekend a month for one year,
and we can pretty much shatter

1268
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:49,660
that so at least we can see that
there is a reality that's behind

1269
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:53,860
the physical universe we can
experience, to some degree, the

1270
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:58,300
intelligence of design that is
expressing itself in The

1271
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:03,240
creative manifestation of time
and space, and the structures in

1272
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:09,420
time and space, that's a very
powerful breakthrough. I think

1273
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,240
that's one of the major
contributions that psychedelics

1274
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:16,800
can make for us. Is not simply
healing us of our trauma and

1275
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,840
healing us of our wounds, but
initiating us, initiating us

1276
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,380
into this, on the one hand,
ancient and on the other hand,

1277
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:28,760
new world view that the world is
alive. The world is saturated

1278
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,280
with intelligence. And there's
layers and layers and layers of

1279
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:35,240
intelligence. And we can commune
with this intelligence. We can

1280
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:39,920
download from this intelligence.
We can, you know, enter into it,

1281
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:49,060
just to, just to have this sense
that there is a purpose to life,

1282
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,480
there is an intelligence
expressing itself. That's one of

1283
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,360
the reasons why I think
reincarnation is so important,

1284
01:33:55,540 --> 01:34:00,900
because we have hard data that
reincarnation is true because,

1285
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,980
you know, we have those verified
memories of our deep past, and

1286
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:10,200
that tells us that gives us a
deeper understanding of what the

1287
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,160
what might be driving the things
that we undertake in our

1288
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:18,720
lifetime, that there is a hidden
purpose, a hidden project folded

1289
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:23,480
into the details of our life
circumstance. This is just one

1290
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,660
of the things that comes very,
very clear in past life therapy

1291
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:30,980
by expansion, when we begin to
see the purpose, not only in our

1292
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:34,880
individual lives, but the
purpose that's percolating

1293
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:39,920
inside our collective evolution,
and the purpose that's behind

1294
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,420
biological evolution, the
emergence of life, the emergence

1295
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:47,500
of self aware life, and so on
and so forth. That gives us some

1296
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:51,700
grounds for beginning to hope
that there is meaning behind

1297
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:55,240
this crisis that we're coming
into, that this crisis is going

1298
01:34:55,240 --> 01:35:00,180
to be terrible. I mean, it's
going to be just terrible. Well,

1299
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:06,840
this is not we're not going to
get through this easily, and I

1300
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,200
believe we will survive it, but
we will not survive unchanged.

1301
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:15,840
We will be deeply changed by it,
and to enter into this process

1302
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,780
with this belief that somehow
it's all an accident and it has

1303
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:21,860
no meaning, it has no
significance. Is a terrible,

1304
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:28,280
terrible philosophy to take into
what's coming Now, having said

1305
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:34,220
that the experience of the
meaningfulness of existence or

1306
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:38,600
the the intelligence that runs
throughout all of life, that

1307
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,040
doesn't mean necessarily that
our first or second or third

1308
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:47,020
take on this intelligence is
necessarily correct, because

1309
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:54,580
there's a sense in which just to
touch the enormous scale of

1310
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:59,920
creation is a humbling
experience, and it tends to lead

1311
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:04,620
you to hold on to your concepts
lightly, delicately, because you

1312
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:09,000
know that your concepts are only
small approximations of

1313
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,840
something which is much, much
larger than your mind is going

1314
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:17,220
to wrap itself around. But just
to have the experience that

1315
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:22,520
there is this power manifesting
itself in life encourages us, I

1316
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:26,600
think, to live our life with
deep integrity, to live our life

1317
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,580
with deep purpose, and to
actualize the purpose of our

1318
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:38,000
incarnation as deeply as we can.
My understanding is that before

1319
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,100
we incarnate, we choose our
incarnation, and there's lots of

1320
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:46,420
research that suggests that. So
my sense is that every one of

1321
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:51,400
us, every human being on the
planet now, chose the

1322
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:55,900
incarnation that they are
currently living, right? And if

1323
01:36:55,900 --> 01:37:01,380
that's the case, then all we
need to do is do is do the best

1324
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:05,520
we can with the incarnation that
we are living, and the rest will

1325
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:11,280
take care of itself, right? And
I think that's a pretty healthy

1326
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:15,420
way to engage what's coming at
us, to do the very best we can

1327
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:19,920
and let the end results work
themselves out beautiful.

1328
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,640
Luc Briede-Cooper: And of
course, immediately begs the

1329
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:27,560
question, what is the best that
we can do? You know, although

1330
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:32,000
there there's something
immediate about that, we have

1331
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,640
things that immediately call us
in our in our environment. So

1332
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:39,620
there's, there's definitely
something else to that. Okay, so

1333
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,600
I hear what you're saying about
attaching ourselves to concepts

1334
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:50,620
lightly and at the same time
with our practices, or spiritual

1335
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:53,920
practices, we may have a
stronger hold on those as the

1336
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,220
process, maybe not attached to
the meaning that we attribute to

1337
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:01,380
the end goal or things like
that. I'd like to explore this a

1338
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:05,160
little bit more specifically
too. And one of the ways that we

1339
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:09,540
can that we confront the world
comes to a basic principle, as

1340
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:12,780
far as I can understand it, is
that where attention goes,

1341
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:16,080
energy flows. Is the idea you
mentioned earlier, that when we

1342
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:22,160
sort of worship or give praise
to entities or say, collective

1343
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:25,160
principles, that it can kind of
give rise to those as images in

1344
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:29,480
the collective unconscious. And
the way I understand worship is

1345
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:32,300
being like a it's like a
practice of of directing

1346
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:37,220
attention to the highest value,
the highest good, some some aim

1347
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:40,540
that you have, that you know,
whether that's nirvana or

1348
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,820
whether that's creating the
kingdom of God on earth in

1349
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:46,660
Christianity, or the Gnostic
image of separating from the

1350
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:50,980
earth, sort of up and out image
that the Gnostics had. What the

1351
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:54,640
worship does is it helps people
sort of realign their values and

1352
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:57,820
their actions to maintain
themselves as they walk on that

1353
01:38:57,820 --> 01:39:01,080
spiritual path. And you know,
certain concepts become

1354
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:04,320
devalued, and it sort of
maintains a structure of reality

1355
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:09,060
with certain things having more
importance than others. Big

1356
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:13,800
question, but how are we to
worship in light of the diamond

1357
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,720
Luminosity and pun intended?

1358
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:28,160
Chris Bache: Well, I'll tell you
how I worship. I worship the

1359
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:34,400
universe. I worship the the
diversity of life on the planet.

1360
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:39,440
I worship the manifestation of
galaxies and solar systems and

1361
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:45,340
star systems. I worship, that's
what's I worship, the the

1362
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:51,040
manifest abundance and the
unfolding complexity of life

1363
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:59,440
itself, and I honor the hidden
drivers of this reality. And

1364
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:04,440
you. You know, science is
telling us what 95% is, dark

1365
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:08,280
energy and dark matter. 96% is
and dark energy and dark matter,

1366
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:11,220
which we've never seen and we
really don't understand, only 4%

1367
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:18,000
is visible in any realistic
form. So it's not that big a

1368
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,460
stretch to think that the
universe is growing. It's an

1369
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:26,300
unfolding out of an
extraordinarily complex and

1370
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:30,500
infinite reality. So I honor the
man of the universe as the

1371
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:35,360
manifest body of this
intelligence, and I honor the

1372
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:41,200
intelligence which is
manifesting as this body at the

1373
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:50,080
same time. So to me, you know,
the medieval cathedrals of

1374
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:54,580
Europe were created in order to
you walk into them and they the

1375
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:59,320
idea is they lift your eye to a
higher horizon, to a deeper

1376
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:06,060
understanding. To me spending
time digesting the images that

1377
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,360
were given to us by the Hubble
telescope and its successor.

1378
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:15,060
Those are spiritual experiences.
Those are profoundly rich

1379
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:20,720
spiritual meditations on on the
intelligence that's manifesting

1380
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:25,940
itself as our universe. And then
for me, I I reflect on my own

1381
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:29,900
experiences. I mean, I I can't
manifest the experiences that

1382
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:34,220
I've had inside my time, space,
body. I wish I could, but I

1383
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:37,400
can't manifest diamond
Luminosity in my daily, daily

1384
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:42,400
consciousness. But I can
remember and I can meditate upon

1385
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:46,480
and I can bring those
experiences into my mind, and I

1386
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:52,720
can enter back into the edges of
those experiences as part of, as

1387
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:57,640
part of a deepening of my own
living process, right? And I'm

1388
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:02,040
also deeply moved by other
people's experiences of this

1389
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:05,940
infinite intelligence. So that's
why I really enjoy reading other

1390
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:09,360
people's psychedelic
experiences, because I don't

1391
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,680
want to get trapped simply in my
lens, in my particular lens, I

1392
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:18,540
like to see this infinite
mystery as it's experienced by

1393
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:23,360
many different people, because
that enriches my sense of its of

1394
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,440
its complexity.

1395
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:29,120
Luc Briede-Cooper: Wow, wow. I
think I wrote wow, like 50 times

1396
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,540
as I was going along. What comes
back for me is coming back to

1397
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,360
the scientific materialism. And
maybe the an immediate thing

1398
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:42,640
that that could happen is a
softening of our concept of

1399
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:45,520
scientific materialism, and
hopefully psychedelics can play

1400
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:49,480
a part in that. I do want to
mention interesting maybe

1401
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,520
coincidence, maybe it's not
strong enough to be a

1402
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,740
synchronicity. But for me,
reading your book, when you

1403
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:56,260
mentioned Carl Jung a few times,
I thought, Oh, my God, no way.

1404
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:59,260
And then you specifically
mentioned Carl Jung's, the Red

1405
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:04,920
Book, which I'm in the middle of
right now. Just crazy. And then

1406
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:09,000
you mentioned Richard Tarnas a
few times, and he and then he

1407
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,660
specifically said one point he
mapped out history of the ideas

1408
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:15,780
of Western thought. Lo and
behold, I'm in the middle of

1409
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:18,300
Richard Tarnas is the passion of
the Western mind at the same

1410
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:23,600
time, very interesting book, and
you realize just how immature

1411
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:26,840
Well, recent, let's say
scientific materialism is like

1412
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:33,680
300 years something scale of 10s
of 1000s. So that was a funny

1413
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:41,440
coincidence for me. So if we can
wrap it around, psychedelics are

1414
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:45,160
a tool, not necessarily for
everyone. How could we best use

1415
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:49,600
psychedelics for spiritual
awakening in light of the coming

1416
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,520
challenges that we may face?

1417
01:43:54,640 --> 01:44:01,200
Chris Bache: Well, I hope we use
them for more than spiritual

1418
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:05,520
awakening. I think, for example,
the whole movement in the

1419
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:09,540
psychedelic Renaissance towards
healing is really important.

1420
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:16,920
Because for I think when I look
at human beings, I don't simply

1421
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:21,380
see a human being. I tend to see
souls. And so when I look at

1422
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:25,520
children, I don't see I don't
see young beings. They could be

1423
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:29,540
very, very old beings in a young
body. And when I see old beings,

1424
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,260
I don't necessarily see, I mean
old people. I don't see old

1425
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:38,540
beings. It could be a very young
soul in an old body. And so I

1426
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:43,780
tend to look at the qualities of
soul that are present in an

1427
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:48,040
incarnation. And my sense is at
this particular time in history,

1428
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:54,040
people are incarnating with lots
of former lives active in their

1429
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:57,220
current life, and they're
incarnating with lots of

1430
01:44:57,220 --> 01:45:01,200
unfinished business at the soul
level. Alive in their life,

1431
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:06,480
there's a sense and that means
that healing is a very important

1432
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:10,680
contribution, not only to their
individual well being, but to

1433
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:15,540
our collective well being. So my
sense is that we are incarnating

1434
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:21,200
generations of pain and
suffering in this generation, in

1435
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:24,680
these generations, and that by
clearing this pain and

1436
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:28,040
suffering, we are clearing out
the whole system of all the

1437
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:32,420
garbage of our leftover from our
egoic consciousness through

1438
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:36,020
1000s of years of incarnations,
and we're opening up and

1439
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:41,080
creating space for this deeper
infusion of cosmic consciousness

1440
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:45,340
to enter into our lives. So
psychedelics can be a

1441
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:49,000
significant part of this
healing. So that's the one

1442
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:56,920
second if healing is allowed to
deepen, then it becomes a tool

1443
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:03,300
of initiation into the
intelligence of the universe,

1444
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:08,040
the intelligence that lies at
the very core of our being, and

1445
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:12,120
it can psychedelics can help us
experience, even if only

1446
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:17,520
temporarily, the truth of our
divine nature and the truth of

1447
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:22,100
our inclusive nature, so that it
really is like we are all leaves

1448
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:28,280
on a tree, and every leaf truly
is part of my being. And only at

1449
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:31,520
the surface level does it look
like we are separate leaves, but

1450
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:36,680
as a tree, we experience that we
are all implicated in each

1451
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:41,800
other's lives, and so naturally
compassion arises, fairness,

1452
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:47,800
justice arises out of that. So
psychedelics can help us deepen

1453
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:52,000
and accelerate this process. A
whole separate issue is the

1454
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,560
balancing of psychedelics with
spiritual practice which is non

1455
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:01,080
psychedelic. I mean, I that's a
whole separate issue. I don't

1456
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:04,800
think psychedelics by themselves
is necessarily a very wise way

1457
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:11,700
to proceed. You need the support
and grounding and insights that

1458
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:14,760
have been kept alive in our
spiritual traditions, our

1459
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:18,480
meditative traditions and
contemplative traditions that I

1460
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:23,660
think these two work hand in
hand, well with each other. So I

1461
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:26,780
think those are maybe the most
important. One of the is the

1462
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:30,740
hate, the accelerating of
healing and the deepening of our

1463
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:37,760
insight into our true nature and
into the nature of the universe.

1464
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:43,540
And then, if we want to push
farther cosmological

1465
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:52,120
exploration, just takes that one
step farther into a conscious

1466
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:57,460
opening to layers of reality
that lie beyond simply our

1467
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:02,580
physical senses. And I think you
don't have to push it as far as

1468
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:06,660
I did, to do a little bit of
cosmological exploration, which

1469
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:10,380
can be very healthy and very
supportive. I think I just

1470
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:18,600
pushed it so far, so hard it,
you know, it just, it becomes a

1471
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:23,180
life defining project, and
there's no need for it to become

1472
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:26,780
a life defining project for many
people. But I think psychedelics

1473
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:30,740
have multiple layers of benefit
that they can give us at this

1474
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:34,580
time. They can help heal us.
They can help us come to our

1475
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:38,000
spiritual senses, and they can
help give us a sense of the

1476
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,860
deeper mystery that we're part
of.

1477
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:44,380
Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it
beautiful. Yeah, I'd like to

1478
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:47,440
bring us back to just one little
point I kind of skipped over,

1479
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:51,400
one little thought I want to ask
you about. And just coming back

1480
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:55,480
to the the understanding of
there being infinite levels that

1481
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:59,380
are higher and higher and
higher, or by Huston Smith's law

1482
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:06,300
of inverse analogy, deeper and
deeper and deeper. How do we

1483
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:11,220
align ourselves with the highest
if there is no highest?

1484
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:18,960
Chris Bache: Oh, yeah, your
question, catches the paradox.

1485
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:29,000
Doesn't catches the issue. Yeah.
Yeah, you know, let me, let me

1486
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,920
give you. This is going to sound
a little off target, but it'll

1487
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:39,380
be, it'll I'll focus it in. I
often think that the

1488
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:43,660
relationship of physical reality
to spiritual reality can be

1489
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:48,640
modeled on an apple, and
physical reality is the skin of

1490
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:53,440
the apple, right? So, the entire
physical world and all the

1491
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,680
levels is the skin of the apple.
And if you if an apple starts

1492
01:49:56,680 --> 01:50:00,780
and it's expanding, you know,
there's like the. The universe

1493
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:05,820
is expanding and getting bitter.
The skin is getting bigger, but

1494
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:10,920
the meat of the apple is
spiritual reality, and we have a

1495
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:14,880
tendency, because we think of
psychedelics as mind expanding,

1496
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,540
mind opening. And there is a
subjective sense that the

1497
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:22,760
reality that we're entering is
bigger than our physical

1498
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:27,080
reality. That tends to convey a
sense that spiritual reality is

1499
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:31,520
bigger than physical reality.
But I don't think that's

1500
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:36,440
necessarily an insight that
generates when you go deeper and

1501
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:42,520
deeper, that sense of expansion
into deeper space changes. So

1502
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:49,180
I'd like to give a different
metaphor. If you go underneath

1503
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:53,740
physical reality, you get into a
layer of spiritual reality. And

1504
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:57,580
if you go deeper in a deeper
layer of spiritual reality, you

1505
01:50:57,580 --> 01:51:01,980
start to drive towards the
center of the apple. And as you

1506
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:06,000
drive deeper towards the center
of the URL the apple, of course,

1507
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,360
forms fall away, because forms
are part of the emergence of

1508
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:13,440
physical reality. And the light
gets brighter and brighter and

1509
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,920
brighter as you drive to the
center of the apple is because

1510
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:22,880
you're at the center is light,
and light eventually manifests

1511
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:27,260
the green textures of the apple
skin, but in the end, it's

1512
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:33,200
light. So you're asking the
question now, how do we orient

1513
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:37,100
ourselves to the ultimate, even
knowing that the ultimate is

1514
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:42,760
beyond our intellectual grasp?
And I think the key to that is

1515
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:49,060
recognizing that the essence of
my life and the essence of your

1516
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:54,940
life is fundamentally the same
essence. We all come from the

1517
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:59,560
light. We are all fractal
embodiments of the light. We are

1518
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:05,820
all evolving expressions of this
manifesting intelligence, this

1519
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:11,160
self manifesting intelligence.
And at that very, very deep

1520
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:16,500
level, my essence is the same as
the essence of mosquitoes and

1521
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:19,620
ants and leaves and everything
on the planet. And that's why

1522
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:23,780
when, when I go into a
transcendental state, that is, I

1523
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:29,360
drop into selflessness, or
Shunyata, I experience the world

1524
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:34,340
as one. And as the shamans would
shout out, all my relations, all

1525
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:37,520
other levels of reality, all
other beings are my relations.

1526
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:45,460
We're all kin in this planet,
even though we may not be able

1527
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:51,820
to adequately conceptualize this
essence, individual essence, the

1528
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:58,180
Atman, the Brahman, we can tune
to it. We can know it. We can

1529
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:03,600
let it suffuse our being. We
can, we can let go of anything

1530
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:08,640
small, which keeps us smaller
than it, and we can regularly

1531
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:14,760
cultivate the practice of tuning
to it. And that's not that is

1532
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,360
only partly an intellectual
exercise. It's, it's deeper than

1533
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:23,540
an intellectual exercise. It's
more of a tuning exercise, and

1534
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:28,340
that we can do even without
having an adequate understanding

1535
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:36,980
of the final goal. It's just
like it's an enjoyment. There is

1536
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:42,580
a sense of peace, there is a
sense of harmony. There is a

1537
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:49,780
sense of Infinite Challenge, the
challenge of infinity, but

1538
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:55,720
there's a profound sense of
alignment that comes about in

1539
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:58,600
our person and in our
relationships, the closer we

1540
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:03,420
draw to that reality. And we can
do all of that without having

1541
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:09,060
any solid answers to what is the
nature of ultimate reality.

1542
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:12,900
Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it. I
mean, not really got it, but I'm

1543
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:17,880
glimpsing it that what comes to
mind is the distinction between

1544
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:22,100
process oriented, say, spiritual
practice or religion, and then

1545
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:25,400
goal oriented religion or
spiritual practice, is that

1546
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:25,760
useful?

1547
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,840
Chris Bache: There it can be. I
mean, basically one way of

1548
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:32,480
putting that. We can live in a
world of nouns, or we can live

1549
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:37,100
in a world of verbs. Verbs are
more accurate than nouns, right?

1550
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,500
That's just one of the insights
that science and philosophy

1551
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:45,940
gives us so we live in a world
of process, rather than a world

1552
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:51,040
of objects, right? And it's all
process a human being is, is a

1553
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:55,300
process which begins lives and
dies. You know? It goes,

1554
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:58,900
consciousness goes, evolves and
completely, constantly changing,

1555
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:03,480
constantly changing. Changing.
Neither you or I are the same at

1556
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:06,360
the end of our conversation as
we were at the beginning. We've

1557
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:10,980
been changed by this contact. So
it's all verbs. It's all process

1558
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,460
Luc Briede-Cooper: and looking
noting the time. Maybe one

1559
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:17,040
thing, one more thing on this
topic I'll just bring up. It's

1560
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,560
just, it's just, this is what it
comes back to, at least for me,

1561
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:23,120
is, you know, in in certain
scriptures, I just will pick

1562
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:27,980
Christianity, you know, Jesus
says Not one word will change in

1563
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:31,580
the Scriptures until all is said
and done. And other ones, Islam,

1564
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:34,760
you know, worship no other God
but me or whatever. This kind of

1565
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:38,780
exclusionary thing doesn't seem
to just be like a cultural

1566
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:41,320
interpretation of it. It's like
right there in the core of the

1567
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:44,260
revelation of the religion. I
don't know what do you make of

1568
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:45,940
that? In two minutes,

1569
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:54,760
Chris Bache: I understand I
understand it. You know, there

1570
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:59,620
was a time in our history, not
that long ago, where religions

1571
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:03,420
existed basically on specific
continents. They were just kind

1572
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:08,340
of before the invention of the
steam engine. Religions existed

1573
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:11,580
in a valley in a particular
landscape. There wasn't mass

1574
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:15,540
migrations of populations moving
around. The religion was part of

1575
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:22,040
a place. It was tied to a place.
And when you bump up against

1576
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:26,360
other people in another place,
there is a conflict between how

1577
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:30,140
your people see the reality and
how those people see reality,

1578
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:36,680
and so the honoring the
integrity of the vision was part

1579
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:41,500
of the process of people owning
their identity in contrast to

1580
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:45,160
other people who have a
different vision and a different

1581
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:49,060
identity. But of course, all of
this changed with the invention

1582
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:51,880
of the steam engine, and then
with the invention of travel,

1583
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,760
and then with the invention of
the internet. Now everything's

1584
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:58,780
getting blended. And now, ever
since the 19th century, scholars

1585
01:56:58,780 --> 01:57:03,120
have been putting together these
amalgams of gathering the

1586
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:07,440
world's wisdom together into
these massive compendiums of

1587
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:10,440
trying to understand it all.
We're wrapping our mind around

1588
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:15,180
the entire planet in that
context, I think what we

1589
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:19,740
recognize is that what may have
been a virtue in the ancient

1590
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:23,840
past now can become an
encumbrance. It can become a

1591
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:30,020
limitation. So now, I think the
greater wisdom is in

1592
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:33,200
understanding all of these
religious traditions

1593
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:37,460
simultaneously, and
understanding that the part the

1594
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:42,940
whole is greater than any of the
individual parts, and so that

1595
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:48,760
the pattern of spirituality for
the planet as a whole is a

1596
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:52,720
larger and more interesting
story than the pattern of

1597
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:56,440
spirituality in one particular
tradition versus another spirit

1598
01:57:56,500 --> 01:58:00,600
another particular tradition.
Okay, so it's just a different

1599
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:03,960
truth that comes forward in
different historical

1600
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:10,140
circumstances. So on the one
hand, I recognize, I recognize

1601
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:14,280
the sentiment that you
described, and I honor it as an

1602
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:21,420
historical sentiment, but I
don't feel beholden to it. To

1603
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:25,160
me, the greater challenge has
been to try to understand the

1604
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:29,360
world's diversity of religious
beliefs and spiritual beliefs,

1605
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:34,340
and then to, in my particular
case, to take the exploration so

1606
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:40,464
deep that it radically eclipses
all of our human experience in a

1607
01:58:40,464 --> 01:58:45,984
larger landscape that emerges in
deep spiritual experience.

1608
01:58:46,224 --> 01:58:49,704
Luc Briede-Cooper: Wow. And just
to wrap it up, I'll just add I

1609
01:58:49,704 --> 01:58:53,364
got a sense of that. The first
thing I ever read that led me

1610
01:58:53,424 --> 01:58:55,944
down this deepening the
spiritual path was Joseph

1611
01:58:55,944 --> 01:59:00,240
Campbell and his writing about
exactly that, this global sense

1612
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:07,680
of all the world's traditions.
Yes. So thank you, Chris, so

1613
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:09,900
much. So much to meditate on.

1614
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:13,680
Chris Bache: Luke, it's been a
pleasure. I thank you for the

1615
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:18,600
conversation. Thank you for
giving me a lot of room to work

1616
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:21,620
and for your very thoughtful
seating of questions. I

1617
01:59:21,620 --> 01:59:22,220
appreciate

1618
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:25,880
Luc Briede-Cooper: it. Thank
you, and I hope that this and

1619
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:29,600
other interviews will help you
in digesting your own journeys

1620
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:33,440
and having the community finally
to share your experiences with

1621
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:38,120
so I feel that I feel part of
the same community with you, and

1622
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:40,100
I'm excited to see what you put
out in the future.

1623
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:45,280
Chris Bache: These conversations
do help me in sharing is good,

1624
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:48,040
and I hope they're useful to
other people, but they truly

1625
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:52,120
help me too, because it it helps
me digest all these things.

1626
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:55,120
Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it
awesome. Thank you, Chris. You.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300
Unknown: Foreign.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,440
Stephen Gray: Welcome everybody.
The very first YouTube channel

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,720
and also audio podcast on Anchor
is where it will also show up.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,640
YouTube channel interview in a
series. It's the series is

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,360
called, you may have noticed
Steven Gray, vision. Stephen

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,040
gray all one word, S, T, E, P,
H, E, N, and then capital, G, R,

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,160
A, y, vision. And the purpose of
these is to explore the

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,720
possibilities of an awakening
humanity. I guess that's the

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,980
simplest way of putting it. And
you will be able to subscribe to

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,500
these. I hope to be able to put
a subscribe button up here

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,760
somewhere at some point, and
some contact information both at

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,960
the beginning and the end. So as
I say, I'm very excited, because

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,700
this is the very first one of
these in a series that I hope to

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,500
continue for quite a while.
Chris Bache is our first my

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,120
first guest, and we both
acknowledge, just before putting

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,760
on the recording, that we're
both feeling honored about this.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,340
And so that's really exciting in
itself. And so before I actually

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,160
ask Chris to say anything. I'm
going to read a short bio and

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,900
add a couple of little comments
of my own. So Christopher M

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,340
Bache officially is professor
emeritus in the Department of

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,640
Philosophy and Religion at
Youngstown State University

22
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,400
where he taught for 33 years. He
is also adjunct faculty at the

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,220
California Institute of integral
studies and a fellow at the

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,480
Institute of Noetic scientists
sciences, an award winning

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,480
teacher. Chris's work explores
the philosophical implications

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,600
of Non-ordinary states of
consciousness, especially

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
psychedelic states. Chris has
written three books, lifestyle

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,440
life cycles. I won't describe
them here. They're findable, of

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,220
course, dark night, early dawn,
which I read about 20 years ago.

30
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,340
Wonderful book the living
classroom, which I have not

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,200
read. And his more recent, or,
well, quite recent, about a year

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,680
ago, maybe. Or was it less, I
can't remember, six months.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,600
Yeah, anyway, LSD and the mind
of the universe, subtitled

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,240
diamonds from heaven. And also,
I'm going to be asking Chris

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,480
about to give a summary of the
20 year journey that he went on

36
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,000
that's described in LSD, in the
mind of the universe. But I

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,480
don't want it to take the whole
interview, and in particular,

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,160
because, well, among other
reasons, because it's he talks.

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,880
He does do a thorough, kind of
linear job of going through all

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,000
that in two or three of these
YouTube videos. And so I would

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,780
suggest, if you really want to
get into the details, short of

42
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,080
reading the book, which is a
stunner. It's just amazing. I

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,160
would suggest going on YouTube
and looking up diamonds from

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,060
heaven. Time waiver, summer
world 2018 and there's like a 50

45
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,960
minute talk that they recorded
of Chris going through the whole

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,740
journey. And that book, by the
way, I have it right here, so

47
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm going to show it to you
called LSD in the mind of the

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,140
universe, diamonds from heaven.
Chris, Don't let me forget at

49
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:39,320
the end to ask you for any kind
of contact information or links

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,520
that you would like people to
follow up on. Thank you so

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,820
Anyway, welcome Chris to my
inaugural Steven gray vision

52
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,800
YouTube Channel series.

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,040
Chris Bache: It's a pleasure to
be with you today, Steven, an

54
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,820
honor to be in your memorial
voyage.

55
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,140
Stephen Gray: All right, so, you
know, there's lots of things I

56
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,680
want to ask you about and
discuss with you, and the I

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,160
think a good place to start.
However, it would be if you

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,700
could give a relatively short
again, because people can go and

59
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,140
look at the video videos on
YouTube, if you could give,

60
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,520
maybe, I don't know, five minute
or something. I don't know

61
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,700
exactly sort of summary of, you
know, well, in the in the talks,

62
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,240
you talk a little bit about, you
know, what got you into it, you

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,480
know, maybe just a real brief
reference to, you know, why you

64
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,020
did this in the first place, and
then a little bit about the 20

65
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,560
year journey, and perhaps what
you know where, where it went

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
after that, something like that.

67
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,780
Chris Bache: So basically, what
you're asking for is, is a

68
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,240
highlight reel or trailer for
the book? Exactly. Yeah. Well,

69
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,500
I'm a philosopher of religion. I
was trained in philosophy of

70
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,360
religion. And I came to this
work with an interest in the

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,260
potential of psychedelics to
explore the deeper reaches of

72
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,660
consciousness, and by pushing
through our personal, personal

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,960
unconscious, entering into the
consciousness, what I eventually

74
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,980
came to understand is the mind
of the universe itself. So I did

75
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,240
20 years, 73 high dose LSD
sessions, and I'd emphasize the

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,900
significance of that particular
protocol, high dose sessions

77
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,520
working at 500 to 600
micrograms, because this opened

78
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,420
up territory and experiences
that were much deeper than when

79
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,760
you're working with the types of
psychedelics and the levels of

80
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,420
doses of psychedelics which are
being used in the therapeutic

81
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,480
community today, which is so
important and very important

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,660
development there. This was
different. This is a much more

83
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,980
aggressive shattering of
different levels of

84
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,040
consciousness and the boundaries
of consciousness. I worked for

85
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,880
four years, stopped for six
years, and then worked for 10

86
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,540
years. I did an average of about
five sessions a year. And where

87
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,400
I went is a long story, but the
highlight reel is I spent about

88
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,440
two years basically working at
what Stan Grof calls the

89
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,680
perinatal level of
consciousness, processing a lot

90
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,120
of material around very early
experiences, birth experiences

91
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,960
death, experiences fear of
death, experiences existential

92
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,800
crisis. Kind of work went
through a deep ego death that

93
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,040
just exploded my identity and
catapulted me into early level

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,720
spiritual experiences, spiritual
reality. Then I spent another

95
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,000
two years going through a much
more intense purification

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,200
process that I call the dark
night of the soul, where the

97
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,360
work clearly pivoted. It took me
a long time to recognize it, but

98
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,880
it clearly pivoted away from my
personal transformation or my

99
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,020
personal healing, and entered
into the collective psyche,

100
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,700
where the focus was the healing
or transformation of the species

101
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,200
mind itself, where I was
processing experiences coming

102
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,140
from 1000s and hundreds of 1000s
of persons and 1000s of years of

103
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,480
time. When that culminated, I
was spun into archetypal

104
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,900
reality. Experienced various
permutations of archetypal

105
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,940
reality and vast territories in
the collective unconscious. And

106
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,900
basically was learning how to
how our species lives as a

107
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,120
single integrated entity, as a
single being, all of us being

108
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,440
fractal embodiments of that
being. From that culminated, I

109
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,460
went through yet another round
of death and rebirth into causal

110
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,220
level reality, where basically,
instead of the world being

111
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,300
composed of parts, even the very
big parts, of archetypal

112
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,980
reality, here the universe
basically pulsed as a single

113
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,720
entity, as a single life form,
dissolving all boundaries, all

114
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,340
membranes, even the membrane
between matter and spirit. I

115
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,840
explored or was given many gifts
in that territory for about a

116
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,500
year, and a chapter that I call
the benediction of blessings,

117
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,540
and then for the last five years
of my work, I entered into a

118
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:38,420
domain of that I came to call
the diamond Luminosity, entering

119
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,660
into a state of consciousness
that was pure light, and the

120
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,620
most difficult thing to describe
is the hyper, hyper clarity,

121
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,540
just clarity beyond measure of
this form of light. I discovered

122
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,000
that there are many levels of
light, and the diamond

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,360
Luminosity was the purest,
highest level I reached in my

124
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,400
work, what Buddhism calls
Dharmakaya are the absolute

125
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,840
reality, the clear light of
absolute reality. For those five

126
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,060
years, I entered this reality
only four times in 26 sessions

127
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,980
with a lot of purification, lot
of lot of healing work done in

128
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,380
those intermediate sessions, and
then I was given one final

129
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,840
vision of the human trajectory,
where we are in history, which

130
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,680
had been a consistent theme in
the work, and then basically the

131
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,640
universe kicked me out. It gave
me two sessions, or wrapped up

132
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,520
our work without me really
understanding yet at the time

133
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,780
that it was wrapping it up, but
it wrapped me up, wrapped up our

134
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,620
work, and then ushered me on my
way, and I stopped my work. So I

135
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,020
stopped the work. I began it in
1979 and I finished it in 1999

136
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,720
and after I finished it, Spirit
said to me in my meditation, 20

137
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,780
years in, 20 years out, meaning
that it would take me 20. Years

138
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,140
in order to understand and
digest the 20 years of

139
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,220
experiences that I had had. And
then it just so happened, not by

140
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,780
any intent, but it just so
happened that LSD in the mind of

141
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,540
the universe was published 20
years after my last session.

142
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,600
Stephen Gray: Wonderful, yes.
And you know, for people

143
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
watching and listening to this,
I want to say that, you know, if

144
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,740
you didn't quite gather how
stunning this journey, or series

145
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,740
of journeys, really has been,
read the book because it's mind

146
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,320
blowing. It's truly paradigm
shattering material. I like to

147
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,480
occasionally joke with no
particular offense to Terence

148
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,040
McKenna, who did a lot of lovely
work that the descriptions that

149
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,720
he gives of where he went were
just kind of tapping into the

150
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,100
realms where you have explored,
where you've gone into the, you

151
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,300
know, in these in these
journeys. So a practical

152
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,500
question, though, or sort of,
yeah, user friendly question, so

153
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,340
to speak, you have spoken in
different ways about, Well,

154
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,720
several things related to this.
One is, you said you wouldn't do

155
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,240
it the same way again because it
was so intense, and then you

156
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,820
also understood that it wasn't
about getting anywhere

157
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,120
particularly. That's one aspect
of this question I'm about to

158
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,040
pose. The other one is, clearly,
this is not for everybody, and

159
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,520
so there's something in there,
and and then, just on a

160
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,320
practical level, for people who
do feel like they are those sort

161
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,040
of deep exploring Psychonauts
and want to do something like

162
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,240
this, feel that kind of a call
like you have. Could you just

163
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,960
briefly describe the protocol,
the safety protocol, that you

164
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,560
employed?

165
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,000
Chris Bache: Well, let's start
with the safety protocol. Yeah,

166
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,500
I basically use the protocol
established by Stanislav Grof in

167
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,680
the early years of his work and
published in his book LSD

168
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,680
psychotherapy in 1980 he
distinguishes clearly low dose

169
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,580
psychelytic sessions and high
dose psychedelic sessions in the

170
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,780
early years. Those psychedelic
sessions were limited to three.

171
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,460
I basically took that protocol,
which always and then and then,

172
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,020
multiplied the number of
sessions to 73 but I was always

173
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,320
working in isolation. I was
working in the privacy of my

174
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,940
home or my wife's clinical
office. I was always lying down,

175
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,280
protected from the outside
world, no interruptions. I had a

176
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,380
sitter. My sitter for all this
work was Carol, my first wife, a

177
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,760
clinical psychologist, listening
to a very carefully curated

178
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,540
playlist of music to support the
deepening and the unfolding of

179
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,200
the work. So basically, the
sessions were completely

180
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,280
internally focused, sheltered
from the outside world. There

181
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,920
was no interface with the
outside world except through the

182
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,660
music. And the focus was on
encountering as deeply as

183
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,580
possible what was arising from
within my own consciousness. Now

184
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,240
the reason I

185
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,840
Stephen Gray: Chris, before we
go any further, a quick question

186
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,180
regarding the sitter, for anyone
who's going to do this kind of

187
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,020
work on their own, what would
you say the job description

188
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,140
prerequisites are for the
sitter, like, does that person

189
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,420
need to have been to some of
these inner realms themselves to

190
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,900
be able to do that job? Or what
would you say, you know, who

191
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,420
could do that job properly?

192
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,500
Chris Bache: Ideally, a person
who's doing the sitting should

193
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,500
be experienced in these domains.
It partly depends upon how

194
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,040
interactive the work is, but the
more experienced the sitter is,

195
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,240
the more comfortable he or she
is likely to be when the subject

196
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,600
gets into this territory. In our
case, Carol was not really

197
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,080
interested in exploring these
domains herself. She read the

198
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,220
literature with me, and that's
not perhaps an ideal

199
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,760
circumstance, but it works
sufficiently well for us. The

200
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,680
responsibility of the sitter is
to take care of the subject so

201
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,680
that they don't hurt themselves,
because some of the spasms that

202
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,460
come up in this session are
pretty violent. There's a lot of

203
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,580
throwing up when working with
high doses, and that has to be

204
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,800
taken care of, basically making
sure the subject stays focused,

205
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,080
so that there's no acting out
any attempt to sort of step away

206
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,980
and step outside of the session,
needs to be discouraged and keep

207
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,380
the person focused material and
then managing the music, staying

208
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,980
in touch with the subject, so
that they know they can

209
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,240
anticipate where the subject is,
sometimes asking questions, but

210
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,360
usually not often. So. That they
can shift the music when the

211
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,380
person has gone into a shift in
their own inner experience.

212
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,840
Stephen Gray: Can you say a
little bit about the music, how

213
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,160
important it is? Is it to get
the right kind of music? I think

214
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,640
in your talk, the one that I
mentioned on YouTube, you said

215
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,220
something about you kind of a
developing quality to the music

216
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,200
as it changed over the course of
the of the session of the Yeah,

217
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,880
it was six, eight hours or so.

218
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,960
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, I
basically followed Helen

219
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,740
Bonnie's recommendations that
Stan had cited in his early

220
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,320
work. And she differentiates
five stages of an LSD session,

221
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,380
and there's basically an
ascending there's an early

222
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,220
latency, and then when the drug
begins to kick in, there's a

223
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,820
high activation. And again, this
is working with high levels of

224
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,180
LSD where the activation level
is particularly intense, and

225
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,680
there's a huge surge in the
quantity of energy that one is

226
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,420
processing, and that continues
to build. And you want music

227
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,440
that can encourage the
surrendering, encouraging the

228
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,760
giving in to whatever is
happening, and supports the

229
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,140
breakthrough of your own
defenses. And then the

230
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,900
experiences will build until you
reach a level where eventually,

231
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,980
if you manage them well,
courageously, you go through

232
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,200
some form of crisis, some crisis
in the experience, some death

233
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,440
and rebirth, experience where
then you're catapulted for the

234
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,800
remainder of the session into
the ecstatic portion of the

235
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,780
journey. My experiences were
always the early portion of the

236
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:47,440
session was a purification
experience, culminating and then

237
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,180
ending in an ecstatic portion of
the experience. Then there's a

238
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,960
long peak of the experience,
where, once you've made that

239
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,900
breakthrough, you want music
that supports the long

240
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,900
expansing, expansive worldview,
and then a very, very slow

241
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,000
decline, a re entry with gentle
music that gives you a spacious

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,840
background that allows you to
process your experiences, and as

243
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,260
you come back to your ordinary
consciousness, integrate your

244
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,660
experiences With your
conventional your identity, your

245
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:27,320
ordinary identity. I found that
after a number of sessions, that

246
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,840
when I began to use indigenous
music chanting with my sessions,

247
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,380
I found that to be much more
powerful, much more evocative,

248
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,260
than classical music, even
powerful classical music. So I

249
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,420
had a preference for that, and
so I collected a lot of

250
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,720
indigenous music over the years
from different cultures. And you

251
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,500
don't want music with any words
that you can understand. So you

252
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,520
want music that doesn't keep you
on familiar ground, which is

253
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,800
another advantage of indigenous
music, or, you know, vocal or

254
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,560
non vocal types, because it
throws you into foreign

255
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,920
territory, and the foreign
territory is what you really

256
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,100
want to be exploring right now,
not staying on the familiar

257
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,580
ground

258
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,780
Stephen Gray: Absolutely. Yeah,
so before we get into the sort

259
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,560
of farther reaches of some of
the experiences you had and the

260
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,900
implications of that I just
listened or watched parts of

261
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,280
that video that I had mentioned
earlier, and you referenced

262
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,260
William James, the great early
20th century psychologist, who

263
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,160
said something like that, there
are three stages of this kind of

264
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,780
work that you've been doing, and
one is the first one is kind of,

265
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,060
you know, pushing the
boundaries, going out into

266
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,600
exploratory territory, but then
following that up with

267
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,040
meticulous recording, and then a
third stage of analysis and

268
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,960
sharing. Is that more or less

269
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,740
Chris Bache: accurate? Yeah,
that's my that's not so much

270
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,560
William James, but it's my
articulation of the principles

271
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,700
of psychedelic philosophy based
on the pioneering work that

272
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,560
James did in that he used
nitrous oxide and drew very

273
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,280
striking conclusions in the
context of the varieties of

274
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,960
religious experience book. And
basically I just articulated

275
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,300
this method from that that you
go into temporary Non-ordinary

276
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,320
states, you record those states
afterwards as clearly and

277
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,700
precisely as you can. And that's
important, because that's really

278
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,420
important, I think, to complete
the circle of learning. Because

279
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:42,640
if you want to do this in a
systematic fashion, integrating

280
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,020
and attending to and trying to
understand your experiences lays

281
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,140
the foundation a strong
foundation for your next set of

282
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,820
experiences. Just like our
dreams are very revelatory, but

283
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,120
if you keep a dream journal,
people find that their dreams

284
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,160
often become more powerful. More
articulate. It is as if your

285
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,700
mind knows that you're paying
attention. The unconscious knows

286
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,060
you're paying attention to it,
and therefore it ups its game.

287
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,200
Likewise, in a session, the more
attention you pay to integration

288
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,800
and consolidating your
experiences. It is as if the

289
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,080
cosmic mind knows you're paying
attention, and and therefore it

290
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,280
engages you more systematically
at the end. So retaining the

291
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,420
experiences is really important,
and particularly if you're

292
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,420
pushing the far boundaries, like
I was doing, and entering into

293
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,040
territory that was radically new
to me and uncertain and I didn't

294
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,900
have many cues, even in in the
psychedelic literature, for

295
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,160
trying to understand much of it,
writing at the very edges of my

296
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,540
of my ability, and trying to
consolidate what I experienced,

297
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,860
was an important part of the
process. And if I can loop back

298
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,740
to your earlier question, why I
wouldn't do it the same way

299
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,720
again, I wouldn't do it the same
way because of some of the

300
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,760
things I learned on the journey.
First of all, I found that over

301
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,660
the long haul, working at doses
this high, even doing it very

302
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,980
responsibly and conscientiously,
and supplementing it with a lot

303
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,640
of other spiritual practice, a
lot of attention to my body, a

304
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,460
lot of yoga, a lot of
meditation, it's a very, very

305
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,100
demanding protocol. It exerts,
it's it's a very taxing

306
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,660
protocol. If I were doing it
over again, I would be gentler

307
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,920
with myself. I would balance
high dose sessions with low dose

308
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,440
sessions. I would balance LSD,
which tends to be a high level,

309
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,480
cosmic level psychedelic with
Psilocybin Ayahuasca, other

310
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,500
psychedelics which are more body
grounded in order to facilitate

311
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,420
an ongoing integration of the
peak experiences, doing it the

312
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,720
way I did, just hammering the
high levels, Just pushing and

313
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,940
pushing, it did open great
cosmic vistas. But I think it I

314
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,180
think I was harder on myself
than I really needed to be, and

315
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:14,040
maybe then was wise, and it took
me a long time to internalize

316
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,180
and in some ways, to recuperate
from that entire journey. The

317
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,440
other reason I would do it a
little differently is because I

318
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,880
learned along the way that this
is not a journey that comes ever

319
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,480
comes to a distinct end. When I
began this work, I thought there

320
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,660
was an end point. I was trying
to get to the end point. Some

321
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,380
people describe the end point as
oneness with God, or entering

322
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,420
into the primal void, and I had
entered into oneness with the

323
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,240
Divine many times, and I had
learned that there are many

324
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,140
levels to that experience, and
even levels to immersion in the

325
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,340
primal void and deep. About two
thirds of the way through the

326
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,220
journey, I had an experience
where the universe showed me

327
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,160
that it's an absolute, infinite
universe, I would never be able

328
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,840
to get to the end of it. It's an
open ended journey you take in

329
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,260
as much of the universe as you
can, as as healthy and as wise

330
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,260
for you. But the idea of getting
to the end was just it was a

331
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,080
misconception, and because of
that, that's another reason why

332
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,160
I would just be a little gentler
and a little patient with the

333
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,100
pace of a slower pace of
evolution.

334
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,360
Stephen Gray: Yeah, the, my old
Buddhist teacher, chugging

335
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,100
Trungpa, has one of his books is
called journey without goal. And

336
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,400
then there's the Are you
familiar with the 10 ox herding

337
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,000
pictures? Yes, yeah. The way
I've encountered them was like,

338
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,940
the last one is something like
and Thus ends the journey that

339
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,580
never need to have been made in
the first place, or something

340
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,120
like that.

341
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,900
Chris Bache: Yes, yeah. And now
it's a little different that,

342
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,780
you know, I started this work
kind of with a focus on

343
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,720
enlightenment, and that really
is what the 10 Oxford and

344
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,080
pictures are about, that journey
of awakening to the ever present

345
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,860
condition, so that in the end,
you come back to where you were,

346
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,480
but you come back with your
filters clear and the present.

347
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,620
The always present, ever present
condition is luminously there.

348
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,140
That's where I that's the agenda
I started with. But it was over

349
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,640
come over. It was superseded by
two other aspects. First, it was

350
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,860
superseded by the challenges of
our collective enlightenment, of

351
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,480
our collective evolution.
Eventually, my personal healing,

352
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,220
or my personal enlightenment,
was just completely superseded

353
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:48,340
by responding to the call to
support our collective

354
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,400
transformation, the
transformation taking place in

355
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,340
history. And the second thing
that superseded then even that

356
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:03,120
was the opportunity. Need to
explore the deep structure of

357
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,200
the universe itself to what I'd
call a cosmological exploration.

358
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,520
You do not need to explore the
deep structure of the universe

359
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,880
in order to become awakened, to
become to your spiritual senses.

360
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,760
You do not need to go back to
the beginning of the universe

361
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,680
and the Big Bang to transcend
all limits of time, to enter

362
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,820
archetype of reality, to abide
in the true and natural

363
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,740
condition that Buddhism calls
our essential nature. These are

364
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,800
different projects. So my work
kind of combined the

365
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,040
Enlightenment project, but
really it kind of yielded to a

366
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,420
different project, what you
might call the philosopher's

367
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,400
project, the invitation to
explore, as far as I could, the

368
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,620
nature of cosmic reality.

369
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,100
Stephen Gray: Yeah, wonderful.
Thank you for clarifying that.

370
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,960
So I don't know how to ask this
question exactly, or even if it

371
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,900
is a good question, but
something like this, you know,

372
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,240
that kind of deep work is
clearly not, you know,

373
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,800
prescribed for a great majority
of people. It's for particular

374
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,580
individuals who feel that they
that calling, and, you know,

375
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,480
feel that they're up for it. And
you you've indicated in your

376
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,600
talks, that you felt that
calling, you know, earlier, at

377
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,820
the beginning of your career,
you know, that you'd always been

378
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,340
interested in that state, and
you felt like, are those kinds

379
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,200
that, you know, effing the
ineffable, as Alan Watts put it,

380
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,620
unscrewing the inscrutable. So I
guess where I'm trying to go

381
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,160
with this question is, people
that are, hmm, a lot of people

382
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,860
are not ever going to use
psychedelics. But then there's

383
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,660
another whole subset of people
in the communities that are the,

384
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,520
you know, in the populace, that
are working with these. And I'm,

385
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,540
I guess, I don't know if
they're, you know, like I say,

386
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,600
what you could say about this.
But you know, the people that

387
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,300
are not in that small group of
people that are going to do that

388
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,860
extremely deep work, do you have
any, have you had any kind of

389
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,680
thoughts, intuitions, feelings
about, you know, how a lot of

390
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,460
people can approach the work
that needs to be done with the

391
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,280
help of psychedelics? Hmm?

392
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:28,040
Unknown: Well,

393
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,080
Chris Bache: first, you're right
that I wrote LSD in the mind of

394
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,920
the universe with the hope that
it would be read, not only by

395
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,040
other psychedelic voyagers. I
hope psychedelic voyagers would

396
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,180
would read it, and there would
be a kind of conversation that

397
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:48,040
would emerge from Voyager to
Voyager, back and forth. But I

398
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,180
hope that this book would also
be read by people who are not

399
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,240
interested in taking
psychedelics and or who haven't

400
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,440
had the opportunity. Because
what's important, I think, in so

401
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,080
many ways, in the book is the
cosmology that emerges, is the

402
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,520
visions of reality that emerge
in the psychedelic state. And

403
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,240
these can be very valuable to
people, whether or not they ever

404
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,540
touch these experiences
themselves, just to see what the

405
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,920
understanding of reality that
comes forward. And I've had many

406
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,760
people write me since the book
has come out, and say, I've

407
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,000
never taken psychedelics in my
life, but I've been a lifelong

408
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,420
meditator, and I really relate
to what you're saying. I've had

409
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,200
many, many similar experiences
of collective suffering, for

410
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,800
example, or different death and
rebirth experiences, but I've

411
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,320
never used psychedelics, and
that's, of course, what we

412
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,000
expect, because psychedelics are
simply an amplifier of

413
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,820
consciousness. It's
consciousness that does the

414
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,080
work. So if you work with
consciousness in a focused way,

415
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,800
then naturally, you're going to
have similar experiences in

416
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,520
different ways to what emerges
in a psychedelic session. Now

417
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,480
for people who want to work with
psychedelics, sorry, several

418
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,940
basic rules of thumb stand out
for me. One of them is very,

419
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,500
very meticulous attention to set
and setting, which, of course, I

420
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,540
think is widely understood now,
but I would emphasize clarity of

421
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,580
intention in creating the
conditions of long term

422
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,440
engagement. Sometimes our
engagement is short by a few

423
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,680
months. Sometimes our
undertaking is several years of

424
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,660
work. But the longer our focused
engagement, the more important

425
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,140
it is to really set up the shop
carefully, to really have your

426
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,780
Kiva prepared, both inwardly and
outwardly, so that your contact

427
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,880
what you want is clean contact
and good recall. And clean

428
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,540
contact means not obscuring the
field with a lot of other things

429
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,720
going on or tending to a lot of
outside things. Tripping is fine

430
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,960
if people want to trip, and a
lot of people have life changing

431
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,820
experiences trip. Being no
criticism there. But if you want

432
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,720
to use this for deep inner work,
you have to clarify your field,

433
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,860
clear it out. And then the
second thing that stands out is

434
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,160
the importance of retention, the
importance of holding on to your

435
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,280
experiences, clarifying
recording them, either with

436
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,900
works of art. Sometimes people
do it with music. For me, it's

437
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:30,200
always been the written word,
methodologically. This, a lot of

438
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,320
the work which is being done,
important work being done with

439
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,040
psychedelics, is therapeutically
focused, aimed at healing the

440
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,540
wounds of the personal psyche.
And that's really important

441
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,240
work, and we're learning a lot
about that, particularly now in

442
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,100
this renaissance of
psychedelics. But that which

443
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,760
heals at the therapeutic level,
at the personal unconscious

444
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,100
level, is also that which opens
work experiences deeper into the

445
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,900
cosmos itself. It's in renewing
our relationship with the

446
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,160
universe that heals so much of
our wounds of incarnation. And

447
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,940
if you are called, or feel
called to push the boundaries, I

448
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,300
mean, it really is. There are
some people who love to climb

449
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,860
mountains and lum some people
who love to, you know, go deep

450
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,480
into the oceans. They just have
an adventurous spirit. And I

451
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,540
think that also is true for
those who want to explore states

452
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,220
of consciousness. But it takes a
certain personality type, if you

453
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,720
will, to you have a certain
rigor, a certain capacity to

454
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,720
maintain ambiguity, to deal with
ambiguity, a certain kind of

455
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,260
stability of your social
circumstance, because it's not

456
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,500
just you who go into these
states, but into a degree.

457
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,940
Everyone that you are intimately
associated with is touched by

458
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,780
your work. So you have to make
sure your life is grounded and

459
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,500
solid that supports the work.
And the last thing I would

460
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,000
mention is the deeper you want
to go into these Non-ordinary

461
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,140
states, the more important it is
to have a daily spiritual

462
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,860
practice. I just have become so
convinced of this over the time,

463
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,920
because you need a daily
spiritual practice to ground

464
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,180
first just the energy that's
unleashed in these states, and

465
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,300
then to ground the experiences
the more you learn about

466
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,500
mysticism and the more you study
the autobiographies of our great

467
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,180
saints and sages, the easier it
is. I think to have it gives you

468
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,500
a touchstone for grounding your
more radical experiences.

469
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,620
Stephen Gray: You know, it's
funny, you mentioned the great

470
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,420
saints and all that. And I don't
think there's an answer to this,

471
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,140
but it's just been on my mind a
little bit later, lately that,

472
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:52,120
you know, there are these, you
know, kind of pinpoint people

473
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,000
over the last couple of 1000
years that you know we hear

474
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,520
about. I don't remember all the
names, but you know, St John of

475
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,560
the Cross, St Francis, Meister
Eckhart and a few of these great

476
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,380
mystics that we know about. You
know, of course, you know, there

477
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,780
are probably many from
indigenous traditions that

478
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:11,580
weren't writing anything down.
But you know, where are these

479
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,820
people now? I mean, are there
just too many of us for them to

480
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,000
stand out on the planet? Now,
like, Where are the people like

481
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,620
Ramana Maharshi and these people
that seem to have completely

482
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,120
gotten it, so to speak.

483
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,900
Chris Bache: Yeah, I don't know
the answer that question. That's

484
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,140
kind of a sociological and
historical question. I don't

485
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,980
really know the answer. I think
that we are that they're more

486
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:39,500
hidden saints than we might
appreciate, but I also think, in

487
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,380
a fundamental way, I agree with
those who have observed that the

488
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,220
age of private enlightenment is
coming to an end. It's already

489
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,480
come to an end, and it's not
like individual you know,

490
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,020
enlightenment work is not
important. It is important, but

491
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:01,860
we have entered into a time of
history where we need to draw

492
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,460
the whole human species needs to
enter into the Enlightened

493
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,380
condition. The whole human
species needs to really get at

494
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,680
the roots of what's holding us
in this tight configuration of

495
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,900
ego. Because the world, the
civilization that we are in now,

496
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,600
is a civilization built by the
ego, and the ego is ultimately a

497
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,680
cut off psychological entity. We
don't experience our common

498
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,280
ground with other beings, and we
don't experience our common

499
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,540
ground with the universe itself.
It's a fragmented condition, and

500
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,980
it builds a fragmented universe.
And right now, the fragmentation

501
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,060
of our universe is threatening
the very vitality of the lives

502
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,040
of the all life on our planet.
So I think we are moving into a

503
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,840
time where the real impetus is
collective transformation. And

504
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,580
that's a that I think is kind of
taking us into a different level

505
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,500
of the game than we were in for
the. Last 2000 years.

506
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,460
Stephen Gray: Yeah, well, put
beautifully, but yeah, my old

507
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,440
Buddhist teacher that I
mentioned earlier, chugyam,

508
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,280
Trungpa. I don't you probably
know more about this than I,

509
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:16,200
than I do as a concept, but I
think there are different uses

510
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,660
of the word term arhat. But
wait, Trungpa talked about it

511
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,960
was he, he was critical of what
he called the arhat mentality,

512
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,960
which was the enlightenment for
self kind of mentality, was the

513
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,260
way he described it. Yeah. So,
you know, I completely agree

514
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:35,600
with you. So perhaps that leads
in, for me, anyway, into this

515
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,660
discussion of the sort of great
death and great awakening that

516
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,500
you talk about in your work and
that you explored in those

517
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:48,640
journeys, and yeah, the probably
the primary motivation for me

518
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,220
doing this YouTube channel
series altogether, is because of

519
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,320
the kind of things you were just
talking about, that we've

520
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,380
reached a karma, a kind of
karmic comeuppance point where

521
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,080
the that fragmented ego
mentality has brought the planet

522
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,440
to place where it's not
sustainable to continue in this

523
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,700
direction anymore. So I'm
wondering if you could explore

524
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,040
and talk a little bit about I
know one thing that you've

525
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:19,980
mentioned in your talks is that
you weren't given a timeline on

526
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,920
this. There was no 2012
involved. But it sounds to me

527
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:30,020
like I don't know. An image I've
been using occasionally is a

528
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,980
boat coming down a river toward
a whirlpool, or you might use

529
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,880
the term vortex. And you know at
first, when the when, when the

530
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,680
boat first gets pulled into the
into the orbit, as it were, of

531
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,640
the of the vortex. It's going
around the outer edge kind of

532
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,480
slowly, but then it's gradually
getting pulled. The strength

533
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,960
becomes of the pull becomes
increasingly strong and rapid,

534
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,980
and it seems to me where we're
well into that vortex. Now, I

535
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,020
don't know, do you? Can you
comment on that?

536
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,380
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, this
was a great surprise for me in

537
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,040
my work, because when I began
this work, I was thinking that

538
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,220
this was thinking in terms of a
model of individual

539
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,300
transformation. I was doing this
work to transform and improve my

540
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,380
my private self in some way, and
that was shattered after two

541
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,780
years. The game changed. It was
it was not about that. And about

542
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,800
four years into the work, I
began to be given a series of

543
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:35,060
visions that continue to unfold
over over 50 sessions. And the

544
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,440
the theme of these visions was
always humanity's collective

545
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,800
transformation. They were
consistent in in over over time.

546
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,300
And the message was, humanity
was coming to a point of a

547
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,540
before and after point in
history, of a decisive

548
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,480
transformation, of an
evolutionary jump in the quality

549
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,680
of of consciousness that we
would be living out of and

550
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,620
through just just an exponential
a time of great blessing, a time

551
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,520
of great grace, of great
illumination, of great healing.

552
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,820
And these visions came for
years, but I was never shown in

553
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,680
these early years how nature was
going to pull this off, because

554
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,080
when I looked around me, it
didn't look like that was what

555
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,080
was happening. And it looked
like for every indicator that we

556
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,360
were getting better, there were
other indicators that we were

557
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,600
getting worse, more insanity,
more greed, more corporate

558
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:38,420
control and and then in 1995 I
was given a very, very deep

559
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:45,040
session, a series of visions,
and I was taken into the future.

560
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,600
Time became very horrible,
permeable. In my sessions, I I

561
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,740
entered into multiple modalities
of trans temporal experiences.

562
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:59,260
And in this I entered into the
deep future, and I experienced

563
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,480
what I came to understand was
the death and rebirth of our

564
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,860
entire species in some
collective historical crescendo,

565
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,020
and I experienced it not as
crisp Bache, individual self

566
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,720
looking on, and not even as a
spiritual aspect of crisp based

567
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,820
looking on. By this time, I had
dissolved so many times and so

568
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,160
deeply into the collective mind
that I experienced this crisis

569
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,600
as a ask the species. I
experienced it literally as a

570
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:39,680
rippling of crisis arising
within the collective psyche,

571
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,940
and I experience a time of
tremendous suffering, a time of

572
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:52,120
things falling apart, of loss of
control, of of human beings

573
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,800
losing more and more of the
constants of their world. It the

574
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,920
image that comes to mind is of a
hurricane that's coming over.

575
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,860
Over a small island which is
just threatening all life on the

576
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,700
island. And for a time, in my
experience, I thought we were

577
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,280
going to go extinct. I thought
we were heading into an

578
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,520
extinction event. But then at
the peak time, the storm passed,

579
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,380
and humanity began to recover,
to pick themselves up, and when

580
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,460
we began to pick ourselves up,
something extraordinary

581
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,860
happened. In the process of
going through this crisis, we

582
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:40,840
were changed. I think it's our
heart was broken open, in a way,

583
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,980
there was some kind of deep
transformation. When the pain

584
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,180
became so terrible, we we began
to make choices that we weren't

585
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,140
willing to consider making. At
an earlier time of stability, in

586
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,220
such extreme instability, we
began to make different choices.

587
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,840
And when we were past the worst
of this crisis, there was a

588
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:09,180
tremendous kind of up surging of
new values, new insights, new

589
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,280
ways of being, new ways of
organizing. And if there were

590
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,860
one fundamental theme that
emerges, it is the theme of

591
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:25,280
oneness. We had an experience
deep in our psyche of oneness

592
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:30,320
that permeates all existence,
and that's a tremendous

593
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:35,300
spiritual revitalization. And
then subsequently, in other

594
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,200
sessions, I was taken deep into
deep time and given an

595
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,500
experience of what I came to
call the future human that that

596
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,260
is this is a change which is not
going to simply precipitate a

597
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,040
political restructuring or an
economic restructuring or a

598
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,520
social restructuring. It's a
change which is going to reach

599
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,740
so deeply into the collective
psyche that it actually causes

600
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,380
an evolutionary flip of the
archetype of the blueprint, or

601
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,100
the archetypal blueprint of the
human psyche, so that there is

602
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:18,720
literally a an emerging, an
emergence of A restructured core

603
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,560
around which our individual
lives crystallize in time. I

604
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,760
came and just to touch this
future human, to go into deep

605
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,440
time and just to touch it was
such a clarifying experience. It

606
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,100
was so gratifying, because this
magnificent humanity, with its

607
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,300
heart healed of all the pain
that we've caused each other

608
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,380
through time, and that has been
caused in us by nature, a

609
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:53,140
tremendous illumination of the
human mind. It was truly an

610
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:57,880
enlightened species that was
emerging out of this process.

611
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:04,860
And this has been this, I think,
gave the larger context for my

612
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,160
entire life and my understanding
of history that we are in right

613
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,020
now. It gave a context which
helped me understand why my

614
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,620
individual enlightenment fell
away as insignificant, and that

615
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,740
my sessions went for years
aiming at collective

616
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,840
transformation and trying to
support this collective

617
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,620
transformation wherever
possible. It did not give me any

618
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,400
timeline, as you said, it did
not give me any specifics. It

619
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,240
did not tell me when, where or
how, but the certainty and the

620
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,540
magnitude of this convulsion
seemed to be driven by some kind

621
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:45,880
of global ecological crisis that
triggered a global systemic

622
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,920
crisis, crisis of global
systems, which then I began

623
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,980
after I began to have these
experiences, I began to do my

624
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,280
ecological homework. I began to
read more widely in the

625
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,540
ecological literature, to pay
attention to the people who've

626
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,920
been tracking these things, and
I think it's clear, and I give

627
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,240
the references in the book, that
we are coming to a critical time

628
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,540
in human evolution. We are on
the verge of losing the planet

629
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,920
if we don't change our ways, and
we don't seem to be changing our

630
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,200
ways nearly fast enough to avoid
a crisis of unprecedented

631
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:28,700
proportions. So I had these
experiences, oh, 1985 to 1999

632
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:35,600
you know, 20 years ago, and it
seems that these are unfolding

633
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,860
now that we are entering
increasingly a time of

634
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,680
ecological plague, in a way, a
time of great, great ecological

635
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,800
uncertainty coming at us,
devastation coming at us in

636
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,920
global climate change. In this
context, I watch covid 19, and I

637
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,680
don't see it as the true crisis
of this. Era. It seems to be too

638
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,280
small a crisis, but it's a
serious crisis, and it's a

639
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,420
crisis that, if we respond to it
well, it could teach us many

640
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,100
things that we will need when
the deeper crises emerge, which

641
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,360
are coming in the decades ahead.
And I think, I think it is

642
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,780
teaching us, I mean it. There
are those who are learning from

643
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,780
it, and then those who are just
trying to quickly get back to

644
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,100
normal as quickly as possible.
But I think, I think normal

645
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:33,260
we're going to find is farther
and farther irretrievable. We

646
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,640
now have no choice but to go
into a new future and to find

647
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,680
our way into this new future.
And I think the divine, or

648
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,400
whatever you want to call the
intelligence of the universe,

649
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,540
the creative capacity of the
universe, is pulling us that

650
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,500
way. It supports us as we
cooperate with this crisis. It's

651
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,040
taking us somewhere that it
wants us to go,

652
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,820
Stephen Gray: beautiful, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I've the, I've, I've

653
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,700
kind of had the same intuition
about the covid situation. It's

654
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,940
kind of a fantasy. I suppose you
could say in my mind that that

655
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,080
you know the gods as it were,
whatever that is, as you say,

656
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,500
the divine there. I don't know
how this functions, of course,

657
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:28,100
and how hands on they would be
with our journey. But it I could

658
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,240
almost imagine that there that
the covid situation is kind of

659
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,880
like letting us down step by
step, like, here's what can

660
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,700
happen when there's a great
disruption. And as you say, You

661
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:48,460
know what? What kinds of changes
in our individual mentalities

662
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,340
and the way that we do things
collectively might come out of

663
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,540
this? And you know, of course,
that remains to be seen. But you

664
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,080
know, I have a feeling that at
the very least, you know the

665
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,060
whole world has been quieter and
cleaner for a while. And, you

666
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,640
know, even if people, I mean, I
could be completely wrong about

667
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,000
this, but I wonder if you know
that, even if people don't

668
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,380
really consciously, kind of pay
attention to, you know, the

669
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,640
implications of that, it's, it's
gotten in under their skin on

670
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,520
some level. You know, birds are
more audible. There may be more

671
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,260
of them around, you know, the
air is cleaner. The pace of life

672
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,500
has been slower. I'm seeing so
many people riding bicycles

673
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,840
around my neighborhood, you
know, I'm hoping that more of

674
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,040
them will, you know, many of
them will continue to ride those

675
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,860
bicycles. And people are jogging
like nothing, like nobody's

676
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,480
business around my neighborhood
lately. You know, they're going

677
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,640
to come, you know, when people
get back to their quote,

678
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,980
unquote, normal life, I think a
lot of people are going to find

679
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,720
that they've come back rested,
healthier. They've probably been

680
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,660
eating more at home, cooking
more at home. It's hard to find

681
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:04,380
yeast in the stores around
making east, you know, but at

682
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:09,540
the same time, you know, the way
you describe this great death,

683
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,560
you know, trajectory sounds
pretty frightening in a sense,

684
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,840
you know. And I guess to what
comes out to my mind, comes into

685
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,300
my mind about that is that it's
increasingly becoming more and

686
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:29,900
more important for anyone who
possibly can to be a rock, as it

687
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,880
were, for others. You know,

688
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,420
Chris Bache: yeah, it is
frightening. It really is

689
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,020
frightening. And I think It's
therefore important to really

690
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,280
understand what's happening. I
mean, there are a lot of people

691
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,020
who will be calling on the
apocalyptic End of Days and all

692
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,920
sorts of interpretations.
There'll be people be talking

693
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,720
about extinction and so on so
forth. But I think what's really

694
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,200
happening is that we are in
labor. This is a birth.

695
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,720
Gestation is a long process.
It's a nine month process, but

696
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,860
labor takes place with 24 hours.
It's a very short, very intense

697
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:11,940
process in which we give birth
to something new. I think

698
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,980
humanity has been gestating the
future human for 1000s and 1000s

699
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,780
of years, but the process of
giving birth to it is really

700
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,960
convulsive. And if you walked
into a room when there was a

701
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,600
woman giving labor right in the
middle of it, and she's yelling

702
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,060
and screaming and everyone's
running around, you would think,

703
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,360
Oh, this is terrible. She's
going to die. But if you know

704
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,660
what's happening, you know that
this is labor. This is what

705
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,440
labor is like. Well, we are
going into a collective labor, I

706
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,840
believe, and therefore it's
important for us to cultivate an

707
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,160
appreciation of what this
actually consists of. We are

708
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,440
giving birth to a new form of
human being, not simply better

709
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,280
in a few little ways, dressing
up the edges, but a deep

710
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,320
reconstruction of the human
psyche. Me, and the way I've

711
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,380
come to understand this is in
terms of the concept of the

712
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,860
diamond soul, which is a
different image, but basically

713
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:13,020
it refers to other sessions that
I went through where I

714
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:17,220
experienced what seemed to be I
was given a series of teachings,

715
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,720
experiential teachings, about
where reincarnation is taking

716
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,220
us, you know, and it led me to
have an understanding of

717
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,460
reincarnation which went
considerably beyond the way it's

718
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,240
been talked about in the
traditional Eastern sources.

719
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,380
Because I think basically the
idea in traditional thinking of

720
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,580
reincarnation, we reincarnate,
we reincarnate, we reincarnate.

721
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,600
Karma follows us. We make
improvements. We get a little

722
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,060
bit better and better. We go
from third grade to fourth grade

723
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,240
to fifth grade, hopefully more
compassion, more intelligent,

724
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,920
more resourceful, incremental,
incremental change. But I think

725
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,220
what happens eventually in the
reincarnation process, we die

726
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,960
and we go into spirit, where we
reconnect with soul, the

727
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,920
consciousness that holds all of
our experience. We're born, we

728
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,120
get small, we learn, we die, we
get large. We're born, we get

729
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:13,800
small. And we keep this up for
1000s and 1000s of years, only

730
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,240
touching our soul, our total
consciousness, usually in the

731
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,580
afterlife state, in the Bardo
state. But if this keeps up, all

732
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,760
of us has been going through
this for 1000s, 1000s of years,

733
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,860
sooner or later, there comes a
point where I think all what

734
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,520
happened in my sessions, all my
former lives, started coming in,

735
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,600
and they hit critical mass, they
and when they hit critical mass,

736
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,300
there was a massive explosion of
energy, and they fused. And when

737
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,140
they fuse, an extraordinary
diamond light broke out of my

738
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:51,940
chest, and it catapulted me into
a state of consciousness beyond

739
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,480
anything I had been in up to
that point. And it was a state

740
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,740
of consciousness in which I was
an individual, but I was an

741
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,880
individual beyond any frame of
reference that I had known it

742
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,120
previously. And I think what
that's what's happening with

743
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,260
reincarnation, that there comes
a time in history when all of

744
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,920
our former lives become
integrated. In the early stages,

745
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,160
when we integrate our former
lives, we often have to deal

746
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,840
with leftover pain and problems
that have been that are still

747
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,400
reside in these former lives. So
the emphasis is on healing and

748
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,940
clarifying, but eventually, when
they when all of that work is

749
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:34,760
done and they fuse into a new
singularity, and that

750
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,960
singularity, I think, is the
birth of the soul in time, so

751
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,960
that we permanently shift our
identity from the ego of this

752
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,480
small, short term body which
lives maybe 100 years to the

753
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,580
soul which lives and thinks and
feels on a much, much larger

754
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:01,560
time horizon. I think this birth
of soul consciousness inside

755
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,780
time is taking place
simultaneously Well, as the

756
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,980
planet is trying to come to
terms with its divisive history

757
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:15,360
and is trying to deal with
problems which it cannot solve

758
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,380
at the national level, but can
only solve at the global level,

759
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,720
As we're trying to come together
as one planet. Internally, the

760
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,800
players there are trying to come
together as one soul, so that

761
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,760
there is a reciprocity between
the the outer, political,

762
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,980
ecological dynamic in the inner,
psycho spiritual dynamic, so

763
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,980
that, I think the ego is the
psychological structure that

764
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:45,580
built this world, and the ego
will never be able to solve the

765
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:49,540
problems that we have generated.
It takes the expansion of the

766
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,280
soul to really have the depth of
courage and the depth of

767
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,440
compassion and the depth of
insight to really carry us into

768
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,080
the creation of the next stage
of our planetary evolution.

769
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,700
Stephen Gray: Yeah, beautifully
put again, yeah, yeah. My, my

770
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:15,180
sense of of this passage, I
guess you could say, is that it,

771
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,960
you know, it is scary, as we
were saying that it looks like a

772
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,560
lot of things that, you know,
people have been able to, you

773
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,520
know, hold as status quo and
stability are going to be ripped

774
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,980
away from us and so on and so
on. It's going to be a really

775
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:32,240
challenging time. I guess the
hopeful, or more optimistic part

776
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,660
of my my mind, adheres to this
old saying, necessity is the

777
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,700
mother of invention, and it
feels like, as we move out of

778
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,220
it's like we've been, you know,
as, you know, living in, you

779
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,520
know, in an illusion, in a
sense, you know, in a kind of a

780
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,900
collective and individual dream
that's virtual, that's based in

781
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,480
our thoughts and our you know,
it's in our heads and all that.

782
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,240
And you know, as Terence McKenna
has, and others have. It

783
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,380
whistling past the graveyard you
know, trying to ignore the you

784
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,220
know, the reality of ego death
and the spirit that you know,

785
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:16,200
encompasses all. But as we, as
these conditions destabilize, I

786
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,900
think perhaps one of the amazing
thing that's things that's going

787
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,960
to come out of this is, you
know, because there is such a

788
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,340
deep well of creativity and
capability in the human species,

789
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,240
I think we're going to see a lot
of that coming forth. You know

790
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,740
that, oh, that's another one of
my favorite sayings from Victor

791
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,480
Hugo, something to the effect
of, there's nothing as powerful

792
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,500
as an idea whose time has come,
right? Yeah, so I think we're

793
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:52,180
going to see, you know, as as
the old ways become less viable,

794
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:57,760
people can put less faith in
them, a greater openness to new

795
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,600
ideas.

796
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,420
Chris Bache: Yes, I think we're
experiencing this profound

797
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,640
polarization taking place now.
There will be forces pulling us

798
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,960
very strongly toward the past,
towards the divisions of the

799
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,220
past, towards the certainties of
the past, towards the patterns

800
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,080
of the past. And then there will
be forces taking us into the

801
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:25,340
future, taking us into something
less certain, more unexplored,

802
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:30,980
but, but I think the the juice
is going to be with the future,

803
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,520
because with the past, if we, if
we keep allow ourselves to be

804
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,120
pulled into the past and the
patterns of consumption and

805
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:43,840
corporate control and so on
violence and, you know, placing

806
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,920
one race over another, one
religion over another, one

807
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,480
continent over another that way
ends in death. It just ends in

808
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,820
death. But a different a future,
a collaborative future, working

809
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,980
for a world that works for all,
working, working where a certain

810
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,300
portion of the population has
less, so that everybody has more

811
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,800
is going to produce a much, much
happier, better existence for

812
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,640
all of us in the end. And I
think we have the courage to

813
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,820
make it. I think you know,
things like the coronavirus are

814
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,560
basically giving us an
opportunity to flex our courage,

815
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:27,260
to flex our wisdom and to say no
when we're being told lies by

816
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:31,760
people who represent the past,
people who represent, you know,

817
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:37,520
the faded wisdom of patriarchy,
the faded the you know The

818
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:44,500
unspeakable shame of ego, and we
see it dramatized on the body

819
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,180
politic today, you know, and
that just leaves a sour taste in

820
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:53,020
our mouth. Where, when we see
courage, when we see compassion,

821
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,640
when we see wisdom, insight,
working for our collective good,

822
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,740
that we recognize and say, Yes,
I want to be like that. I want

823
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,360
to support those forces.

824
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,680
Stephen Gray: Yeah, so again,
hopefully that, you know, as

825
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,140
Leonard Cohen put it, there's a
crack in everything. That's how

826
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,100
the light gets in, that the
light will be coming in. And,

827
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,900
you know, I read some of the
channeled books that were

828
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,020
popular back in the late 80s and
early 90s. And one guy that I

829
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:27,740
kind of liked more than others
was a guy named Ken Carey. He

830
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,420
had a book, a couple of books
called star seed, Millennium and

831
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,660
things like that. And one of the
things that, assuming this was

832
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,960
actually channeled, that his,
you know, ch, his source, his

833
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,560
entity, was saying, was, these
technologies that you have, you

834
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,800
know, these communication
technologies, they're actually

835
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:52,600
pretty interesting, because you
know when, when the information

836
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,780
gets to the point where you can,
you know, be sending out that,

837
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,960
you know, the idea whose time
has come. We now have this

838
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,880
capability of sharing
information instantly around the

839
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,720
planet, pretty much, right? It's
like a we have these stepping

840
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,340
stones, in a sense, now, right?

841
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,860
Chris Bache: Yeah, and, and I
think what I'm saying and what

842
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,980
I'm describing if, if it were
just me having these

843
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,460
experiences, and then it would
be maybe not that significant.

844
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,780
But a lot of people have been
having these experiences and

845
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,140
sharing these ideas. They've
been seeing the same thing. A

846
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:32,000
lot of psychedelic voyagers have
been seeing this basic vision of

847
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,040
a time of fundamental historical
crisis and choice. Indigenous

848
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:42,580
cultures have been seeing this
vision emerging for decades in

849
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:48,820
their work, mystics like and
contemplatives, meditators who

850
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,940
would never go near
psychedelics, have been having

851
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,660
this deepening insight that this
is a time of crisis, this is a

852
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:59,560
time of where we must grow up.
And I think that's one way of

853
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,480
looking. At it. This is a time
of maturation. We have to grow

854
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,500
up and to take responsibilities
as adults. And there's a certain

855
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,440
way in which we've been living
like adolescents, with the

856
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,760
qualities of adolescents, but
now we need to grow up, and I

857
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,600
think we have that capacity, and
I really think we will. I think

858
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,140
we're going to make this
transition, even though it's

859
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:28,340
going to get difficult, I just
have confidence in I think, when

860
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:33,140
I'm really feeling deeply
uncertain and fearful, I remind

861
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:37,280
myself that the universe has
brought us this far, and I know

862
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,980
that there are end roads, there
are extinction events that are

863
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:44,920
taking place all around us, but
I trust that if, if we are

864
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,880
entering into a time of such
momentous choice and

865
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,600
consequences, that we the
universe must think that we're

866
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:57,640
ready. And I think I will. So I
place my trust in the universe's

867
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,380
wisdom, and at least in my
sessions, the universe seems to

868
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,280
clearly think that we're ready,
in that it knows what it's

869
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,400
doing, and we will be able to
participate in that, knowing

870
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,840
Stephen Gray: well this is the
reason why I'm so happy that you

871
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:18,480
are my initial or inaugurative
guest On this hopefully

872
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:24,620
developing series, because that,
you know this one, it's, it's,

873
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,940
it's central to why I have such
respect for you and your work,

874
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:32,660
Chris, is that that it's
hopeful. It points out that

875
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:35,960
there, you know who we possibly
can be, and that there was a,

876
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,140
there is a way to get there,
right? You know, there is a

877
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:43,180
little bit like the Four Noble
Truths, you know that, that

878
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:46,660
there is a way to get there. You
know, there are pathways and

879
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,660
and, you know, and as we've been
talking about here, you know,

880
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,380
people need that kind of, you
know, encouragement, that kind

881
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:57,940
of, you know, vision to be
shared. You know, as things get,

882
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,140
you know, less stable for people
that they have less to less

883
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:06,780
ground to hang on to, so I think
this is probably a good time to

884
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,260
bring it to a close. We've been
talking for close to an hour,

885
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:16,080
and I'm clear that you could
have a lot more to say on these

886
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,440
topics, so we might have to do
it again. Actually, it just

887
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,020
occurred to me at this very
moment, because you're, you're,

888
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:29,000
I'll have to say you're an easy
interview, Chris, because I just

889
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,940
need to ask one question and
articulate it so so clearly and

890
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,900
so beautifully. I really
appreciate that I'm really moved

891
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,800
in my heart to, you know, to
hear these kinds of things that

892
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,520
you have experienced and that
you're sharing with people. So

893
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,200
this being my very first one, I
don't haven't figured out how to

894
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,460
end these yet. I know sometimes
people would, you know, say

895
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:58,000
goodbye to the guest and then
talk to the talk to the the

896
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,900
viewers a little bit, but I
think I'll just do that while

897
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,340
you're still here, if you don't
mind.

898
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,240
Chris Bache: So so before you do
that, and that's fine to do, but

899
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,140
first I want to thank you for
your initiative, because you've

900
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:13,260
been drawing people together in
the conferences that you've been

901
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,860
organizing for years now, and
your commitment to our

902
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,900
collective transformation has
been profound, and this

903
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:25,640
continues in this series, your
your your vision is for

904
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:29,360
collective awakening. And I just
honor that, and just want to

905
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,200
thank you for it.

906
01:03:30,379 --> 01:03:32,059
Stephen Gray: Well, thanks so
much for saying that. And yeah,

907
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:36,019
that is the reason, you know, I
just feel really connected to

908
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:39,019
that vision. And you know, I
another one of my favorite

909
01:03:39,019 --> 01:03:43,359
sayings is from Bishop Desmond
Tutu, the legendary South

910
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:47,019
African Bishop. And I don't,
don't remember the full

911
01:03:47,019 --> 01:03:49,899
sentence, but it was something
to the effect that a lot of

912
01:03:49,899 --> 01:03:53,379
people don't believe in the
possibility of possibility, and

913
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:55,359
that that's what we need, is you
have to believe in the

914
01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:02,339
possibility of possibility. And
to my mind, you know the the ego

915
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:05,279
and whatever it is, can cook up
all kinds of stories about

916
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:09,179
what's going on, but there's
only one attitude that's

917
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,939
functional, and that is to
believe in the possibility of

918
01:04:11,939 --> 01:04:16,679
possibility and do what you need
to do your own healing work and

919
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:19,019
participating whatever You can
do.

920
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,360
Unknown: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I
think so, yeah.

921
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,300
Stephen Gray: So it's a
wonderful vision. It's a

922
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:30,860
wonderful prayer. And excuse me,
do you want to say anything? Is

923
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:33,860
there can people contact you? Or
is there anything to say about

924
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,280
that?

925
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,060
Chris Bache: Well, actually, I'm
embarrassed that I haven't

926
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:43,000
gotten my website finished yet.
I hopefully it will be up in a

927
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:48,520
month or so. It will be Chris
bache.com will be where people

928
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,240
will be able to find me online
right now. They can find me if

929
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,080
they go to my articles and
publications, if they go to

930
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:01,680
academia.edu and sign in. There,
they'll be able to find me under

931
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,000
Chris M Bache and everything
I've written, and many of the

932
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,200
podcasts are there, but Chris
bache.com soon will be where

933
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,500
people can reach me, and they
can also reach me at my

934
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:20,040
university website. My address,
C, M Bache, at y, s, u.edu

935
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,900
Stephen Gray: I should be able
to put little tabs up on the

936
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,720
screen at some point. Yeah, show
those for people, and in the

937
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,380
meantime, just so they know.
Well, I think maybe it's showing

938
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,320
on the screen. It does on mine
when I'm speaking and when

939
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:40,420
you're speaking. But it's
spelled B, A, ch, E, yes. It's

940
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:43,600
not necessarily an intuitive
spelling and pronunciation

941
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,280
match. Yeah, yeah. So again, the
book that we're talking about

942
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,700
more than any you know, he's got
other works, as I mentioned at

943
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:55,900
the beginning, is this one. It's
it's incredible. It's really

944
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,660
remarkable. And there's so much
more in this book that we didn't

945
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:02,460
cover today. So I hope people
will go and find this book. It's

946
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:07,140
going to be, it already is and
will continue to be part of this

947
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:13,740
kind of transformation that
we're talking about. So yeah, I

948
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,020
guess Thank

949
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,060
Chris Bache: you, Steven,
really. Thank you very much.

950
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,900
Thank you for the conversation.
Thank you for the opportunity to

951
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,480
bring these ideas forward to
your listeners,

952
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,980
Stephen Gray: and you do it so
well, Chris, really, you know, I

953
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:31,280
know you're humble about it, but
you know, I could listen to you

954
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,400
all day. You really have the you
know you're in you're doing the

955
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,880
right job. You know you've you
found your job, I think because

956
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,600
you explain it so, so clearly.
So again. Thank you very much.

957
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,720
And I'll just say, while you're
still here, because I haven't

958
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,240
like I say, I haven't figured
out quite you know, how I want

959
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,140
to end these things, I'll just
say that I'm hoping to be able

960
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:56,140
to put a little subscribe button
up on here, and I hope people

961
01:06:56,140 --> 01:07:00,040
will subscribe to this YouTube
channel and share it and so on.

962
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:04,260
And it'll also be on Anchor,
which is an audio podcast, I

963
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:07,020
hope. Well, once I figure it
out, we'll strip the audio off

964
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:12,060
of the video and put it on
Anchor as well. So again, much,

965
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,640
much. Thanks. From the Heart,
Chris, take care.

966
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,120
Chris Bache: Bye, bye, my
friend. You. You.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:35,840
Chris Bache: You I want to thank
Swamiji for taking us into such

2
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,860
a wonderful, spacious place. It
was a little disorienting for

3
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,200
me, because I went so deep with
him that when he was finishing,

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,660
I suddenly realized, oh, I have
a talk to give. I also would

5
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:55,000
like to mention that the
cosmology that emerges in

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,360
psychedelic research is not a
new cosmology. It's the same

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,320
cosmology that has been
discovered and emerges in the

8
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,060
deepest and the best mystical
traditions around the world, we

9
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,720
are simply looking at a new set
of technology, a new set of

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,740
techniques for entering into
these states of consciousness.

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,220
It's a pleasure to be with the
time waiver community. Again,

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,840
when I was with you last year, I
spoke to you about a book I was

13
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,300
writing called diamonds from
heaven. This book has now been

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,140
finished, and it will be
released this coming November.

15
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:45,100
The publisher has given it a new
title. But oh, here it is,

16
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,900
calling it LSD in the mind of
the universe. It's not my

17
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,680
favorite title. It will always
be diamonds from heaven. For me,

18
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:01,740
the revolution begins with the
question, what is it possible

19
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,200
for human beings to experience?
The work in the global

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,260
consciousness project is pushing
the edges of what is it possible

21
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,260
for human beings to experience?
Parapsychological research

22
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,280
pushes that question.
Psychedelic research pushes that

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,580
question, what is it possible
for human beings to experience

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,120
the experience. The forward to
this book was written by urban

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,820
lasso, who I'm so pleased, is
going to be with us this

26
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:39,440
afternoon, by by television. It
is Urban's work to provide

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,940
through his mastery of multiple
scientific disciplines to

28
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,540
demonstrate that there is a
super implicate, super coherent

29
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,720
cosmic intelligence that informs
time and space. It's my

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,800
experience and my contention
that psychedelics, when they are

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,480
used in a discipline and
therapeutically structured

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,180
environment, they give us the
opportunity to enter into a

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,260
progressively deepening
experience, a deepening

34
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,800
communion with this cosmic
intelligence.

35
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,800
Now, as you all know here, there
is a revolution, a renaissance

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:33,440
in psychedelic research taking
place across the world. Most

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,540
psychedelic research today is
taking place in two forms, or is

38
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,800
focused in two projects. One of
them is mapping the neurology

39
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,940
and the biochemical pathways
that psychedelics activate, and

40
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,980
the second is healing the
personal psyche, the wounds that

41
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,220
we collect in life, post
traumatic stress, depression, a

42
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,980
variety of different conditions.
I think these are important

43
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,960
first steps in reclaiming these
valuable substances, but these

44
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,400
are only the first steps,
historically and cross

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,720
culturally. Our experience with
these mind opening substances

46
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,760
has been that healing the
personal unconscious is only the

47
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,060
first stage of a much longer
journey. The psychedelic acts,

48
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,860
the psychedelic agents we have
access to today are so powerful

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,680
that I believe they mark a new
frontier in human experience. We

50
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,320
can shatter the shell of the
earth bound mind so consistently

51
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,780
that it becomes hard to describe
the depths of cosmic communion

52
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,840
that follow by taking our life
to its limits and repeatedly

53
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,840
shattering those limits we
dissolve for hours. At a time,

54
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,840
into flows of life that
transcend all measures. By

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,060
entering these states with focus
and clear intent, by submitting

56
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,180
to the harsh demands of death
and rebirth, we surrender all we

57
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,080
have been to become something
utterly new for six or eight

58
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,980
hours at a time, a being who can
do things we could never do, a

59
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,860
being who can know things that
we can never know. As we enter

60
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,700
larger and older levels of
existence, the universe receives

61
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,760
us and tutors us. It rewards our
courage with exquisite

62
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,880
intimacies, drawing us into
almost unspeakable ecstasies of

63
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,980
discovery. Now, my own
psychedelic journey began 40

64
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,180
years when I was a brand new
academic, fresh out of graduate

65
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,520
school, and I met the work of
Stanislav Grof, and I read these

66
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,720
two early books by him, realms
of the human unconscious, which

67
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,380
was published in 1976 and for
me, I'm reading this in 1979 and

68
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,520
then quickly followed by LSD
psychotherapy, where he sets out

69
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,900
the methodology of working
clinically, therapeutically and

70
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,600
in a very disciplined,
structured manner with

71
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,060
psychedelics and integrating
them into the therapeutic

72
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,020
process. I want to emphasize
that what I'm describing today

73
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,920
is not tripping. It's not the
recreational use of

74
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,860
psychedelics. It's not the
careless engaging of these

75
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,660
states of consciousness. These
are amplifiers of consciousness,

76
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,800
and when we contain that
amplified consciousness, when we

77
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,420
take it into a meditational
situation, when we take it into

78
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,100
a Kiva, completely isolated from
the outside world, and use this

79
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,160
energy to drive deeper and
deeper and deeper into

80
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,660
consciousness. That's what I'm
talking about. That's what Stan

81
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,280
grofs work is exploring. So
first, let me say a few words

82
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,620
about the protocol that I used,
and then describe where this

83
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,340
journey that I'm telling the
story of in LSD, in the mind of

84
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:31,520
the universe, where it went.
Most of you who know Stan grofs

85
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,700
work, and I have to assume a
certain familiarity here, most

86
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,840
of you who know Stan grofs Work
know that the fundamental

87
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,280
distinction he drew in their
methodology was low dose

88
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,180
psycholytic therapy and high
dose psychedelic therapy.

89
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,660
Psychedelic therapy was
basically working with lower

90
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,920
doses of psychedelics, maybe up
to between 40 and 100 sessions

91
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,300
where you peel the unconscious
layer by layer stripping down

92
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,280
the various levels of trauma or
angst or our pains that we carry

93
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,560
bit by bit. In Spring Grove
Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland,

94
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,020
they developed a different form
of therapy, high dose

95
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,080
psychedelic therapy. But the
strategy was quite different

96
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,440
there. The strategy was to take
an overwhelming dose, a very

97
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,780
high level dose of psychedelics,
about 500 micrograms, and blow

98
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,960
through all the levels of
consciousness and try to trigger

99
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,500
a Near-Death Experience. They
were working with patients who

100
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,160
were going to die, terminally
cancer, terminally ill cancer

101
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,820
patients, and they wanted to see
if they could trigger a

102
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,020
confrontation with the universe
that would give them a glimpse

103
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,820
of where they were going, and so
reduced the anxiety of death,

104
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,380
and they succeeded in doing so.
Now I came along and I thought,

105
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,400
well, if you could use
psychedelics in this manner

106
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,060
safely three times, and their
protocol was limited to a

107
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,980
maximum of three doses per
patient, if you could do this

108
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,420
work safely three times, then
you could do it safely more than

109
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:13,020
three times. And that's what I
set out to do. I began a quiet,

110
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,880
covert because I couldn't do
this work legally. I had to kind

111
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,980
of create a barrier between my
professional life as a professor

112
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,000
of religious studies in my
personal life, where I began the

113
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,220
systematic work of exploring my
own consciousness using Stan

114
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,200
Grof protocols in psychedelic
therapy, it ended up being 73

115
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,400
high dose sessions I worked at
500 to 600 micrograms spread

116
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,860
over 20 years. I did four years
of work. I stopped for six years

117
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,760
for reasons that I explained in
the book, and then I did another

118
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,540
10 years of very intense work. I
did this all between the time

119
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,360
when I was 30 years old and 50
years old. I stopped in 19. 99

120
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,180
and it's taken me this long to
digest everything that I had

121
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,080
experienced, to put it in an
organized fashion and to

122
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,800
basically write it down in a way
that I could share it with other

123
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,180
people. And it's not that what's
not important is that I

124
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,800
experience these things. What's
important is that these levels

125
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,160
of consciousness are available
for everyone to experience,

126
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,280
whether through psychedelics or
through non psychedelics,

127
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:36,560
because it's the nature of the
universe itself. I want to

128
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,140
emphasize that I'm not a
psychologist and I'm not a

129
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,340
therapist. I didn't go into this
work seeking healing. Though I

130
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,000
received much healing. I am a
philosopher. I was trained as a

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,320
philosopher, and I had a
philosophical agenda, and in

132
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,460
this I traced this work back to
William James in his Varieties

133
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,940
of Religious Experience, where
he talks about his experiences

134
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,440
with nitrous oxide and the
essence of this new

135
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,760
philosophical modality is this
first three steps, first, to

136
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,160
push the boundaries of
consciousness as hard as

137
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,800
possible, or to push the
boundaries of consciousness.

138
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,540
Second, to write a detailed and
complete, phenomenologically

139
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:22,400
accurate report of your
experience within 24 hours, and

140
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,480
third, critically analyze your
experience, comparing it to

141
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,900
other form, other bodies of
knowledge, and comparing it to

142
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,120
the experiences of other
journeyers.

143
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,760
So a few words on the
methodology. Oh, I try them

144
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,780
there. But I stopped when I got
to the end of my 73 journeys and

145
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,420
was beginning to write it up. In
the beginning, I thought I was

146
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,300
really just doing an extended
course of psychedelic therapy.

147
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,740
It was just psychedelic therapy.
Nothing new. When I got to the

148
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,820
end, and I was looking back over
the course of where I went over

149
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,360
those 20 years, I realized that
this was something different.

150
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,480
When you enter into this state
so many times in a controlled

151
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,140
fashion, it opens up
opportunities that were not

152
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,800
considered in the early years of
psychedelic therapy, and it also

153
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,420
represents challenges that were
not encountered in the early

154
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,680
years of psychedelic therapy, I
recognize that it needed a new

155
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,160
name. It needed something to
differentiate it, and so the

156
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,620
name I gave it is psychedelic
exploration. The method is

157
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,080
psychedelic therapy. Very
controlled circumstances. Always

158
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,100
working with a sitter, always
working in contained and private

159
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,480
environment, eye shades,
earphones, listening to a very

160
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,040
carefully curated musical list.
The difference between

161
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,880
psychedelic therapy and
psychedelic exploration is the

162
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:04,620
number of sessions. For me, 73
sessions. Now I want to add that

163
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,780
this is not a protocol that I
recommend. Honestly, I do not.

164
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,900
At the time, I thought I could
do this work safely, and I did

165
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,200
do it safely. I always stayed
within the limits of safety, but

166
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,440
I found that pushing yourself
that hard, that deeply into the

167
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,060
universe, generated
complications that it took all

168
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:35,840
of my resources to manage in the
course of this time. If I were

169
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,500
doing this work over again, I
would be much gentler on myself.

170
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,880
I would balance high dose
sessions with low dose sessions.

171
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,380
And because LSD tends to be a
high altitude psychedelic, I

172
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,760
would balance working with LSD
with working with Psilocybin and

173
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,260
Ayahuasca, which are more body
grounded psychedelics, I think a

174
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:04,140
more nuanced approach would
produce better results. Now, I

175
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,500
did this work as systematically
as I could. I had very, very

176
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,120
detailed records. Came out with
about 400 pages of my

177
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,620
psychedelic journal. I kept
track of all the dates of course

178
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,020
of my sessions. I even looked at
the astral, logical variables

179
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,580
when I began to understand from
Stan and from Rick Tarnas Their

180
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,240
proposal that there is a
correlation between the outer

181
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,640
planets and what happens in
one's psychedelic sessions. And

182
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,720
I should mention that my
protocol was highly

183
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,060
standardized, which allowed me
to minimize as many variables as

184
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,800
possible. I always had the same
sitter, who was a clinical

185
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,160
psychologist, whom I happened to
be married to at the time, was

186
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,340
very handy. The same set and
setting, the same location, the

187
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,020
same substance, the same dose
level. Ago, and the same

188
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,680
recording process, and I think
the stability of all those

189
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,920
variables keeping them constant,
it contributed to the clarity

190
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,460
and the stability of the
communion that opened and the

191
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:20,360
psychedelic window that opened
in this work. Now I want to

192
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,560
mention that the story in
diamonds from heaven, I always

193
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,100
to me, it's diamonds from
heaven. The story that opened is

194
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,060
not primarily a personal story.
I did not I'm not trying to tell

195
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,580
a personal story. In fact, I
dropped out a lot of the

196
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,460
personal details. It's a
personal story, of course,

197
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,140
because it's my experience. But
it's not primarily a personal

198
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,040
story. These ways represent a
series of psychedelic sessions,

199
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,540
which I've drawn overlapping to
illustrate the point that these

200
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,840
sessions are systematically
there is a conversation that

201
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,400
picks up and continues session
by session. The small circles at

202
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,980
the beginning and endings of the
of the session represent the

203
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,420
openings and closing of a
sessions, I found that things

204
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,840
that were relevant to my
personal life tended to occur

205
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,020
when I was leaving time and
space and when I was coming back

206
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,100
into time and space, but during
the peak hours of a session,

207
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,860
after the first 12 or 15
sessions, during the peak hours

208
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,220
of a session, I was usually
operating far beyond personal

209
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,060
reality, and that's the story
which is the most important

210
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,960
story, that's the story which is
the philosophically more

211
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,120
interesting story, that's the
cosmological story. So this

212
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,040
story is not a therapeutic
story. Therapeutic story, the

213
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,460
personal details are very
important in a cosmological

214
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:52,720
story, they're less important
when one does this work, one

215
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,420
enters into a regimen in which
one undergoes many deaths and

216
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,900
many rebirths, the first death.
This line in this image.

217
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,440
Everything below the line is
time, space, reality. The drop

218
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,280
at the end of this line, at this
blue image, represents our

219
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,260
individual time, space identity,
our egoic identity. The first

220
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,320
circle represents the
Death-Rebirth that takes place

221
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,820
when we transition into
spiritual reality, ego death,

222
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,660
which is gets a lot of attention
in the psychedelic literature,

223
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,500
but it's getting less attention.
So far, are the deeper deaths

224
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,940
that take place at deeper levels
of existence. Now, Stan Grof

225
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,500
uses the vocabulary of psychic
level Transpersonal experience,

226
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,180
subtle level Transpersonal
experience, causal level

227
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,380
experience. And ask because the
universe tends to reveal itself

228
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,520
in layers. One goes through
deaths when one moves into these

229
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,600
deeper layers. Every time one
goes into a deeper level of

230
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,540
consciousness, everything that
one has known up until that

231
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,680
time, including your psychedelic
experiences, everything you know

232
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,940
to be true, including those
psychedelic experiences, must be

233
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,800
surrendered if a truly new and
novel dimension of existence is

234
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,780
going to open. When I was
evaluating all of my

235
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,620
experiences, one of the
questions I asked myself, was

236
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,180
okay, there were many, many
deaths, but how many fundamental

237
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:35,840
core Death-Rebirth transitions
did I go through? Oh, back up

238
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,040
one circle to describe a
transition into a level of

239
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,600
reality is an
oversimplification. One goes

240
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,720
through levels within levels
within levels. These numbers

241
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,800
represent session numbers. And
there is kind of an iteration, a

242
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,340
repeating going deeper and
deeper and deeper into this

243
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,280
level of reality. But I asked,
how many times? How many core

244
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,680
deaths, Death-Rebirth cycles
that I go through, and I

245
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,440
identified five, and here they
are. The first is the death of

246
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,760
self, the complete shattering of
your time, space, identity,

247
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,060
letting go of everything you
have known yourself to be from

248
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,920
the moment you're born until
that moment in time ego death.

249
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,600
The second was entering into or
took place at the level of the

250
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,600
collective mind, the collective
psyche. The third was entering

251
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,180
into archetypal mind, kind of
the domain described by Carl

252
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:45,520
Jung and Plato, but different
than either of them portray it,

253
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,400
the third fourth, entering into
causal oneness. Now, oneness is

254
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,340
a theme which emerges much
earlier in the journey, but

255
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,820
causal oneness is something
quite distinctive. There is no

256
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,200
outer boundary at the level of
call. So one. Is, it is the

257
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,460
totality of existence. You
cannot step outside this reality

258
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,760
to get a perspective on it. It
is the totality of existence

259
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,060
moving and living as one. And
the fifth level for me is the

260
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,240
diamond Luminosity, what I call
the domain of diamond

261
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,460
Luminosity, which occupied me
for the last five years of my

262
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,920
journey. Now, what I'd like to
do now is shift to the book and

263
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,760
simply take you through or show
you the relationship between

264
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,500
these stages and the chapters of
the book. The easiest way to do

265
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,000
this is just do it, maybe
something like this, to the

266
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,700
death of self. There is the
chapter crossing the boundary of

267
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,760
birth and death. There's a
methodology chapter, first

268
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,060
explaining the methodology and
the protocol, but then crossing

269
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:58,120
the boundary of birth and death,
exploring collective mind. There

270
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,240
are three chapters that address
this. The first has to do with

271
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,660
the ocean of suffering. The
second is deep time in the soul,

272
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,160
or the fifth chapter deep time
in the soul. And the six is

273
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,820
initiation into the universe.
I'm going to come back so I'm

274
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,780
just going to push through here.
Archetypal mind. There is a

275
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:30,800
chapter called The Greater real
of archetypal reality, causal

276
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,460
oneness. There is a chapter that
I call a benediction of

277
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,240
blessings.

278
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,460
Diamond Luminosity is discussed
in Chapter 10, which is the

279
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,900
largest number of sessions in
the book, 26 sessions, almost a

280
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,160
third of the entire journey. But
before I talk about diamond

281
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,820
Luminosity, I talk about the
birth of the future human, which

282
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,360
I have to drop back. And this is
a series of experiences that

283
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,380
actually began during the
initiation of the universe and

284
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,660
continued into the diamond
Luminosity work. And at the end,

285
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,240
after everything was said and
done, when I was in the last

286
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,500
year of this work, a final
vision, which was the capstone

287
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,800
of the birth of the future human
work. So it's impossible to do

288
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,260
more than just touch on a few
themes, a few descriptors of

289
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,920
these chapters to give a sense
of the trajectory of the work.

290
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,720
So first, let's do that, and
then let's move this over.

291
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,860
Crossing the boundary of birth
and death is the easiest to

292
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,580
summarize, because it's the one
that's very thoroughly described

293
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,080
in Stanislav Grof work. It's the
perinatal level of consciousness

294
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,720
entering and transitioning
through the perinatal level.

295
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,860
When one enters this work, one
becomes many people relive their

296
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:05,580
own birth. One has many profound
encounters with death, death and

297
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,940
dying. We get here by being
born. We leave the physical

298
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,300
world by dying. When one is
pushing the boundaries and

299
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,060
taking consciousness beyond the
limits of physical

300
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,560
consciousness, birth and death
get all complexly intertwined

301
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,860
until one goes through a series
of profound existential crises,

302
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,060
confronting the meaninglessness
of existence, the futility of

303
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,560
life, understood as a physical
purely a physical structure,

304
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,280
until eventually, one goes
through an event that usually is

305
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,860
described as ego death in The
ninth and 10th sessions. This

306
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,100
took me two years and 10
sessions to navigate this

307
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,060
process. In the end, the
universe just snapped me like a

308
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,660
twig. It everything I knew
myself to do to be at the

309
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,420
beginning of the day was
completely reversed and

310
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,500
inverted. I began the day as a
white male middle class

311
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,200
philosopher obsessed with the
meaning of life. In the course

312
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,260
of the session, for hours, I was
immersed in the experience of

313
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,660
women, women of color, women who
were poor, women who had no

314
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,160
interest whatsoever in
philosophical exploration. And

315
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,660
that's what I was. That's what I
became. It was a frightening

316
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,100
experience scared me to death,
but when I let go and when I

317
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,180
allowed myself to become fully a
woman, then everything pivoted

318
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,260
and I was taken into the world
of women. I experienced hundreds

319
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,860
and hundreds of women. I
experienced many dimensions of

320
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,560
female experience under the arm
of the great mother. I wish

321
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,980
every man could have the
experience that I had that day.

322
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,880
It truly was a broadening
experience. And the message was

323
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,960
not reclaim your femininity or
reclaim your former lives as

324
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,920
women, because I know I've had
former lives as women. The

325
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,400
message was where you are going.
Gen. Gender does not exist. Let

326
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,820
go.

327
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,580
Excuse me. I

328
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,100
where things went next. When I
went through ego death, and I

329
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,920
was expecting things to get
lighter. I mean, after ego

330
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,820
death, things are supposed to
get lighter, where things went

331
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,920
actually got much worse. I
entered a domain of

332
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,700
extraordinary suffering,
collective suffering, a domain

333
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:52,180
of just unbelievable pain and
unbelievable anger and violence,

334
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,980
and it this took place over two
years, and it deepened

335
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,840
systematically, systematically
deepening and deepening,

336
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,400
deepening, until eventually I
had the experience of being,

337
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,400
becoming, in some fundamental
way, all of the human beings of

338
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,840
our entire species, and
gathering experiences that

339
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,820
extended over 100,000 years,
just a massive you.

340
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,920
At first, I thought

341
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,720
this was a deepening of ego
death, that somehow pieces of my

342
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,200
ego had slipped through the
noose, and there was I was

343
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,740
dying. It was my personal death
and personal transformation that

344
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,840
was driving these processes. But
it went on for so long, and it

345
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,280
took so many, there were so many
beings involved, that eventually

346
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,980
I came to a different
conclusion. The conclusion I

347
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,500
came to was that somehow
something had shifted in my

348
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,700
sessions, and the universe was
using my sessions to bring a

349
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,780
kind of healing to some portion
of the collective psyche. With

350
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:10,740
urban Laszlo, I agree that there
is an Akashic memory that holds

351
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,100
the memory of everything that's
happened in the universe and in

352
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,660
the collective unconscious of
our species. We hold the entire

353
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:24,440
history of our species. We hold
all the wars. We hold the memory

354
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,040
of all the terrible things that
we've done to each other. And

355
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,640
just as our personal trauma
burdens our personal life and

356
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,380
must be cleansed if our personal
life is to be free, likewise,

357
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,160
our species holds these wounds,
and these wounds, these these

358
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,480
trauma must be cleansed if our
species is going to function at

359
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,320
a higher level. So I came to
understand by the end of this

360
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,420
process that something was
working to transform, not me,

361
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,800
but through me, to to transform
some aspect of the human species

362
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,320
and help us move forward. Now,
there are two phases of a

363
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,620
session in working like this.
There's a purification phase,

364
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,760
and then there's an ecstatic
phase in the purification or

365
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,860
suffering phase, if you allow
it, if you take it as let it

366
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,800
take you as far as it wants to
take you. If you let it take you

367
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,380
wherever it wants to go, even
though you may not understand

368
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,860
anything about what's happening,
it will eventually culminate,

369
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,760
come to a crescendo, and it'll
you'll go through a kind of a

370
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,920
death and surrender process, and
when you go through that, you

371
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,000
wake up into a completely
different reality, completely

372
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,080
unexpected reality, and for the
remainder of the session, you're

373
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,400
in an ecstatic state of
consciousness, and then when you

374
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,700
resume the next session, three
or four months later, the same

375
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,360
process will repeat itself when
I came through the ocean of

376
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,940
suffering. Let me back up, just
like I did, the ocean of

377
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,900
suffering, I said, lasted two
years. There was a year of work,

378
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,800
and then I stopped my work for
six years, and then I resumed my

379
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,900
work on the other side in the
first year when I was going

380
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,800
through the ocean of suffering,
when I came through the

381
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,100
sessions, I entered this
territory that I call deep time

382
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,240
in the soul. I entered
systematically for seven

383
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,660
sessions over the course of the
year, I entered into a state of

384
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,020
consciousness in which I
experienced the totality of my

385
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,028
life start to finish as a
completed whole. All the details

386
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:44,328
of my life were suddenly
present. I was in the state that

387
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:48,108
just totally overwhelmed me and
systematically gave me an

388
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:52,428
instruction on what my life was
about, how it was connected to

389
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:57,348
the lives of the people around
me. This was the deepest, most

390
00:29:57,348 --> 00:30:01,860
moving experience of my life at
the time in. And yet, at the in

391
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,920
the first time, when I came back
from that experience, I could

392
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,240
not remember it. It disappeared.
I had no reference points in my

393
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,900
time space consciousness to
enter states of to anchor.

394
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,980
States of consciousness would
shatter Time, space or linear

395
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,040
time. But what I found was that
when I went back to this

396
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,280
condition in that state of
consciousness, a second, third

397
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,000
and fourth time, I remembered
more. I was able to hold on to

398
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,780
more. I get more coherent, a
clear understanding of what was

399
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,460
taking place. You can learn how
to stay conscious in levels of

400
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,980
consciousness that you were not
able to stay conscious in

401
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,880
before. And this is an
epistemological and important

402
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,900
epistemological state. Deep
experiences of the universe are

403
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,340
not simply given to you. First,
you have to get to that level of

404
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,240
reality to have these
experiences, but then you have

405
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,920
to train yourself. You have to
be taught by the universe how to

406
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,420
stay conscious in levels of
consciousness that previously

407
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,780
would not be able to stay
conscious in. It takes a great

408
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,500
deal of discipline and training,
and the universe will train you

409
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,300
to have accurate recall of
levels of consciousness that

410
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,520
were previously completely novel
to you in

411
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,020
so after the six year break that
I took, and I began the work

412
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,680
again, the ocean of
consciousness began exactly

413
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,940
where it had stopped six years
before, and it kept getting

414
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,380
worse and worse and worse. The
fact that it started exactly

415
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,120
where it had stopped before, I
think says something about the

416
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,720
intentionality and the and the
the magnitude of the

417
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,160
intelligence that is guiding
one's work. I always felt myself

418
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,820
to be in communion with an
intelligence. This intelligence

419
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,900
never took any form. I never saw
any images that I would

420
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,740
associate with it. There were no
deities or no forms of anything

421
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,900
like that, but I always felt
myself in dialog with a super

422
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:16,140
ordinate intelligence. When I
began the work after the six

423
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,300
year break, the ecstatic portion
of the session shifted into a

424
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,460
completely different domain. I
entered into a process in which

425
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,840
I was given a systematic course
of instruction in the structure

426
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,500
of reality at a cosmological
level. I know this sounds

427
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,140
terribly arrogant, and I
apologize for that, but that's

428
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,380
simply what happened. Here are
the names of the sessions that I

429
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,980
use, that I that I gave these
sessions and I deal with in the

430
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,240
book. For me, I give all of my
sessions a name. I try to

431
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,840
identify the pith of what
happens in the session, and I

432
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,320
give it a name, so that when I
see the name, it reminds me of

433
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,360
the session, because I'm trying
to hold all of my journey in my

434
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,600
mind. All at the same time, I
not only record my sessions, I

435
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,900
break them down into bullet
points. These are the names of

436
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,560
the sessions that I'm addressing
in the chapter of the initiation

437
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,560
in the universe. Some of these I
discuss in my book, dark night,

438
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:24,800
early dawn. The Master Plan was
a series of experiences that

439
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,120
took place, which began and
this, this continued for years,

440
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:36,560
a series of experiences in which
I seem to be being taught what

441
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,980
was happening to the human race
and where the human race was

442
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,660
going. What is the larger
developmental trajectory of

443
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,080
humanity? Once again, I
apologize for the apparent

444
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,040
arrogance of that. It sounds
like ego run amok, but

445
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,560
eventually, the ocean of
suffering culminated in the 24th

446
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,960
century, 24th session, which I
call healing the collective

447
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,240
wound, just an orgy of
suffering, which eventually,

448
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,960
when it came to a head and it it
climaxed, it spun me into a

449
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,340
level of reality that was
ancient beyond reckoning. It

450
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,500
spun me into archetypal reality,
and the collective suffering

451
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,680
never reappeared in any
subsequent session,

452
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,660
where I went next was into the
greater real of archetypal

453
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:43,360
reality. I entered a reality
that was more real than physical

454
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,120
reality. It was like Plato's in
Plato's cave, where the fellow

455
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,740
gets out of Plato caves, Plato's
the cave and enters a world

456
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,060
which is more real than physical
reality, which is a very

457
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,280
disorienting experience.
Initially and when I entered

458
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,280
this reality, when I entered
archetypal reality for the next

459
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,120
year and a half, I stayed in
this reality over in my

460
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,200
sessions, I went through a death
that was deeper than ego death.

461
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,960
I went through a death in which
I had to cease to be a human

462
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,940
being in any way, shape or form,
my consciousness could no longer

463
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,140
operate within the confines of
even our collective psyche. I

464
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,440
entered a state of awareness
which was beyond the collective

465
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,820
psyche, and it at that level I
was being worked with to be

466
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:43,000
taught how reality functions. At
this level, the experiences, the

467
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:50,320
sessions that I address in this
chapter are listed here. My

468
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,200
experiences here are sort of
divided into two levels. There

469
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,520
was kind of the high, subtle
level, the Platonic level in

470
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,920
which I encountered archetypal
forms, archetypal beings that

471
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,180
were just vast. They were
impossible for my mind to wrap

472
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:12,360
itself around. I imaged them as
galaxies. They were billions and

473
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,780
billions of light years across,
just impossible to imagine

474
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,500
beings of such magnitude. But
these are beings who are the

475
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,660
beings who are responsible for
creating time and space itself,

476
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,780
beings who are responsible for
creating and governing the

477
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:32,900
emergence of life inside time
and space at a lower level, at a

478
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,560
lower subtle level, I entered
deep into the collective psyche,

479
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,220
and I repeatedly had the
experience of the human species

480
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,100
as a single organism, and that
all of our individual minds were

481
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,900
fractal aspects of its
comprehensive mind, and even our

482
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:56,020
bodies were cells within the
unified body of humanity. And

483
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,280
that as we heal our minds and as
we heal our bodies, we actually

484
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,220
contribute to the developmental
history and the strengthening of

485
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:14,400
the mind of our species and even
the body of our species. When I

486
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,620
went into archetypal reality,
the deaths that I went through

487
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:29,000
involved enormous energy, fire
volcanoes, sun flares, just

488
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:34,220
excruciatingly difficult
experiences of being burned

489
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:40,180
alive and consumed at this deep
level. And this, I mention this

490
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,500
because this is an important
point. What I learned was that

491
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,160
as you go deeper into the
universe, every deeper level of

492
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,600
reality functions at a higher
level of energy. This is well

493
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,700
recognized in the deep mystical
traditions. A deeper level of

494
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,500
consciousness is a higher level
of energy. And if you are going

495
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,400
to have stable experience at
that deeper level of

496
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,020
consciousness, you must
stabilize your consciousness at

497
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,020
that higher level of energy. If
you're mountain climbing, you

498
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,820
have to stabilize dealing with
less and less oxygen, and you do

499
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,080
that gradually in your ascent.
But if you're working in deep,

500
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,780
Non-ordinary states of
consciousness, you must

501
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,140
stabilize and accommodate to
greater and greater levels of

502
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,820
energy, and you must learn how
to manage those that level of

503
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,400
energy. Otherwise, your
experiences there will be

504
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,480
fragmented, incoherent, and you
will not be able to bring back

505
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:45,640
much of great detail. Well, I
began to have experiences here

506
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,900
of reincarnation as a collective
phenomenon. Now, I had,

507
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,260
previously, I've written a book
on reincarnation, and the story

508
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,980
I tell there is that
reincarnation is kind of a I

509
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,480
thought of it as an individual
soul story, that that's the

510
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,720
story that's given in our
spiritual traditions, that we

511
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,620
are learning. Hopefully we're
making progress. We die, we're

512
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,480
reborn. We die reborn, and our
individual choices lead to,

513
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,580
hopefully, an improving destiny
as our soul matures. But now I

514
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,740
began to have experiences of the
entire planet as a single

515
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:27,740
organism, growing itself,
maturing itself through the

516
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,860
pulsating rhythm of its entire
population, reincarnating

517
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,200
century after century, and I
began to understand, or have, or

518
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,600
was shown, that our individual
karma is all integrated and part

519
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,680
of our collective karma. And the
boundary between individual

520
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,940
karma and individual evolution,
and our collective karma and our

521
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,200
collective individual evolution
came down entirely, and that's

522
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,920
the primary theme of dark night,
early dawn, that there isn't.

523
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,100
Separate. It's impossible to
achieve spiritual awakening by

524
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:11,040
yourself, because there is no
private self to awaken. All of

525
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,160
our awakening emerges out of a
collective context, and it

526
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,640
contributes back into the
collective context. In the end,

527
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:24,380
we are always working with the
divine for the good of the

528
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:36,620
entire species and beyond the
species, after the time spent in

529
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:43,420
the in the where am I? Yeah, in
the greater reel of archetype of

530
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,520
reality, I entered causal
oneness. I entered into a period

531
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,660
of tremendous blessings. It was
a year of unbelievable

532
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,760
blessings. These were the four
sessions that I address in this

533
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,900
chapter. The forest was an
experience of emptiness.

534
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Shunyata, complete transparency,
no self in me, no self anywhere

535
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,380
in the world around me. The
entire world is a living

536
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,060
oneness. And when you experience
oneness, then you instantly

537
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,880
experience no self, the absence
of an independent, separate,

538
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:30,800
autonomous self. When the self
goes the world is one. Let me

539
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,840
jump over the diamond. The birth
of the diamond soul singing the

540
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,400
universe away, was an experience
of the deep, fertile void, the

541
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,540
primal void of not of that is
the matrix within which all form

542
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:54,160
emerges. Jesus's blood was an
experience of extraordinary

543
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,960
cosmic love, being just awash
with love like I had never known

544
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,820
anywhere in my life or anywhere
in my previous sessions. But let

545
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,820
me just mention diamonds, the
birth of the diamond soul,

546
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,040
because it comes up later in
this experience. In this

547
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,100
session, I had the experience of
my former lives coming in fast

548
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,720
and furious. I've done a lot of
work through hypnosis and

549
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,000
whatnot on my former lives and
previously, I had experienced my

550
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,600
life 11 years before as a
totality from end of beginning

551
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,380
to end. But in this session, my
former lives were coming in, and

552
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,300
they were like, right wrapping
kites, string around the kites

553
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,120
pool, except that what the lies
were like filaments of light,

554
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,660
and just wrapping them around
and around, and suddenly they

555
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,200
seemed to hit a critical mass.
And when they hit a critical

556
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,880
mass, they fused, and when they
fuse, there was an explosion of

557
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,780
light, an extraordinary diamond,
like light, broke out of my

558
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,680
chest, and I was thrown into a
state of consciousness that was

559
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,080
both individual, but a higher
level of individuality than

560
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,800
anything I had ever known. And I
think what I was being shown in

561
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,620
this experience, what I was
being given in this experience,

562
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,480
was a taste of where
reincarnation is taking us.

563
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,320
Reincarnation doesn't just
result in the development of a

564
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,960
little bit better this life, a
little bit better the next life,

565
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:34,280
acquiring more more moral
insight, more talents, more

566
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,860
this, more that, eventually,
sooner or later, all of our

567
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,360
experiences, all that we have
lived and learned in all of our

568
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,900
different lives, eventually, all
those experiences which we

569
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:52,120
remember when we die in this you
know, we die, we expand into the

570
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,600
soul. We come back into egoic
awareness. We expand into the

571
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:02,160
soul, back into egoic awareness,
eventually, sooner or later, all

572
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,880
of our life experience is
integrated as a singular

573
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:14,580
individuality inside time and
space. We wake up. We wake up to

574
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:19,680
the cosmic beings that we are,
that we truly are. We no longer

575
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,720
attempted to identify strictly
with our body, with our time,

576
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,560
space body.

577
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:40,100
From here the work went into the
diamond Luminosity work. But

578
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,900
before I go into that, I need to
backtrack a little bit and talk

579
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,380
about the birth of the future
human. I mentioned that in the

580
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,940
initiation the universe work, I
started having a series of

581
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:57,520
visions about the evolution of
humanity. Now this sounds

582
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,540
ridiculous at one level, but
it's not ridiculous. From within

583
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,240
the context of Transpersonal
psychology, when you shatter

584
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,320
your individual consciousness,
you don't simply flip into

585
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,460
totality OF ONENESS
consciousness, but you open into

586
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:20,180
a multi layered experience, a
multi layered universe, and one

587
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,360
of the layers of that universe
is the consciousness of our

588
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,920
species. And when you open to
the consciousness of your

589
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,240
species, it's only natural that
you would get insights into the

590
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,200
growth of this species, where we
came from, where we are and

591
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,920
where we're going. In my
sessions over five years, I was

592
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,540
given repeatedly the same kind
of story, the same story,

593
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,700
different aspects which I
address. In this chapter, I

594
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,060
gathered all the different
visions having to do with the

595
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:00,600
future of humanity into this
chapter. The first is the

596
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,060
visions of awakening, six
visions describing a profound

597
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,340
awakening of the human psyche
and the human heart, a profound

598
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:18,660
what I call the Great Awakening,
an awakening of a shift in the

599
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:26,900
fundamental architecture of the
collective unconscious. A year

600
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,620
and a half later, after those
first series of sessions, I was

601
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,000
taken deep into deep time,
beyond personal deep time, deep

602
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,800
into collective deep time, and I
was taken into what appeared to

603
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:47,560
be the death and rebirth of our
species in near future. I

604
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,860
experienced this. I didn't
wasn't given any information

605
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,100
about how or when or why, except
that it would seem to be

606
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,340
triggered. There was a global
systems crisis that seemed to be

607
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,880
being triggered by a global
ecological crisis. I was given,

608
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,520
I experienced the fact of this
transformation, and I

609
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,400
experienced, I was given, a lot
of insights into some of the

610
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,600
mechanisms of how we would make
this transition. As quickly as

611
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,880
we need to do it, we have so
little time to make the

612
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,780
transition. And it has to do
with understanding the

613
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,840
collective psyche. It has to do
with understanding that our

614
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,460
collective unconscious is a
field, and that when this field

615
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,700
is hyper stimulated with the
suffering that we are entering

616
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:36,140
into, it becomes so hyper
stimulated it enters into non

617
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,600
linear or far from equilibrium
conditions, and that there is a

618
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,200
certain structural parallel
between what can happen in a

619
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,160
psychic field when it is pushed
into non linear conditions and

620
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,580
what happens in physical fields
when they are pushed into non

621
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,540
linear conditions. And we can
extrapolate some of the insights

622
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,160
from from physical fields and
understand what might happen in

623
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,640
a psychic field when it is
pushed into non linear

624
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:11,820
conditions, specifically the
capacity for rapid, accelerated

625
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:17,640
change, heightened creativity
and The emergence of a higher

626
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:24,440
self organization. In my
visions, in my sessions, it was

627
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,440
always this is going to happen
faster than anyone can imagine,

628
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,820
faster than you can imagine,
faster than you can imagine. The

629
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,180
pace of our development in the
past was irrelevant to the pace

630
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,360
of our development in the
future, and it has to do with

631
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:47,080
what's happening at a deep,
collective psychic level. From

632
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,340
here, I went into the diamond
Luminosity work five years of

633
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:55,780
entering, progressively entering
into a field of consciousness

634
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:01,020
that was completely empty,
devoid of content and clear,

635
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:07,320
clear, beyond imagination, just
clear, clear, breathtakingly

636
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,440
luminescent. Buddhism calls this
Dharmakaya, the clear light of

637
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,520
absolute reality, the clear
light from which physical

638
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,280
reality springs. I called it
diamond Luminosity.

639
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,640
My time is running short. I can
only go through so much because

640
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,360
I take comfort that all of this
is in the book, and you'll be

641
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,640
able to go into greater detail
when you see it. I

642
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,540
out of these four sessions, and
I went into this reality only

643
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,880
four times in five years, five
years of work to spend four days

644
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,920
in this condition, the high cost
to pay in between these four.

645
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,780
Sessions, as you might imagine,
there was intense episodes of

646
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,280
purification, more purification,
more purification. Because when

647
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,260
you just to touch this reality
to be able to return to it and

648
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,040
have stable experience in this
reality, you have to purify

649
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,500
yourself of anything in you
which is less than this reality.

650
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,440
The first two entries into the
diamond Luminosity took place in

651
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,960
sessions 45 and 50. And then
after that, we didn't go deeper.

652
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,260
Didn't go deeper into the
diamond Luminosity, but the

653
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,560
diamond Luminosity began to
crunch itself deeper into my

654
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,500
physical body. It went to. It
was as if this light was

655
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:49,000
restructuring my biology. It was
restructuring my mind, my

656
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,060
emotions, my subtle energy
system, and actually

657
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:56,440
restructuring my cellular and
that cellular anatomy in ways

658
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,280
that I won't, couldn't begin to
understand, but it was soaking

659
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,840
itself deeper into my physical
presence. And I learned from

660
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,260
these experiences that the
purpose of this work was not

661
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,800
simply to move into
Transcendence. It isn't to go

662
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,000
into some disembodied,
transcendent reality. These

663
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,600
fields are beautiful. They're
magnificent. But the goal of the

664
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,060
work was not Transcendence.
Ultimately, the goal was to

665
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,720
bring this reality deeper into
our physical existence, to let

666
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,580
as much of spiritual reality as
possible enter into our physical

667
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,200
awareness, and to transform our
lives so that we become an

668
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,740
integrated whole, a being that
balances spiritual reality and

669
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,540
access to spirituality and the
magnificent universe which has

670
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,980
been gestated inside spiritual
reality, the reality of time and

671
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,580
space.

672
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,960
At the end, in the very last
year of this work, I was given

673
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:09,960
one final vision that was the
capstone of everything that had

674
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,460
gone on before. In this final
vision, the universe put me

675
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,600
through the absolute worst,
stripped down process that it

676
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,400
had ever put me through before.
It was just a cascading,

677
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,680
absolute loss of control,
stripped down, dying, dying,

678
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,160
burrowing deeper and deeper and
deeper until eventually it spun

679
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:36,860
me into deeper, into deep time
than I had ever been before. And

680
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,800
I haven't even tried to explain
what deep time is, but again,

681
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:44,440
it's in the book, it took me
into a state of consciousness in

682
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:50,740
which I was able to experience
100,000 years, kind of as a

683
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,100
simultaneous present. I began to
experience time in terms of the

684
00:52:54,100 --> 00:53:02,700
dying of whole life as a
pulsation of death and rebirth

685
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,960
of whole I experienced whole
generations dying every few

686
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,080
seconds, being born and dying
every few seconds, just a

687
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,400
radical expansion of the time
frame this I was given an

688
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,080
experience of what the Buddhist
would call Samsara in The raw

689
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,840
everything in this world, being
born dying, conserving, growing,

690
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:29,600
integrating being born dying.
And in this context, I was given

691
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:36,860
three teachings, which I'll just
mention. The first was that it

692
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:42,340
showed me that human beings are
actually built for speed. We are

693
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:46,660
built for accelerated evolution,
and it has to do with the fact

694
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:50,860
that each of our lives are are
so short 100 years, merely 100

695
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,540
years. But underneath this
repeated reincarnation, there is

696
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,960
a gathering of our knowledge, a
gathering of our of our

697
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,560
experience, and periodically,
this gathered knowledge flips

698
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,260
and becomes a new foundation for
all subsequent incarnations. And

699
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:15,300
from this expanded time horizon
I was I could see that human

700
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:21,080
beings were actually designed
for accelerated evolution. We

701
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:26,060
have a tendency to think human
nature. This human nature that

702
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,140
too statically, we have to think
more dynamically, more open

703
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,220
endedly, in terms if we want to
experience ourselves and

704
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,300
experience the human race from
the perspective of the creative

705
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:43,840
intelligence that's behind it
all the other two experiences

706
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:49,000
I'll mention was I experienced
the universe as a diamond maker.

707
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,300
I experienced this
reincarnation, all these these,

708
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,900
the cycling of reincarnation.
And I experienced sparks of

709
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,140
diamond light shooting off
periodically into the deep

710
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:04,860
space, into the. Deep Sky, and I
understood that the universe is

711
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,120
making diamonds, and the
diamonds the distillation of all

712
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,900
of our experience here into
these crystalline, pure forms

713
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,400
that allow us to enter into
dimensions of spiritual reality

714
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,680
that we could never survive in
if we hadn't gone through this

715
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,760
hyper concentration, hyper
accelerated developmental

716
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,560
process, which is taking place
inside time and space. And

717
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,380
lastly, I was given an
experience of the future human,

718
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:39,080
taken deep and allowed to
experience for a short period of

719
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:45,640
time the human being that nature
is giving birth to in this long

720
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:52,300
developmental process, such an
exquisite being just touching it

721
00:55:52,660 --> 00:56:00,600
for only a few minutes. So
helpful. Just totally expanded

722
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:06,000
my understanding of human
potential and showed us it's

723
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
very important, I think, that we
have an understanding, that we

724
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,840
have a vision of where we are
going historically, because as

725
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,260
the shadows darken as we enter
deeper into this historical

726
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,840
crisis that we are entering into
now, as we enter the dark night

727
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:28,340
of our collective soul. We could
lose hope. We could think that

728
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,920
it's all over. We could think
that we are somehow being

729
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,580
punished for the sins of our
past. We could think that it's

730
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:39,440
just we're entering into an
extinction event, but really we

731
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,020
are in labor. We have been
gestating for hundreds of 1000s

732
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,320
of years. Nature has been
gestating us. Gestation is a

733
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:53,440
long process. Birth is a
relatively short process. Labor

734
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,760
is a very, very intense and
painful process, but at the end,

735
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,920
it gives birth to something
wonderful, something new. I

736
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,980
think that's what's happening
historically, after hundreds of

737
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,120
1000s of years, we are entering
into labor, and the crisis that

738
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,420
we are entering at a global
stage is synchronistically

739
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,960
connected to a developmental
crisis that is taking place

740
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:21,920
inside each one of us. We carry
the entire history of the world,

741
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,360
in our former lives, in our
heart, in our soul, as the

742
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,440
planet is struggling to become
one. In everything that that

743
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,060
involves, we are working to
become one coherent, integrated

744
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,600
soul, so that there is a
relationship between this

745
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,820
building tension in the global
order, and a building tension

746
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,020
inside our psychological order
as we give birth to a new

747
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:52,240
species on this planet, and as
we give birth to a new center of

748
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:58,420
consciousness within our own
person. Again, what is important

749
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,720
is not that I had these
experiences, and I could be

750
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,800
wrong on many different levels,
but what I think is important is

751
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,340
that many, many people are
having these experiences, as

752
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,300
Stani Grof has documented. And
what's important is that these

753
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,780
levels of consciousness are
there for all of us to explore.

754
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,040
And again, I do not recommend
that people explore them as I

755
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,200
explore them. I truly don't. I
would not wish anyone to go

756
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,160
through some of the things I
went through in order to enter

757
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,960
these domains. I would be
gentler. I would be use a wider

758
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,400
complement of experiences, of
techniques and technologies. But

759
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,540
they are there, and they are
there for us to explore. There

760
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,140
is this massive information
field which we can enter

761
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,520
suddenly and temporarily, or we
can just sit here and open up

762
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:54,280
and let it enter us and soak
into our bones. Thank you very

763
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:54,820
much. Applause.

764
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:22,980

3
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:10,592
James Jesso: I'm also great.

8
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,500
adventures through the mind I am
your host, as always. James W

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,840
Jesso, I'm going to start this
episode off with a big thanks to

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,060
the spirit plant medicine
conference in Vancouver,

11
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,360
happening November 2 to the
fourth. You've probably noticed

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,280
they've sponsored a few episodes
over the last couple months. And

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,840
yeah, that's very exciting. The
guest today, Chris Bache, is one

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,320
of the presenters at the
conference, and I will be one of

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,680
the attendees. So if you want to
come check me out, or check out

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,220
the conference in general, or
come check out Chris at that

17
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,580
conference, follow the link
contained in the description to

18
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,180
this episode. Jump over there.
If you buy a ticket, then I get

19
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,960
a little bit of commission from
that, which goes towards my

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,100
costs to fly to Vancouver to
attend this so it's and you get

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,720
to go to a great concert or
concert Jesus conference. Yes,

22
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,680
win, win. Okay, today's guest is
Christopher M Bache. Bache is

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,500
professor emeritus in the
Department of Philosophy and

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,120
Religious Studies at young
Youngstown State University,

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,200
where he taught for 33 years. He
is also adjunct faculty at the

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,080
California Institute of integral
studies and a fellow at the

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,440
Institute of Noetic Sciences, an
award winning teacher and

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,620
international speaker. Chris
work explores the philosophical

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,260
implications of Non-ordinary
states of consciousness,

30
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,820
especially psychedelic states.
He has written three books,

31
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,360
translated into six languages,
life cycles, a study of

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,820
reincarnation in light of
contemporary consciousness.

33
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,000
Research. Dark Knight early
dawn, a pioneering work into

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
psychedelic philosophy and
collective consciousness and the

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,240
living classroom, an exploration
of teaching and collective

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,740
fields of consciousness. He has
a new book being released from

37
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,840
inner traditions in 2019
diamonds for from heaven, a 20

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,840
year journey into the mind of
the universe. So let me just

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,520
give you a little bit more
detail as to Christopher and

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,120
what he's been up to. At some
point about 40 years ago, he

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,340
decided it would be a good idea
for him to take high doses of

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,220
LSD regularly with the
intention, I guess, to map

43
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,840
consciousness as a metaphysical
philosopher. And then proceeded

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,520
to do so 76 I believe, 76 times
over the course of 20 years, 20

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,340
years after his last journey in
that specific structure, he is

46
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,180
about to release his book
diamonds from heaven, and he is

47
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,840
on the show today to talk about
basically, what drove him to do

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,980
this, what it was like, and what
did he learn. And furthermore,

49
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,220
not just what did he learn about
the nature of consciousness and

50
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,720
the psychedelic experience. But
what did he learn about what can

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,860
we do as human beings to make
sense of experiences that are as

52
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,800
massive as the ones you're going
to hear him describe in this

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,600
episode, we also had a great
post credits talk that with his

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,840
permission, I am going to be
releasing as well, exclusively

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,500

76
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,420
Christopher Bache on adventures
through the mind. Just because

77
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,460
of a the context of my of my
work and my travel, I didn't get

78
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,160
a chance to really look into
what you do until yesterday.

79
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:32,000
Other than, you know, Stevens,
you know, what's the word I'm

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,060
looking for, shining
recommendation, definitely put

81
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,180
you on the map. And then I was,
I was really blown away. I found

82
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,980
it. I found it to be, yeah,
yeah. That's just really blown

83
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,040
away. It's interesting, yeah,
interesting stuff you had going

84
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,340
on there,

85
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,760
Chris Bache: yeah? Well, I've
been sort of on the side of the

86
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,020
psychedelic community, but been
there for a long time doing my

87
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,680
own thing.

88
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,040
James Jesso: Yeah, it makes
sense, because you had to

89
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,420
protect your your career for
some time.

90
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,500
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah. All
right. So okay,

91
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,040
James Jesso: why don't, why
don't we start it off here? Just

92
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:14,700
easing in, give me a sense of of
where you're coming from. When

93
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,020
you start this work, you were
doing high dose LSD experiences

94
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,460
for 20 years. You stopped about
10 years ago, which means that

95
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,920
you started doing this 3030,
years ago at that point, I

96
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,020
believe LSD was already illegal.
Can you sort of like draw or

97
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,540
paint us a picture of the
context that you were entering

98
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,540
into the decision to do this.
And while, while doing that, can

99
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,920
you also explain the difference
between what you were doing and

100
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,480
what was popular at the time in
so far as psychedelic therapy or

101
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
psycholytic therapy?

102
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,580
Chris Bache: Yeah. Well, I came
out of graduate school in 1978 I

103
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,460
was trained as a philosopher of
religion, and I came to

104
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,240
Youngstown State University in
Northeast Ohio to begin my

105
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,600
teaching career. And at the
time, I was an atheistically

106
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,640
inclined agnostic. But that
first year, I read Stan Grof

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,040
first book, realms of the human
unconscious, and I immediately

108
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,740
connected with it. I felt I had
found my life's work. This was

109
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,080
1978 the Controlled Substances
Act had been passed in 1970 the

110
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,800
early era of psychedelic
research was over, and of

111
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,200
course, we were had entered that
blackout between 1970 and when

112
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,560
Scientific American had
published its front page

113
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,640
editorial recommending that we
end the ban on psychedelic

114
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,460
research in 2017 2014, but there
was this blackout. No one was

115
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,600
allowed to do this work anymore.
I was convinced that it could be

116
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,760
done safely. And Stan Gross was
very work was very important me

117
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,460
in that respect, and I was
convinced that the people who

118
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,040
would be making the most
important contributions in

119
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,160
philosophy of religion would
soon be being people who are

120
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,300
writing out of an experiential
basis. So I made the decision to

121
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,240
divide my life in half and my
public life. I continued my work

122
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,540
as a academic, Professor,
traditional professor, teaching

123
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,380
my courses, doing all the things
professors do. But in my private

124
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,000
life, I began a 20 year journey
working with high levels of

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,940
psychedelics of LSD, 73 sessions
extending over 20 years between

126
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:46,600
1979 and 1999 I chose to work
with high doses first because it

127
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,320
was complicated to arrange time
for sessions when you have a

128
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,080
dual career marriage to
professional people, and I

129
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,100
wanted to make the most out of
every session. But then, after

130
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,100
the process got started, I found
that I thought it would get me

131
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,420
to my goal of enlightenment
faster, basically breaking off

132
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,600
larger pieces of karma, chewing
up larger pieces of karma in

133
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,320
every session after that model
of personal enlightenment

134
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,960
dissolved along the way, I
continued to work with high

135
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,920
doses of LSD, because it took me
where I wanted to go, and then

136
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,180
It took me farther than I ever
dreamed was possible.

137
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:25,759
James Jesso: Now I'm just going
to take a quick pause to clarify

138
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,499
something, because high dose LSD
is not very clear for the

139
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:33,439
listeners, how high of a dose?
What was the what was the

140
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,279
metric?

141
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:39,679
Chris Bache: Metric was 500 to
600 micrograms, which is kind of

142
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:45,039
a maximum high dose Stan's work,
Stan differentiates between

143
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,359
psychedelic or low dose therapy
averaging about 200 micrograms

144
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:56,559
up to 300 psychedelic therapy is
high dose between 315 100, more

145
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,839
typically 300 to 500 but in the
early work. He did at Spring

146
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,599
Grove Hospital. It was
deliberately limited to a

147
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:07,379
maximum of three sessions. The
idea was to trigger an

148
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:10,259
experience of Transcendence that
would help people come to terms

149
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,739
with their impending death. I
thought, if you could do this

150
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,579
safely three times, you could do
it safely more frequently, and

151
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:21,019
that's so I saw myself, at the
time, simply doing an extended

152
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,679
dose of high dose therapy. When
I got to the end of this

153
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,259
journey, however, and was
looking back, I realized that

154
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,979
what unfolded on this journey
was more radical and more

155
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:35,179
challenging than what had
emerged in the early psychedelic

156
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:38,899
therapy work, and so I had to
coin a new term, a new phrase

157
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:43,179
for it, so the way I would
describe my work now that that

158
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:47,199
psychedelic period is
psychedelic exploration, the

159
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:50,439
method is psychedelic therapy,
with totally internalized

160
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:54,159
sessions, strong, evocative
music, working with a sitter,

161
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:57,879
always in a protected, isolated
environment, classic set and

162
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:03,419
setting. The difference is the
high number of sessions, seven

163
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,879
for me, turned out to be 73
sessions.

164
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,900
James Jesso: Some of the
conclusions that you, that you

165
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,360
drew are, I just remember having
recently listened to some of

166
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,720
your lectures, and just being so
moved by it, and I'm noticing

167
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,200
myself now wanting excitedly to
ask you basically what you

168
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,100
learned in the end. But I know
that this, I'm just like, kind

169
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,480
of suppressing that urge a
little bit and to maybe deepen

170
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,460
into, you know, what? What
exactly was happening? What? And

171
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,540
I want to ask that question
couched in very specific

172
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,200
phenomenon that you observed,
which was multiple layers of

173
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,440
death and and rebirth and like
an increasing expansion into,

174
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,060
and I'm kind of, I guess, using
my own, my own words here, but

175
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,400
like of higher levels of
reality. Can you sort of couch

176
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,640
in this idea of, what do you
mean by multiple death and

177
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,880
rebirth? Can you give us an
outline of, I mean, what the

178
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,520
hell was happening in there
after 70 something? Or, you

179
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,760
know, progressively through 70
something sessions of 500 Mikes

180
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,420
of LSD?

181
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,339
Chris Bache: Well, that is the
question. And it is, it's, it's,

182
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:26,359
it's hard to summarize. I mean,
it's taken me about 300 pages

183
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:30,979
just to tell the story of what
happened. It's hard to jump into

184
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:34,279
it quickly, because there were
so many layers. But basically,

185
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:38,599
my experience has been that the
universe, or the mind of the

186
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:42,819
universe, or the mind of Divine
is an infinite ocean of

187
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,559
potential, and when we drop our
individual mind into that ocean,

188
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:51,339
it catalyzes a set of
experiences out of that infinite

189
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:57,159
potential. And as we are changed
and influenced and healed and

190
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,679
purified by that exchange, the
seed crystal of our mind

191
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:06,359
changes, and then later, when we
drop that same mind, now

192
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:10,439
transformed into the ocean, it
catalyzes a deeper set of

193
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:16,439
experiences out of that infinite
potential. So my experience was

194
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:20,239
that there were a series of
initiations that took place over

195
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:25,339
many years, a series of deaths,
followed by a rebirth into a

196
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,719
deeper level of reality, and
then a gradually acclimating to

197
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,679
that level of reality, adjusting
to its conditions, going through

198
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,419
a purification process, because,
as I experienced it, leads every

199
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:41,199
deeper level of reality, or
every deeper state of

200
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,079
consciousness that gave us
access to a deeper level of

201
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,099
reality was a higher level of
energy. So to stabilize

202
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:51,699
consciousness at that deeper
level of consciousness, so that

203
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:54,579
your experience of that deeper
level of reality would be

204
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,719
coherent and not fragmented, you
had to go through a very intense

205
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:02,999
purification process, but if you
continue to work at a particular

206
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:06,959
level, if you can continue to
stay internalized and push my

207
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,679
experience was you would go back
to the same level, and you would

208
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,439
I would acclimate to that level.
I would begin to have more

209
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,499
coherent experiences at that
level. And eventually I would

210
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:22,579
come to a point where the
Death-Rebirth process would

211
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,299
repeat itself. I would go
through some agonizing, complete

212
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,619
loss of control, and then I
would collapse, and be an

213
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,159
internal collapse, and then I
would be reborn into a yet

214
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,639
deeper level of consciousness,
which gave me access to a deeper

215
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,419
level of reality. And this went
on systematically, periodically

216
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:50,319
for 20 years. So to describe the
levels of consciousness that I

217
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:54,279
entered into, it's a that's it's
a longer story.

218
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,040
James Jesso: Absolutely, yeah,
and I was thinking at some point

219
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,600
I might ask you a couple like,
what does this mean? In so far

220
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,560
as like, why is the chapter
titled this? And, yeah, but

221
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,220
maybe because all of this, you
know, having listened to the

222
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,660
longer story, you know, all of
this is very descriptive, but

223
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,900
for someone who's just entering
into this for the first time, it

224
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,980
can be kind of abstract. So
maybe you can, you can talk

225
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,040
about what this looks like,
because I got one description

226
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,320
from you that seemed to make a
lot of sense to me, which was

227
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,320
something like, you know, in the
early sessions, you were working

228
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
through your own personal stuff,
and that eventually you needed

229
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,640
to die to who you were, to
become, you know, yeah, beyond

230
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,800
your personality into a greater,
a greater sense of like, the

231
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,040
underlying human consciousness,
and then even at some point to

232
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,740
die from that underlying human
consciousness into something

233
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,160
beyond it. Can you give maybe a
step by step in the early

234
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,300
stages, what that looked like?

235
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,280
Chris Bache: Yeah, for about the
first two years, I worked at

236
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,040
what Stan Grof describes as the
perinatal level of

237
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,820
consciousness, which is the
interface between your personal

238
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,600
reality, your egoic reality in
space time, and early

239
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,860
Transpersonal consciousness. So
I went through many experiences

240
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,300
of reliving my own birth, of
experiences of death and dying,

241
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,780
until eventually, after about
two and a half years, my

242
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,000
personal reality was just
shattered. I was just crushed

243
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,040
and extinguished. I died as the
person I had known myself to be.

244
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,960
And then I was reborn into a
level of reality that

245
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,540
transcended, radically
transcended, Chris bacheous

246
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,300
reality. And I was working, at
that point, at a deep within the

247
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,560
collective unconscious, and then
the entire process began again.

248
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,040
And in my experience, there are
two phases of every session.

249
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,700
There's a cleansing phase, which
lasts usually a couple of hours,

250
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,760
and then there's an ecstatic
phase. So if you enter into the

251
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,700
cleansing phase and let it take
you wherever it wants to take

252
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,620
you, you reach. It reaches a
peak. You go through some type

253
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,140
of crisis, some type of
transition, and then the

254
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,340
remainder of the session is
spent in ecstatic reality, where

255
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:13,500
you receive teachings and
experiences. So in the cleansing

256
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,940
phase of phase two, I entered
into what I call the ocean of

257
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,620
suffering, just domains of pain
and suffering that were vast,

258
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,000
encompassing large swaths of
human history and hundreds of

259
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,960
1000s of persons. It took about
two years to go through all of

260
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,940
that material at the personal
side, on the ecstatic side, I

261
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,220
was experiencing for about a
year, I experienced my life as a

262
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,980
completed whole, start to
finish, all the time, moments of

263
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,920
my life as a simultaneous
present. I just kind of

264
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,820
experienced my life as a
complete totality. And then in

265
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,380
the second phase, I went through
a series of initiations in which

266
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,360
I was taken deep into the mind
of the universe and just given a

267
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,120
series of teachings and given a
series of experiences, it

268
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,260
basically grounded me in a
larger cosmological vision of

269
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,420
reality. After about two years
of that process, I went through

270
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,940
another death and rebirth cycle
and was spun beyond, not only

271
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,860
beyond my individual reality,
but also beyond my reality as a

272
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,860
human species, altogether,
beyond the collective psyche

273
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,780
into what I identified as
archetypal reality. But it

274
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,920
wasn't the archetypes described
by either Plato or Carl Jung. It

275
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,420
was both, I mean, it had certain
features similar to Plato's

276
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,440
description and certain features
of Jung's description, but it

277
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,840
really had other features that
did not fit in their

278
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,760
description. The realities that
I encountered there at the high

279
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,320
archetypal level were not
eternal, unchanging ideas in the

280
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,560
mind of God, as Plato describes
it, but vast, living cosmic

281
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,940
forces, giant beings being so
vast, my mind literally could

282
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,420
not wrap itself around it. I
could only get approximations of

283
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,980
the scale of their dimensions at
the slightly beneath that, at

284
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,520
the Jungian level, I entered
deep into the collective psyche,

285
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,280
and then for a couple of years,
had all sorts of experiences of

286
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,620
how our species functions as a
single organism, was taken deep

287
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,460
into the sort of meta neural
networks of the species mind,

288
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,960
and also began to have
experiences of reincarnation,

289
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,960
but not as an individual, not
from the perspective of

290
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,120
individual souls, but from the
spectrum of an entire species

291
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,620
that was incarnating every
generation, a whole generation

292
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,440
of its beings, and experiencing
the centralized intelligence

293
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,760
that was kind of orchestrating
or collaborating with the

294
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,520
individual souls to. Facilitate
not just an individual journey

295
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,560
of transformation, but to
facilitate a species journey of

296
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,340
transformation. And I went
through another round of death

297
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,340
and rebirth. I'm skipping over,
of course, a lot of things,

298
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,000
right, right? And then I was
catapulted into what some people

299
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,040
call causal reality, into non
dual reality, and where the

300
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,420
entire universe began to
function as a single totality.

301
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,480
And had a number of experiences
of what the Buddhists call

302
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,760
Shunyata, emptiness, of self,
oneness, cosmic love,

303
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,260
experiences of the primal void,
the fertile void, you know, the

304
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,620
formlessness that is the source
of all existence. After that,

305
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,820
then I went, I was coming into
the last five years of work, and

306
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,980
the last five years catapulted
me after again, more rounds of

307
00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:01,140
purification, death and rebirth,
into a cosmic light that was so

308
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,240
intense and so clear and so
pure. I called it the diamond

309
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,820
Luminosity, and that's where the
title of the book comes from.

310
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,320
Diamonds from heaven. Buddhism
calls this the absolute clear

311
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,220
light. It associates it with its
concept of Dharmakaya, the

312
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,700
fundamental reality that is the
source of all existence. Now let

313
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,840
me back up. Light entered into
the experiences. There are many,

314
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,300
many levels of light, many
gradations of light, in my

315
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,320
experience there, I had
experienced light many times in

316
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,640
earlier Death-Rebirth processes.
So when I talk about the diamond

317
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,280
light, I'm not simply talking
using metaphor to describe that

318
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,480
light, I'm trying to describe a
particularly intense,

319
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,820
exceptionally clear state of
awareness of crystalline light

320
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,420
that becomes so clear,
eventually becomes transparent

321
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,720
to itself. And in those last
five years, in the last 26

322
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,160
sessions, which was actually
about 1/3 of all of my work, I

323
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,020
entered that reality four times
and just four times. So about

324
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,520
once a year, I would be
catapulted into this reality,

325
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,120
and then I would go through more
detoxification, more

326
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,160
purification, and about a year
later would enter into this

327
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,380
reality one more time. That's
the kind of larger overview,

328
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,660
James Jesso: right, right, good,
and I'm glad that you stopped

329
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,380
there, because there's some your
closing experiences. I want to

330
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,680
get to near the end, but I want
to maybe jump back a little bit

331
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,200
and focus on what you're talking
about here with this

332
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:46,000
purification and also with this
idea of of becoming more

333
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,100
coherent. Now, when you say
purification, what exactly do

334
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,720
you mean? Because I my immediate
assumption is something akin to,

335
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,480
you know, what the Ayahuasca
culture calls purging, where

336
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,280
you're basically putting,
pushing out or releasing or

337
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,320
letting go or discharging,
suffering, pain, you know,

338
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,880
hardships, whatever, through the
active metabolic process of

339
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,240
feeling them so that you can
having let Those go, enter into

340
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,860
a state that a state of being
that exists without them. Is

341
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,900
that what you mean when you're
saying purification,

342
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,160
Chris Bache: that's a good
description. It is that it's

343
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,640
physiological. I mean, you know,
people throw up a lot on

344
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,000
Ayahuasca. They don't tend to
think of LSD as something that

345
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,680
causes throwing up. But to me, I
I was working with such high

346
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,580
levels, I threw up a lot on LSD,
and that's part of this whole

347
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,760
releasing of physical toxins,
biochemical toxins,

348
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,300
psychological toxins, just
letting them come through your

349
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,160
system and offload in very rapid
sequences. When you move into

350
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:04,620
deeper levels, it takes
different forms. I mean to sort

351
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:15,060
of it, if you want to become, to
enter it, to enter into very,

352
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,400
very deep states of
consciousness where you enter

353
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,420
into unitive consciousness with
the divine or different

354
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,880
dimensions of existence, or
different dimensions of the

355
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,020
cosmos, you have to completely
let go of everything in your

356
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,320
life which keeps you small. So
it's not just negative

357
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,820
experiences, it's not just pain,
it's every thought form, every

358
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,840
emotional derivative that
constellates around smallness.

359
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,300
But you you have to sort of
allow your system to step up to

360
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,740
handle the enormous waves of
energy that move through you in

361
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,060
these very deep states of
consciousness. So purification

362
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,660
begins at the personal level.
You're purifying all sorts of

363
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,080
pieces of your personal history,
including your former life

364
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,820
history. You. Hmm, but as you go
deeper and deeper, the forms of

365
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,180
purification become harder to
identify with anything personal

366
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,440
they become and eventually you
literally are transcending time

367
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,660
and space. And there is a sense
in which you have to empty

368
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,440
yourself of everything
associated with your entire

369
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,360
history of being a time and
space, being to enter into

370
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,400
realities beyond time and space,
but it is exactly as the

371
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,120
Ayahuasca, the Santo Daime
tradition, describes it. It is a

372
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,720
port ego. It's a letting go.
It's a manifesting and letting

373
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,920
go of those realities.

374
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
James Jesso: I'm, you know,
given that we're talking about

375
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,500
transcending time and space. I'm
gonna assume that it, you know,

376
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,140
it's Transcendence linguistic
form as well. But I'm just

377
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:56,320
curious, like, what, what does
it feel like to, I like, I know

378
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,820
what it feels like to, you know,
purify or discharge, sadness.

379
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,160
Yeah, I know what it feels like
to, to feel like the grief and

380
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,820
the fear, you know, particularly
the grief of of letting go, of

381
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:21,020
who I think I am, or who I who I
thought I was, yeah, but it

382
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,680
really, it's, it's mind blowing.
Really, is there a way that you

383
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,300
could describe in language what
it's like to purify let go of

384
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,360
your very essence of being bound
by time and space.

385
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Chris Bache: Your question
really penetrates right to the

386
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,020
some very heart of some very
thorny issues. Let me, let me,

387
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,400
let me mention before we jump
into it, you know, ineffability

388
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,060
is taken as one of the signature
qualities of a genuine mystical

389
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,360
experience. William James first
brought it in, and it's been

390
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,960
incorporated into some of the
diagnostic questionnaires to

391
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,900
assess the depth of one's
mystical experience. Personally,

392
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,500
I think ineffability is
overrated. So these things are

393
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,880
hard to put into words. They are
hard to define ways of

394
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,540
expressing experiences that you
enter into in these realities.

395
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,740
But my experience is, when you
first break into a new level of

396
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,540
reality, it is hard to get it
down on paper. It is hard to

397
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,440
find words, and there are some
tricks that I learned in order

398
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,360
to concretize by recall of these
experiences. But what I found

399
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,540
is, if you keep going back to
the same level of reality over

400
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,000
and over again, if you go
through this purification

401
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,300
process and consciousness
stabilizes at that level of

402
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,220
reality, your cognition becomes
clear, you begin to understand

403
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,780
how this works, the pieces begin
to cohere, and it becomes easier

404
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,960
and easier to find the right
words to describe it. Then when

405
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,780
you break into a new level of
reality, the same dynamic

406
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,980
repeats itself that you're kind
of overwhelmed by the enormity

407
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,780
of something different, but if
you keep going back with focus,

408
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,980
you will be able to stabilize it
the particular experience that

409
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,180
you're talking about, of letting
go all of your experience in

410
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:16,080
time and space. Well, partly,
partly, I experience it as a

411
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,140
matter of fear. You're becoming
something so large that it's

412
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,860
swallowing everything you've
ever known. Not only swallowing

413
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,280
everything you've ever known as
an individual, but there's a

414
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,960
sense in which when you're
working at that level, even to

415
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,400
even to push that particular
boundary, you are no longer an

416
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,660
individual. Having gotten to
that level, there's a sense in

417
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:46,180
which you're you're functioning
as a species. You're functioning

418
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,040
as a as a fractal member of an
entire human species. And then

419
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,840
at a deeper level, you're not
even a species. You're somehow a

420
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,160
fractal embodiment of an entire
evolutionary impulse that's been

421
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,740
manifesting galaxies and solar
systems and planets and evolving

422
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,300
life. So you literally have
already dissolved into those

423
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,020
deeper patterns. So you're not
an individual having a

424
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,540
Transpersonal experience. You
have surrendered into that part

425
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:24,260
of the universe that lives as a
galaxy that lives effort as an

426
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,700
evolutionary thrust. So when it
comes to the point of letting go

427
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,760
of that and entering into
something which is where the Big

428
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,900
Bang came from, entering in the
domain of formlessness itself,

429
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,980
it's it feels less like a
personal crisis. It feels like

430
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,260
an almost an evolutionary
crisis, or a species anxiety.

431
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,880
But if you let go, the universe
takes you in, and can you just

432
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:04,500
lose all frames of reference?
Yeah, and then suddenly you're

433
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,740
alive within a different
reality. I mean, what you It's

434
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,220
hard to describe, because I say
you're alive, but you're not who

435
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,500
you were before. But there is a
thread of memory that connects

436
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,840
who you were inside time and
space to who you are in this

437
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,100
reality, which is outside time
and space. But what you are

438
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,780
experiencing it's not you're
literally adrift in the mind of

439
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:35,240
God, so to speak, you're,
you're, you're in the in the

440
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,220
cosmos as part of the title,
currents of the cosmos,

441
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,200
James Jesso: like part of but
also as the title currents,

442
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,860
like, there, is there? Like,
it's not just like, Oh, I am in

443
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,220
the universe. Is there? Like, a
sense of being all of that as

444
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,520
well?

445
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,560
Chris Bache: Yes. I mean,
basically, in each deeper and

446
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,200
deeper level, I experience it as
a remembering I wasn't entering

447
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,100
a reality that I was not. I was
remembering a dimension of my

448
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,580
own existence that I had
forgotten about. So becoming one

449
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,360
with God is not a matter of
confronting an external deity,

450
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,580
which you then merge with,
becoming one with God. Or I

451
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,360
don't even like to use the word
God, because of all the you

452
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,780
know, historical associations,
the baggage that comes with it.

453
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,800
But to become one with that
reality, with that fundamental

454
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,280
reality, you it's a matter of
remembering. It's a remembering

455
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,500
the fundamental truth that
that's what you are. You are a

456
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,440
manifestation. You are a fractal
embodiment of an aspect of this

457
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,780
divine impulse. So the whole
experience is as you become

458
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,440
larger, you remember more. As
you remember more, you become

459
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,340
clear. As you become clearer,
you enter deeper and deeper into

460
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,660
into these ocean currents, but
always the sense of waking up.

461
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,480
You're waking up. It's not
really about dying and being

462
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,200
reborn. It's just a matter of
waking up to something that is

463
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,940
your true and natural condition.

464
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,980
James Jesso: So I might, I might
be jumping the gun here, as they

465
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,720
say, but I feel like this might
be a good time to ask something

466
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,940
that I wanted to save till
later, and then I'll jump back

467
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,380
afterwards. Okay, I'm, I'm
assuming that you're familiar

468
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,520
with with the the anecdotal
reports of five Meo DMT that

469
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,480
have been really growing a lot
over the last 10 years or so.

470
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Yeah, and a lot of the people
who are, we'll say the people of

471
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,800
the five, you know, they they
experience, and then claim that

472
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,740
what happens is like, this is
the ultimate non dual

473
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:57,400
experience. And you enter into,
you become like the apex of

474
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,160
consciousness, in some way, like
the God. And in your experience,

475
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,480
you at one point even got to
what could be described as this

476
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,100
apex, maybe this, this is this
diamond Luminosity. And then at

477
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,440
some point, realized that there
was something even further

478
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,000
beyond that as well. I'm
curious, given your experiences

479
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,460
like your you know, your deep
experiences with high dose LSD

480
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,900
over such a long time, and
these, this, these entrances

481
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,200
into into different levels of
consciousness. How do you feel

482
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,700
about the sort of the larger
cosmological or metaphysical

483
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,820
claim that's being made by
people who are experiencing five

484
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,720
Meo DMT?

485
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,040
Chris Bache: Yeah, first, I'm
really comfortable with the five

486
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,400
Meo DMT discussion. I mean, I
think it's a fascinating

487
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,180
substance. It has this capacity
to just catapult us through so

488
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,560
many layers and give us a short
immersion into those deep, deep,

489
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,940
cosmic territories. But in some
ways, the situation is similar,

490
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,780
I think, to people who have near
death episodes, you know, who

491
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,940
just walking down the street,
they have a heart attack, and

492
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,120
they they they almost die, and
they're knocked out of their

493
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,080
body, and they have a powerful,
transcendental experience, which

494
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,320
lasts minutes, hours, and then
they come back in their body,

495
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,040
and they're trying to understand
what it is they experienced. And

496
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,720
if you have fleeting contact
with these realities at one

497
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,780
level. You know what they are.
You can feel what they are. You

498
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,660
know, there is a sense in which
you are immersed in the ultimate

499
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:35,420
but it may be because they are
so short term and so singular. I

500
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,900
think sometimes we draw
premature conclusions about what

501
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,900
they imply for the nature of the
universe itself. So at least

502
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,700
here's why. I suspect that when
I was doing this work, and I got

503
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,280
to the point where I was in
those last five years, and I was

504
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,000
in that series of immersions
into what I call the diamond

505
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,320
Luminosity, past oneness past.
You know, merging with the

506
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,120
divine into some level that felt
even beyond calls or reality.

507
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,080
I'd gone into it once. I went
into it a second time. This is

508
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,540
my 50th session. And then
towards the end of that session,

509
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,180
I had an unusual experience. I
was as as far out as I'd ever

510
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,320
gone, I was totally, absolutely
peace, floating, merged with

511
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,840
this light, and then suddenly
everything pivoted 90 degrees,

512
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,840
and I saw a reality that was
far, far removed, and this

513
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,260
reality was light soaked, and a
beam of light came out of that

514
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,160
reality and hit me, and it just
absolutely shattered me. It was

515
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,340
a completely different order of
light, beyond even the diamond

516
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,500
Luminosity that it had taken me
15 years to get to. And that's

517
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,520
when I realized I called it the
absolute light, just to give it

518
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,860
a name. But that's when I
realized that it's an infinite

519
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,060
progression. And I completely
gave up to the the idea that we

520
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,960
could ever get to the end of it.
See, when I had started this

521
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,960
work, I thought there was an end
state. You did this work, and

522
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,500
you you reach some definitive
end of the process. And some

523
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,440
people talked about us becoming
one with God, or becoming one

524
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,120
with the universe. Some people
talked about entering the primal

525
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,800
void, or the super, meta, cosmic
void. And I had entered those

526
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,080
states of oneness, and I
discovered that there are

527
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,140
actually many gradations of
oneness, and I had entered

528
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,020
formlessness, but I discovered
that there are actually

529
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,400
gradations of formlessness, and
this experience convinced me

530
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,660
that even using this very
powerful method, the universe

531
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,980
was just much, much larger than
I had imagined it to be, and

532
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,220
that there was no way I was
going to ever be able to come to

533
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,540
the end some end. And I just
realized that was a false, a

534
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,880
false expectation on my part.
And then what happened in the

535
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,480
sessions is that the session
stopped taking me farther out,

536
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,680
and the diamond Luminosity began
to crunch itself deeper, more

537
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,600
and more deeply into my physical
body. The next year, two years

538
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,680
of work were all about being
having that diamond light crunch

539
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,080
into my physiology, into my
psychology, into my neural

540
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,720
anatomy. So I understand, I
really do understand those

541
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,860
senses of ultimacy that emerge
in these experiences. I think

542
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,480
that's a phenomenologically
accurate description, but kind

543
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,300
of, as a metaphysician, I would
bracket discussions of ultimacy,

544
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,920
because I'm not, I really not
sure that we are in a position

545
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,660
as a species even using these
very, very powerful substances

546
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,700
to make safe claims about what
is ultimate or not.

547
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,340
James Jesso: Yes, cool. Thank
you very much. Now we're going

548
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,820
to put a pin in that and jump
back, okay, and talk a little

549
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,620
bit more about purification and
coherency. You make a comment,

550
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,560
you've made the comment multiple
times, and maybe you could just

551
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,840
sort of clarify it a bit now
that you you have to effort at

552
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,120
some point, and get familiar
with certain states of

553
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,380
consciousness at which point you
become coherent. There you're

554
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:33,560
you hold a cog coherent
cognition while in these higher

555
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,060
energy states of consciousness.
Can you maybe just explain that

556
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,460
a little bit more deeper, and
possibly you know, how, how it

557
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,540
is that you do that?

558
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,880
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, this
was a learn as you go process.

559
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,880
You know, I didn't, I wasn't
part of a psychedelic culture. I

560
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,740
never, didn't have a shaman,
kind of helping me through this

561
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,920
process. I was really having to
figure it out as I went and I

562
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,220
was using a medicine that didn't
have a lot of history. It didn't

563
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,520
have and it didn't have
psychedelics, didn't have fields

564
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,460
associated with it, the way that
mushrooms do and the way that

565
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,340
Ayahuasca does. It's really a
relatively new medicine, and

566
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:19,440
therefore it's very much was
taking me to an edge my

567
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,940
experience. You know, when, when
I read the literature of

568
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,460
people's psychedelic
experiences, particularly their

569
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,120
experiences with with LSD or
other very powerful

570
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,380
psychedelics, I saw that the the
different ways that they were

571
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,740
touching all sorts of different
levels of reality, but I also

572
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,520
saw a lot of confusion and a lot
of fragmentation in their

573
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,940
experience. They were getting,
it was as if they were getting

574
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,800
bits and pieces. And I found
that when I when they were

575
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,680
describing multiple sessions, it
was as if they were always

576
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,080
starting over again. They were
they were always getting to this

577
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,300
space where they were having
these experiences, but there

578
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,040
wasn't a progressive
development. Mental sequence, my

579
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,600
experience was different than
that. I experienced myself as

580
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,880
being engaged in a long
sustained conversation which

581
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,580
deepened into a communion with a
consciousness which never took

582
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,660
any form. It never took a
particular symbolic form. It

583
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,340
never but it always was there.
And it was orchestrating my

584
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,460
sessions. It was determining
what happened in the sessions.

585
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,240
All I had to do was show up, let
it take me where it would take

586
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,040
me, and then make sense of what
would happen. And making sense

587
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,140
of what happened involved
methodically recording the

588
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,820
session, thinking about it
extensively after the session.

589
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,780
It wasn't simply just a matter
of having a clean context

590
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,960
environment. So good set, good
setting, good preparation, all

591
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,320
those things. It was a matter of
thoroughly thinking about

592
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,980
processing, trying to integrate
intellectually as well as

593
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,840
personally, emotionally and
physically, the experiences that

594
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:09,420
you were having. So I mean, I
was trained as a philosopher. I

595
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,960
was trained as an analytic
philosophy philosopher. So when

596
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,740
I would enter these states, I
would try to enter into it as

597
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,380
clearly as I could and take in
as much as I possibly could and

598
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,160
understand as much as I could
and retain as much as I could.

599
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,860
And I found that if you meet the
universe, or if you meet these

600
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:36,560
states with that kind of
devotion to engagement, it will

601
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,740
orchestrate your experience and
take you as deep as you have the

602
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,860
capacity to go, but you have to
hold the posture at your end.

603
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,240
You have to do your work. You
have to do your side. And your

604
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,820
side for me, involved paying
attention, surrendering, having

605
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,880
the courage to let it take me
where it would take me, having

606
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,940
the courage to die again and
again in this process, but then

607
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,360
writing it down, thinking about
it, trying to figure it out, put

608
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,180
the pieces all together and let
it unfold.

609
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,219
James Jesso: Hmm, interesting.
Yeah, that's great. And later,

610
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:17,039
before we end, I'd like to ask
you a bit about your your

611
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,919
thoughts and advice on on
integration. But you having said

612
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:25,879
that, and when I first heard it,
really, it echoed something that

613
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:29,599
I hadn't been able to give words
to before I wrote a book on on

614
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,499
working with Psilocybin
mushrooms. And that is exactly

615
00:42:33,499 --> 00:42:36,619
what happened to me over the
course of an extended period of

616
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:40,299
time, of using it monthly. It
was like, each time I used it, I

617
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:44,799
got with this, like pay
attention, surrender and trust

618
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:48,699
the process. I just got a
greater level of cognitive

619
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,119
coherency so that I could come
back, I would do all the

620
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,599
writing, I'd explore it that I
could, you know, accurately

621
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,959
articulate. This is exactly
what's happening, and here's how

622
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:01,559
it comes about, and here's Well,
for me anyways, at these dose

623
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:04,439
levels. So that was a really,
that's a really cool language,

624
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:07,739
and unless you want to
particularly comment on that, I

625
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:09,539
have a I have another question
here

626
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,320
Chris Bache: for you. Now, I
completely understand our it's

627
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,620
interesting how our experiences
are so congruent with different

628
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,120
psychedelics. Each psychedelic
has its own quality, but the the

629
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,900
phenomenon of engagement is the
same in all of them,

630
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,460
James Jesso: you definitely went
much deeper than I, much deeper

631
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,520
than I did actually. Let's just,
let's Okay, we're gonna just put

632
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,040
everything on hold for a second
because you said something else

633
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,700
one time that I thought was very
interesting. And I'll just ask

634
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,620
you outright, because I get this
question of a lot. What is the

635
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:47,440
difference between LSD and
Psilocybin? Yeah. Well, I mean

636
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,320
this phenomenologically, not,
yeah, phenomenologically,

637
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,080
Chris Bache: I think of
Psilocybin as very much of a

638
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,900
kind of a body grounded
psychedelic. I feel it very

639
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,720
strongly in my body. It really
when I'm in a Psilocybin state,

640
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,220
this intelligence. It almost as
if it enters into my body. It

641
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,760
sweeps through my body, checks
it out, can identify what's

642
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,420
going on here, there touches,
the emotional feels, and it's a

643
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:22,040
very it's my whole body hums and
glows when I'm with Psilocybin,

644
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,780
something very similar with
Ayahuasca. It feels very your it

645
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,980
takes your whole body into the
experience. My experience

646
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,480
working again with high doses of
LSD and different lower doses,

647
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,500
but with high doses of LSD, it
is such an enormous

648
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:46,600
acceleration, such an enormous
catapulting into deep, deep

649
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,380
states of consciousness. It
almost as if this isn't really

650
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,500
quite true, but in certain ways,
it almost as if it tends to

651
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,860
leave the body behind. And
there's a way in which

652
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,480
integrating the body into those
states of consciousness. Ness

653
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,680
takes time and comes later.
There's a tendency to that's not

654
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,900
a dissociative psychedelic like
ketamine is, but it tends to

655
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,960
sort of drive to what I would
call the high cosmological

656
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,400
ceiling. It tends to throw you
into the high cosmological

657
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,780
ceiling, and it doesn't give
you, for example, in least in my

658
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,380
experience, it didn't give me
contact with the elemental

659
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:30,440
spirits, with the earth spirits,
with the with the the totem

660
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,460
ancestors of the animal or
vegetable kingdom. It just

661
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,240
wasn't working at that level. It
tends to be kind of drive

662
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,040
towards the cosmological
ceiling, so to speak, so it

663
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,160
would drive me beyond my
personal ego, and then it drove

664
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,980
me into the species
consciousness, and then it drove

665
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,480
me into Earth consciousness, and
then it started taking me even

666
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,100
beyond that territory. Cool.
Thank you. I found later that

667
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:02,340
using Psilocybin actually kind
of helped me integrate some of

668
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,780
my LSD experiences precisely
because it tended to open up my

669
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:11,520
body and allowed some of that
high cosmological energy to

670
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,460
enter more easily into my
physical form.

671
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,280
James Jesso: Now were you
taking, were you taking higher

672
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,160
doses of Psilocybin, or more
average, say, five dried grams

673
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,280
of mushrooms, or were you
entering into uh kilinde e

674
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,780
territory, where you're at 2030,
grams, 4050, grams of mushrooms.

675
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,960
Chris Bache: I was probably
working in more standardized

676
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,700
doses with Psilocybin. I wasn't
really trying, and much of the

677
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,080
work I did with Psilocybin was
after I had stopped the LSD

678
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,520
work. I did some intermittently
along the way, but after I

679
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,860
stopped the LSD work, I worked
with Psilocybin and some with

680
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:55,480
Ayahuasca, and what I found is
that it was very helpful towards

681
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,720
integration. I didn't feel like
I was breaking new territory,

682
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,040
and I wasn't trying to break new
territory I was trying to

683
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,400
recover from the territory I'd
already broken into. I was

684
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,620
trying to basically learn how to
walk on the earth again after

685
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,860
having so many transcendental
experiences.

686
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,219
James Jesso: Well, I would be
very curious to see you and

687
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:21,679
Kalin de compare notes of ultra
high dose tryptophan. But let's,

688
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,119
let's, let's, let's go back now
that we're okay, we've explored

689
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:31,579
that. Okay, increasing, you
know, cognitive coherency at

690
00:47:31,759 --> 00:47:37,819
increasing levels of high energy
consciousness, yeah, mixing this

691
00:47:37,819 --> 00:47:42,879
with purification. Okay, so what
I'm curious about, like, did it

692
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:47,199
get easier, or did it stay about
the same as you progressed? And

693
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:51,099
what I mean by this was, is
okay, so in the early phases,

694
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,799
you're just, you're struggling
with all the pain and grief of

695
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:57,879
just letting go of being a, you
know, a white, you know, highly

696
00:47:57,879 --> 00:48:01,979
educated philosopher, a male
This is one of your stories into

697
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:05,639
becoming something else, you
know, like the entire female

698
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:08,639
side of our species. You know,
over time, yeah, you're

699
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,159
struggling with that, the pain
and grief of that, maybe pain

700
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:15,059
and grief of past traumas or
whatever it is. And then, you

701
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:19,259
know, fast forward 15 years, and
you're, you're, you're facing

702
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:23,119
the fear and the discomfort and
the challenge of letting go of

703
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,339
all time and space, and
somewhere in the middle of that,

704
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,539
you're in a would you call the
sea of suffering? You know, when

705
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,479
you're experiencing the
suffering of the entire species

706
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:37,279
of humanity, you know over all
time, simultaneously, you know

707
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:40,719
is it is what you were
experiencing in those later

708
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,439
phases. Was that about the same
level of challenge with a

709
00:48:44,439 --> 00:48:49,059
greater psychic magnitude, or
did it get easier? Did it stay

710
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,299
this? This is what I'm curious
about, really. Yeah, yeah,

711
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,940
Chris Bache: the ocean of
suffering was much harder, much

712
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,960
more demanding to experience
than the dissolution of my

713
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,320
private ego is different, a
different order of magnitude.

714
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,960
Let me have to go back to think
of something I thought while you

715
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,580
were asking the question, I'm
beginning to lose it now. Okay,

716
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,600
I don't I want to be careful not
to over emphasize the negative,

717
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,560
because there's a steady rhythm,
you know, there's the the clear,

718
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,140
the the purification phase of a
session, and then there, there

719
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,320
the ecstatic phase. And to me,
the only thing that makes it

720
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,840
possible to endure the
purification phase are the

721
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,580
blessings that you're giving in
the ecstatic phase. So when I

722
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,780
was processing the ocean of
suffering after a session, it

723
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,360
wasn't just the ocean of
suffering that I was processing.

724
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,020
I was also processing the
enormous gift of my early

725
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,500
unitive experiences, my early
experiences of being taken on

726
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,360
what I call. The cosmic tour, my
early experience of being taken

727
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,380
back to the beginning of
creation. So it's it's all sorts

728
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,440
of wonderful ecstatic
experiences are part of that.

729
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,420
And this rhythm kept up all the
way through. There was a rhythm

730
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,480
of purification and a rhythm of
blessing. And the blessings

731
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,920
always kept pace with this, the
magnitude and the scale of the

732
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,060
purification. So the deeper the
purification went, the deeper

733
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:29,780
the blessings became, until
eventually, once you learn that

734
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,480
rhythm, once you learn that all
you have to do is follow the

735
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,100
purification as deeply as it
goes, and there will be

736
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,360
blessings waiting for you at the
end. At that point, you

737
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,660
literally begin to not avoid
purification. You seek it out.

738
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,340
You want to go as deeply into
that muck as you can, not

739
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,880
because you're a glutton for
pain and suffering. Your your

740
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,480
glutton for what lies on the
other side of that pain and

741
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,600
suffering. Now, in some ways,
the rhythm itself gets easier

742
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,380
once you know that that is the
rhythm, it gets easier because

743
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,320
there is less fear associated
with it. The ordeal may be

744
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,340
intense, but it does not
frighten you as deeply you may

745
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:16,080
get transiently terrified, but
you trust the process. You keep

746
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:22,460
going deeper into it, one of the
worst in the sense,

747
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,960
experientially, most demanding
sessions I ever had, actually,

748
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,400
was the 70th session. It was the
last great vision. I was given a

749
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,580
series of what I would call the
great visions in my work over

750
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:39,500
the years. But the 70th session
put me through a tear down, a

751
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,300
rip down that was worse than
anything I'd ever gone through

752
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:50,680
before. So it in some ways, it
gets easier, but then, if the

753
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,240
universe wants to take you very,
very deep, in order to get to

754
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,200
that depth, it's got to put you
through a process that you need

755
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,860
in order to stabilize
consciousness in that depth. And

756
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,640
in this case, it took me deeper
into what I call deep time than

757
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,740
it had ever taken me before I
use I coined the term deep time

758
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:15,960
to describe a particular
experience with respect to time

759
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,520
and transcending time, you can
go outside of time altogether

760
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,720
into eternity and escape the
envelope of space time

761
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,040
altogether. But I had many
experiences of experiencing

762
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:34,880
certain units of time, certain
spans of time, as an organic

763
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,620
whole. So this began early on by
experiencing my complete life as

764
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:44,140
a totality, start to finish, and
then I began to experience

765
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,680
evolution, the evolution of the
universe and the evolution of

766
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,560
humanity in terms of a time
frame of 10s of 1000s, hundreds

767
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,400
of 1000s of years. So there was
like my consciousness was

768
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,580
extended to 100,000 years, and I
could experience how the

769
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,300
universe experiences that
100,000 years, not how Chris

770
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,220
Bache might experience that so
deep time became a term that I

771
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,640
used to describe different
modalities of time, and

772
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,820
eventually I became convinced
that these modalities weren't

773
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,300
simply projections, and they
weren't simply, you know,

774
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,360
playing, shuffling the cards of
how Chris Bache experiences

775
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,920
time, but somehow I was being
taken into how the universe

776
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,940
experiences time, and the
universe as you move more

777
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:35,960
towards the edge of space, time,
time itself begins to be more

778
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,740
porous this last session. Well,
let me back up one of the things

779
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:46,780
we haven't talked about yet is
many experiences that I had,

780
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:51,460
which eventually became a story
of the evolution of the human

781
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,780
race and where we are in our
evolutionary story, and the

782
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:59,560
particular crisis that we are
coming into As I think our

783
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:05,040
entire species is trying to
outgrow the egoic psychology of

784
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:13,320
the past and move into a much
deeper archetypal No, a much

785
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,000
deeper experience of being a
human which is much more soul

786
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,500
oriented, much More transparent
to each other and to the divine.

787
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,600
The 70th session that I
referenced was my deepest

788
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,280
excursion into deep time, which
took me deep into humanity's

789
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,820
future and gave me one of my
clearest experiences of what I

790
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:40,040
call the future human, the the
human being that humanity is in

791
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:48,220
the process of becoming our next
evolutionary type. So it gets

792
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:53,980
easier, but you never know when
you know it can come up and slap

793
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,800
you hard if it wants to take you
somewhere especially,

794
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,680
James Jesso: yeah, that's
something, something I learned

795
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,000
all too. Well, and is definitely
shared amongst the other deep

796
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,180
explorers that I know it's just
like, just be careful, because

797
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:11,640
as soon as you get brazen, it'll
teach you a lesson. All comes,

798
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:18,300
no matter how competent you
feel. So maybe now is a good

799
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,420
time to to move into some
closing because we're just about

800
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,860
the hour mark here, pretty
quick,

801
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:38,420
you stop doing this Yes, and,
and I kind of already have a

802
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,960
sense of where the answer is
going, so I'm curious how to ask

803
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,540
the question, because I I'm
simultaneously wondering, Why

804
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:53,560
did you stop? Yeah, while also
wondering, you know, what did

805
00:55:53,560 --> 00:56:00,480
these experiences? How did they
change your relationship to

806
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:07,740
dying like your your physical
death as a as human now. Yeah,

807
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,440
that's, that's sort of like the
large, open ended question,

808
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,580
yeah, well, let

809
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,920
Chris Bache: me take that last
question first, because it's the

810
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,780
easiest. I'm so looking forward,
not necessarily, to the process

811
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,760
of dying, but I am so looking
forward to being dead with

812
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,480
absolute and complete
confidence, because I know where

813
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,100
I'm going. I've died. I've made
that transition so many times in

814
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,940
my sessions, I feel very
comfortable with what's going to

815
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:40,480
be happening after this body
falls away. I stopped these

816
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,760
sessions. It's not that I
stopped sessions altogether, but

817
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,000
I stopped this particular series
of sessions. I stopped working

818
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,080
with high doses of LSD for two
reasons. One was pain, and the

819
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,660
other was heartache. When you're
working with such extremely high

820
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:03,300
doses of LSD, there's just an
enormous demands. It places

821
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,060
enormous demands on your body
and on your subtle energy

822
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:10,440
system. And what I found, and
this I talk about, in diamonds

823
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,880
from heaven, what I found is
that, after many years, my

824
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,960
energy was just running so hot.
I was carrying too much energy.

825
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,580
It was like I was almost never
comfortable in my body. I wasn't

826
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,700
having flashbacks or anything
like that, but literally, my

827
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:33,440
subtle energy system was so
taxed by entering in and out of

828
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,440
these states and a rhythmic even
just five times a year that I

829
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,200
had to stop to let my whole
system Calm down, cool down, and

830
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,280
find its new equilibrium. But
the main reason I stopped is

831
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,580
different. The main reason I
stopped was heartache. I

832
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:56,980
literally could not take the
heartache of being separated

833
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:04,020
from the Divine anymore. I had
entered and was entering so

834
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,620
deeply into the diamond
Luminosity, so deeply into the

835
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:12,540
crystalline nature of whatever
you want to call it, the divine

836
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:17,700
or the absolute, or I had
dissolved and lost my body, my

837
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,280
boundaries, and entered and
become light so many times, and

838
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,440
with such exquisite joy that
coming back into time space

839
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:31,940
became just a terrible
heartache. And eventually I

840
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,200
reached a point where I decided
better not to go back at all

841
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,960
than to have to go and leave.
And so I made a kind of an

842
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,920
agreement with I call the
absolute, my words for the

843
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,060
absolute, or my beloved, because
it was a love relationship that

844
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:54,100
unfolded. So I made a deal with
my beloved to never take me back

845
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,840
that deeply again until I would
not have to leave. And that's

846
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,220
really why I stopped my
sessions. I thought that I

847
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,680
could, just because I really
paid a lot of attention to

848
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,220
integration all the way through
the process, you know, I really

849
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,960
tried to do it right, do all the
things you do to really solidly

850
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,600
integrate each individual
session. And I thought that I

851
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,180
could therefore stop my
sessions, and then I would be

852
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:25,880
able to harvest the insights and
the experiences that I had been

853
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,720
blessed with on during those
years. What I found was,

854
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,960
however, that in the years
following, really a number of

855
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,820
years, I began to enter into
what I call the deep sadness. I

856
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:41,920
began to enter into a sense of
existential loneliness. I just,

857
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:50,560
I was so I was missing the
divine so deeply back now in

858
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,000
time and space that basically
life had began to feel all dried

859
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,480
up. I really, I really wasn't
that interested in being here,

860
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,260
and I found that I was just
waiting. Waiting to die. I was

861
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:06,360
just waiting to die so I could
return to the light in years

862
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,020
past. And I began to realize
slowly that this isn't good.

863
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,660
This is not the way it's
supposed to be. I knew that this

864
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:16,200
was not the way it was supposed
to end up, and I didn't

865
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,500
understand what had happened
because I had been so careful

866
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:23,120
with integration all the way
through I It wasn't clear to me

867
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:28,520
where I had where had gone
wrong, but my life was telling

868
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,940
me was screaming, failure to
integrate, failure to integrate.

869
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,820
In time I began to realize that
what had happened was I had lost

870
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:42,880
a balance between Transcendence
and immanence between letting go

871
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,380
and going beyond all time space
reality and being grounded

872
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:52,420
solidly within time and space.
Reality. Time and space is the

873
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,540
manifest body of the Divine. I
know it's the divine. I've

874
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:59,740
experienced it as the manifest
being of the Divine. It's not

875
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,220
that there are two divines.
There's just the you know,

876
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:05,700
transcendent divine and the
immanent divine. But I had

877
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,960
plunged so deeply into the
transcendent divine that I kind

878
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,280
of lost my foothold. I lost my
grounding in the imminent

879
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:20,060
divine, and I made a it took
about 10 years, but I made a

880
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:24,680
determined commitment to
reground myself into physical

881
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,480
existence, to temper my memories
of Transcendence with my

882
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:35,960
appreciation and enjoyment of
the manifest divine around me

883
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:41,140
continuously. And that took a
long time, but eventually I did,

884
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:47,920
and eventually I became more
comfortable being here. One of

885
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,340
the problems, one of the things
I ran into in going through this

886
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:54,700
process, one of the challenges,
wasn't simply withdrawing from

887
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:59,320
this intimate communion, it was
living in the silence that had

888
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,360
been imposed on me by our
psychedelic phobic culture. I

889
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,300
wasn't allowed to speak about my
experiences. I couldn't teach

890
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,180
from them. I could not bring
them to my colleagues. I could

891
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:14,520
not really write in complete
abandon. I could not do what I

892
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,040
had been trained to do as a
philosopher of religion. I

893
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,080
couldn't philosophize based on
these experiences. I wasn't part

894
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:25,820
of a psychedelic subset in Ohio,
and I knew that if I began this

895
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:29,000
conversation, I would be fired.
You know, I would just and I

896
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,260
love to teach. I love being with
my students. So this beat, this

897
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,860
split between my public life and
my private life, became

898
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,920
increasingly burdensome. And
then when I stopped the

899
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,720
sessions, it became even more
burdensome that I I didn't have

900
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:48,460
a place to process my
experiences. So what I found is

901
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:51,760
that there's, there's a level of
integration that could take

902
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,560
place privately,
psychologically, before I

903
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:00,780
started to speak, and then when
I began working on diamonds from

904
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,200
heaven, and I began to give the
talks as i This book was coming

905
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,100
to its conclusion, and I began
to share with people what it

906
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,680
actually what I had actually
done, and where it had gone. So

907
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,920
I could not only share what I
had experienced, but take in

908
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,940
what they had experienced. I
found that the integration of

909
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,380
those experiences began to
deepen. They began to live in me

910
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,120
differently than they had lived
before. I began to speak about

911
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:30,320
them, and that's that's begun a
process that's still continuing

912
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:34,220
to unfold. I don't know where
it's going to go, but somehow

913
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,580
the transcendent divine and the
imminent divine seem to be

914
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:43,420
reaching a deeper merging, a
deeper synthesis in my life now

915
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:47,500
that I finally, you know, shared
the conversation, I've opened

916
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,400
the conversation.

917
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:52,720
James Jesso: There's, there's a
couple more questions I have for

918
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,100
you, if you've got the time,
yeah, this one might be a bit

919
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:03,660
quick. You were just, you were
uncomfortable physically because

920
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:07,860
of this, you know, high subtle
energy. Were you doing any

921
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,820
physical spiritual practices,
yoga, tai chi, anything like

922
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:12,360
that?

923
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,080
Chris Bache: Yes, I was doing,
first, I was doing meditation

924
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,300
and Vajra during all of my
years, and in the last five

925
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:24,620
years, I was really doing formal
Vajrayana practices. I was

926
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:28,040
taking good care of my body. I
was doing yoga. I was really

927
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:33,740
maintaining a very careful at
that time, a vegetarian diet. I

928
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,220
was really taking a lot of care
of my body. I was doing

929
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:41,140
chiropractic care. I was doing
massages. I was really taking

930
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,160
care of the instrument.

931
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,740
James Jesso: Okay, cool. That
was I was curious about, because

932
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,260
that might be an area where it's
like, oh, maybe if you were

933
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:52,300
doing yoga, blah, blah, blah,
yeah. Cool. So this other

934
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,300
question is very personal. Why?
I mean, everything you've shared

935
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,120
is obviously very personal, but
this is the kind of personal

936
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,920
that a lot of people hesitate
to. To share. So you certainly

937
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,120
don't have to answer this. No
pressure, which is, what kind of

938
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:11,820
a toll did these experiences
take on your capacity to be

939
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:16,140
intimate with other people?
Because I know for myself, when

940
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:21,140
I was it's less now, but when I
was going regularly, very deep

941
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,120
into my mushroom experiences.
Yeah, I often felt very

942
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:30,140
existentially alone and like I
couldn't relate to other people

943
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,280
and I couldn't relate to I
didn't I felt like there was

944
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,600
this vital area of relationship
in my romantic partnerships that

945
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,460
was always missing because they
didn't go there as well, and so

946
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,120
I always felt alone in those
explorations. Yeah, so I'm just

947
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,560
curious what kind of because I'm
assuming that your intimate

948
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:55,180
partners weren't going as like
regularly, deep as yourself. You

949
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,600
know, what kind of impact did
that have on your ability to be

950
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:02,100
at the human level and be
intimately relating with other

951
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,420
people or with lovers?

952
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:07,560
Chris Bache: Yeah, I know
exactly what you're referring

953
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,980
to. I understand that
loneliness, and that loneliness

954
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:15,540
was the unexpected cost of doing
this work. I Of all the things I

955
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:19,200
had anticipated entering into
this essentially a shamanic

956
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:24,560
path, the loneliness and
separation from other people was

957
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:29,720
the most unexpected. And it's
kind of curious, because because

958
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,680
of the experiences, my capacity
to enter into other people's

959
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,820
lives, to empathically enter
into their experience, had

960
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:42,820
deepened enormously, but unless
they were psychedelic and Italy

961
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:46,360
initiated themselves, they had
no capacity to understand what

962
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,240
were, to me, the most important
experiences of my life. And so

963
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,560
naturally, a certain distance
grew up between myself and my

964
01:06:53,560 --> 01:07:00,540
social relationships and this
anyway, so there is and there is

965
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:06,240
a sense the world. There's a
place in Carlos castaneda's book

966
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,020
where Don Juan is talking to Don
Genaro, and Don and Gennaro says

967
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:13,500
the world is only real when I'm
with him, meaning Don Juan,

968
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,560
which means there's a sense in
which, if you take up the

969
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,660
psychedelic path, or any
practice which really opens up

970
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:25,400
deeper and deeper levels of
experience. It does inadvertent

971
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,480
it inevitably separates you.
You're on a different road than

972
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,180
the people around you who are
interested only in physical,

973
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:36,800
tangible things. And so there is
a loneliness that comes with

974
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,900
that. I find that this
loneliness is for me is easing

975
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:44,320
as I become more public and I
enter into conversations with

976
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,960
people like yourself, who have
had their own experiences, and

977
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,800
we can share these things, and
it's easier now. In terms of my

978
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,920
most intimate relationships,
I've been very blessed in that

979
01:07:53,920 --> 01:08:01,080
respect. I've been married
twice. Carol was a my first

980
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,380
wife. We were married for 24
years. She was my wife during

981
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,460
all the years when I was doing
this work. She was my sitter in

982
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:13,260
all of this work. She is a very
mystically inclined person.

983
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:18,300
She's a deep Buddhist
practitioner. She never was

984
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:22,160
interested in doing sessions.
They just wasn't she was they

985
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,340
always seemed too violent for
her, and she really was

986
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,760
meditator everything she needed
she found on her meditation

987
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:35,900
cushion. And in some ways, it
wasn't until I began at very

988
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,840
advanced levels of this
conversation, this engagement,

989
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,700
when I was moving into the
diamond Luminosity, that I felt

990
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,840
like I began to understand her
for the first time. So she was a

991
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:51,700
highly developed spiritual being
after we have separated, and she

992
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,240
has remarried, and I have
remarried, she has gone on to

993
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:59,140
complete her Vajrayana training.
She's done her three year, three

994
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:04,140
month retreat with her teacher
in Santa Fe, New Mexico to go

995
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,880
Sonic. So she's a serious
practitioner, and so I didn't

996
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,380
experience lack of headroom in
my conversation with her. I

997
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,920
always felt like, in some ways,
even though the experiences were

998
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,160
different, but in some ways, the
more I did this work, the closer

999
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:27,140
we were coming existentially in
that way, and after, after I

1000
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:32,960
stopped my sessions, we came to
a point where we separated with

1001
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,720
for reasons that don't have to
do with the sessions themselves.

1002
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,780
We just came to a parting of our
ways, and we're still friends

1003
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:45,040
and but then I was blessed with
a second marriage that with

1004
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,000
Christina Hardy. And Christina
Hardy is also a journeyer, so

1005
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,840
she understood experientially
the dimensions that I had

1006
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,540
entered into. She understood
them from her own experience.

1007
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,680
She's also an astrologer, so and
she's very deeply a daughter of

1008
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,640
the earth. Than a daughter of
the stars. So she kind of lives

1009
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,740
deeply grounded in the reality,
in the text, in the textures of

1010
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:12,120
time and space and in the
rhythms of time and space. So

1011
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:17,400
that in my most intimate
relationships, I've been blessed

1012
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:23,300
to be with two women who were
able to understand the unique

1013
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,900
experiences that I was going
through, it would have been very

1014
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:32,600
lonely to be with people who
where you experience intimacy at

1015
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,720
one level, but you don't
experience that intimacy at

1016
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,500
another level.

1017
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,680
James Jesso: Yeah, the final
question that I have, I want to

1018
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,380
hold on it for a second, because
you said something, and I just

1019
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:48,160
want to make sure I understand,
because if, if I understand, I

1020
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,940
think it's an important point.
You said that your first wife

1021
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,660
never she did not want to do
what you were doing because she

1022
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:58,840
found it too violent. And you
said, at a certain point, you

1023
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:03,600
began to understand her. Is that
what you mean? You started to

1024
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,320
understand why she wouldn't
choose to do what you were

1025
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:07,740
doing.

1026
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:13,440
Chris Bache: No, it wasn't that
particularly I, I shouldn't say

1027
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:19,440
focus just on the violence she
really. She's a very gentle and

1028
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,900
a naturally mystical, oriented
person, and she found the

1029
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,140
vehemence of the cleansing
portion of the sessions very

1030
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:31,280
hard for her to relate to. She
also found the temporary nature

1031
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,340
that you would have these deep,
temporary experiences, but then

1032
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,620
you would come back and you
couldn't hold on. You could

1033
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,660
remember them, but you couldn't
embody them. And she was more

1034
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:44,440
attracted to a path where you
basically could hold on to more

1035
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,220
of your experiences. It was a
slower path of initiation, but

1036
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,700
you could hold on to more of
your experiences. What I mean

1037
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:55,600
was by when I say I began to be
able to understand her more

1038
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:03,540
deeply. There is a sense in
which her natural way of tuning

1039
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,140
into the universe, and the
universe that she tuned into

1040
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:11,580
that is what I began to
appreciate more deeply, that

1041
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,820
when, when I began to touch into
the diamond Luminosity, I

1042
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:19,800
touched into a reality that was
so absorbing and so powerful for

1043
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,620
me that basically nothing else
in my sessions mattered except

1044
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:28,280
reconnecting with that reality.
And I began to appreciate how

1045
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:32,840
her entire life, ever since she
had been a girl, had been

1046
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,100
oriented towards accessing and
stabilizing this deep

1047
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,200
participation in the universe.

1048
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:44,140
James Jesso: Okay, that's what
it was. Yes, I got you i I'm

1049
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,060
glad for the clarification,
because I might have

1050
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:49,840
misunderstood as, as you know,
you've said in your talks

1051
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:54,280
elsewhere, that that you
wouldn't recommend this path for

1052
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:58,720
other people, and that, you
know, if you could go back, you

1053
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,860
would be, you know, quote,
easier on yourself, and so I

1054
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:04,380
wondered if that's, if that's
what you were leaning towards,

1055
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,520
Chris Bache: I would be gentler
for a number of reasons. One is

1056
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,060
because I learned that it's not
a matter of getting to an end

1057
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:15,660
destination. It's a matter of
becoming open living as much of

1058
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:20,160
the infinite enter into your
being as you can absorb. And if

1059
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,120
that's the approach. If it's
really about grounding the

1060
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:28,520
transcendent experiences here
and now in this body, then that

1061
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,120
is often served better by
working with lower doses that

1062
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:36,620
allow you to hold on to more of
what you experience. So I really

1063
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,500
don't recommend what I did. I
mean, I really think I pushed

1064
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,060
myself. It It took a great deal
of concentration, a great deal

1065
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:47,680
of commitment to do, to go some
of the places I went. And I

1066
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:51,820
don't think it's necessary in
order to spiritually wake up, to

1067
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:55,420
have the to go where I went. I'm
I just have more compassion for

1068
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:59,200
myself, and I wouldn't want some
people, anybody to to undergo

1069
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,600
some of the things I went
through.

1070
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,319
James Jesso: Okay, thank you.
So, the final question before

1071
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:06,899
the, you know, the
understandable opportunity to

1072
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:09,419
promote your new book and get
people more connected with you,

1073
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:16,559
yeah, is about integration,
maybe a fuller understanding for

1074
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:20,339
us, like what it means to
integrate, because there are,

1075
01:14:20,339 --> 01:14:23,179
there's, you know, one thing
about, you know, writing the

1076
01:14:23,179 --> 01:14:27,859
stuff down. I remember you had
explained that the next day, you

1077
01:14:27,859 --> 01:14:31,939
would write it down, like
narrativize it, listening to the

1078
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:35,899
same music you listen to during
the session, and that you would

1079
01:14:35,899 --> 01:14:39,379
name each session so that as
soon as you looked at the name,

1080
01:14:39,799 --> 01:14:42,639
you would have a sense of what
that session contained, which is

1081
01:14:42,939 --> 01:14:46,419
brilliant. Thank you. On behalf
of all psychedelic explorers,

1082
01:14:46,419 --> 01:14:52,119
thank you for that. And you've
also mentioned the vital

1083
01:14:52,119 --> 01:14:58,359
importance of relationship in
the integration process in other

1084
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:05,399
talks. And so. Those two things
sort of laid out. How do you

1085
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:11,339
integrate something as profound
and massive as the things that

1086
01:15:11,339 --> 01:15:12,539
you had gone through?

1087
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,400
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think some
of the challenges, the personal

1088
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,540
challenges that I faced around
integration, is one of the

1089
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:23,600
reasons I precisely would
recommend that people don't do

1090
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:29,360
what I did, precisely because it
with these substances. We can

1091
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,720
project ourselves. We can
dissolve so deeply into these

1092
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:37,820
vast territories that it truly
becomes mind boggling. How does

1093
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,680
how do you integrate them? In
fact, I mean, as long as you're

1094
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,860
staying inside time and space
and you're uncovering your pains

1095
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,860
of your past and your oncoming
trauma for this life or former

1096
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:50,740
lives, we have therapeutic
models for what integration

1097
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:54,160
looks like and how to do it. And
if you go deeper and you

1098
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,100
experience the intelligence that
runs through all things, and you

1099
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,920
experience, you know, the
certainty of continuity of life

1100
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,540
after death, we still have
spiritual models for what it

1101
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:06,660
means to integrate those
experiences into our life. And

1102
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,360
when you look at the near death
episode research, people have

1103
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,620
very deep one time experiences
of Transcendence. We have a

1104
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,900
sense of how to integrate that
material, but it truly is one of

1105
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,860
the leftover questions of my
life is, what does integration

1106
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:25,280
mean when you when you're going
so deep into deep time? How do

1107
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:30,260
you integrate 100,000 Year
swaths of time into Monday,

1108
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:32,900
Tuesday, Wednesday,
consciousness? How do you

1109
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:36,560
integrate becoming one when you
are, you know, just one among

1110
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,480
many again. How do you
integrate, you know, going so

1111
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:44,020
deep into the future that you're
looking at the next evolutionary

1112
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:47,080
stage of the human process. How
do you integrate that with

1113
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:51,160
coming back and going back to
work in the morning after I

1114
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:54,280
finished my session, shortly
thereafter, in my morning

1115
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:59,500
meditation, Spirit said to me,
20 years in, 20 years out. And I

1116
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,520
thought, okay, I understood what
that meant. It would take me at

1117
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:06,420
least 20 years to integrate the
experiences that I'd cultivated

1118
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,900
over those 20 years, and I
thought that sounds about right,

1119
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:13,920
but now dark matter, the
diamonds from heaven, will be

1120
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,580
published 20 years after I
stopped my session. So I really

1121
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,480
have been looking at how much
I've been able to hold on to

1122
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,980
during those 20 years and where
it's taken me. And as I

1123
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:30,080
mentioned, the depth of the
loneliness that I experienced

1124
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,260
was not because of a failure in
my sessions. It was actually

1125
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:37,340
because of success. The success
that you have entering into the

1126
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:40,600
universe becomes the challenge
of integration when you come

1127
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:49,900
back again, I found that as long
as I was keeping silent, as long

1128
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:53,740
as I was really not
communicating from my center

1129
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,540
about these experiences,
immigration could only take us,

1130
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:03,420
could only proceed to a certain
level when I wrote dark night,

1131
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:06,900
early dawn, where I first began
to unpack some of these

1132
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,500
experiences that allowed me to
enter into some conversations

1133
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,460
that allowed this integration,
this deeper integration, to

1134
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:18,420
manifest. But it wasn't really
until I began to write diamonds

1135
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,980
from heaven that I began to
experience a deeper level of

1136
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,520
integration manifest. And I
guess the way I would put it is

1137
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:31,100
like this, I don't think you can
integrate the infinite into the

1138
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:36,140
finite. It's very definition.
Almost you can't integrate

1139
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:39,380
infinity into finite existence.
The only thing you can do is

1140
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:43,600
integrate your finite existence
into infinity. You must

1141
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,980
surrender to the infinite,
moment to moment, day to day,

1142
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:52,360
opportunity to opportunity. You
must kind of become a servant of

1143
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:56,740
the infinite, surrender
completely to that involutionary

1144
01:18:56,740 --> 01:19:02,220
process that Sri Aurobindo talks
about. And I think that, I mean,

1145
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,580
I'm I'm a teacher. My natural
instinct is to learn and to

1146
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:10,380
share. And the laws around
psychedelics interrupted my own

1147
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:14,460
natural way of being in the
world. Now that I'm retired, now

1148
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:18,300
that I've passed my statute of
limitations for my psychedelic

1149
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,260
crimes, now that I can speak
about these things now that I

1150
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:24,560
can those two different sides of
my life are coming together. And

1151
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,280
really, for the first time in my
adult life, I feel like I'm

1152
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:32,180
beginning to be a whole person
again, as I'm beginning to be a

1153
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:35,780
whole person, something is
happening in my relationship,

1154
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,680
within myself, in the universe,
and also something is happening

1155
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,120
in my relationship with other
people, because the depth of the

1156
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,880
consciousness which is alive in
me is also the depth of the

1157
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,820
consciousness that's alive in
you. And so when we come

1158
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:55,120
together, this deeper kind of,
you know, fluctuation surfaces

1159
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:58,120
underneath both of us, and I
find this when I'm teaching and

1160
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,960
when I'm working in workshops or
with groups. Which is a deeper

1161
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,800
aliveness that in earlier years
I had to hold at bay, I had to

1162
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,280
kind of tamp down. Now it's
beginning. Now I can let it come

1163
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:13,320
through. Now it comes forward. I
don't know where this deeper

1164
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:16,080
integration is going to go. I
don't know where it's going to

1165
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:20,960
take me. It's taking me places
that I have not been before,

1166
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,560
except in the sessions, but in
times of my physical

1167
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,100
consciousness, my time space
consciousness, there is a

1168
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:34,880
certain transparency that
catches me up, that's fresh, and

1169
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:42,400
there is a certain wholeness
that arises when I'm with people

1170
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:47,800
that is fresh and I don't know
where it's going to go another

1171
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,760
20 years of this, it's I have no
idea where it's going to lead

1172
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,180
me, but I like it. It feels
natural, and it feels like

1173
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:59,080
integration is continuing to
take place. So I don't consider

1174
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,860
myself finished with this
integration process at all.

1175
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,420
Cool.

1176
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,180
James Jesso: Well, thank you
very much for that, Chris and

1177
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:10,620
thank you so much for this whole
conversation today. Me too, give

1178
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:15,300
maybe you could end us off with
letting the listeners know where

1179
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,140
they can find out more about
you, where they could get your

1180
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,300
your I'm not sure if your
diamonds from Heaven is released

1181
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,900
yet, but your three books what
their names are, as well as your

1182
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,040
social media handles.

1183
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,360
Chris Bache: Well, actually, my
website is still in the process

1184
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:38,960
of being made, so can't go there
yet, but soon, diamonds from

1185
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,280
heaven, the book that we've been
talking about will be released

1186
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:48,520
from inner traditions in 2019
probably next summer, in this

1187
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:54,460
it'll be in the second half of
2019 my three earlier books was

1188
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:58,300
first life cycles, which is a
book on reincarnation research.

1189
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:03,060
Second book was dark night,
early dawn, where I basically am

1190
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,000
integrating psychedelic research
and incorporating my own

1191
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,800
experiences with near death
episode research and out of body

1192
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,660
research. So it's an extensive,
unfortunately kind of

1193
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:20,300
academically dense, if rigorous
but dense discussion of some of

1194
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:26,000
these issues. The third book is
called the living classroom. All

1195
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,580
of these are available on
Amazon. The living classroom

1196
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:32,360
basically is describing
something that was happening in

1197
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,860
my classroom while I was doing
my psychedelic work in the

1198
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:39,380
backside. I don't talk about
psychedelics there at all, but

1199
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,620
it's about fields of
consciousness. It's about the

1200
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:45,640
contagious nature of states of
consciousness. Because what I

1201
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:49,660
found was that when I was doing
this work and keeping it private

1202
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:52,780
from all my students,
nevertheless, some of my

1203
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:56,800
students started to be activated
by my own work. And so I, you

1204
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,360
know, it was like I began to
understand and have to work with

1205
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:04,260
the contagious quality of states
of consciousness, and then

1206
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,340
diamonds from heaven, is the
book just finished, where I

1207
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:11,940
basically go back to the very
beginning and simply take people

1208
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:15,060
through layer by layer, the
entire sequence of events,

1209
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:19,860
because I found that you can't
even begin the philosophical

1210
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:24,980
conversation about psychedelic
states, unless people, in this

1211
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:28,160
case, editors of professional
journals and things, unless

1212
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:31,940
they're convinced that these are
legitimate experiences. And the

1213
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,820
only two ways to be convinced
that these are legitimate

1214
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:39,980
experiences is to either have
the experiences yourself or to

1215
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:44,980
be to undergo a secondary
initiation by reading other

1216
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:47,920
people's accounts of their
experiences and kind of picking

1217
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,940
up on it through kind of
osmosis, and that's what I'm

1218
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:54,640
hoping that diamonds from
heaven. I don't think my

1219
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,880
experiences are special or
unique in any way. They may have

1220
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,020
pushed a little harder than some
people, but I think they fall

1221
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:04,260
within the broad range of
experiences that people have.

1222
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,500
I'm just trying to lay them out
in an organized fashion so that

1223
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:11,100
people can become more familiar
with these states. And I hope,

1224
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,820
maybe, hopefully, it'll, it'll
help people in their own

1225
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:18,180
psychedelic work, but I also
hope it will be useful to people

1226
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:22,400
who never take a psychedelic,
because it's what's important is

1227
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,100
not the method, but what the
method teaches us about the

1228
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:28,760
universe itself, and as a
philosopher, that's what my

1229
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:33,440
interest in, is letting people
see the universe as the universe

1230
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,060
showed it to me in these
sessions.

1231
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,120
James Jesso: Yeah, beautiful.
Thanks. Thanks so much. Chris.

1232
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:40,340
Are you on social media
anywhere?

1233
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:45,880
Chris Bache: I'm on Facebook,
but I really, I'm not really

1234
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:49,360
well grounded in social media.
I'll have my website up

1235
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,000
hopefully within just a couple
of months, and I'll be

1236
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:56,140
collecting, I mean, my talks are
scattered all over the web. You

1237
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,600
know, if you Google me, you'll
come up with a whole bunch of

1238
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,160
videos and talk. Books, but I
haven't consolidated them and

1239
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,320
presented them in a in one
place.

1240
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,800
James Jesso: Cool. Well, I will
make a little bit of an effort

1241
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,860
to consolidate some stuff,
including links to all your

1242
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:14,040
books where people can buy them,
and your website once it's live

1243
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:18,480
at James W jesso.com under the
page that has the show notes to

1244
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,200

1246
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,600
Chris Bache: today, James, my
pleasure. It was a great

1247
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,380
conversation. Really appreciate
your probing questions. Really

1248
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:27,860
excellent.

1249

1
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,660
Chris Bache: The good news, do I
have a mic? Yeah, the good news

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,880
is that after me, it's lunch, so
I'm the end of your day. Now,

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,940
I'm a professor. I've been at
this game a long time, so I know

4
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,940
a tired audience when I see one.
It's been a long morning and a

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,120
lot of wonderful ideas. So I'd
like to take real quick.

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,120
Everybody. Stand up. Just stand
up

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,660
Unknown: and stretch your arms
out. Bring in that more good

8
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,800
energy. Bring it in.

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,780
Chris Bache: Okay, okay, now sit
down.

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,900
If the most important
philosophical question one can

11
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,280
ask in life is, do we survive
the death of our body, which Dr

12
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,780
Van lohm is asking, I think the
second most important question

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,240
is, do we live once, or do we
live more than once? And it all

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,760
hinges on time, the problem the
significances of time as a

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,780
teacher, if I give a quiz, I
have a right to expect a certain

16
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,460
performance from the students.
If I give an hour exam, I have a

17
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,340
right to expect a higher level
of performance. And if I give a

18
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,580
take home research paper, I
expect a higher level of

19
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:44,860
performance because they have
more time, if this universe, if

20
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,840
this magnificent universe that
we are in, has a purpose, then

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,980
as a philosopher, we can, we
have to measure the purpose of

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,280
the universe proportionate to
the time. We have to fulfill

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,760
that purpose. If we only live
one time, then we might

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,360
extrapolate or estimate or
calculate the purpose of

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,620
existence to be but if we live
100 times, if we live 1000

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,100
times, if we live 10,000 times,
if our participation in this

27
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:29,360
magnificent universe is truly
open ended, then we have a very

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,180
different relationship with the
universe, and then we have a

29
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,040
reason to think about the
possible purpose of existence in

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,100
a completely different
framework. And the religions of

31
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,840
the last 4000 years, have had a
tendency to not value physical

32
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,240
existence. They've had a
tendency to say, well, you

33
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,060
achieve realization, you achieve
enlightenment, and then you

34
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:56,200
leave Nirvana, Samsara, you
escape. Samsara, moksha, escape

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,980
or you achieve salvation, and
then you leave. But that leaves

36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,760
the fundamental question, what
is the purpose of the universe?

37
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,360
Unanswered. What is the purpose
of my physical existence in the

38
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,400
universe? But if we come back,
if we come back to this life

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,300
many times, then we have a
different story that begins to

40
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,680
unfold, and it doesn't. I think
it. I think our understanding of

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,900
reincarnation is completely
incomplete at this point, just

42
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,960
as we've begun to understand the
true depth and breadth of the

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,860
universe that we are part of,
likewise, when we begin to

44
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,520
understand that we participate,
we're dancing with this universe

45
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,680
for extended period of time,
then we have a deeper

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,700
understanding of what the
universe might actually be

47
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,860
trying to accomplish in us, and
what might be our gift to the

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,460
universe in the continual
refinement and compounding of

49
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,600
our talent over time. So what
I'd like to do today is talk

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,940
about the evidence for
reincarnation, and I've been

51
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,180
thinking about this and been in
this game for a long time the

52
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,720
first book I wrote, it was, is
life cycles. And notice how long

53
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,820
ago I wrote it. It was the first
book I wrote as an academic, and

54
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,360
that is a signal of how
important I think this topic is,

55
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,820
and that there is good, critical
empirical evidence that allows

56
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,480
us to decide this topic. If
there weren't critical evidence,

57
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,960
then it would just be a wasted
exercise. And I think this

58
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,520
evidence did not exist 50 years
ago, and the theologians used to

59
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,180
debate about reincarnation go
round and round. But today, we

60
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,500
have a different body of
physical of empirical evidence

61
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,800
on reincarnation that has moved
the topic from the theologians

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,060
table to the psychologist table
to the philosopher's table to

63
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,540
the to the psychiatrist table,
and that's what I'd like to take

64
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,900
you through some today. Now when
looking at the evidence for

65
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,220
reincarnation, we can either
look at go small or go large. We

66
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,760
either look at the detailed
cases in or we look at the

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,320
larger body of literature. The
Beauty and the real joy is in

68
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,140
the detailed cases. But in 45
minutes, I've chosen to go

69
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,640
large. What I would really like
to do is encourage you today to

70
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,640
read one book on reincarnation
that you haven't read yet, and

71
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,920
so I want to take you into some
of the literature on

72
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,800
reincarnation and show you some
of the patterns that are

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,880
emerging in the literature and
rebirth. Okay, ready to go?

74
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:40,900
Let's go 20 cases suggestive of
reincarnation. By Ian Stevenson,

75
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,220
this is a book that changed my
life, because, like many people,

76
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,960
when I finished graduate school
in 1978 I was an atheistically

77
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,760
inclined agnostic. I was trained
in philosophy of religion, but

78
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,260
all that training basically made
me an atheist. But when I

79
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,000
encountered this book, right
after finishing graduate school,

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,060
he turned my life around because
he convinced me that there was

81
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:18,240
evidence that we live on life
more than once. He is the Okay,

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,140
good Steven. Stevenson is the
Carlson professor. Was the

83
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,200
Carlson professor from the
University of Virginia between

84
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,560
1967 and 2001 he has written 11
books on reincarnation. Some of

85
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,200
the most important are these
cases of reincarnation, type

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,580
written over a seven year
period, from 73 to 84 unlearn

87
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,440
language, languages by children
about children who have an

88
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,140
ability to speak a language
which no one in their family

89
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,880
speaks, no one in their entire
town speaks, sometimes an

90
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,680
ancient language, children who
remember previous lives. And his

91
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,280
last book, his Monu mopis, a
1000 page, two volume work, a

92
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,260
study of 187 cases of children
who not only have detailed

93
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,540
memories of their most previous
of their immediate life, but

94
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,620
actually carry the scars in
their body which relate to the

95
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,880
death wounds of the body in
their previous personality. And

96
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,320
that, of course, really upsets
academics. I mean, it's one

97
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,800
thing to have continuity of
memory that's bad enough, but to

98
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,500
suggest that a wound of death
can actually be transferred into

99
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,740
the physical body of a
subsequent personality that

100
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,320
drives my colleagues right up a
wall. But 187 cases, well

101
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,960
documented case histories. It's
a magnificent book. What are we

102
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,140
looking at with Stevenson? We're
looking at cases of children

103
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,180
from around the world who have
detailed recall of their most

104
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,280
immediate recent life. They know
their way around towns that

105
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,020
they've never been in before.
They can recognize persons when

106
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,300
they're brought into the life
place of the previous

107
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,380
personality. They can recognize
persons that they have never met

108
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,600
before. They know the personal
history, their personal history

109
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,280
with that person. They have the
appropriate emotional responses

110
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,560
with that person. Husbands, for
wives, children. You have cases

111
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,000
of a five year old child who is
showing all the feelings of the

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,860
husband of a 35 year old woman
with all the emotional

113
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,900
responses. There is one case of
a child called parmed When he

114
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,620
was reunited with the family of
the previous personality. He was

115
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,100
very shy around the wife of the
previous personality. He

116
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,980
wouldn't identify her until she
left the room, but then he

117
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,960
identified her, and then later
he took her aside, and he said

118
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,920
two things to her. He said, I've
come but you've not fixed bindi,

119
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,460
which is the spot that Indian
women wear on their Ford, is an

120
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,180
indication that they're married.
And he also criticized her for

121
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,780
wearing a white sari instead of
a colorful saree. And the

122
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,200
tradition in India is when you
become a widow, you don't wear

123
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,920
color from the rest of your life
you're wearing only white.

124
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,700
Essentially, this five year old
boy was saying to this 35 year

125
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,840
old woman, I've come but you're
acting like you're not married.

126
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,460
They know the inner architecture
of homes that they've never been

127
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,640
in. They know people who owed
them money when they died and

128
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,800
the debt had not been collected.
In one case, this little child

129
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,700
was brought back to the home of
the previous personality, and

130
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,720
the wife of the previous
personality said, Okay, if

131
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,680
you're my husband, where did you
put the will? We couldn't find

132
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,080
the will. Will. The little boy
walked over to a floorboard in

133
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,020
the kitchen, pulled up the
floorboard and pulled the will

134
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,080
out of this little secret place
that only he knew about in the

135
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,720
floor of the kitchen. Cases like
that drive my philosophical

136
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,380
colleagues at the University
right up a wall. They don't know

137
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,880
what to do with it. It's hard
for them deny it, but there it

138
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,080
is. Some patterns in the data,
the average time interval

139
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,320
between the death of the first
personality and the birth of the

140
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,520
second personality. Stevens
finds about two and a half years

141
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,920
the average distance between the
life place of the first

142
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,060
personality and the life place
of the second personality 50

143
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,220
miles and these children tend to
lose their memories around the

144
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,300
year, around eight years old,
when they become begins to get

145
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,720
into school and in a more
complex social environment, they

146
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,800
basically forget. They lose
their memories. So we're looking

147
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,760
at a small time window from
research, from about three years

148
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,180
old to eight years old, a five
minute time window to get to

149
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,900
these children and document
their memories. The remaining

150
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,960
90% forget them by the time
they're eight. The remaining 10%

151
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,780
the vast majority of those,
forget them when they hit

152
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,160
puberty, when they hit puberty,
you know, all hell breaks loose,

153
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,520
and they forget their subtle
traces of their former lives.

154
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,300
Stevenson asks, Why do these
children remember what most of

155
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,700
us forget? And his answer is, he
doesn't know we need more

156
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,420
research. It's all research. He
has a hypothesis. He points out

157
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,300
that about 60% of these children
died violently in their previous

158
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:57,220
life. The remaining 40% died
either early, suddenly or with

159
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,920
an acute sense of unfinished
business, like a mother who dies

160
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,320
shortly after the birth of her
baby. His hypothesis is maybe

161
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,440
there's something about the
trauma of being wrenched from

162
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,100
life violently, suddenly, with
an acute sense of unfinished

163
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,420
business that encodes the
consciousness in a way that

164
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,240
draws them back faster than
usual and closer than usual,

165
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,240
because this time, I don't have
time to give all the evidence,

166
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,020
but this two and a half and 52
and a half years 50 miles, is

167
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,640
faster than the population at
large and closer To home than

168
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,780
the population at large.

169
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,736
In reviewing 20 cases suggestive
of reincarnation, the Journal of

170
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:49,816
American Medical Association,
wrote, Stevenson has

171
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:54,376
painstakingly and unemotionally
collected a detailed series of

172
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:58,696
cases in which the evidence for
reincarnation is difficult to

173
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:03,660
understand on other grounds. Two
years later, the Journal of

174
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,780
Nervous and Mental disease, a
major psychiatric journal in the

175
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,560
United States, published an
entire journal devoted to

176
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,700
Stevenson's cases. And it was
such an unusual move that they

177
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,540
published an editorial to
justify or to explain their

178
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,940
rationale, and in the editorial,
they wrote. Our decision to

179
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,500
publish this material recognizes
the legitimacy of his research

180
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,340
methods and the conformity of
his reasoning to the usual

181
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,480
canons of rational thought.
That's the way an academic

182
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:43,120
qualifies their endorsement. Now
the philosophic philosophical

183
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,800
institution, the guardians of
Orthodoxy, are not going to let

184
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,240
Stevenson get away with this,
not without a fight. And he has

185
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,220
had his critics, and the most
important critic is a man named

186
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,900
Paul Edwards. And I promise you,
this is the best picture I could

187
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,180
find of Paul Edwards online his
book reincarnation of critical

188
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,640
examination. Paul Edwards was a
major American philosopher. He

189
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,540
taught at the New School for
Social Research. He's best known

190
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,160
for having been the editor in
chief of the eight volume

191
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,220
Encyclopedia of Philosophy. So
he's a major heavyweight in the

192
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,620
philosophical tradition. He
wrote a series of articles in

193
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,800
1986 to 87 a four part article
on reincarnation. And eventually

194
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,180
he published these articles in a
later form, in this book,

195
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:46,960
reincarnation and his he is the
harshest critic of Stevenson. He

196
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,600
accuses Stevenson of fraud. He
accuses Stevenson of not being

197
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,800
sufficiently rigorous in his
analysis of the data. He accuses

198
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,440
Rhee Stevenson of not actually.
Actually verifying that he

199
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,440
thinks that there could have
been contact between the two

200
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,980
families, that Stevenson isn't
really critical in proving that

201
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,040
these families, the first and
second personality, have never

202
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,420
had contact. But there's
actually a deeper you know, to

203
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,620
accuse someone of bad research
and to prove bad research two

204
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,300
different things. And if you go
through Stevenson's arguments

205
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,240
very carefully, I'm sorry,
Edwards arguments very

206
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,440
carefully, you see that there's
kind of a deeper logic operating

207
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,220
in his work. He says
reincarnation would represent a

208
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,880
crucifixion of our
understanding. And by our

209
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,620
understanding he means secular
humanism, the philosophical

210
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,800
scientific tradition, the
Newtonian, Cartesian

211
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,220
philosophical tradition. He
says, If you believe in

212
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,720
reincarnation, you must accept
what he calls six collateral

213
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,760
assumptions. And these
collateral assumptions are that

214
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:05,160
materialism is false, that that
mind is not reducible to brain,

215
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,540
that our identity is more than
our personality, that there is a

216
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:19,260
domain other than space time,
that death is an illusion, that

217
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:26,060
there may be a deeper logic to
our lives. Edward says these

218
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,600
assumptions are surely
fantastic, if not indeed

219
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,760
nonsense, and even in the
absence of a demonstration of

220
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,260
specific flaws, a rational
person will conclude either that

221
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,120
Stevenson's reports are
seriously defective, or that his

222
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,420
alleged facts can be explained
without bringing in

223
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:54,460
reincarnation. Well, I won't go
over Edwards arguments more

224
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,900
carefully, because Robert out
Robert almiter has done this for

225
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,880
us. Robert almiter is another
major American philosopher. He

226
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,300
is Professor Emeritus at Georgia
State University. He has

227
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,120
authored, or co authored, 24
books. He wrote this book in

228
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,600
which he is evaluating five
categories of evidence for

229
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,720
survival of death, the major
analysis he's doing in this book

230
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,400
is the debate between Stevenson
and Edwards, and what he shows

231
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,420
by analyzing Edwards' argument
is that Edwards does not refute

232
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,800
Stevenson's argument. What he
does is refuse to even look at

233
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,300
it seriously, because he is so
convinced that it must be false.

234
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,000
He says his argument constitutes
a blatant bit of question

235
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,320
begging, because he always
assumes precisely what is in

236
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,840
contention. What is in
contention is, Can consciousness

237
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,300
exist without a brain? And
because he believes that science

238
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,300
has proven that consciousness
can exist without a brain,

239
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
therefore we know that there
must be something wrong with the

240
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,500
evidence. Albert says if you
have a very commanding argument

241
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,940
that you can that you cannot
refute, then not to accept the

242
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:25,280
argument is to act irrationally.
Rationally, Stevenson's

243
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,060
tradition continues, even though
he's passed on, he's now looking

244
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,480
from the bleacher seats,
watching us from there. This

245
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,140
book by Tom Schroeder, old
souls. Tom Schroeder wins the

246
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,840
definitely wins for having the
award for having the worst cover

247
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,420
of any book in reincarnation
research. But Tom Schroeder is

248
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,840
an interesting guy. He's a
reporter, he's a Pulitzer Prize

249
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,140
winning reporter. He's also one
of the editors for The

250
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,100
Washington Post, a major
American newspaper, and he was

251
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,724
interested in whether
Stevenson's research could stand

252
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:04,924
up to a critical reporter's eye,
so he went with Stevenson on one

253
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:07,804
of his trips around the world
studying these small children.

254
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:12,544
He looked over his shoulder, and
he came away convinced, as the

255
00:19:12,544 --> 00:19:15,844
subtitle shows, compelling
evidence from children who

256
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:20,900
remember past lives, convinced
that this Stevenson's methods

257
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,560
were good, the data would stand
up. These children were real.

258
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,060
This is a compelling case for
reincarnation, and at the

259
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,540
University of Virginia,
Stevenson's work continues in

260
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,320
the person of Jim Tucker, who
has now inherited Stevenson's

261
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,400
chair. This book is a wonderful
book, very much in the Stevenson

262
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,840
tradition, continuing to look in
detail the detail cases, and

263
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,460
explaining why these cases
cannot be attributed to weaker

264
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:59,920
hypotheses like super psi or
something like this, I might.

265
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,260
Mention that Jim Tucker's book
is a lot easier to read than

266
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,640
Stevenson's book. Stevenson
writes and thinks like a lawyer.

267
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,220
It's very good, but it's very,
very detailed, very dry. Jim

268
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,240
Tucker brings a little more life
to the subject matter. Now

269
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,600
everything we've been looking at
so far has to do with what I

270
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,720
would call the evidence from
spontaneous memories, just

271
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,920
children who spontaneously have
memories of previous life. But

272
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,620
there's another body of
evidence. You have to approach

273
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,760
it with a different framework.
It's evoked memories, memories

274
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,040
which have been evoked in some
way, different techniques. Even

275
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,880
massage can evoke a former life
memory, but the most common one

276
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,820
that we're familiar with is
hypnotherapy, some type of

277
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,300
hypnosis. The following cases,
the following books are

278
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,200
representative titles of people
who have worked in the field of

279
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,040
past life therapy. My favorite
book written by a single

280
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,480
therapist who has worked in the
area of past life therapy and

281
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,040
has thought about it a great
deal. Is this book by Roger

282
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,920
Wilber. Notice the date an
earlier book, other lives, other

283
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,320
cells, started as a Jungian,
ended up in past life therapy,

284
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,500
doing past life's work, even
though Carl Jung, I don't know

285
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,440
whether you probably know, he
himself believed in

286
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,680
reincarnation towards the later
years of his life, but he kind

287
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,960
of kept it quiet. This is a
wonderful book, intellectually,

288
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:41,860
totally competent, a wonderful
review of detailed cases and a

289
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,900
discussion of the implications
of these cases. Past life

290
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,800
therapy began to really explode
in the 70s, 80s, and there were

291
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,620
a lot of therapists who were
concerned that there was not a

292
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,620
graduate school, there was no
curriculum, there was no agreed

293
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,300
upon curriculum for how to
establish the credentials for

294
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,960
people who wanted to do past
life therapy, and this task was

295
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,620
taken on by Winifred Lucas, who
wrote a magnificent two volume

296
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,000
anthology, which is a compendium
of essays and articles of the

297
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,780
best of the best of the people
working at that time in past

298
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,120
life therapy. So if you wanted
to read a single book, I would

299
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,920
read Wilbers book by one author.
But if you wanted to see an

300
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,400
overview of multiple people
writing in the field, I would do

301
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,900
Winifred Lucas' book regression
therapy, a handbook for

302
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,860
professionals.

303
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,060
Carol Bowman was a social
worker. She wasn't interested in

304
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,680
past life therapy. She got into
it because her son started

305
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,640
having nightmares. He started
waking up with very disturbing

306
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,380
nightmares, and she approached
him. She tried to work with him,

307
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,200
took him to therapist, tried to
do conventional things, but it

308
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,680
didn't work. And then she began
to do her homework. She began to

309
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,920
look into past life therapy. She
began to learn the field, and

310
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,140
she began to help her own child
solve his own trauma carried

311
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,500
over from a previous life that
was both spontaneously bubbling

312
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,580
up in his life. She began to
attract other people, with other

313
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,760
children who are also having
problems, and eventually she

314
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,140
wrote this beautiful book,
specifically a therapeutic book

315
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,480
for parents who have children
who are having traumatic memory

316
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,100
surface that they're having
difficulty dealing with was very

317
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,900
successful, very persuasive. It
really made, had a lot of

318
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,620
impact. She got more business
coming in. She wrote a second

319
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,760
book. She gets the award for the
second worst title cover on

320
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,480
reincarnation book, return from
heaven. She's looking

321
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,000
specifically at relatives who
had been reincarnated within

322
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,920
their own families. Now, as a
philosopher, that's a weaker

323
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,700
body of evidence, right? Because
there's so much potential for

324
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,700
contamination if you're
remembering your grandfather.

325
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,840
But as a father, this is
interesting. It's interesting,

326
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,840
because reincarnation simply
doesn't happen where it works

327
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,900
well for the researchers, across
great distances and great

328
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,740
families, but inside families is
a very common occurrence, and

329
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:40,960
therefore it deserves to be
looked at. And next. Michael

330
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,060
Newton, two wonderful books, and
I must confess a special

331
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,020
partiality if you want to read
some, if you wanted to just pick

332
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,920
out one or two books out of this
entire list, I can't help but

333
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,300
wish that you would read Michael
Newton's work. Michael Newton

334
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,820
was a Hypnotherapist. Who got
into past life therapy and was

335
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,200
doing past life therapy, and
then he accidentally discovered

336
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,280
that his clients in deep
hypnosis had the ability not

337
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,180
only to remember their previous
life, but to remember what

338
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,900
happened to them after they
died. They could remember

339
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,340
basically, his clients were
beginning to describe the

340
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,360
afterlife, and he thought, he
didn't think this was possible,

341
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,460
but he followed his clients, a
good therapist that he is, and

342
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,260
he took hundreds of people into
deep hypnotic regressions, and

343
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,140
he followed them when they would
go through their former life and

344
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,560
they would go through the death
experience, he would follow them

345
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,060
into their memories, continuing
on, and then he would ask them

346
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,140
questions. And he kept detailed
notes. He would ask questions

347
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,080
about, what was this, what was
going on, what was it like? And

348
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,000
what he found was, regardless of
what background people came

349
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,720
from, whatever their cultural
enculturation was,

350
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:08,220
fundamentalist Baptist, Karl,
Marxist, atheist, hard core,

351
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,460
scientific reductionist.
Whatever their background was,

352
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,660
people were describing the same
fundamental reality in the after

353
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,540
death state. They were
describing a world that had

354
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,360
order, that had structure, that
had logic. There was actually a

355
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,920
social structure. It was a world
in which older learners taught

356
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,940
younger learners. And it was
also a world where people made

357
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,800
the choice to reincarnate as a
conscious, careful decision.

358
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,180
It's one of the most important
choices you make if you go to

359
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,980
college, what courses you sign
up for, that's an important

360
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,320
choice, because once you sign up
for a course, you're committed

361
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,700
for the entire semester. When
you incarnate, what life you

362
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,440
take on is an important choice.
And Michael Newton found that,

363
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,900
in fact, in the spiritual world,
the choice of what life to take

364
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,060
is a consciously taken choice,
made under the guidance of your

365
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,720
spiritual helpers, and made in
cooperation with the other

366
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,680
persons that you're going to be
incarnating with. So before we

367
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:20,120
knew, before we were born, when
we knew more than we know now,

368
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:26,360
when we were aware of more than
we are aware now, we chose the

369
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:33,920
life that we are living now,
that fact alone just bears deep

370
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,980
meditation. Two last examples,
not from professionals, they're

371
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,360
from amateurs, but that's what
makes them interesting. The

372
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,540
first is this book looking for
Carol Beckwith, and what makes

373
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,560
it interesting is the man who
wrote it, Robert snow. Because

374
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,520
Robert snow is the commander of
the homicide division of the

375
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,300
Indianapolis Police Department.
All right, so he's Chief of

376
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,300
Detectives of he investigates
murders. His opinion is very

377
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,200
important. It must stand up in
court. He would be the last

378
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
person that you would think
would be doing research on a

379
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,160
former life. But it happened
that he kind of, he did a hypno

380
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,700
a hypnotic session, not oriented
towards past lives. He just kind

381
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,680
of on a lark, he did the
hypnotic session, and in this

382
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,640
hypnotic session, he was hit in
the face with a life that

383
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,920
appeared to be his life, but it
was it scared him to death, and

384
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,840
he literally ran out of the
room. But he was curious, and so

385
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,540
he brought all of his detective
skills to the systematic search

386
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,500
to see if he could identify and
track down whether there was

387
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,100
such a person. And the story of
his experience and the story of

388
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:53,320
his detective work is told in
this short book looking for Carl

389
00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:00,360
Beckwith. And lastly, this book,
Sole Survivor, which you may

390
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,900
have seen it because they did
some news clips, decent news

391
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,160
clips on it, written by Bruce
and Andrew leininga about their

392
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,180
son, James. And this is a case
of a child, three years old, two

393
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,220
years old, who started having
spontaneous memories and trauma,

394
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,600
waking up crying in the middle
of the night, spontaneous

395
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,520
memories of appear, apparently
dying in World War Two as an

396
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,480
airplane pilot over the over the
coast of Japan. And his father

397
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,200
was a fundamentalist Baptist,
and he was absolutely,

398
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,240
vehemently opposed to his son
reincarnating. Mother was a

399
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,960
little more receptive. So they
got involved in first they

400
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,880
wanted to help their son, but he
got involved in the the inquiry

401
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,800
because he wanted to disprove
reincarnation, whatever was

402
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,640
going on with James. He wanted
to disprove reincarnation to

403
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,720
protect his faith. So in the
end, they tracked down this

404
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,320
pilot. They tracked down this
story. They were able to reunite

405
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,760
James with the people at a
military reunion, with the

406
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,480
people who had served with this
pilot. And James was able to

407
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,660
identify people out of this
group. The father became

408
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,760
convinced that, in fact, his son
was the reincarnation of this

409
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:30,680
pilot, and reincarnation is
true. Now I'd like to just

410
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,160
finish with two, two
observations. Quick observation

411
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:40,540
says, lunch awaits. I'd like to
emphasize what we don't know

412
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,040
about reincarnation. The
evidence for reincarnation may

413
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,180
be compelling. However, we don't
really know a lot about how

414
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,040
reincarnation takes place, or
what the physics of rebirth is.

415
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,440
We're still beginners in this at
this point, we can't say what

416
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,820
the soul is or what it's made
of. How does it come and go from

417
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,600
the physical body? How does it
interface with our biology and

418
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,520
our genetic makeup? How does it
encode its previous learning

419
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,540
into our present body? And how
does it leave with its learning

420
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,820
intact after we die? These
things right now are beyond our

421
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,780
present grasp. I'm sure we'll
make progress in the future, but

422
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,060
before we do, we're going to
have to start we're going to

423
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,300
have to stop reducing mind to
brain, and we're going to be

424
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,900
have to approach this research
with a more multi dimensional

425
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:44,740
metaphysical cosmology. And
lastly, I'd like to point to a

426
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,520
certain paradox in the evidence.
And to do this paradox, I need

427
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:54,520
to really go back to Ian
Stevenson, Stevenson's evidence,

428
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,240
I think, is the most powerful
evidence for reincarnation. And

429
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,800
his evidence liberates our
thinking at one level, but it

430
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,720
also constricts our thinking at
another. Because the strongest

431
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,840
evidence for reincarnation comes
from lives that show the

432
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,540
tightest connection, the
tightest correlation. But the

433
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,560
correlation can be so tight it
can lead, if you just study

434
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,620
Stevenson's evidence, it can
lead to an

435
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:28,760
anemic an under developed vision
of what life is like when we

436
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,360
die, when most of us die. In
that respect, we must remember

437
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,380
that Stevenson's cases are not
typical cases. These children

438
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,480
are coming back very fast and
very close to home. Most people

439
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,260
spend much more quote time in
the timeless condition of the

440
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:51,040
spirit world. They have a much
wider breadth of experiences. So

441
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,980
Stevenson's evidence liberates
us to thinking about the soul

442
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,600
and thinking about our lives and
thinking about our existence in

443
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,380
a much larger expanded
framework. But in order to

444
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,880
actually fill in that Canvas, in
order to actually explore more

445
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,840
deeply what happens to us when
we die, and what the larger

446
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,260
circle of life is like, from
expanded consciousness to

447
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,840
contracted consciousness and
back into expanded

448
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,640
consciousness, we need to look
at other bodies of data. I think

449
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,580
Michael Newton's work is an
important body of data that

450
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,760
gives us a larger vision. And
this afternoon, when I talk

451
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,540
about psychedelic research, I'll
look at another body of data,

452
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,900
which I think can give us an
expanded vision of our life in

453
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:42,980
this universe. Thank you very
much. Applause.

454
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,580
Unknown: Again, Chris, again.
Thank you so much. This was,

455
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,760
again, a real experience to
listen to you, and I so much

456
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,840
like how you how you make clear
that this is the knowledge which

457
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,740
makes really such a difference
how we live our life, which

458
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,920
makes such a difference how we
approach every minute in our

459
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,740
life. If this is true or not,
makes the real difference, like,

460
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:27,440
I think all the three speakers
of this session fitted together

461
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,640
so well. It's, I think it's so
much arranged, and it's really

462
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:37,280
the core of the Institute for
existential consciousness,

463
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,340
because these are the real
existential questions. And there

464
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,240
is a scientific basis, and we
have to bring it to society to

465
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,300
make a shift in consciousness
again. So thank you very much,

466
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,360
and I'm so much looking forward
to your next lecture. You.

1
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:03,392
Rachel Fleming: Hmm, diamonds
from heaven. It was LSD in the

2
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:06,092
mind of the universe. Was that?
Was that the title?

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,332
Chris Bache: Yes, that was the
publisher's title, but my title,

4
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:11,852
while I was writing the book,
was always diamonds from

5
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:15,932
Rachel Fleming: heaven. Okay,
beautiful. Absolutely, I've been

6
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:19,292
a fan of your books. Actually,
Colin, and I talk about you

7
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:23,360
regularly about your books, I've
been a fan. Reincarnation was

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,060
wonderful, and then the one in
the middle, and then then the

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,660
LSD books been fabulous. So a
lot of the people here do not

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,840
know your research methods. So
kind of, what I would describe

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,840
you as, kind of, is an explorer
of the outer reaches of the

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,640
cosmos, really kind of in search
of the truth of reality, and

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:56,200
really what it means to be kind
of human in this reality. And

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,520
your research method is deeply
interesting. And I would love if

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,060
we you could start us off by
telling us about about what that

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,800
is and what your work has been.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,720
Chris Bache: Well, what we all
share in the animistic community

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,100
is the belief that nature is
infused with consciousness, is

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,700
fused with mind and soul. And of
course, now we know how vast the

20
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,980
physical universe is, and the
question becomes, how large is

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,240
the mind of the universe? How
deep is it? And so I was just

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,160
out of graduate school in 1978
in my finish in philosophy of

23
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,020
religion, and I met the work of
Stanislav Grof, who many of you

24
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,680
know, one of the foremost
thinkers in the Transpersonal

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,100
psychology community, in the
psychedelic community, and I

26
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,060
read his book, realms of the
human unconscious, and my life

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,720
pivoted with that book, because
I immediately saw that his

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,300
research was relevant, not only
to clinical psychology, but also

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,840
to philosophy that it would he
was offering a method to

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,680
actually safely and
systematically explore the

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,680
deepest levels of consciousness,
wherein lay the answers to the

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,400
philosophical questions that I
was carrying coming out of a

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,020
training in religious studies.
So in 1979 I began what became a

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,820
20 year journey, working with
LSD. And it was 1979 LSD is what

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,540
Stan had done his research with,
and that's what I chose to

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,360
continue with. If I were doing
it today, I would have a more

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,920
diversified cocktail of
Ayahuasca, Psilocybin, more, but

38
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,760
I worked with LSD, and I chose
to work with very high doses,

39
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,680
for reasons that are too
complicated to go into now, but

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,220
that had a profound impact on
the work, because it not only

41
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,960
changed how deep the went work
the work went, but It changed

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,080
how wide it went. The field of
consciousness that I took in

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,320
these transformational exercises
expanded with the power of the

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,340
state of consciousness that I
was entering to enter into these

45
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:22,400
exercises. So basically, I did
this work in standard grafian

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
protocol, totally isolated from
the world with the sitter, a

47
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,180
trained clinical psychologist.
Sitter, I did it at home, in a

48
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,720
controlled environment, totally
internally focused, not in any

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,680
with any contact of the outside
world, amplifying the states of

50
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,180
awareness with carefully
selected music designed to

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,260
empower the states of
consciousness in which you

52
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,180
basically just Shatter your
mind. In essentially working at

53
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,600
these levels, you just Shatter
your mind, and your mind

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,500
dissolves out into subtler and
subtler forms or aspects of

55
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,680
reality, and it became a
systematic exploration of what I

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,340
think of as the mind of the
universe. I hesitate to call it

57
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,120
the divine, though sometimes I
do. It's just because the divine

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,660
has so many culturally infused
qualities in history that I'd

59
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,420
rather avoid. So I think of it
as the mind of the universe. And

60
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,460
I did this work for 20 years,
always keeping very careful

61
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,560
records and whatnot and and then
i i digested those experiences

62
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,920
for another 20 years, because
this is these are not

63
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,760
immediately transparent
experiences. They're very

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,480
complex and interwoven, and they
involve many levels of reality

65
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,580
being orchestrated in the same
kind of title, surges of these

66
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,760
states. And there was a
systematic instruction I found

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
that one session more or less
started where the other session

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,900
stopped. When you work in this
system. Systematic fashion,

69
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,060
there was a progressive
deepening and deepening and

70
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,140
deepening. And so it just took
years for me to understand what

71
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,160
the universe was showing me and
where it was taking me and I was

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,100
being shown things. I mean, I
always had a sense of a

73
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,440
systematic encounter with an
intelligence that was

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,240
orchestrating my experience in
dialog with me, not taking any

75
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,760
form, never taking any any deity
form or any archetypal form, but

76
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,560
always when pressed dissolving
into deeper and deeper layers of

77
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,200
infinity. Anyway. So that is,
cumulatively, the story that I'm

78
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,720
telling in LSD, in the mind of
the universe.

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,180
Rachel Fleming: And would you
say, Chris, that this is an

80
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,780
objective reality, that if
anybody that did a similar

81
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,720
method, I mean, I think, I think
what you did was incredibly

82
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,820
brave. But would would everybody
kind of reach this unfolding

83
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,440
that you did using that method?
Or is that not possible to say?

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,980
Chris Bache: No, I think, I
think it is possible to say I

85
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,780
think Stan Grof work allows us
to say it, and where he's

86
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,320
dealing with integrating the
experiences of 1000s of people,

87
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,800
and I'm only talking integrating
my experiences, but my

88
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,020
experiences fit comfortably
within the larger matrix that

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,360
Grof is work has explored, and
it's a complicated answer,

90
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,840
because on the one hand I want
to say yes, and on the other

91
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,920
hand, I have to qualify that
immediately, because when you

92
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,120
begin this work, these
substances only amplify

93
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,020
consciousness. They don't give
you an experience, they don't

94
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,160
take you a particular place.
They amplify your mind. And

95
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,520
because each of us has a
different life story, then the

96
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,000
mind which is amplified is
different, and we therefore,

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,800
when an amplified mind engages
the deeper mind of the universe,

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,660
what comes forward will be, in
the beginning, somewhat unique

99
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,320
and will reflect our individual
history. And that's why these

100
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,760
substances are very helpful for
healing. They evoke our

101
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,720
unconscious, and therefore they
evoke our problems. And it's an

102
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,400
individual experience. But if
you keep going farther, if you

103
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,860
press to the limits of of your
time, space, identity. If you

104
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,120
press to the limits of what your
individual history can hold and

105
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,440
go through this transformation
we call ego death, then you

106
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,900
begin to open into spiritual
reality, farther removed from

107
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,920
your own personal history. And
that's when the experiences

108
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:47,440
begin to overlap. That's when
they begin to converge. Now, my

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,280
understanding is that spiritual
reality is not simply something

110
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,460
you enter and pluck fruit from,
like plucking an apple from a

111
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,480
tree. It's interactive. It's
always interactive. So there's a

112
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,700
participatory quality to our
experiences. So the mind that we

113
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,460
bring to the encounter acts as a
seed catalyst. It crystallizes a

114
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,140
certain set of experiences from
the infinite potential of the

115
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,500
mind of the universe. And then
as we internalize those

116
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,960
experiences and are purified by
those experiences, it changes

117
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,700
the seed bind, and then we it
catalyzes an even deeper level

118
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,820
of secrets from the universe. So
it's a both and situation,

119
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,560
participatory. But once you
understand the cycle of

120
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,740
participation, then I think the
universe that we discover is

121
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,060
coherent and consistent. My
universe is the same universe

122
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,080
that is discovered by
contemplative monks, the

123
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,880
mystical traditions, the near
death episode traditions. There

124
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,360
are degrees of depth, and then
we have to be careful, because

125
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,420
you can reach a point where you
think, Oh, this is what the

126
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,440
reality is. And it turns out,
well, no, this is what reality

127
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,860
is at this level of reality, but
you can pop that and go into a

128
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,580
deeper level of reality, and
things change a bit.

129
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,540
Rachel Fleming: One thing that I
find really exciting about your

130
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,700
work is that we talk about
practices. You know that finding

131
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,420
the right practices, to find the
cracks kind of in ourselves, to

132
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,920
get back to a much more porous,
expanded way of being, and yet

133
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,220
these practices take repetition
and tenaciousness and

134
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,420
everything, and you have used a
different method. Here. You've

135
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,260
used what, what one might kind
of think of as a fast track to

136
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,980
some of these experiences. I
mean, it's a very difficult

137
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,460
method, and I'm sure not one
that you would kind of recommend

138
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,660
to a lot of people, but that
that feels for me, where the

139
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,920
excitement of your work is as
you fast tracked a lot of sleep.

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,400
Lower practices and possibly got
to the edge of the map that a

141
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,040
lot of these contemplative
practices have got to. I feel as

142
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,340
though you've managed to go
further than than much that I've

143
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,020
seen before on kind of what the
underlying nature of reality is.

144
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
Would you say that's

145
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,380
Chris Bache: true, it is a fast
track, except it's a fast track

146
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,160
that doesn't allow any
bypassing. So the fact that it's

147
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,220
a fast track means it's a much
more intensely concentrated

148
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,380
track. So purification, which in
the conventional spiritual path

149
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,820
would be drawn out over years,
can take place within days. And

150
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,600
as any woman who's given birth
knows, a short labor is not

151
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
necessarily an easier labor,
it's just much, much more

152
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,280
intense. And this is true for
this type of practice, true the

153
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,680
purification that one goes
through in order to acclimate to

154
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,400
these subtler and cleaner and
clearer states of reality, those

155
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,700
purifications and
detoxifications are extremely

156
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,020
intense. I mean, they send you
in convulsions across the floor,

157
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,240
in throwing up, constantly
coming and going, and they

158
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,360
require a systematic
purification of your lifestyle,

159
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
just as any traditional
spiritual practice does, and I

160
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,000
want to emphasize that the
states of consciousness that I

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,160
touched for hours at a time, we
usually only learn about these

162
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,200
realities from the work of
contemplative mystics who have a

163
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,480
certain sense of they abide in
these realities. And I emphasize

164
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,800
that this is a practice, not of
abiding. It's a it's a temporary

165
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,240
access. It's only temporary
immersion in these states. And I

166
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,340
don't want to confuse temporary
immersion from abiding immersion

167
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,040
all honor to the Great Ones who
abide in these realities. You

168
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,400
know, this is different. This is
temporary access, very, very

169
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,920
intense purification. But you
don't come away with permanent

170
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,420
access, embedded in your nature,
to these realities. What you

171
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,760
come away with are seeds of
Transcendence, or seed

172
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,960
experiences, which you then have
to nurture within your your

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,200
daily spiritual practice. You
have to nurture them within your

174
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,060
embodied, physical existence.
And I also want to mention that

175
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,840
these practices in the earlier
times in history have tended to

176
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,920
be associated with a
dissociative spirituality. So

177
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,400
the goal was to get up into
Transcendence and get away from

178
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,700
Earth, you know. So these are
the up and out cosmologies of

179
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,000
the last five Axial Age,
religions of the last 5000

180
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,140
years. The cosmology that
emerged in my work is very

181
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,480
different. It wasn't about
getting Transcendence. There was

182
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,140
Transcendence in service of
incarnation. Transcendence and

183
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,400
service of deeper integration.
It was about opening up and

184
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,120
letting in as much of the
universe as possible, and then

185
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,640
going through the
transformations that would allow

186
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,520
this energy to live in the
historical body, and giving me,

187
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,460
at one point, insights into
where the evolutionary

188
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,140
intelligence was taking the
human family as a whole. I began

189
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,260
this work thinking in terms of a
personal model of

190
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,240
transformation, but things
happen that just shattered that

191
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,440
model, and I began to understand
that I was had been drawn into a

192
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,300
collective transformation, and
that my my so called individual

193
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,220
work, was part of a collective
process, which then naturally

194
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,440
lead, yielded some Insights into
our collective family, human

195
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,240
family, evolutionary trajectory,
fantastic.

196
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,340
Rachel Fleming: And I want to
ask you about that in great

197
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,060
depth in a minute, because for
me, that's kind of the exciting

198
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,160
thing that you discovered, if
you like. But first of all, I'd

199
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,020
love to ask you about the
aliveness and intelligence in

200
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:25,280
the universe. Then we are
talking about the aliveness and

201
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,760
intelligence in everything
around us, you know, in humans

202
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,860
being just one load of that, but
just kind of as is everything an

203
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,180
animate world and animate
universe. I just wondered if you

204
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,900
could summarize your
understandings of the aliveness

205
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,340
in the universe and how layered
that is, and how deep that goes,

206
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,260
how big it is, yes, what did you
What have you mean?

207
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,680
Chris Bache: Well, you're asking
a lot because it, you know, the

208
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,660
universe is so vast, and the
mind of the universe. Has so

209
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,680
many layers to it, and those
layers are, of course, all

210
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,280
complexly interwoven, and it's
all alive, and it's all

211
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,660
intelligent, and it's it's
everywhere we dig into the

212
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,900
universe, of course, we discover
aliveness and intelligence.

213
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,980
We're finding that we can't dig
in anywhere and not encounter

214
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,800
this intelligence, this living
intelligence. So when you dig

215
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,660
into the mind of the universe,
you find layers of intelligence

216
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,880
operating there. There are
layers of intelligence operating

217
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,080
in the biosphere, operating in
the incarnational rhythms of a

218
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,340
planet I began to experience at
one point, for example,

219
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,220
reincarnation, the I had gone
into, sorry to cut so many

220
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,760
corners here, but there's no way
to do it except jump into it, go

221
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,120
into states of consciousness in
which time was radically

222
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,400
dilated, not eternity, not
timelessness, but radical

223
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,820
dilations of time and dilations
of personal boundaries, so

224
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,800
dissolving into my human family,
becoming the human family, and

225
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,520
from that perspective,
experiencing reincarnation, the

226
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:24,020
pulse of reincarnation, taking
place, all of us together as a

227
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:30,260
single organism, incarnating
generation by generation. And I

228
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,340
experienced whole lifetimes,
incarnating in generations,

229
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,780
living their lives, dying and
returning into the spiritual

230
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,240
reality. And there was an
intelligence to this entire

231
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,840
process so that all of our, what
I had previously thought of as

232
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,560
individual karma, individual
challenging, individual

233
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,400
transformation, all of our
individual karma was part of a

234
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,380
vast network of exquisitely
tuned collective karma, and our

235
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,300
and history was expressing the
rhythms of collective

236
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,260
transformation through the
medium of our individual

237
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,640
transformation, just one
example, and then going deeper,

238
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,780
beginning to experience the the
pulse of the entire universe as

239
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,840
A single living organism. And
when you when you dissolve it

240
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,400
into that level of oneness. You
know, the Buddhists have a word

241
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,800
for it. They talk about Nirvana,
blown out. Self is blown out. Or

242
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:40,600
Shunyata, emptiness of self when
you experience the world as one

243
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,300
in any scale, then you
experience that there are no

244
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,840
permanent boundaries between
yourself and the world. So

245
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,360
literally, there is no private
self. And so the self kind of

246
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,440
pops and life runs through you.
You run through life, and the

247
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,020
whole of life breathes as one.
It breathes together, as platoon

248
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,420
has said, So everywhere you
touch it, the world is

249
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,280
intelligent. At the very end of
my journey, after in the 70th

250
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,760
session out of 73 I did 73
sessions. In the 70th session, I

251
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,840
was taken deep, deep, deep into
what I call deep time, farther

252
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,100
into time than I had ever been
taken before and given a series

253
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,780
of visions. And one of those
visions had to do with

254
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,080
experiencing in some way, from
my perspective and my history,

255
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,000
the large story of what was
happening in the universe. And I

256
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,440
experienced reincarnation. I was
experiencing the same deep

257
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,980
pattern, and I experienced stars
of light shooting out of time

258
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:03,540
and space, shooting into the
universe. And I understood that

259
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,200
these were what I call diamond
souls. These were the fruition

260
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:14,520
of a reincarnation process
creating a diamond pure, a soul

261
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,960
that could explore the spiritual
world in dimensions previously

262
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,760
unavailable to it, that time and
space was creating diamond souls

263
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,100
over vast periods of time, so
layers and layers and layers of

264
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,500
intelligence operating at
different levels.

265
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,200
Rachel Fleming: So when I read
your book, Chris, I mean, it's

266
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,140
literally mind blowing. I mean,
it's kind of it feels as though

267
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,320
it's science fiction, or it's in
the realms of science fiction.

268
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,380
And yet, for me, there was
nothing in there that didn't

269
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,700
sound right. You know, it just
kind of has that feeling of, ah,

270
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,180
yes, I understand this, and it
feels right to me. And I. Love

271
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,000
to talk to you about the
evolutionary process. You

272
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,220
touched on it a bit there, but
let's go into that in more

273
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,420
detail. But first of all
reincarnation, because that is

274
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,920
something that obviously we
don't all feel is true. But you

275
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
did earlier work on the subject
of reincarnation, and just

276
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,380
before we go on to the
evolutionary story that you've

277
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,620
seen, could you talk about a
little bit about reincarnation

278
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,220
and your work on it, and why you
believe that that is what's

279
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,880
happening?

280
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,540
Chris Bache: Well, I did. I
wrote my first book on

281
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,120
reincarnation because I thought
it was such an essential

282
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,380
principle, because our
philosophical roads divide. If

283
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,640
you think we only are on earth
one time, or we're on Earth

284
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,240
multiple times, those lead to
different visions of reality.

285
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,380
And today, I think we have
overwhelming empirical evidence

286
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,620
that reincarnation is simply
true. It's a fact of life. I

287
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,560
think Ian Stevenson at the
University of Virginia and his

288
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,740
study of young children around
the world who have spontaneous

289
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,660
memories of their most immediate
life. He's just documented

290
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,500
hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of these children, and

291
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,200
his research has been
challenged, but it's still, it's

292
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,100
holding up. And I think he is
the Charles Darwin of

293
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,240
reincarnation studies. And then
we have past life therapies,

294
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,720
people coming in, highly
qualified people healing using

295
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,280
past life access to past life
memories to heal present life

296
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,800
traumas. This, to me, is just an
empirical fact of life. So after

297
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,120
living it takes a long time to
sort of live in a reincarnation

298
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,000
universe to understand the
implications of the fact that

299
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,300
there's this pulse of life, and
that all of us have been here

300
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,960
multiple times, and all of us
have deeper histories with

301
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,220
place, with people, with
projects, and that we're always

302
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,040
starting something and we're
continuing something in one

303
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,620
lifetime, and we're doing
something that's Going To be

304
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,320
continued in another lifetime
that this overlapping complexity

305
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,820
so that I don't see little
children as little anymore, and

306
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,200
I don't see old people as old
anymore. Sometimes little

307
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,180
children are deeply old in soul,
and old people are sometimes

308
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,060
very young in soul. And so it's
you just tune to a different

309
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,940
level. Now I had that in the
early stages of my psychedelic

310
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,620
work. And in the early stages of
my psychedelic work, I was taken

311
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,900
into some of the nuts and bolts
of reincarnation and karma, and

312
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:45,640
then that became kind of ground
one as I began to be taken into

313
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,280
the human family and to
experience the human family

314
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,720
evolving and growing through
reincarnation. This, to me,

315
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,720
reincarnation is simply the
higher octave of evolution. It's

316
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,040
the cutting edge of evolution in
our particular species, where

317
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,880
evolution ch was trying to
change whole species.

318
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,040
Reincarnation is evolving
individuals within certain

319
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,520
species. And I don't think just
human species. I think somewhere

320
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,920
lower down the line,
reincarnation begins to turn and

321
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:28,340
gestate, and then the question
becomes, well, where is

322
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,780
reincarnation taking us, if we
are reincarnating so many times,

323
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,060
where are we going? What's
going? What's the whole project

324
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,680
of it? What's the purpose of it?
And to determine to answer the

325
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,840
question, what's the purpose of
a reincarnating species is

326
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,220
complicated, because once you
understand that every human

327
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,780
being on the planet is
reincarnating with a purpose,

328
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:59,140
its specific purpose, then you
realize the full breadth of the

329
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,480
living experience of human
being, the breath of what's

330
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,440
being learned, that what
humanity is learning is just

331
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,760
enormous. And when we try to
say, well, this is the purpose

332
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,420
of life, we have a tendency to
sort of take a purpose that we

333
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,800
can identify with and maybe over
generalize it to encompass all

334
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,660
purposes. So we really have to
look at the whole of the human

335
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,800
family and gestate the whole of
the things that people are

336
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,180
learning to even begin to come
up with some generality that

337
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:38,720
encompasses them all. You see
what I mean. So, so in some

338
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,200
cases, we can be learning love,
we can be learning generosity,

339
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,680
we can be learning strength of
self. We can be learning

340
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,460
physical defense. We can be
learning surrendering physical

341
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,780
defense, what one person is
growing into in one lifetime,

342
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,200
another person may be growing
out of, and both of them are

343
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,540
living in. Their truth at a
process level. Most of the

344
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,040
Eastern religions basically say,
Yes, you grow, you activate the

345
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,040
chakras, you bring higher and
higher levels of consciousness

346
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,300
online. But when your
consciousness opens up to divine

347
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,180
essence, when it opens up to the
you that is more real than any

348
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,020
of your individual, private
incarnational use, the divine.

349
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,520
You, the essential you. When you
open up to that, then you reach

350
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,540
enlightenment, what the Hindus
call moksha, means you can

351
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,040
escape, you can leave. So once
you wake up, then let's get out

352
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,180
of here. There's better places
to be than Earth, so that's an

353
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:48,100
up and out cosmology. But what
happened in my sessions was

354
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,780
different than that. I reached a
point about halfway on my

355
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:59,020
journey when all of my former
lives began to come into me. I

356
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,540
was in a again, a kind of a
pregnant time, reality of deep

357
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,840
time. And my former lives were
coming in and were coming in,

358
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,160
and it was like wrapping a
filament of kite string around a

359
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,840
spool. But that's string was
human experience. It was whole

360
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,380
human lifetimes. And they kept
coming together, and they

361
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,220
reached a critical mass, and
when they reached a critical

362
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,440
mass, they fused into one. And
when that happened, there was a

363
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,940
tremendous explosion of energy,
and a diamond Luminosity

364
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,220
exploded from my chest. And
that's when I began to

365
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:43,480
understand, and was shown, that
we make progress incrementally,

366
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,500
lifetime by lifetime, as we
incarnate. But the goal is not

367
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,600
simply to make incremental
progress. The goal eventually is

368
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,300
that all of our lives come
infused into one and we become,

369
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:06,060
on earth, a being who has
100,000 hundreds of 1000s of

370
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,980
years of history in it, awakened
within it, and empowered within

371
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,340
it. That is the being that we
are becoming, and that is a

372
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:20,840
different kind of being than an
egoic being. It's the vast depth

373
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,160
of its heart is deep is bigger.
The breath of its mind is

374
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,160
bigger. The texture of its
social relationships is bigger,

375
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,180
and its relationship to nature
is different because it knows

376
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,480
that the world we leave is the
world we inherit. It has a

377
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:44,320
deeper, embodied texture of its
relationship with nature. And my

378
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,060
discovery was that this is not
simply a path of individuals.

379
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,660
This is simply a story of
individual spiritual awakening

380
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,860
that we are all going into this
transition. We are all giving

381
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,020
birth to the diamond soul. The
entire species is at a point in

382
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,800
its history where it can no
longer afford the luxury of

383
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,960
trying to live on this planet in
the fragmented egoic state. When

384
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,880
a world order is created by
egos, it leads to a fragmented

385
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,500
order that serves some and not
others, but when the soul wakes

386
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,340
up to the with the profound
compassion of its history, the

387
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,960
soul lives on this planet
differently than the ego does,

388
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:37,400
and I think we are coming into a
very profound, tumultuous period

389
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,680
of history, which I think of as
A birth process. It will feel

390
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,060
like a death process. And it is
a death process. It's basically

391
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,620
destroying the culture that was
built by the ego, and destroying

392
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,980
the ego which built that
culture, and in that process of

393
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,660
dying to that which is small,
giving birth to something new,

394
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,040
giving birth literally to a new
stage in the human story, not a

395
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:11,220
new body politic and New
Economics, and a shift I think,

396
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,420
is taking place at the depths of
the collective unconscious. The

397
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,560
plate tectonics of the
collective psyche are shifting

398
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,600
in that Jungian sense deep, deep
down inside the human psyche.

399
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,420
This transformation is taking
place so that all human beings

400
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,640
who are born after this
transition will be living their

401
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,560
individual life within the
matrix of a different collective

402
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,080
psyche that I think, is the work
of the hour. That's what we are

403
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,400
working to. And part of this to
actualize, and part of this is

404
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,540
reawakening to the divine
presence which we've stripped

405
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,820
out of nature tried to
unsuccessfully, but reawakening

406
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,800
to this common ground that. We
have with nature to this

407
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,040
intelligence that surrounds us
and saturates us.

408
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,120
Rachel Fleming: Wow, Chris. I
mean, I'm imagining that people

409
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,060
hearing this for the first time,
it's kind of difficult to get

410
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,900
your head around it. And I'm I
want to bring Colin in in a

411
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,480
minute. So to summarize, in my
kind of terms, and what you're

412
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,160
talking about, really, is the
evolution of the human species,

413
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,200
individuals and collectively,
towards a position where we can

414
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,060
remember our entire history. So
if we take reincarnation as a

415
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,860
given, then we're evolving
towards a place where we can

416
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:45,880
remember past, our past
incarnations on this earth. And

417
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:52,000
you know, Colin, can I bring you
in here? Because there's

418
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,400
something that you talk about.
You know, in reanimating

419
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,160
ourselves, we need to have a
completely new cognitive

420
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,320
framework. You know, the that
the the the way of connecting to

421
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,460
the intelligence in the universe
is so foreign to us now that we

422
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,980
need a whole different framework
to kind of be able to wrestle

423
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,480
with with that kind of
information. What's your feeling

424
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,880
about what Chris is talking
about. I know you've read the

425
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,780
book too, and I know you love
it. So biased question here, but

426
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,460
yeah, from your perspective.

427
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,240
Colin Campbell: Thanks, Rachel.
Well, first of all, I really

428
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,300
wanted to say how much of an
honor it is to meet you, Chris.

429
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,100
I have to say, you know the
encounter with your books, and

430
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,860
the first one I encountered was
dark, night, early dawn. Was was

431
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:51,220
really well, tectonic in nature.
For me, it was, and I'm filled

432
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,640
with questions. And was, and
have been all the way through

433
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
reading your books and re
reading them and reading them

434
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,740
again, thinking about it and
brewing on it, and a lot of the

435
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,060
questions I really want to ask,
I have no idea how I would even

436
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,460
articulate. I can feel them and
I can sense them, but how, and

437
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,800
I, you know, so, I mean, I can
see, feel myself at the sort of

438
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,560
edges, you know, of my, what I
call my present cognition,

439
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,720
because, you know, I was, I was
lucky enough to be born into and

440
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,300
brought up within a traditional
indigenous culture here in

441
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,640
southern Africa. And through,
through my childhood, lived in

442
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,600
wilderness and among people who
had a very, very particular

443
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,140
relationship with wilderness and
a cosmology that came out of

444
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:51,400
that. And subsequently, I find
myself, you know, in in the

445
00:32:51,400 --> 00:33:00,420
worlds of post industrial world,
trying to reconcile that part of

446
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:07,380
me with the part of me I find
myself in now, and finding that

447
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,380
there's it's very difficult to
bring it feels like, in a

448
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,560
certain sense, that there are
two cognitive frameworks within

449
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:18,300
me at some level, and that
somehow I'm tasked with trying

450
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,880
to reconcile these two parts of
myself and reading, reading

451
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,580
through your books, I you know
where I found myself, find

452
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,140
myself pulled back into the
cognitive system, really, that I

453
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,620
grew up in, and that forms a
kind of an under structure

454
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:40,720
within my experience now and but
I mean within that, then I have,

455
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,020
I have questions. I mean loads
of them, which, which your books

456
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,580
really, really brought up in me.
And among them, among the most

457
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:55,000
difficult to articulate our
questions around time and and

458
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,560
the notion that somehow, rather,
you know, so reincarnation is

459
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,520
not something that really comes
into the cosmology is here in

460
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,720
southern Africa, and yet it
does. It's implicit in certain

461
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:15,480
terms. But I'm really so as we
look at this idea of

462
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,420
reincarnation and the cognitive
framework that I would perceive

463
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,580
it from here as we speak about
it relies on a sequence of time

464
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,960
that speaks of a past from which
we come and a future to which we

465
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:35,600
go. But what happens if we take
that out, if, in fact, if in

466
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,680
fact, that's merely my present
cognitive framework. But you

467
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:46,840
know, how would we understand
reincarnation and the notion of

468
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,240
a trajectory towards something,
if time in its kind of sequence

469
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,980
from beginning to seeming
culmination, or some such thing?

470
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,440
If that wasn't the case? Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know if I'm making

471
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,360
any sense.

472
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,920
Chris Bache: It's a good
question. If you if we eliminate

473
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,300
the arrow of time, then
reincarnation begins to look

474
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,080
like multi incarnation, not
reincarnation. Some people have

475
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,500
conceptualize this. We're living
all of our lives simultaneously

476
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,080
in a and we're interacting all
these lives are active and

477
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,020
interacting in a way that
befuddles the logic of linear

478
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,920
development, and it requires a
different kind of logic. And

479
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,960
I've tried to think in that
world multiple times, and I

480
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,420
basically keep coming down to I
can't do it. I mean, I literally

481
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,540
cannot live in a world where
Multi incarnation makes sense. I

482
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,340
can't make it make sense. Now,
another little thread, Robert

483
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,100
Monroe, from the Monroe
Institute of Applied Science,

484
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,280
out of body guy you know, has
been wrote three wonderful books

485
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,600
in the out of body state,
exploring the universe daily

486
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,440
from the out of body state. He
says, You reach a point in your

487
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,100
spiritual development where you
discover that you can incarnate

488
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:14,280
in any time period you wish. So
soul forward does not mean time

489
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,260
forward, right? So you can
incarnate in the 10th century

490
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,620
BC, and next you could incarnate
in the 20th century. AD, so

491
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,200
permeability of time. You see
how that continues the concept

492
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,640
of linear development, but it
flexes on the concept of Time's

493
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,780
absolute linearity. For myself,
I've gone through so many

494
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:46,840
permutations of time, moving
into deep time where you can I

495
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,980
experienced my entire life in
the early stages, birth to

496
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:56,440
death, simultaneously present,
absolutely I was experiencing

497
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,180
the whole of my life, the end
and the Beginning and all of its

498
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,560
development as a simultaneous
whole. Later, I was taken into

499
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,540
periods of time where 100,000
years were being lived out as if

500
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:16,440
it were one minute. It's
convinced me that the universe

501
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,680
has many modalities of time
built into it, that when we move

502
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,460
into deeper dimensional of
reality, there are different

503
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:33,020
modalities of time that are
available. There all that would

504
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,620
you would think, and it does
make me receptive to the idea of

505
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,920
letting go of a concept of
linear time and linear

506
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,460
development. And somehow I try
to reconcile the fact that from

507
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,060
the universe's perspective,
there are multiple modalities of

508
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:54,280
time, so that the universe can
show me the future from its time

509
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,900
which is and can give me the
experience of knowing the future

510
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,460
as something which has already
happened and simultaneously

511
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,520
which is yet to happen, and at
the same time, at the same time,

512
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,340
hold on to some notion of the
value and the challenge of

513
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:22,460
something approximating Linear
development. And I think my best

514
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,200
take is that life chops its its
challenges to is chops learning

515
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,340
into bits and pieces. And we
can't learn it all in one

516
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,780
lifetime. We can't do it all
simultaneously. It's easier if

517
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:41,980
it's just broken down into bits
and pieces. And if this, if this

518
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,920
challenge of linear development,
is coming to a fruition, and is

519
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,000
coming to a diamond soul, a an
awareness that holds all of its

520
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,800
time moments in its present
consciousness on Earth, this, of

521
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,720
course, is not the end of the
developmental story, of the

522
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,040
linear story, because in a
million years will be farther.

523
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,480
In a billion years will be
farther still. The universe is

524
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,960
just getting warmed up. You
know, if that we have no reason

525
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,760
for thinking that the universe
is is in anywhere near the end

526
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,900
of its evolutionary story, we
know it's really at the early

527
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,780
stages of its story. So I think
of time is one of the great

528
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,940
gifts of evolution.
Individuality is one of the

529
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,900
great gifts of the physical
universe. Time is one of the

530
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,220
gifts of the physical universe.
Behind that lay lies

531
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,160
permutations of metaphysics that
put that are more fluid with

532
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:51,280
respect to time, but inside
space time, I think there is a

533
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,200
an approximate linear arrow of
time which serves the soul's

534
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,800
purpose, which serves some
deeper kind. Cosmic Web. And

535
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,940
yet, at the same time, when we
are in the linear development,

536
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,320
if we open up to the universe,
if we open up to the universe's

537
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:16,080
sense of time, we often get
these flashes of more than, more

538
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:25,100
than the present. You know, more
parallel dimensions of time. So

539
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,000
your question makes a lot of
sense, and it's it's a

540
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,680
substantive question.

541
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,219
Rachel Fleming: Can I ask one
Colin, or do you want to come

542
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:40,119
back on that? Okay, so

543
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,860
Colin Campbell: yeah, great.

544
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:44,019
Rachel Fleming: This is the
problem with your work, Chris.

545
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:49,659
We need to keep trying to we're
out in kind of like inarticulate

546
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:56,139
ball terrain, aren't we, when we
get to that you what you call

547
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:59,439
the diamond soul, then when
there's this moment of

548
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:05,279
remembering what? What are the
other attributes? What are the

549
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:10,019
other kind of what does that
bring, other than remembering

550
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:13,259
and wholeness? You know, did you
have an experience of what else?

551
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,300
Chris Bache: Well, first of all,
I think soul consciousness is

552
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,680
what we return to when we die.
So while we are in the Bardo

553
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:30,260
Earth, Bardo Earth kind of stage
when we die, we return to whole

554
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,860
consciousness. So it's not
something we're unfamiliar with.

555
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,340
It's something we are familiar
with. And then we precipitate

556
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,840
out of whole consciousness into
part consciousness, egoic

557
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,800
consciousness, and we return. So
it's a it's a constant

558
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,580
accordion. Kind of effect, we
die as we get large. We're born.

559
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,120
We get small, we die. We get
large. We're born, we get small

560
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:57,100
sooner or later, if we just keep
up for a few 1000 years, 100

561
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,640
million years, sooner or later,
large wakes up inside physical

562
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,940
consciousness, and so it's
simply a consolidation of what's

563
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,720
taking place naturally and
normally. It's just a stage in

564
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:22,820
this process, the times that
I've been carried into deep time

565
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:28,160
and experience temporarily my
diamond soul, and then the

566
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,500
diamond stole the soul that's
emerging as an archetypal

567
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,840
imprint, an archetypal form.

568
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:54,280
I It's hard to describe because
of the enormity and the beauty

569
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:00,040
and the joy we're looking we're
talking about a human being

570
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,380
that's completely healed, of all
the wounds of history. That's

571
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,960
healed of all the terrible
things we've done to each other,

572
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,380
men and women, and wars and
violence, that's healed all of

573
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:16,620
those scars. Healed a tremendous
breath of communion with the

574
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:24,140
natural world, an intimacy with
all life forms, not only then a

575
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,160
breath of companionship with all
life and with other human beings

576
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,640
and with human community and
with natural nature's community,

577
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:37,580
but an openness of the mind,
able to take in more directly,

578
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,900
enter into deeper communion with
the intelligence of the

579
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,940
universe. I mean, the genius of
the universe has all the answers

580
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,840
to all the technological limit
questions we want to have

581
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,880
answers to, and we just are not
able to download all that

582
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:04,440
knowledge. And the diamond soul
is a more complete and higher

583
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:12,060
potency of human being that can
enter into deeper downloads from

584
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,380
the divine intelligence. But
it's not only an expansion of

585
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:22,220
heart and an expansion of mind,
our physical senses are also

586
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:29,960
amplified by orders of magnitude
in the very, very last session,

587
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,760
after 73 sessions, the very last
session, the universe gave me an

588
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,860
experience of what I call
diamond vision. Suddenly, in a

589
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:45,040
kind of a late, late session,
wind down, clear space. My

590
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,480
vision became 1000s of times
more cute and sharper than it

591
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:55,120
had ever been before. I could
see things, details, gradients

592
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,480
of color, sharpness and
precision of form. I could just

593
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,960
see I was. Me is that I ever had
accepted this fuzzy stuff as

594
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,480
real seeing. This was diamond
clarity seeing. And then after

595
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,680
10 minutes, it went away, and I
was seeing the way I normally

596
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,040
see. And that's when I
discovered, I realized what I

597
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,680
was being shown is that we tend
to think of sensation as kind of

598
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,240
a biomechanical process, but
it's actually a conscious

599
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,900
process, and the more
consciousness which is is

600
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,640
present in this body, this body
has built into it the capacity

601
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,260
for infinitely higher levels of
sensate, experience, touch,

602
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:47,260
hearing, seeing, sensitivities
of all manner of physical

603
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:56,320
sensations. So it truly is. It's
heaven on earth in the body, so

604
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:02,100
that the body participates in
the qualities of heaven without

605
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,980
having to leave the physical
existence. This is why, I mean,

606
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,640
it's not an up and out
cosmology. It's bringing it in

607
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,760
deeper and deeper and deeper,
changing, literally, the

608
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,120
physiology of the body to allow
it to operate in this ecstatic

609
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:26,720
state, which becomes the normal
state. Yeah, that is a child I

610
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,800
think, is worth the labor that
we're going into to give birth

611
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,940
to. And we are going in a
terribly, terribly severe labor.

612
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,960
Our past is being stripped away.
Will be stripped away. We will

613
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,760
lose all capacities that we
associate with normal and

614
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,300
minimal existence. This is what
happens in all mystical

615
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,280
traditions, in all psychedelic
traditions, literally, the small

616
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,860
has to be broken ground to dust,
stripped and dismembered in

617
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:05,220
order for the new to awaken
within us, and this is happening

618
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,960
now historically, where we're
entering into what I think of as

619
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,760
the dark night of our collective
soul. The Dark Night is an image

620
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,540
often used for a hard time, but
it's not a hard time in John of

621
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,620
the Cross. The Dark Night of
self is a hard time. The Dark

622
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,760
Night of the Soul is a very,
very intense purification time

623
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,900
which immediately precedes the
awakening of full illumination.

624
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,700
And a dark night of the of the
collective soul is a time of

625
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:44,920
intense purification, intense
loss of reality as we have known

626
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,200
it up to this point in time. And
I think out of the out of the

627
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,340
pain and suffering that's
coming, it's going to crack US

628
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:03,420
Open and break us down to our
center and in this ordeal, we

629
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:10,800
will not survive, but we will
give birth to that in us which

630
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,680
is more beautiful, more
ecstatic, more competent, more

631
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:24,260
plugged in. I think we truly are
becoming a species of Buddhas, a

632
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:28,640
species of Christ and prophets.
These are the models we've had

633
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,140
trying to give us some for
vision of what's happening. In

634
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:38,120
the early years, we could not
imagine an ordinary human being

635
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,080
reaching that level of
excellence. But now we're

636
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,320
beginning to understand through
reincarnation, over and over and

637
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:49,360
over and over again, slowly, we
grow into that level of

638
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:54,760
excellence, which is simply a
level of transparency to the

639
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:05,100
essential condition which in
which we experience life. The

640
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,340
irony is, we experience what's
always been happening all the

641
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,880
way along. It's always been this
way. The universe has always

642
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,400
been one. The universe has
always been filled with

643
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,480
intelligence. We have always
been empty of self. But somehow

644
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,980
we distracted ourselves from
thinking that that's not there.

645
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,420
It's always been there. So we're
waking up to the paradise that

646
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,400
the universe already is. We've
just been missing it.

647
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,940
Rachel Fleming: Wow, Chris, I
just find your experience and

648
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:44,200
your vision just such a hopeful
one as we move into what we see

649
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,420
as ecological crisis and
societal crisis, and I just

650
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,060
again, as I felt quite
emotional. Said at the

651
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,480
beginning, it was just one of
the most inspiring books, or the

652
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,780
most inspiring book last year,
but what one of the most of my

653
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,460
lifetime? You know, I. It, and
I'm sure Colin would agree with

654
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,100
me on that. So it's so wonderful
to hear.

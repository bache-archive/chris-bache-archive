00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,720
Unknown: You are listening to
part two of Two of our

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:20,120
conversation with Chris Bache.
You

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,360
Susan: Chris, now, Chris, you've
mentioned this crisis or pivotal

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,520
point for humanity, and what
insights or experiences have you

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,920
gained as from that, from your
psychedelic work about this

6
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:11,700
crisis or pivotal point, and
what do you see as the

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,080
evolutionary trajectory of
humanity as a whole coming

8
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,740
through that?

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,660
Unknown: Well, that is a big
question, isn't it? That's a

10
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:31,220
huge question, and it has
absorbed a lot of my time and in

11
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,280
Non-ordinary states of
consciousness, it's been one of

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,560
the recurring themes. And
because what happens when you

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,960
when your individual bubble of
consciousness dissolves when the

14
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:51,580
drop opens you, you fall into
the divine at different depths.

15
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,780
And one of the things that
happens, I think, is that one

16
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:02,580
falls into deep time. So one
falls out of linear time into

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,840
the deeper expanse of time. So
the the universe seems to have

18
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:13,860
many different time signatures,
and one can experience arcs of

19
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,020
time over 1000s and 1000s of
years as if it were a simple

20
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,660
hour, and even hundreds of 1000s
of years and so as I dissolved

21
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,600
at the individual level, I was
drawn into repeatedly into the

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,540
evolutionary arc that underlies
my individual existence. I was

23
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,900
drawn into the arc of human
evolution as a whole, which is

24
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,440
just, of course, one layer of
the larger evolution of the

25
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,820
planet and solar system so on.
And just as I was drawn into

26
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,200
these large episodes of
collective suffering, when I

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,620
would spin out, when eventually
these would peak, and I would go

28
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,480
through some large combustion,
Death-Rebirth process, when I

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,260
would spin out into spiritual
spaces, ecstatic experiences, or

30
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:26,780
the deeper warp and woof of the
universe. I was often drawn into

31
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,680
our head. Various visions are
drawn into the experience of

32
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,100
what's really taking place
behind the scenes, and that is

33
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,360
the this evolutionary crescendo
that's building in time, this

34
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,540
breaking forth of this deeper
consciousness in history that's

35
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,080
breaking forward into time and
eventually in in the 55th

36
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:03,180
session Out of a 73 session
series, I had an extra ordinary

37
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,180
experience in which I actually
what seems to have happened, as

38
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,360
best as I can understand it, is
that at some collective level, I

39
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,340
went through the Death-Rebirth
of our species. It it was I was

40
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,640
in a state of consciousness,
hard to describe, but I was at

41
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,880
that time. I was literally
billions of people

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,520
simultaneously, and every
individual and all billions at

43
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,540
the same time simultaneously,
were beginning to go through a

44
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,480
life death crisis that was
literally global. It was just a

45
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,640
profound restructuring of life.
Life was being broken down to

46
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,300
the very core. It was, I think,
in this massive die off that's

47
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,920
that's coming down to us. Which
is simply the fallout of our,

48
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,100
our ecological foolishness.

49
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,079
Susan: So this was just an
existential death. It was a

50
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:13,859
physical possibility as well.

51
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
Unknown: Yeah, this was an
entire species brought to

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,740
extinction, brought to the very
edge of extinction. This is,

53
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,600
yeah, this. This was being taken
into the very essence, the depth

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,100
of this historical crisis, which
seemed to be peaking somewhere

55
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:40,420
in the 21st Century. And this is
an imminent kind of crisis, and

56
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,020
it looked like, in the center of
this crisis, it looked like we

57
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,220
would all die. It looks like
this was this. Was it. This was

58
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:56,200
the end of it. We were going to
go extinct. And then when it was

59
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,620
like being on an island with a
hurricane coming over, in the

60
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,660
end, everybody was forced to
just hunkering down and holding

61
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,720
on and hoping that they weren't
being blown away. And it looked

62
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,100
like death was inevitable, and
then at the in the last minutes,

63
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,460
suddenly the storm crested and
passed, and there were

64
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,560
survivors, and survivors began
to find each other and began to

65
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,460
reconstruct. But then what
happened was the most extra

66
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:38,900
ordinary explosion of of new
social structures, new forms

67
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,300
that had that reflected the
birth of a new consciousness

68
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,080
that was literally birthed by
the pain of our near extinction

69
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:56,440
event, and out of this trauma of
a species brought to the very

70
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,700
edge of extinction, There was a
a tearing away of what is in

71
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,100
essential and and a birth of
what is essential. And I this, I

72
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,860
think of the birth of soul
consciousness, but not just a

73
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,820
birth of soul consciousness. Or
put it this way, the nature of

74
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,240
soul consciousness is to know
the truth of our

75
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,040
interconnectivity. It is to know
the common ground that we all

76
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,780
share. It is to know our place
in the universe and our

77
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,220
camaraderie with all other
beings, not just human beings,

78
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,580
but all other beings who share
this planet that sprang into an

79
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,760
augmented capacity. It sprang
into an empowered position, so

80
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,180
that when we began to
reconstruct our lives, we

81
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,900
weren't really reconstructing we
were creating a new culture. We

82
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,620
were creating new social forms
that were reflecting new

83
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,300
realities that had been birthed
in the throes of this crisis.

84
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,340
This was a shattering and a
profound experience for me,

85
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,820
because it took me. It took me
several years, really, to absorb

86
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:19,440
the experience, because it's
like, it's like being in

87
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,700
Hiroshima, yes, on the week
before the bomb goes off, and

88
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,920
knowing that every human being
that you see on the face of the

89
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:40,040
planet is about to go through a
nightmare of great suffering And

90
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,740
then to and to have so much, so
profound, much profound respect

91
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,260
for these beautiful beings who
volunteered to undergo this

92
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:57,280
crisis as part of our collective
transformation. And then in

93
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,100
years following, as the work
continued, and I continue to go

94
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,220
into this. There were several
episodes where I entered into

95
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,700
deep time and spent time with
what I call the future human.

96
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,000
Just had the opportunity to be
with this new archetype that's

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,620
coming forward in history, and
it's only in the experience of

98
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,600
the future being that humanity
is becoming, that we really

99
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,560
begin to understand the larger
evolutionary trajectory and what

100
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,280
we are actually giving birth to.
It's, it is as if we're going

101
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,380
into labor. Yes, we we didn't
know we were pregnant. It's only

102
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,380
in seeing the baby that we
really understand the whole

103
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,760
gestational process. So nature
has been gestating this human

104
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,160
being for 100,000 years. I mean.
Ever since Sapiens emerged on

105
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,680
the scene, we've been behind the
scenes gestating the next layer

106
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,600
of our evolutionary story.

107
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,060
Susan: Well, you're perfectly
describing the prenatal Peri

108
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:22,040
matrix outlined by Stan Grof too
and it's, but it's just on a

109
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,300
collective level,

110
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,559
Unknown: so on a collective
level, and this the future human

111
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:33,439
is, is such an extra, ordinarily
beautiful being. I mean, it's

112
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:39,319
just when I focus my mind on it,
even now, it brings me to tears,

113
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:46,059
because it's, it's a humanity
healed of its divisive history.

114
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:52,119
It's a humanity of all of its
wounds resolved. It's a humanity

115
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:56,679
with its with its heart
completely open at a deep and

116
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:02,219
profound level, in collective
embrace. It's a humanity with

117
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:07,799
its mind open into deep
communion with the

118
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:16,439
Transcendence. It's a humanity
where war ends and and

119
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:20,779
cooperation and collaboration is
the norm. It's a planet that has

120
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:27,019
outgrown its its divisiveness,
and has entered into a time of

121
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,779
history of collaboration, not
monolithic, safe sameness, but

122
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,799
tremendous creative
collaboration, where we begin to

123
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:41,439
consciously cooperate with the
divine, rather than

124
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,659
unconsciously cooperate with
divine.

125
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,740
Susan: And this is what you've
termed the diamond soul.

126
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,980
Unknown: The diamond soul Yeah,
because our Yeah, this birth of

127
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,680
this new human on the face of
the planet.

128
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,660
Susan: I've also heard it termed
homo luminous, which sounds

129
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:11,460
about the same. And do you think
that this is not just our human

130
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,340
evolution, that this
reverberates all through the

131
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,800
beingness of the source, that
this is not just about us,

132
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,160
Unknown: it's not just about us,
and whatever is happening on

133
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,660
this planet, I'm sure, is
mirrored in similar processes

134
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,720
that are taking place in other
planets and other solar systems

135
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:44,020
and other galaxies, so that this
gestational process is a natural

136
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,340
process. It's simply an
extension of evolution reaching

137
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:54,040
a new critical point. Yes, and
that, and everything we're

138
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,880
learning about the evolution of
our galaxies and the universe at

139
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,380
large is that whatever is taking
place here in one way or

140
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,140
another, is taking place in
other corners of the universe.

141
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,420
So we are

142
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,559
Susan: just send our fields out
further and further and further

143
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,879
we start to get a feel for what
you're saying.

144
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,200
Chris Bache: Yeah, we are cosmic
citizens. We're not only global

145
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,940
citizens, but we are cosmic
citizens, and I'm sure there'll

146
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:30,680
come a time when higher orders
of community, intergalactic

147
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,660
communion will emerge as part of
the natural sequence. Whether

148
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,380
so, of course, many people
believe that's already begun and

149
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,000
and maybe it has, but it's
almost an it's inevitable that

150
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,620
it will be part of our future.

151
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,300
Susan: So beautiful, Chris, so
beautiful. Thank you for that,

152
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,820
Chipper: and it'll speed up the
more of us cooperate with that

153
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,720
process.

154
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,660
Unknown: Yes, it's speeding. It
speeds up. The more we

155
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,580
collaborate, the faster it moves
for us, individually and us

156
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,600
collectively. That's the other
thing that emerged from that

157
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,540
critical session I described,
and that is an understanding of

158
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,700
how we actually we have a huge
distance to travel as a species,

159
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,980
and a very short period of time
to travel that distance. And

160
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,040
there have been many people who
have pondered, how can we

161
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,580
possibly change as much as we
have to change in order to

162
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,080
survive in as little time as the
ecological crisis seems to be

163
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,700
giving us to change. And I think
the key is understanding the

164
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:44,440
collective dynamics that are at
play that it's it's not simply 7

165
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,240
million, 7 billion individual
minds that have to change at

166
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,340
core, it's this collective mind
of the species which is

167
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,740
undergoing a change. So if you
take what we know about fields

168
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,660
and. Fields theory and non
linear systems and tipping

169
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,220
points and catalytic points, and
you make the assumption that the

170
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,620
collective psyche is in some way
a unified field, and that what

171
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,900
we know about non linear systems
applies also to the collective

172
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,800
psyche, then we can understand
how we might actually make it

173
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,660
the as far as we need to travel,
as quickly as we need to make

174
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,340
the traveling. And that is all
the suffering and all of the

175
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,320
confrontation with our divisive
ways are not simply registering

176
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,120
on our individual psyches, but
everything that the individual

177
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,320
registers is fed into and
registers at the collective

178
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,580
level, and that when enough
individuals come to a tipping

179
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:57,640
point and begin to choose a
different way of living

180
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,340
themselves, individually, Sooner
or later, the species comes into

181
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,020
a tipping point, and at that
point, 100th monkey phenomena,

182
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,940
kind of thing, the pace of
evolution accelerates

183
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,300
exponentially. The new common
sense emerges.

184
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,639
Chipper: It's like playing chess
with koyana scotsie

185
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,700
Chris Bache: Yes, yes. And
that's why programs such as

186
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,760
yours is so important, because
just because of the depth and

187
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,840
breadth of the outreach, the
number of synapses of our

188
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,320
collective brain, that you're
able to bring together, the new

189
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,480
technology is just opening up
exponential increase of

190
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
understanding

191
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,000
Chipper: in your advanced
sessions, I'm going to change

192
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,440
back to a question here, you
experience various permutations

193
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,280
of the Divine and domains that
lie beyond the story of

194
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,360
humanity's evolution and beyond
all form but the Other

195
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,760
intimately related. Would you
share your experiences and

196
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,560
insights with us regarding that?
I mean, you have been all along,

197
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,620
but with a specific focus

198
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:19,740
Unknown: on Yeah. You know, this
is hard to do without sounding

199
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,620
like a mad man, yeah, well,
that's the that's the challenge

200
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,640
of even trying to speak about
psychedelic experiences, because

201
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,120
it's so it expands exponentially
the frame of a conversation that

202
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,720
unless you're willing to enter
into that conversation, it's

203
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,960
just and Since I live at a
university. I know how easy it

204
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,220
is for very intelligent, well
educated people to write off

205
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,940
this entire conversation, sure,
but so if we let go of all of

206
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,620
that and go into the possibility
that one can open up to the mind

207
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,220
of the universe, then the most
extra ordinary story begins to

208
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:09,420
unfold, the invitation here.
There's so many ways one could

209
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,100
put it, I don't know. The
invitation the privilege is to

210
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,220
experience the ways in which the
universe is alive in depth that

211
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,140
are hidden, to simply physical
consciousness, to enter into

212
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,220
archetypal reality, and I don't
mean that in a narrow Jung Ian

213
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:39,440
sense, but to enter into the
flows of intelligence, the flows

214
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,680
of consciousness, the flows of
life that actually are giving

215
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,400
structure to and giving form to
time space itself, to go outside

216
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,140
of time and space to go enter
back into time and space to just

217
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:03,540
to be drawn into, in some way,
the intimate, in an intimate

218
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,120
way, the very birthing of time
and space as an ongoing event to

219
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,720
experience the enormity of the
intelligence of the universe. I

220
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,840
mean, it's, I mean, we know what
it's like when we're around very

221
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,420
intelligent people. They're just
different than people who aren't

222
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,940
intelligent and but to enter
into orders of magnitude of

223
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,300
intelligence that's actually
behind the universe is a it's a

224
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,640
mind shattering experience. And
to be, to to dissolve, and to

225
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:45,760
be, for a time, that kind of
being to touch the edges of the

226
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:53,500
garment of the Divine, is it
just it radically reframes, you

227
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,720
know, one's understanding of the
life that one is part of and

228
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,000
then equal to the entire.
Intelligence is the compassion,

229
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:11,040
the love, it just it shatters
again and again all frames of

230
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,020
reference, the the love that's
behind the universe is as large

231
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,740
as the intelligence that's
manifesting in the universe. And

232
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,600
you know, this is this planet is
hard. Life is hard. There are so

233
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,020
many there's so much suffering,
and it's such a difficult place

234
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,720
to be, that the very intensity
of time, space experience has

235
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,280
been used to argue against the
the intelligence of that there

236
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,940
is an intelligence and that
there is a love, a compassion

237
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,520
behind existence, but to
actually experientially enter

238
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,700
into communion with that
intelligence and to feel that

239
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,580
love, and to begin to understand
some of the ways In which, once

240
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,880
you open up to the true depth of
the project of an emergent

241
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,200
universe and the depth of the
project of the Divine, then you

242
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,640
begin to understand the ways in
which it there really is

243
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,360
compassion manifesting this
suffering that we have been

244
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,640
going through for So many
hundreds of 1000 years is just a

245
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,740
phase. It's not an enduring
condition. It's a phase that

246
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,280
reflects the limitations of our
species. At our particular time

247
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,820
in evolution, there is a an
ongoing fullness that is

248
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,040
expressing itself. We will move
beyond all this pain generation.

249
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:47,200
We will move beyond all the the
hate and bigotry of our divisive

250
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:58,420
ego consciousness and then and
then and then and just there to

251
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:04,560
be moved to go into experiences
that Stan calls the super cosmic

252
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,200
and meta cosmic void, to go into
the domain of the formless, the

253
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,020
domain that is the great plenum.
Yeah,

254
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,480
Susan: is this beyond even the
creation and the evolution?

255
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,660
Unknown: Yeah, it's where
creation and evolution comes

256
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,520
from. It's it's in, it's
transcending all time and all

257
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:37,520
space, going into some kind of
fundamental reality where form

258
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,920
does not exist, none of the
forms exist. And it is that

259
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,480
reality which actually gets
birth to all form. So it's,

260
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,640
it's, it's often described as
the void, but it's also the

261
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,620
plenum, the divine plenum, that
it is the it's, sometimes in

262
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,360
Buddhism, sometimes calls it the
Buddha womb, the awakened womb,

263
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,680
the Cosmic Womb. It's the mother
universe. It's it's that which

264
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,700
is just dating everything, which
is because this physical

265
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,840
universe, as vast as it is, as
enormous as it is, and

266
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,180
magnificent as it is, time and
space as we know it, is not the

267
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,600
only universe. There are other
universes. So we have to get to

268
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,900
a radically expanded cosmology.
And all of these universes are

269
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:37,760
manifesting out of a primal
reality which is formless in

270
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,380
itself, the sheer the majesty of
the mother. She's so beautiful.

271
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,440
Yes, are you so beautiful?

272
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,240
Chipper: With Sri Aurobindo? And
yes,

273
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,720
Unknown: yes, yeah, I think Sri
arrived.

274
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,900
Chipper: Is his super
consciousness, yeah.

275
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,220
Unknown: I Sri Aurobindo, I
think is one of the great

276
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,480
thinkers helping us make the
pivot away from the old

277
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,740
cosmology, the up and out
cosmology, into an incarnational

278
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,860
cosmology. Great, a great
thinker.

279
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,060
Chipper: Yeah, well, I earlier
you had, you had talked about

280
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:24,680
you would recommend a less than
high dose regimen. What would

281
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,360
you recommend from your
development state at this point

282
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,760
to an earlier self?

283
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,040
Unknown: Yeah, if I were talking
to my younger self, or if I'm

284
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:44,260
talking to my own children, who
are young adults now, well, I

285
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,640
would recommend it partly it
depends upon what are you trying

286
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,100
to accomplish? I when I got into
this work, what I was seeking

287
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,560
was enlightenment, you know,
like what most of us were

288
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,920
seeking, to be a better human
being, to be more awake and.

289
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,120
Conscious individual being. And
what I found was, if you want to

290
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,220
seek classically, what we mean
by enlightenment, to be able to

291
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,300
become completely open to the
depth of reality in the

292
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:23,420
immediate moment in a way which
ego yields, and what I call leaf

293
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:28,700
consciousness yields to tree
consciousness to the transparent

294
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,960
life of the totality. I think
it's actually better to work

295
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,960
with low doses, to work to go
track down the ego where it

296
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,360
lives and the ego lives in
close. It lives on the earth,

297
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,600
and it needs to be tracked back
to its layer. And really working

298
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,600
that means really working with
lower doses, and really taking

299
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,980
it apart bit by bit, integrating
that type of work with with

300
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,480
meditation, various classical
meditation practices, and I

301
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,220
should mention, all my life I've
also been a teacher of religious

302
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,640
studies. So I've taught courses
in world religions and Eastern

303
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,420
religions and comparative
mysticism all my life. So I've

304
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,440
spent my entire life learning
from the sages, and have just

305
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,100
deep, abiding respect for the
spiritual levels of spiritual

306
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,820
realization achieved by the
great masters of and men and

307
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,560
women of all lineages. And I've
always tried to combine

308
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,720
contemplative practice with
shamanic practice. I've became a

309
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,660
Vajrayana practitioner 15 years
ago, and I've tried to integrate

310
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,540
my Vajrayana practices with my
shamanic psychedelic work, and

311
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,880
tried to put those together, but
I found it over time that a lot

312
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,180
was taking place in these
sessions that were not serving

313
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,700
the purpose of individual
enlightenment at all. And I

314
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,040
think that has to do really when
you start working with high

315
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,480
doses, you get involved in a
different game here. The game is

316
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,040
collective enlightenment and and
the game is actually the the

317
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,280
game of exploring the universe.
And I don't think you need to

318
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:17,340
transcend time or take evolution
back to the Big Bang or be

319
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,600
absorbed in archetypal levels of
reality in order to achieve

320
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,440
enlightenment. That's, it's just
a it's a different enterprise.

321
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,900
As a philosopher, I was drawn
into the enterprise of knowing

322
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,000
the universe. But if we, even if
we focus on that enterprise, I

323
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,260
would do it differently. And
that is, of course, I would, I

324
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,800
would continue to always embed
working with psychedelics into a

325
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,080
daily spiritual practice. And my
the rule of thumb is the deeper,

326
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,760
non ordinary state you go into
on a temporary basis, the more

327
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,920
important it is to have a strong
daily practice, to anchor your

328
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,600
temporary practice, right? So
it's not an alternative. It has

329
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,860
to be grounded in the regimen of
spiritual life, which is moral

330
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,360
living, social commitments,
social relationships, and what

331
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,440
you do every day when you get
up, right? But in working with

332
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,320
non or with psychedelics, I
would alternate, I think I would

333
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,500
work at more strong doses. But I
think working, for example, if

334
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,460
you're working with LSD, 300
micrograms is a lot easier than

335
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,820
working at 500 or 600
micrograms, just to get

336
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,280
specific, yeah, and I, and I
would alternate working with

337
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:46,540
synthetic psychedelics like LSD
with organic psychedelics. You

338
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,860
know, we all know Terence
McKenna was a great advocate of

339
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:57,280
Psilocybin and Ayahuasca and DMT
derivatives. And I would

340
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,100
alternate, I would I think
Psilocybin mushrooms, for

341
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,920
example, really helped the body
absorb. It's very it to me, it's

342
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,420
a very physical kind of
experience, yes, and if you're

343
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:15,660
working with high dose LSD inter
spacing, those sessions with

344
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,020
Psilocybin sessions or Ayahuasca
sessions, can really kind of

345
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,680
help the body and the subtle
energy systems absorb the deep

346
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,100
visionary states you go into
when you're working with LSD.

347
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,120
Because I think of LSD is kind
of a high altitude drug. You

348
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,260
know, tends to in high doses. It
tends to blow you into cosmic

349
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,980
territory,

350
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,840
Chipper: a black diamond run
Yes, yes,

351
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,040
Unknown: and, and, and. There
are other the organic

352
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,280
substances, and the two that
come to mind particularly are

353
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:58,480
Psilocybin and Ayahuasca really
kind of help the body and ground

354
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,800
these very deep states of color.
Consciousness more completely

355
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,120
into the physical body, into the
mental body, into the emotional

356
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,460
body. So I guess I would do
fewer high dose LSD sessions,

357
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,680
and I would work with the with
an alternate regimen of organic

358
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,580
psychedelics.

359
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:26,420
Chipper: Well, that does tend to
take the common place away from

360
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:33,140
it. If you were to alternate, I
can see how time after time

361
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:39,200
after time of doing a high dose
without the intention that

362
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,260
you've brought to it, of of
expanding rather than just

363
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,240
playing, could get tiresome if
all you were doing was playing.

364
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:55,000
Unknown: Yeah, yeah. And to me,
it's been interesting. How many

365
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,080
people have felt that if you, if
you work with, let's say, LSD,

366
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,600
that eventually you keep going
back to the same level, and you

367
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,400
just keep re experiencing the
same lessons. And therefore, you

368
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,580
know you sort of, as Huston
Smith said, when you get the

369
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,900
message, you hang up the phone,
right? But that hasn't been my

370
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:21,260
experience. My experience is, if
you're working in a very

371
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,660
internal way, internalized way,
as long as you were willing to

372
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,560
throw another log in the fire,
the universe will keep taking

373
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,460
you through break point after
break point after break point

374
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,160
and the reason I stopped. I
mean, in 1999 I stopped, what I

375
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,540
call my serious work the very
high dose work. And I stopped

376
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,760
for a couple of reasons, but one
of the reasons was it was

377
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,420
producing too much wear and tear
on my physical body, and

378
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,900
particularly my subtle energy
body. I was literally running

379
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,720
quantities of energy that were
just larger quantities of energy

380
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,560
than even I could handle, even
using these archetypal Vadnais

381
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:10,500
deity practices. In between
sessions, I just had to step

382
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,260
away. I had to slow down and let
my energy recalibrate and adjust

383
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,020
to what had been, what had been
realized in all these years of

384
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,900
work. And the other reason I
stopped was it I couldn't it was

385
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,260
getting increasingly difficult
to come back, not not

386
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,280
psychological, but it was too
painful, yeah, to come back into

387
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,600
time and space. When one has
gone into the the fields of

388
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,280
diamond Luminosity, they are
just they're so magnificent.

389
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,640
They're so beautiful. And to be
that intimate with the divine,

390
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,480
and then have to come back into,
you know, the beautiful earth,

391
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,600
but the more limited
circumstances of ordinary

392
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,880
consciousness, even
consciousness is being

393
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,820
transformed. That is the real
drawback of what I call the path

394
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,400
of temporary immersion. It's a
it the the methods that move you

395
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:13,920
more slowly into these deep and
profound spaces allow you to

396
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,480
keep those tart, to keep those
spaces after your retreat is

397
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,700
over, but the path of temporary
immersion punches you ahead of

398
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,720
yourself in a way, right? So,
it's a temporary,

399
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,660
Chipper: yeah? It's just a visit
rather than a move.

400
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,980
Unknown: It's a visit. It, yeah,
you know, Ram Dass said it opens

401
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:39,800
windows, but it doesn't allow
you to go out the door. It's, I

402
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:46,360
understand that, and it's true,
but it's a visit that changes

403
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,560
the course of your own
evolution. One Spirit told me

404
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:56,560
one time when I was backing away
and said, 20 years in, 20 years

405
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:03,300
out. So 20 years of work in,
don't you can't assimilate that

406
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,200
without expecting to spend 20
active years of assimilation.

407
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,300
And now I actually think it's
even more than that. I think

408
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,800
that when you work in very deep
states of consciousness like

409
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,500
this, it doesn't just affect you
for the rest of your life. It

410
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,800
affects you at a soul level. So
that I think it really would

411
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,260
take many lifetimes to
assimilate the full scale and

412
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,900
scope of what has unfolded in
the work. So it changes your

413
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,960
deep evolutionary trajectory. So
the challenge at this point, I

414
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,440
think, is now that we have these
technologies that allow us to

415
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,620
blow out the levels and to
plunge deeply into these places

416
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,980
of the universe. The challenge
really shifts not from breaking

417
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,720
out. The challenge shifts to
integration, deep, deep

418
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,136
integration. In your mind, in
your heart, in your social

419
00:35:02,136 --> 00:35:05,916
relationships, in your body on a
day to day basis.

420
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:10,836
Chipper: I guess that's why the
DAO say Before enlightenment

421
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:15,576
chop would carry water, yes, or
enlightenment chop would carry

422
00:35:15,576 --> 00:35:16,116
water,

423
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:19,355
Unknown: yes, yeah. Yes.

424
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:25,400
Cybele: Fascinating. Chris,
would you say that ultimately,

425
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,200
the unconditional love that you
experienced on your journeys is

426
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,640
the lesson that we all need to
learn?

427
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:40,900
Unknown: Well, to me, love,
unconditional love, unrestricted

428
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:47,680
compassion is it is the
correlate to oneness. If the

429
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,020
universe exists as a single
entity, if God is ultimately the

430
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,860
fabric of existence, and if
oneness is the great truth

431
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,860
within which we live, then
oneness manifests in all sorts

432
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,000
of ways, but one of the ways it
manifests is in this profound,

433
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,700
emotional, ecstatic embrace of
everything, which is of all

434
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,780
life. You know, the shaman comes
out of Transcendence, cries all

435
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,480
my relations, I Am One With All
my relations with all the beings

436
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,680
of the world. So love really is
of the essence, because oneness

437
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,120
is of the essence, and love is
the manifestation of oneness in

438
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:42,100
the human heart. So that deep
feeling of acceptance of all

439
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,300
beings and every human being,
even human beings that are doing

440
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,560
stupid, terrible, hurtful,
injurious things to themselves

441
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,580
and to each other, but to not
close your heart down to them

442
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,860
and to hold them in that embrace
of oneness, yeah, I think you're

443
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,860
right. I think one love is, you
know, the breathing of the

444
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,400
universe as one. Thank you.

445
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,540
Chipper: Do you sense this
experience and experiences

446
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,940
others have that are similar,
they co create a meeting with

447
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,140
the divine so we can all
remember what we have forgotten?

448
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:27,019
Unknown: Yeah, I do. I really
do. I think, you know, the

449
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:32,959
classic story of reincarnation
is when we die we remember, and

450
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,639
when we're born we forget, you
know, so when we die, you know,

451
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:40,719
the near death episode research
shows us very clearly, when

452
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,439
people die or nearly die, they
experience a tremendous,

453
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:47,799
accelerated expansion of
consciousness and a sense of

454
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:51,159
remembering. How could they have
forgotten the spiritual world?

455
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:55,239
But then, when we're born, at
least at this stage of our

456
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:59,859
evolution, we have a tendency to
forget. We contract into these

457
00:37:59,979 --> 00:38:06,719
time space suits the egoic
identity. So these all these

458
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:14,099
technologies, whether it's trans
dancing or silence or fasting or

459
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:19,019
meditation or deep tissue
Rolfing, or all these various

460
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:27,019
methods for loosening up the
shell of our body, mind identity

461
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:33,199
ultimately opens us into this
more intimate dialog with the

462
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,119
universe, in which, over and
over again, we experience it As

463
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,879
a remembering. So I think
collectively, we are remembering

464
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:46,479
who we are. We're remembering
what the purpose of life is.

465
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:51,159
We're remembering, you know,
what the project is. And every

466
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:55,659
time one of us remembers, it
makes it easier for other people

467
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:59,439
to remember. So that, I think
collectively, we are really

468
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:06,539
trying to incarnate a field of
remembrance, which ultimately

469
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:11,039
converts into, in a sense, a
field of communion. Because when

470
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,059
we remember that there is this
reality there, there is a

471
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:18,179
universe surrounding the
physical universe. There is a

472
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,099
mother universe. There is a
spiritual reality. It's always

473
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:25,219
there. It's it's always tapping
at the back of our

474
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:28,399
consciousness. It's always
sustaining our bodies and our

475
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:33,319
hearts and our minds. Then
remembrance yields to communion,

476
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,779
really deeper communion. So that
mean, as long as we believe that

477
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:41,079
the universe was a Dead
universe, who would want to

478
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:45,399
commune with a Dead universe,
but if it's a living universe,

479
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:48,459
if it's saturated with
intelligence and saturated with

480
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:52,059
intentionality, then that's a
universe I'd want to enter into

481
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:59,079
communion with. So remembering
becomes an ongoing process of

482
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:02,879
entering into. Sustained
communion, where that which we

483
00:40:02,939 --> 00:40:08,879
are here and that which is the
totality Together, we create

484
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:12,959
something that's never been
before. Really, that's where

485
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:19,499
we're in the process of creating
thoughts, feelings, visions,

486
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:24,439
social realities that have never
existed on this planet before.

487
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:27,379
Cybele: Yeah. Thank you.

488
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:34,100
Thank you, Chris. This is
Sabella again. So in all the

489
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,760
work that you did and the
personal transformation you did,

490
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:43,120
and then you were going back to
the university and being in a

491
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,460
very academic world, how did
your personal transformation and

492
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:54,100
practice impact how you were in
in the, you know, quote,

493
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:59,980
unquote, real world and and the
other people, you weren't a

494
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,320
mumble anymore, you know,

495
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,059
Chris Bache: yeah, but you only
get promoted for your

496
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:08,759
muggleness. You know, at the
universities is a different

497
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:12,179
order. That's a complicated
process, and it wasn't entirely

498
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:20,599
comfortable. And I I learned how
to live in two worlds. I mean,

499
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:27,799
this work, because of its
legally problematic nature,

500
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:33,439
cannot be discussed openly in
academic circles. It can be

501
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:37,879
discussed in certain avant garde
circles. It can be discussed in

502
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:41,259
Bay Area circles and in very
progressive institutions. And

503
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:45,939
I've taught courses on this type
of work at the California

504
00:41:45,939 --> 00:41:48,759
Institute of integral Studies in
the Department of Philosophy,

505
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:53,859
cosmology and consciousness. But
here in Ohio, it's it's a much

506
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:57,039
more conservative environment
and and they have the right to

507
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:03,479
be where they are. And so there
were tensions between but there

508
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,439
were tensions that ultimately I
found I could work with

509
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:14,099
creatively, and as my
consciousness changed naturally

510
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:20,719
who I was or what I was changed,
and that meant the experience of

511
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,519
my teaching, what I taught
changed, and so they're kind of

512
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,239
two levels. One is content, and
then some, there's a deeper

513
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:33,559
level that has to do with the
energetic being underneath the

514
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:40,599
content. So content wise, I was
able to design courses where I

515
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,059
was able to discuss some of
these phenomena in a certain

516
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:49,779
way. So I've taught a course
called Transpersonal studies. So

517
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:52,839
we studied reincarnation
research, and we studied near

518
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:57,579
death episode research, and we
studied out of body research,

519
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:01,859
and I taught a course called
psychology of religion, but it

520
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,799
was really Transpersonal
psychology of religion, and

521
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:10,319
there I traced the history of
depth psychology, and spent

522
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,679
about a third of the course
talking about Stan grofs work in

523
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,699
psychedelic research, never
referencing myself, simply

524
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:22,759
referencing The literature and
Stan grofs work so and I've

525
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:27,799
taught seminars through the
years in advanced Transpersonal

526
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:32,479
theory, where I created academic
context for students and I to

527
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,559
have conversations about some of
these realities. And my

528
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,099
colleagues have always, you
know, I've always had good

529
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:42,519
relationships with my
colleagues, and they've known

530
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:47,259
that I've been out on the far
side left, but they've given me

531
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:52,419
room to work there. And I found
that if you have student

532
00:43:52,419 --> 00:43:55,419
numbers, if you have if you have
students who want to take your

533
00:43:55,419 --> 00:43:59,499
courses, and if you're a good
citizen of the university, you

534
00:43:59,499 --> 00:44:03,059
know if you do your work, and
you support the department, and

535
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:06,959
you you work on all the
committees, and you do all the

536
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:12,959
things that's expected of you,
then you really have much more

537
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:18,719
room to improvise and push the
boundaries than might at first

538
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:21,919
appear. So many people have
asked me, how did you get away

539
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:25,159
with teaching the courses you
teach, you know, at this open

540
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:29,839
enrollment State University, and
I found that, you know, we

541
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,599
really have much more freedom
and flexibility if you're

542
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:38,719
willing to seize it than we
might initially think. And there

543
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,799
are other people who are pushing
those boundaries. Tom Roberts,

544
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,819
in Illinois at a state
university, has been teaching

545
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:49,479
about psychedelics in his
classes for years, and they're

546
00:44:49,779 --> 00:44:54,639
in an academic context where you
pay your academic dues to that

547
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,319
discussion, but there's there
was a deeper process going on,

548
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:04,979
and that is. As the deeper my
experience became of this

549
00:45:04,979 --> 00:45:10,739
universe, it changed how my mind
works. It changed how my psyche

550
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:16,859
works, and it changed my energy
in a way, so that when I was

551
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:20,539
coming into the classroom and
simply teaching things that were

552
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:23,599
not about any of these things I
was teaching intro world

553
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,659
religions, or introduction to
Eastern religions, or something

554
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:34,939
like this, it began. I found
that at a subtle psychological

555
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:40,099
level, at a collective level,
things began to happen between

556
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:45,819
myself and my students that were
somewhat unusual. For example, I

557
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:50,739
found that when I would just be
reaching for an example, just to

558
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:53,199
make a point, to make a
theoretical point, I would reach

559
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:56,619
for an example, and I'd create
an example out of my

560
00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:01,319
imagination. And then after
class, one day, a student came

561
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:05,459
up to me, and when he was sure
that there was no one around who

562
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:07,979
could hear what he was about to
say, the room was empty, he

563
00:46:07,979 --> 00:46:11,039
said, You know, it's strange
that you use that example in

564
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,579
class today, because that's
exactly what happened to me last

565
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:19,919
week. And I found that that
happened began to happen

566
00:46:19,919 --> 00:46:24,019
repeatedly through the years,
and students were finding bits

567
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:28,639
and pieces of their life showing
up in my lectures, very in very

568
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:34,339
precise and exact ways, without
my intending it, without my even

569
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:39,859
being consciously aware when it
was happening. And not only were

570
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:43,059
they finding pieces of their
life showing up in my lectures,

571
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:49,179
but often it was the parts that
were showing up were touching

572
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:53,619
them in very, very deep and
personal ways. It was as if

573
00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:57,879
their soul was whispering to my
soul, which is passing it up

574
00:46:57,879 --> 00:47:01,979
into my conscious awareness,
pieces of information that they

575
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:06,479
needed to heal themselves, that
they needed to take the next

576
00:47:06,479 --> 00:47:11,699
step in their own evolutionary
journey. So during these years

577
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:16,319
when I was doing this work, I
became kind of a lightning rod

578
00:47:16,979 --> 00:47:20,959
of the soul for many of my
students. And this became so

579
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:27,379
pronounced that I had to
actively, consciously engage

580
00:47:27,379 --> 00:47:31,639
this process and understand it
more deeply and to work with it

581
00:47:31,759 --> 00:47:36,619
so that I would, so that it
wouldn't become too intense for

582
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:41,619
my students, so that it would,
it would stay within the bounds

583
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:46,659
of what's appropriate in a
classroom, and that's the story

584
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:50,979
that I tell in the living
classroom. I tell the story of

585
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:55,479
that dance that unfolded between
my students and me, and then I

586
00:47:55,479 --> 00:47:58,719
began to understand that it was
more than just resonance between

587
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,519
my students and me. There was a
resonance that was being created

588
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:05,999
by the field of our coming
together, that there was the

589
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:11,459
field of a group focused in
intense study actually has an

590
00:48:11,459 --> 00:48:14,159
animating effect on the
individual minds that are

591
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,179
present there in a way which
activates These collective these

592
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:24,799
are Morphic fields for groups.
And my students, you know, if

593
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:27,439
the faculty had reservations
about what I was doing or what

594
00:48:27,439 --> 00:48:30,619
was happening, my students never
did. The students were always

595
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:33,259
there. They were much more
forward thinking, I think, than

596
00:48:33,259 --> 00:48:37,939
the faculty. They always met me
well, and we just had just

597
00:48:37,939 --> 00:48:43,479
wonderful adventures in the
classroom and at the same time,

598
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:50,739
I could not bring everything
that I knew to be true into my

599
00:48:50,739 --> 00:48:53,859
undergraduate classroom. It just
wasn't fair. It wasn't

600
00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:57,999
appropriate. And so I had to
hold back a lot, and in the

601
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:02,939
later years of my career, and
I've retired now that holding

602
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:10,799
back became difficult for me
because I could feel a tension

603
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:15,359
that literally a catch that
would happen in my throat when

604
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:20,539
my instinct was always to share
more information than my

605
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:25,039
circumstance allowed me to
share. And I would sometimes

606
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:28,999
lose control of my voice for
short seconds at a time was kind

607
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:33,019
of like a bark. So it's a
tension between the forces that

608
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:35,839
were holding me in check and the
forces that wanted to express

609
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:43,659
itself. And this is basically,
you know, I went through I was a

610
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:50,199
professor for 33 years, and I've
stopped that. And I love being

611
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:53,019
in the classroom. I love being
with the students, but I've

612
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:56,559
stopped that in order to write
books that I could not I did not

613
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:01,499
feel that I could write while I
was working. As an academic

614
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:08,399
books that are more openly
embracing the hidden side of my

615
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:12,839
life, the psychedelic side of my
life, which I hope will put me

616
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:15,359
in conversations with

617
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,380
Unknown: a different group of
adults, more spiritually

618
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:27,020
informed, more progressed in
their own spiritual evolution.

619
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,400
For two years, I worked as the
Director of Education for a

620
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,240
nonprofit, the Institute of
Noetic Sciences, where I had

621
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,080
many opportunities to speak with
and engage and do workshops with

622
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:43,480
people like yourselves. People
who have been consciously living

623
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,660
the spiritual life and engaging
these issues are not afraid of

624
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,080
these issues or plunging into
them, these transformative

625
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,480
processes, and I hope to be
doing more of that work in the

626
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,360
last phase of my life. So I've
kind of entered from an astral,

627
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,080
logical perspective, the third
turning of the wheel of Saturn.

628
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:09,600
My the second Saturn cycle from
when I was 29 to 5860, was my

629
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,040
academic career, and now I've
entered the third cycle, which I

630
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,560
think is really more exclusively
focused on this, these deep,

631
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,940
transformative practices and the
insights that emerge from them.

632
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,940
Cybele: Yeah, it sounds like
your experience with your

633
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,560
students was really beautiful.

634
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:33,919
Unknown: And I think it was. I
think they were, we were all we

635
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:36,859
all were touched, and we all
learned many things from them.

636
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:41,979
In fact, the last third of the
living classroom is all essays

637
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:46,179
written by my students. What
would happen I have my students

638
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:49,539
do a lot of writing, and most of
their writing is intellectual,

639
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:53,019
academic kind of writing, but
every once in a while, a student

640
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:57,039
would take the chance and write
a more personal essay. So they

641
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,139
would share the deepest, most
profound experience they had

642
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:03,959
ever had. They would share
stories of their father's death,

643
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:06,659
or their own conversion
experience, or their own

644
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:11,099
experience of nearly dying. And
I began to collect these through

645
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:14,699
the years. I would ask him if I
would could keep a copy of this

646
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:19,139
to use sometime in the future.
And I collected a beautiful

647
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:24,319
folder these magnificent stories
of transformation. And when I

648
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,499
wrote the living classroom, I
knew that this was the time to

649
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:30,079
give these back. So the whole
last third of the book, it's

650
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,419
really a second book is really
students. It's sharing these

651
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:39,559
students stories with the
public, because they they're

652
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:44,559
just so beautiful. So I think, I
think it was a very positive

653
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,039
experience for all of us. I know
I learned a lot from it.

654
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,960
Cybele: Yeah, it sounds like
it's the stretching dance of

655
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,220
straddling two worlds in that
way. And then, you know, I think

656
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:01,500
we've all experienced where you
might know something, but the

657
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,120
person you're talking to is not
ready for that yet. And now

658
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,800
we're getting to have this free
rein to talk about things and

659
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,240
just let people be drawn to it
or not. Yeah, it's really

660
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,680
lovely. Yeah.

661
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,500
Unknown: And again, I think the
the undergraduate students were

662
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,460
much more receptive than the
faculty. I believe that, yeah,

663
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,760
no, they're just, they're just,
they are different generation.

664
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,900
They are already now. They have
this in their bones. They are a

665
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,880
different generation of souls.

666
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:40,420
Susan: But Chris, don't you
think that those that are doing

667
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:46,360
this work, enable the newer, the
younger generations to come in

668
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,680
already knowing a lot of this
stuff, because the works being

669
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,100
done,

670
00:53:51,819 --> 00:53:55,119
Unknown: I hope so. I mean, I we
all have different roles in

671
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,299
this, in this evolutionary saga.
And you know, if there is a

672
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:04,199
seventh generation, as the Hopi
prophecies predicted, and are

673
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:09,539
the Indigo generation I am, and
maybe some of you are part of

674
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:14,039
the sixth generation, you know.
And our job is to hold, to break

675
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:17,579
ground for these young people,
and to hold to create the

676
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:21,979
container that allows them to
come to a speedier fruition of

677
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:25,639
their own capacities, of their
own consciousness on the planet.

678
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:32,179
And I hope that what we're doing
creates an in a very tangible

679
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:36,559
social structure, but also a
subtler psychic structure, way

680
00:54:36,979 --> 00:54:40,959
creates fields that empower them
absolutely,

681
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,820
Susan: yeah, absolutely, because
it is a collective

682
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:53,260
consciousness, and what what we
learn or discover affects them,

683
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,800
especially because they're more
open to it, they don't have the

684
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,680
letting go to do like us old
Dinosaurs.

685
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,320
Unknown: Yes, yes, and it's,
it's a complex feedback cycle.

686
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:11,400
Giving an example, I I often had
the experience where I would

687
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,720
read a book and it would contain
a high experience for me, and it

688
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,440
would give me insight into
something that I hadn't

689
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,580
understood before. I would have
a particular experience in a

690
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,640
psychedelic session where
something new would open. I

691
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,780
would understand something that
I hadn't understood before, and

692
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:35,240
within a week, a student would
ask me a question, and I would

693
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,900
have an answer, which two weeks
previous, I wouldn't have had an

694
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,600
answer for that was helpful to
them. And I thought, oh, isn't

695
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,920
that interesting, isn't it
wonderful how the universe uses

696
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,600
one person's learning to
facilitate the learning of other

697
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,680
people. And then over time, I
began to realize, wait a minute,

698
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,340
I'm only seeing one half of the
circle. I have the cart before

699
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:04,500
the horse. I began to understand
that the students need to know

700
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:07,500
the question that was coming
toward me, the student who was

701
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:13,020
coming to me was actually
influencing my own field and

702
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,440
causing me to read some of the
books that I was reading and

703
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,080
even have some of the
experiences that I would have

704
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:24,080
was having, in order to have
something available to them when

705
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:29,120
they came and actually asked the
question. So, so it's not simply

706
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,020
that I'm doing this work and the
universe is taking advantage of

707
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:38,000
distributing this information,
but the cycle, it's a circle

708
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,680
between students and teachers,
and I mean that in a broader

709
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,840
sense, that their need to know
was actually seeding my need, my

710
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:53,620
capacity to understand, so that
it's a circle, and I wouldn't be

711
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,980
reading or thinking what I'm
thinking if it weren't for the

712
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:02,700
seeding of these Students coming
to me. So at that point, you

713
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,920
truly open up to the mystery and
majesty of the universe and just

714
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,540
bow in prayer to the grandeur of
what's coming forward. We are

715
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,740
all in it together.

716
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:18,480
Susan: Oh, I love this. This is
wonderful. Thank you. Yeah,

717
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,620
thank you.

718
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,320
Cybele: So what are your
thoughts on the legal use of

719
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:30,320
psychedelics and therapy and
healing, and what's going on

720
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,640
right now with using
psychedelics as tools,

721
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:40,120
philosophically cosmic. Lee, you
know, making inquiry. What do

722
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,560
you think is the future of that?

723
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,900
Unknown: Well, I think we're
tilting back in the right

724
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:53,560
direction. I'm sure many of your
listeners are aware of maps, the

725
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,560
multi disciplinary association
for Psychedelic Studies, which

726
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,900
is a an educational and lobbying
organization which is trying to

727
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,740
change our laws around
psychedelics, and is

728
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,000
successfully moving psychedelics
back into the area of

729
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,620
respectable research, supporting
research with psychedelics,

730
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:17,940
bringing it back into the
therapeutic arena. I think we

731
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,340
are the this class of chemicals
is so important that I don't

732
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:26,420
think we're going to lose them
forever. You know, we're going

733
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,600
to step away from these very
repressive policies of the late

734
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,880
60s and 70s, so that we are
going to re appropriate with

735
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,600
this new wave of scholars and
researchers these substances for

736
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,640
their therapeutic potential
sooner or later, as we do that

737
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,100
we will, and I think this is
also happening with as we open

738
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,960
to Ayahuasca, the Ayahuasca
circles, the indigenous shamanic

739
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,500
populations which have been
using psychedelics, not only to

740
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:05,100
heal psychologically, but to to
engage the universe spiritually

741
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:09,420
and philosophically. I think as
we re appropriate these

742
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,320
substances for their clinical
therapeutic value, we are also

743
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,080
in the process of re
appropriating them for their

744
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,240
philosophical, illuminating
value. I just don't see how we

745
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:26,900
can keep pushing these things
away from us, the world, which

746
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,600
reveals itself through
psychedelics, is profoundly

747
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,840
compatible with the world that
we are studying, that we are

748
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,440
learning through science and
it's it's particularly

749
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,480
compatible with quantum theory
and field theory and and all the

750
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:48,520
sciences which have been given
birth in the post Newtonian era,

751
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,900
in the Newton Ian world, which
is still the academic gospel of

752
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:57,580
of the universities. The the
universe is a clockwork, and

753
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:00,360
it's a it's a purposeless
machine which moves. Was by

754
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:04,440
chance, a necessity and
mathematical precision. But in

755
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:10,080
the quantum world, where we
pivoted in the 1930s we're in a

756
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,980
very, very different universe,
where intentionality saturates,

757
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:21,020
the world where there is a
simultaneity fields of knowledge

758
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,340
underlying discrete existence.
This is very much, very

759
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,340
compatible with the world that
psychedelics are showing us, so

760
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,600
that as the intellectual
community really internalize and

761
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:38,000
absorbs what is truly the
cutting edge of science. It's

762
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,840
less it's more open to the type
of experiences that are that

763
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,680
emerge spontaneously in working
with psychedelics. So I think

764
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:53,560
that there is a shift taking
place at a very deep cognitive

765
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:58,300
level among leading thinkers,
which is going to open more and

766
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:05,400
more doorways to psychedelics in
the future, and I think we can

767
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:10,380
look forward to a time in the
future when you will be able to

768
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:15,480
work with psychedelics. If you
choose to have a therapeutic if

769
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,240
you choose to incorporate
psychedelics into your

770
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,580
therapeutic regimen, you'll be
able to do so. If you choose to

771
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,660
incorporate psychedelics into
your spiritual regimen, you'll

772
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:30,800
be able to do so there have been
a couple of communities in the

773
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,920
United States, Ayahuasca
communities, who have taken

774
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,280
their case all the way to the
Supreme Court and have won the

775
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:44,260
right to use Ayahuasca as part
of their spiritual practice. So

776
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:49,540
we already are opening up the
legal doors. So I see it moving

777
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,860
in a very positive and a very
exciting direction. To me,

778
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:58,720
psychedelics are one of the just
as a philosopher, I cannot over

779
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:05,400
emphasize how important they are
to opening to facilitating this

780
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,600
intellectual paradigm that's
that's taking place because,

781
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:15,900
classically, historically, it
took decades, decades of

782
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,380
spiritual practice before one
could have access to these

783
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,420
Transpersonal dimensions of
existence, but psychedelics can

784
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:30,560
give even a modest individual
short term exposure to the

785
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:34,820
deeper these deeper textures of
reality, and they allow you to

786
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:38,480
change your thinking, even if
you can't abide in those

787
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,260
realities. They allow you to
change your understanding of the

788
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,520
world we live in, so that
they're tremendous door openers,

789
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:50,860
and I think that we won't be
able to turn down the

790
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:54,040
invitations that they are
extending into us, and that they

791
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,020
will be very much part of this
vast cultural awakening taking

792
01:02:59,020 --> 01:02:59,680
place.

793
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:07,859
Cybele: Yes, it seems like the
the paradigm we live in, you

794
01:03:07,859 --> 01:03:13,019
know, the Newton Ian physics,
the mechanical clockwork ness of

795
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:19,319
it. And people have lost the
ability to find new questions,

796
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:25,219
you know, and it sounds like
psychedelics. It gives the

797
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:28,639
chance the fish, the chance to
observe the water. And then you

798
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:31,219
have whole new possibilities of
questions,

799
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:36,919
Unknown: yes, yes, and
absolutely, new questions, new

800
01:03:36,919 --> 01:03:44,019
opportunities, and it may take
you Once the door is open. It

801
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,739
may take you, not necessarily,
to continued psychedelic

802
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:51,039
experience, but it may take you
to more traditional spiritual

803
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,899
practices of meditation, yoga,
whatever, but it's a tremendous

804
01:03:55,899 --> 01:04:02,699
door opener. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I
think if you live in the

805
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:07,259
Newtonian universe, I have
witnessed for decades What a

806
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:14,399
terrible, terrible, damaging
gospel secular humanism is for

807
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:17,999
our students. I mean, the vision
is that existence is an

808
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:21,979
accident. It's a fluke. It
proceeds by chance. There is no

809
01:04:21,979 --> 01:04:25,879
deeper intentionality behind
your life. If you live in a

810
01:04:25,879 --> 01:04:30,619
beautiful, healthy body, you're
lucky. If you live in a in a

811
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:35,059
body plagued by illness, you're
just not so lucky. The universe

812
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:38,959
isn't conscious. It isn't paying
attention to you. I mean, how

813
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:43,359
could, how could that universe,
that vision of reality not breed

814
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:47,379
all sorts of various types of
personal and social pathology.

815
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:50,739
And if the universe is
essentially dead, and if we are

816
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:54,099
essentially just material
beings, then materialism makes

817
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:57,099
sense. We just try to have as
many experiences and as consume

818
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:00,539
as many material things as we
can before we die. Because when

819
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:05,399
we die, we're going to cease to
exist anyway, so who cares? And

820
01:05:05,399 --> 01:05:09,959
that is the gospel which we've
been giving our brightest, most

821
01:05:09,959 --> 01:05:14,459
creative minds for generations.
And now that's beginning to

822
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:19,739
shift. Now, with the emergence
of an understanding of the way

823
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:23,719
in which the universe is
actually alive. We can document

824
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,019
its livingness in our
laboratories, and we can have

825
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:32,299
facilitated experiential
immersion in that aliveness,

826
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:38,179
then that opens up a profoundly
expanded vision of ourselves,

827
01:05:38,479 --> 01:05:43,059
and it gives us a kind of
leverage to take us away from

828
01:05:43,059 --> 01:05:47,439
this blind consumerism, so that
we can begin to draw our

829
01:05:47,439 --> 01:05:54,099
resources from a deeper
immersion in the universal, in

830
01:05:54,099 --> 01:05:55,299
the universe itself.

831
01:05:55,659 --> 01:06:02,279
Cybele: So for people who have a
crisis of of lack of meaning in

832
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:07,679
in the world. This could be a
really beneficial Avenue.

833
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,700
Unknown: I think it can be very
beneficial. I think just

834
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,640
reading, of course, is
enormously beneficial. I mean, I

835
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:20,300
do a workshop sometimes called
no fear of death. And here My

836
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:26,840
contention is, if you read the
right dozen books, it should

837
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,440
completely dissolve any fear of
death. It should open up the

838
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:36,020
possibilities of really
understanding the in a new way,

839
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:38,900
what the meaning of life is,
what the possibilities are, the

840
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,300
potentials are, if you look at
reincarnation research, near

841
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:49,420
death episode research, if you
look at life between life

842
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,740
therapy of Michael Newton and
where we're regressing people

843
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:57,580
back, not only to their former
life memories, but to their

844
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:02,520
awareness of their life between
their incarnations. If you

845
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,480
combine that with research and
psychedelics, I mean this, this

846
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,160
just creates an intellectual
context that opens up all new

847
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,760
sorts of avenues for
understanding the meaning of

848
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,840
life and the purpose of

849
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,360
Cybele: life. That's fabulous.
Thank you,

850
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:24,560
Susan: Chris, before we bring
this symposium to a close, I'd

851
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:29,240
like to read something you wrote
in dark night, early dawn, okay,

852
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,920
and you said, I believe that
this divine marriage of

853
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:38,600
individuality and essential
ground of the masculine and

854
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:44,680
feminine of Samsara and nirvana
is the dawn that humanity's dark

855
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:50,020
night is driving toward. This is
the dawn that, if successfully

856
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:56,140
navigated, will unite humankind
and elevate us into a form that

857
01:07:56,140 --> 01:08:01,140
has never before walked this
earth, a humanity healed of the

858
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:07,560
scars of history, its ancient
partitions, re absorbed a people

859
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:13,200
with new capacities born in the
chaos of near extinction. Only

860
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,460
when we have made this pivot,
when our long labor has birthed

861
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,280
this future child, only then
will we fully understand what we

862
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:27,260
have accomplished, and when this
moment finally comes, I deeply

863
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:31,640
believe that like all mothers
before us, we will count our

864
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,620
pain as a small price. This
birth is our gift to the

865
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:44,080
Creator. Thank you for writing
this. Thank you so much for such

866
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,460
a wonderful conversation. We so
appreciate it.

867
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,880
Unknown: Thank you very much.
It's been an honor and a

868
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,300
privilege to spend this time
with you. Thank you.

869
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:01,860
Chipper: Can I just read a poem?
I may have read it before, I

870
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:09,180
motion as love's beauty is
moving, standing nakedly and

871
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:13,800
blushing in photonics, brightly
rushing as love's artistries

872
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,540
unbrushed time in silent
rhythms, crushing sped slowly,

873
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:25,040
long and in a hush to bring to
rip title lushness out as and of

874
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,700
coupling within flux. Namaste.

875
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:32,539
Unknown: It's beautiful. Thank
you.

876
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:38,480
Susan: Chris, could you tell us
the names of your books and

877
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,620
maybe just a brief synopsis
about them.

878
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:46,959
Chris Bache: The books are the
first one is called life cycles,

879
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:53,079
reincarnation and the web of
life. It's basically a book on

880
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:58,239
reincarnation. It looks at
reincarnation through the issue

881
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,379
of the empirical evidence. It
looks. At it as a psychological

882
01:10:01,379 --> 01:10:05,519
and spiritual phenomenon, and
then it once it documents the

883
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:08,399
empirical evidence for
reincarnation, it then asks the

884
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:12,479
question, so what? What's the
difference if we see ourselves

885
01:10:12,539 --> 01:10:16,619
as reincarnating beings versus
one time through beings? So it's

886
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:21,439
just one of the early attempts
to explore this, the universe as

887
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:26,419
a pulsing, throbbing
reincarnation universe. The

888
01:10:26,419 --> 01:10:31,819
second one is dark, night, early
dawn, which is a book in the

889
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:34,519
philosophical study of
Non-ordinary states of

890
01:10:34,519 --> 01:10:38,179
consciousness, specifically
psychedelic states of

891
01:10:38,179 --> 01:10:42,939
consciousness, but integrating
Psychedelic Studies with near

892
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:47,559
death episode research and out
of body research trying asking

893
01:10:47,559 --> 01:10:51,219
the question is, the question is
the universe as it shows itself

894
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:54,579
in near death episode research,
in out of body research,

895
01:10:54,579 --> 01:10:58,899
particularly Robert Monroe's
work at The Monroe Institute and

896
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:03,719
psychedelic research, are those
pictures cohering, or are they

897
01:11:03,779 --> 01:11:08,939
fragmenting? And so exploring
that, and exploring the ways in

898
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:12,899
which our the collective psyche,
shows up in the work of

899
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:17,159
individuals, and the way the
individuals work influences and

900
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:20,779
contributes to our collective
evolution. That integrated part

901
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,039
and the third book is called the
living classroom. And all of

902
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:29,899
these are you can get them on
Amazon or other book sites. The

903
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:35,719
living classroom tells the story
of it's about fields of

904
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:38,839
consciousness, collective
consciousness, the subtler

905
01:11:38,839 --> 01:11:42,939
background textures of
consciousness as they surface in

906
01:11:42,939 --> 01:11:47,379
the classroom. Because what I
found over time was, while I I

907
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:52,839
kept my personal life, my quote,
personal spiritual practice, out

908
01:11:52,839 --> 01:11:55,959
of the classroom, because it's
not appropriate to bring it into

909
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:59,859
the classroom. That was my
weekend work, what I found was

910
01:11:59,859 --> 01:12:03,119
that the work I was doing in
these very deep states of

911
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:07,439
consciousness outside of the
classroom began to impact my

912
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:13,379
students in the classroom, and I
began to understand and had to

913
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:18,539
think about and theorize about
the collective the nature of

914
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:23,059
collective consciousness, not at
the species level, but actually

915
01:12:23,059 --> 01:12:26,719
at a very intimate level, of the
students that I was working with

916
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,099
week in, week out, year after
year. So it's about teaching and

917
01:12:31,099 --> 01:12:34,699
collective consciousness. So
those are the three. And now I'm

918
01:12:34,699 --> 01:12:39,679
going back to the topic of of
psychedelic work and trying to

919
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,999
give some type of philosophical
description or exploration of

920
01:12:45,999 --> 01:12:52,659
that 20 year psychedelic Odyssey
that I went On between 1979 And

921
01:12:52,659 --> 01:14:40,119
1999 You You You You.

Chris Bache: Um, I think
Stevenson's evidence is really a

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,420
strong evidence for some type of
continuity of an awareness from

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,620
lifetime to lifetime, especially
his last two book, which is a

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,180
two volume book on philosophy
and on reincarnation in biology,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,780
in which he studied 170 87 cases
of children who not only had

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,100
psychological recall from their
previous lifetime, but actually

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,320
bore the marks in their body in
the form of birthmarks, which

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,300
replicated wounds of death in
the previous incarnation. So

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,940
somehow, it was as if
consciousness had been

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,960
traumatized in such a way that
it not only imprinted on

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,900
subsequent mind, but it
imprinted on the body of

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,100
subsequent mind. So after
looking at this data a lot, I

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,260
think what it tells us is we
have information in our mind

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,060
that predates this body.

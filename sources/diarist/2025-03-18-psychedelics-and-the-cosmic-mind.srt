new thinking allowed

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,160
Jeffrey Mishlove: today. Thank
you, Emmy, it's a pleasure to be

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,140
here today.

29
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,580
Emmy Vadnais: We're going to
discuss your deep exploration of

30
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,160
yourself, your own spiritual
journey and into the cosmic mind

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,380
when you had 73 LSD sessions
between the years of 1979 to

32
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,780
1999 and you outline that in
your book LSD, in the mind of

33
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,880
the universe, before we get into
all that you experienced and

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,380
what you gleaned and learned
from that. From those sessions,

35
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,340
can we just begin with talking a
little bit about what you've

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,200
noticed in the last, oh, I don't
know, 10 plus years or more,

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,920
where it seems that the taboo
related to psychedelics seems to

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,620
be shifting the types of
psychedelics there are out there

39
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,560
and and what their uses are, for
not each one, but sort of

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,880
overall, why people do this, and
today we're going to focus on

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,760
specifically the cosmic
exploration of them.

42
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,300
Jeffrey Mishlove: Well, as you
know, there is a worldwide

43
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,360
renaissance of research taking
place in psychedelics. At the

44
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,040
forefront of that research is
the focus on therapeutic

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,160
healing. That's what's bringing
psychedelics back into the

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,600
intellectual and clinical
community, the capacity of these

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,940
amplifying substances to bring
forward the personal unconscious

48
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,920
and to unearth the wounds of the
personal unconscious and to

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
assist and deepen, accelerate
people's healings of trauma,

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,660
various issues Post Traumatic
Stress, depression, things like

51
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:56,020
this, a second use of
psychedelics, overlapping but

52
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,340
different from therapeutic
Healing, is using psychedelics

53
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,280
to promote spiritual awakening,
an awakening to our of the true

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,280
nature, our deeper nature,
underneath our personality,

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,560
nature to deepen our
understanding, our experience of

56
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,040
the wisdom of the universe, the
intelligence of the universe,

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,780
the consciousness of the
universe. Classic kind of

58
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,100
spiritual awakening to the to
the nature of spiritual reality,

59
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,540
and that's why I got started in
this work. Really was to deepen

60
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,000
my spiritual awakening. But the
protocol that I ended up using

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,480
was so strong and so evocative.
Within a few years, I was having

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,600
experiences that went far beyond
anything that could be

63
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,400
understood in terms of either
therapeutic healing or spiritual

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,880
awakening. And I came to
understand over time, that the

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,500
project that I was involved in
was cosmological exploration,

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,100
that is a systematic attempt to
explore. Or the deep structure

67
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,180
of spiritual reality, or the
deep structure of the

68
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,560
consciousness of the universe
itself. So that's really what my

69
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,240
work is about. I'm not a
clinician. I am a trained as a

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,140
philosopher of religion. What
interested me from Stan Grof

71
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,720
early work was the capacity of
these substances to lay bare,

72
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,880
not only of the personal issues,
but to enter into deep communion

73
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,360
with the consciousness that lies
behind existence.

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,220
Emmy Vadnais: Can you share give
us an overview of the different

75
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,300
types of psychedelics, just to
kind of list them off, of

76
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,820
course, because there are, there
are many, but we're going to

77
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,640
primarily talk about your
experience with LSD today.

78
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,480
Jeffrey Mishlove: Many
psychedelics. I mean, there, I

79
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,400
guess the primary ones that come
to mind are LSD, Psilocybin,

80
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,440
MDMA, though that's probably
that's an in pathogen, more than

81
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:07,620
a straight psychedelic. Five,
MEO, DMT, salvia divinorum San

82
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,160
Pedro. I mean, I think these are
the types of psychedelics that

83
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,500
most people are familiar with.
There are all sorts of

84
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,220
derivatives. MDMA. They're
derivatives off of each of these

85
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,560
little tweaks along the way.

86
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,500
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah. And we also
want to say upfront that you're

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,480
not recommending necessarily
that people engage in the same

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,960
process you engaged in, or
advocating necessarily for the

89
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,600
use of these per se, is that
right?

90
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,840
Jeffrey Mishlove: Absolutely,
there are a large percentage of

91
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,680
the population who shouldn't be
doing psychedelics at all. These

92
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,800
are very powerful amplifiers of
consciousness. They have

93
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,900
tremendous evocative potential.
And there are persons who should

94
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,140
not be venturing into these
waters, and no one should be

95
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,560
venturing into these waters
without really good, high

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,200
quality professional guides
accompanying you to keep you

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,860
safe as you enter into this
territory. Now, the protocol

98
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,600
that I chose to work with was
high doses of LSD. I worked at

99
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,580
500 to 600 micrograms, and
looking back at it on it, at the

100
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,160
end of it, I think, what was I
thinking? That was ridiculous,

101
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,100
but I had a deep hunger to
explore the nature of existence,

102
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,960
and working at these high doses
took me on an adventure of a

103
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,000
lifetime. But this is very
demanding work, which requires a

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
lot of concentration, a lot of
safeguards and a lot of time to

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,220
assimilate the experiences, and
I really knowing what I know

106
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,900
now, at the end of this journey,
I strongly recommend against

107
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,180
using the protocol that I used.
If I were doing it over again, I

108
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,860
would work with lower doses of
psychedelics. I'd be much

109
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,820
gentler on myself. I'd be
willing to sort of peel back the

110
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,560
layers of the psyche much more
gradually than I did in this

111
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,040
work.

112
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,120
Emmy Vadnais: So to begin into
your journey, what was the

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,100
impetus for you to embark on
this deep exploration with high

114
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,740
doses of LSD.

115
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,620
Jeffrey Mishlove: Well, I had
just finished my graduate work.

116
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,980
I had just started my academic
career. At the time, I was a

117
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,900
pretty convinced atheistically
inclined agnostic. And then I

118
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,180
met the work of two people, Ian
Stevenson, whose work on

119
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,020
reincarnation convinced me that
reincarnation was a simple fact

120
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,040
of life, and the other one was
Stanislav Grof. And I read his

121
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,860
book, realms of the human
unconscious. And I read it in

122
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,080
1978 two years after it had just
come out. And as soon as I read

123
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,680
that book, I recognize that
Stan's work had tremendous

124
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,120
significance, not only for
psychotherapy, but it had

125
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,940
tremendous significance for
philosophy of religion,

126
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,260
philosophy of consciousness. And
I knew that if I was ever going

127
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,660
to make a contribution in this
field, I had to undergo, I had

128
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,360
to undergo my own therapeutic
exploration, my own regimen so

129
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,500
very uncomfortably, I made a
decision to break the law in a

130
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,740
very, I hope, disciplined and
restrained way, and I began a

131
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,240
series of psychedelic sessions,
which ended up, much to my

132
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,060
surprise, ended up lasting 20
years. I worked for four years.

133
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,720
I stopped for six years, and
then I worked for another 10

134
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,180
years, finishing in 1999 and
then I spent 20 years after

135
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,140
that, digesting these
experiences, analyzing them,

136
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,780
sifting them, sorting them, and
then wrote El. University in the

137
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,400
mind of the universe in 2019, 20
years after I had stopped my

138
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,240
sessions.

139
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:10,679
Emmy Vadnais: Can you give us a
sense of what your sessions were

140
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,119
like? How you began? You
mentioned that you had a sitter,

141
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:19,919
somebody with you in that
process. How did you choose to

142
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,579
set up your set and setting.

143
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,040
Jeffrey Mishlove: Well,
basically, I followed the

144
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,640
protocol established by stand
reflected in his book, realms of

145
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,600
the human unconscious, and then
clarified further in his book,

146
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,080
LSD psychotherapy, where he lays
out all the nuts and bolts of

147
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,820
working in this modality. You're
always, I was always in a room,

148
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,120
separated from the world,
protected from the world, no

149
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,540
interruptions by myself with my
sitter, who was my wife at the

150
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,300
time, who was a clinical
psychologist who studied the

151
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:02,040
psychedelic literature with me.
I'm lying down. I'm using eye

152
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,260
shades and Muse and headphones
conventional kind of classic

153
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,840
psychedelic, deep introspection,
deep meditative orientation,

154
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,880
very carefully curated music to
support the opening and the

155
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,480
peaking and the closing of a
session. So the basic idea is to

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,000
profoundly energize the
unconscious, and then to create

157
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,720
an environment where the the
energies rising through your

158
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,640
unconscious can be engaged
cleanly and clearly if you stay

159
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,200
in contact with the physical
world, if you're in dialog with

160
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,160
friends, or if you're going to a
concert, that's all fine and

161
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,420
good, but that's just not what
this work is about. It requires

162
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,680
a powerful amplification of the
unconscious, but then creating a

163
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,360
very carefully controlled
environment that lead allows you

164
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,000
to engage what rises
conscientiously and most

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,680
importantly, to follow whatever
arises to its very bottom level,

166
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,780
to the bottom line, to let it
take you wherever it wants to

167
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,260
take you.

168
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,940
Emmy Vadnais: If I recall
correctly, it was typically on

169
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,940
Saturdays because you had a very
important day job teaching at a

170
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,140
university, and I think your
sessions lasted about was eight

171
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,520
hours each, roughly,

172
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,980
Jeffrey Mishlove: yeah, pretty
much I would start in the early

173
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,820
morning, and I would finish by
nighttime. That night, late

174
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,740
afternoon, night time. So a
session would last 810, hours or

175
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,180
so of the carry over tail, but
basically a good, hard eight

176
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,260
hours each session. So it's a
major commitment. It's a you

177
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,940
have eventually, I developed
spiritual protocols that I would

178
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,100
adopt in the weeks leading up to
a session and in the weeks after

179
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,860
a session, and particularly the
day or two before a session, and

180
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,520
the day or two after the
session. You really have to work

181
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,880
with those that time and with
the energy that is stirred in

182
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,680
you, because if you're working
with very high doses of a

183
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,380
powerful psychedelic like LSD,
it taps into very deep levels of

184
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,000
the universe, and it takes your
body and mind and subtle energy

185
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,100
system a time to process that
material. And so it's it's a

186
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,640
major time commitment. It's just
not the day of. It's several

187
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,800
days before and several days
after.

188
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,000
Emmy Vadnais: You also took
meticulous notes from your

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,440
sessions as well, which is a lot
of what's in your book.

190
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,220
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah, that's
the first step of integration is

191
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,380
to act to create an accurate
phenomenological description of

192
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,940
exactly what happens in your
sessions, because integration is

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,960
the foundation of your future
sessions. If you don't integrate

194
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,240
your sessions thoroughly and
conscientiously, then you're not

195
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,320
going to have as likely to have
as deep an experience the next

196
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,700
session out. So there's a circle
where you open, but then you

197
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,360
integrate what you experience,
which lays the foundation for

198
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,060
the deeper opening in your next
session.

199
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,220
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah. It seems
like they built upon each other.

200
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,320
Jeffrey Mishlove: In my
experience, they did. Again, I

201
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,400
kind of standardized my sessions
as much as possible, eliminating

202
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,300
as many variables. I always was
using the same substance, the

203
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,680
same dose, the same set and
setting, the same sitter, even

204
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,380
in the same part of the country.
If you change those variables,

205
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,120
it changes the subtlety of the
interface between your mind and

206
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,840
the universe's mind that you're
engaging. So by trying to

207
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,340
standardize those variables, you
create an environment of

208
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,948
sustained communion or dialog.
With this deeper consciousness.

209
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:08,288
And by by treating that
sustained, clear contact point,

210
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,548
my experience was that the
universe, or the consciousness,

211
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,788
whatever it was that I was
engaging, that consciousness,

212
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,868
took me deeper and deeper in a
systematic fashion. It was like

213
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:25,520
taking a series of graduate
courses in consciousness. It was

214
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,740
a tremendous, rigorous,
systematic expansion of my frame

215
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,580
of reality.

216
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:36,079
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah. Why did you
choose this path versus, for

217
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,599
example, sitting in meditation
or some other spiritual path

218
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:43,539
that can lead you deeper into
these realms.

219
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,139
Jeffrey Mishlove: Well, I had
been meditating since college. I

220
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:50,319
was familiar with meditation. I
meditated in a couple of

221
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:53,679
different traditions by that
time, and I'm a professor of

222
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,799
religious studies, so I had a
good, solid grounding in the

223
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,219
world spiritual traditions. I
taught courses in psychology of

224
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:05,759
religion and Transpersonal
studies and comparative

225
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,739
mysticism. So I understood the
world of meditation and

226
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:16,139
contemplative practice. I
started by thinking that these

227
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,799
sessions would basically help me
break through some of the

228
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,739
obstacles that had risen in my
contemplative practice. What I

229
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:28,399
found, however, was that this
was a protocol of spiritual

230
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,199
exploration that took me deeper
than I had ever imagined being

231
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,319
possible when I began this work,
and once I was into it a couple

232
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:44,559
of years I had developed an
aptitude for working in these

233
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,679
states, and I never stopped
meditating. I was always

234
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,739
meditating through this time. I
was always doing yoga and

235
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:54,759
various spiritual practices. In
fact, I think that the deeper

236
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,559
you want to go in working with
psychedelics, the more important

237
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,959
it is to have a daily spiritual
practice that helps anchor you

238
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,639
and helps you absorb the
experiences that you unleash

239
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,619
with psychedelics. It was a
different protocol. It gave me

240
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,399
access to states of
consciousness that you can reach

241
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,459
with meditation, but only with
lifetimes, not just one

242
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,499
lifetime, but many lifetimes of
meditation. So I differentiate

243
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:31,219
between what I call the path of
temporary immersion, which is

244
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:34,459
working with psychedelics as you
only, you're only immersed in

245
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:39,199
these states for hours at a
time, versus the path of

246
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,819
presence, of contemplative
presence, where it's a slower

247
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:47,739
path, but it tends to produce
states of abiding transparency,

248
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:53,739
whereas the temporary path
pushes you deep into these

249
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,359
conscious domains, and then it
wears off and you Come back.

250
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:02,279
They're they're complementing
approaches, but they are

251
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:02,939
different.

252
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,220
Emmy Vadnais: Let's begin with
your very first session, just to

253
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,180
get us started, because I know
you've done many of them to give

254
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,720
the listeners, the audience, the
viewers, a taste of what your

255
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,320
experience was like, that led
you to keep wanting to come back

256
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,040
for more.

257
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,980
Jeffrey Mishlove: Probably the
most significant thing that

258
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,940
happened in my first session was
that I entered a phase of the

259
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,380
work where I could not remember
who I was. I could not remember

260
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,640
what I was, what I did for a
living, living. I could not

261
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,980
remember whether I was a man or
a woman, even it was a complete

262
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,900
interruption of my stream of
consciousness that was telling

263
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,220
me who and what I was. And this
was a frightening experience, a

264
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,300
jarring experience, but in the
end, I learned that it was a

265
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,060
very helpful experience, because
it showed me that it would be

266
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,080
pointless for me to try to stay
in control, because if you can't

267
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,400
control your self knowledge,
then what that's about as basic

268
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,440
as you can get. And this session
taught me that in this work, you

269
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,540
have to surrender radically to
whatever arises. And it saved me

270
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,240
a lot of time and energy later,
when more demanding experiences

271
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,680
open, there's a tendency to sort
of want to maintain control, to

272
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,760
hold on to reality as you know
it. And in this type of work,

273
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,060
you have to let go of reality as
you know it. You have to

274
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:40,180
completely surrender and go
where it wants to take you. And

275
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,020
so that was just the first
lesson that basically said,

276
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,980
Don't waste time trying to
maintain control

277
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,180
Emmy Vadnais: before we go
further into some of your

278
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,860
sessions and giving us a taste
of your experiences and what you

279
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,560
learned. Have you come to.
Understand the physiology of

280
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,540
what LSD is doing on the human
physiology the nervous system.

281
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,660
Of course, a lot of people think
about connect consciousness with

282
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,600
the brain, which, of course,
it's more than that. However, I

283
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,020
recently spoke with Jill Bolte
Taylor, who is a neuroanatomist

284
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,660
from Harvard, and she had a
wrote a well known book her

285
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,200
Stroke of Insight, where she had
a stroke and she had an eight

286
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,680
year journey of recovery back,
but she described that our

287
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,760
personal sense of identity is
just the size of a peanut in our

288
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,480
brains.

289
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,460
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah, and, you
know, I followed the discussion

290
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:44,860
of the science scientist about
how what is biochemistry of LSD

291
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,180
and how it affects brain
structure and Default Mode

292
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:54,280
Network interruption and those
type of discussions, but I'm not

293
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,520
really drawn to that
conversation. I'm not primarily

294
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,460
a scientist, a scientist in
training. I basically have taken

295
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,580
more of a psychological approach
to understanding that these

296
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,600
substances, whatever their
mechanism, they amplify

297
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,280
consciousness, they open they
hyper sensitize consciousness,

298
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,660
and they allow you to experience
dimensions of your mind, and

299
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:25,160
eventually, of reality beyond
your mind, which usually were

300
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,840
kept in a space time, kind of
focus where we don't experience

301
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,240
these subtler textures, right,

302
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,020
Emmy Vadnais: where we can feel
trapped inside our bodies or in

303
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,280
the what most people consider is
primarily the materialistic

304
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,540
world, which we know is there's
much more than that, which is

305
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,040
what we're talking about today.

306
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,460
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah, yeah.
And that's, that's the real draw

307
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,860
to me. And so I basically work
within the frame of reference

308
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,500
that I had acquired from Stan
Grof and some of the other

309
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,200
earlier researchers, using a
description of the dynamic

310
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,260
qualities of psychedelic
consciousness, or the

311
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,680
consciousness that arises with
psychedelics. And I'll let the

312
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,060
science guys sort out the
physiology of it. I know that

313
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,360
that's interesting, and I find
that often the physiological

314
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,080
discussion is carried out within
reductive metaphysical

315
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,500
assumptions, which really is not
helping our conversation right

316
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:24,860
now.

317
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,380
Emmy Vadnais: You mean the
conversation in general. We're

318
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,000
having a good conversation,
right?

319
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,840
Jeffrey Mishlove: I mean the
attempts to sort of understand,

320
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,280
to correlate what's happening in
the brain physiologically,

321
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,800
right, with the states of
consciousness that one is

322
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,560
experiencing. But often these
discussions take place within a

323
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,800
certain set of metaphysical
assumptions. And too often those

324
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,480
metaphysical assumptions tend to
be reductive. They tend to sort

325
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,140
of lean in the direction of
thinking that physical reality

326
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,020
is the dominant and determining
reality of one's experience. But

327
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,680
when you actually look at the
experiences that emerge in

328
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,380
psychedelics, that restrictive
metaphysical framework is

329
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,160
shattered,

330
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,880
Emmy Vadnais: yeah, well, I just
want to touch on it for now, and

331
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,100
primarily because there may be
those listening thinking, well,

332
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,780
this is just, you know, your
brain on on drugs, and it's

333
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,620
causing, you know, the whole
chemical reaction. Yeah, that's

334
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,680
been discussed with near death
experiencers and so forth, but

335
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,440
research has shown that there's
more going on with that. So I

336
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,200
definitely understand what
you're what you're saying, and

337
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,360
we can get into the veracity or
the trusting of these

338
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,260
experiences a little later in
our conversation, can you take

339
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,700
us more into some of your
experiences with your sessions

340
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,480
with LSD, to give us a taste of
what that was like for you?

341
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,260
Jeffrey Mishlove: Ooh, that's a
hard question. I mean, let's

342
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,860
give a context some very
influential books were written

343
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,140
based on a very limited number
of psychedelic experiences. So

344
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,800
Aldous Huxley wrote his very
important, beautiful book, The

345
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,280
Doors opening the doors of
perception after only one

346
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,800
Mescaline experience. And Huston
Smith wrote his book, his

347
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,480
collected reflections on
psychedelics, cleansing the

348
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,940
doors of perception after only
taking LSD six times over the

349
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,560
course of his lifetime. Michael
Pollan wrote his book, after

350
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,360
which is a very important, very
helpful book, but after only a

351
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,500
handful of psychedelic
experiences. So the challenge

352
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,180
that anyone faces coming into my
work are the challenges that I

353
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:53,320
have conveying my experiences is
just how long the journey was,

354
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,160
how many layers of consciousness
opened in that journey. It's not

355
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,580
simply a matter of opening 73
times. To the same interface is

356
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,180
that there is a cycle of death
and rebirth that reproduces

357
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:11,220
itself so that death breaks you
free of one level of reality,

358
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,220
physical reality in the
beginning and enters, takes you

359
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,900
into a non physical, spiritual
reality. And you work there for

360
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,880
a while, but if you work
consistently, eventually you'll

361
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,420
go through another death and
rebirth that will take you into

362
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,660
another level of reality, where
you have to learn the whole

363
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,780
rules of that level of reality,
which would then will be

364
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,560
followed, taking you to another
level. So the problem I have

365
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,820
with answering your question is
so many levels of reality. Any

366
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,940
if I focused on any one, I'd be
leaving out so many others. So

367
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,900
let me just say this in the
beginning, when I was looking

368
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,760
over the whole of my sessions
and putting them together, in

369
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,500
order to write this storyline of
what happened on those sessions,

370
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,500
I eventually differentiated or
distinguished five different

371
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,140
broad categories that my
sessions fell into. First,

372
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,740
having to do with personal mind,
your personal unconscious, your

373
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,660
personal story. Second,
collective mind, which has to do

374
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,920
with the collective psyche, the
psyche of humanity, the species

375
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,320
mind, the third archetypal mind,
which in my case, I'm primarily

376
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,000
addressing, not archetypes in
the Jungian sense, but

377
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,740
archetypes more in the Platonic
sense, the levels dimensions of

378
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:42,340
reality which lie outside time
and space and outside the

379
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,640
collective psyche, causal levels
of reality are the level of

380
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,540
oneness, the level where oneness
becomes the dominant reality,

381
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,940
and then beyond that diamond
Luminosity, a particularly clear

382
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,800
dimension of light that I
encountered and worked with in

383
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,020
the last five years of my work.
So all of my experiences, I can

384
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,820
kind of lay them out as a
sequential journey, starting at

385
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,460
the level of personal mind,
moving into the level of

386
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,760
collective mind, archetypal
mind, so on and so forth.

387
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,319
Emmy Vadnais: Well, I would love
to discuss each of those levels

388
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,379
you went into, what I recall
reading in your book that seemed

389
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:28,339
to be common themes of your
sessions were that it was, like

390
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:32,239
you said earlier, a letting go,
and that there was, it seemed a

391
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:36,559
lot of pain and suffering to
actually reach to these deeper

392
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,139
levels of consciousness. Can you
share what that was like for you

393
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,899
Jeffrey Mishlove: in the early
stage and when I was working at

394
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:46,779
the level of personal mind, that
the pain and suffering came in

395
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:50,859
the form of what Stan Grof is
very well discussed and

396
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:53,679
presented in his discussion of
the perinatal level of

397
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,379
consciousness, basically
sometimes reliving your birth,

398
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:02,819
but confronting the fundamental
existential questions that

399
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:08,339
dominate life and physical
reality. Is there any meaning in

400
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:11,459
the universe? Is there any
order, any design to it, any

401
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:15,239
intelligence of it? Because at
just the physical level,

402
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:19,199
everything we love, everything
we know, will be destroyed at

403
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,699
death. Is there any reality
beyond death? I mean, that's and

404
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:25,639
therefore you, you have to face
the deepest levels of

405
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:30,499
metaphysical angst in order to
move through this until

406
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:35,119
eventually your identity is just
crushed and shattered. That's

407
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,939
easier for some people to
undergo than it is for other

408
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:41,439
people. But you, you have to
surrender your time, space,

409
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:45,279
identity, in order to gain
access to the next level of

410
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,499
reality. At that next level of
reality, I continue to have a

411
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:56,859
deepening confrontation with
pain, suffering and violence. It

412
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:01,079
was so deep and it lasted so
long, and it seemed to encompass

413
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,159
so many hundreds of 1000s of
persons in so many 1000s of

414
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,319
years that I eventually came to
the decision that this was not

415
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,099
some didn't represent a
deepening or cleansing or

416
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:18,419
healing of my personal psyche,
that what was being healed here

417
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,219
was some aspect of the
collective psyche of humanity

418
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:27,319
itself, that something was using
my sessions in order to set in

419
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:33,799
motion a reconciliation and a
healing of levels of pain that

420
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:40,179
were fundamentally collective,
not personal, And then more

421
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:44,799
levels of death and rebirth,
where the nature of death and

422
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,719
suffering changes the deeper you
go. But the basic principle is

423
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:54,579
pretty simple, if you want to
experience oneness with God, or

424
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:58,779
if you want to experience a deep
experience of the nature of the

425
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:04,439
mind of the universe. So the
problem is our historical

426
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:08,579
consciousness is just too small
if you want to literally

427
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:11,759
experience it. I mean, it's one
thing to think about it, but to

428
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,019
actually immerse yourself in the
communion with these levels of

429
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:20,719
reality, your small identity has
to be surrendered, and you have

430
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:26,299
to flow, be willing to flow into
a larger level of identity. So

431
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:30,799
eventually you're going into
levels of reality where it would

432
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,759
be a misrepresentation to think
that Chris Bache went and had

433
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:39,199
those experiences. Rather, Chris
Bache has to be destroyed,

434
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:44,619
dissolved in order for these
levels of consciousness to

435
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:51,039
manifest inside Chris Bache his
awareness. But the fact that I

436
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,299
remember those experiences
doesn't mean that my personality

437
00:30:55,299 --> 00:31:00,179
identity was present when those
experiences were being had. It's

438
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,079
kind of like you have to lose
yourself, enter into communion

439
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,219
with the universe. And then when
you come back, you gather your

440
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:11,879
experiences back. And then my
personality synthesizes them,

441
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:15,299
digests them, trying to
integrate them. But it's, it's a

442
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,779
it's a pulsing. You learn to
sort of surrender completely,

443
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,999
open, breathe deeply. You
receive teachings, then you

444
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:26,359
bring it all back in, and then
you try to integrate it and

445
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,319
consolidate it.

446
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,680
Emmy Vadnais: What are some of
the teachings you received

447
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:34,879
Jeffrey Mishlove: that the
universe is a manifestation of a

448
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:40,159
single consciousness, a massive
consciousness beyond anything

449
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,139
that we've ever begun to grasp
in our Western religious and

450
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:49,239
philosophical traditions, that
it is an intent, that creation

451
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:55,419
is an intentional act. It is an
act of, I hate to use the word

452
00:31:55,419 --> 00:32:01,559
design, because those theories
are problematic, but that there

453
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:07,139
is an intelligence manifesting
itself in time and space, that

454
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:10,379
we are part of this
intelligence, that our nature is

455
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:14,999
of the same nature as its
nature. So this is an ancient

456
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,479
idea. Atman is Brahman. The
essence of the individual is the

457
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:23,539
essence of the totality that
reincarnation is simply a fact

458
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:27,079
of life. I don't think we get
anywhere in trying to understand

459
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:31,939
existence, unless we understand
the pulse of life, unless we

460
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:36,799
understand that our current life
is just the most recent in many,

461
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,499
many repeating cycles of life
and death, that there is an

462
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:45,159
underlying logic to the
circumstances within which we

463
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:48,759
find ourselves. Of the hint the
Buddhists and the Hindus talk

464
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:53,739
about karma, that there is a
deeper intentionality working

465
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:58,659
itself out in the circumstances
of our of our existence, and

466
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:03,299
that in that our evolutionary
existence is not simply driven

467
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:10,199
by blind chance and mechanical
processes which are which are

468
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:14,579
purely mechanical, but that
there is a deeper intelligence

469
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:18,599
manifesting itself in the
circumstances of our life, in

470
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,939
the challenges that we are
facing and inviting us to become

471
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:27,139
more by the end of our life than
we were in the beginning. So

472
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,119
just a few touch points.

473
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,540
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, yeah. Going
back to your experiences in

474
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,820
these sessions, it seems that
death and rebirth and a

475
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,920
purification process happened in
many, if not all of your

476
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,700
sessions, yeah, what did you
come to understand was the

477
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,720
reason for that

478
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,300
Jeffrey Mishlove: first, the
general structure of the

479
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,080
sessions, as I experienced them,
is that every session there's a

480
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,160
sort of a rhythm of a cycle with
variations, but basically the

481
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,900
first early hours of a session
are spent in some type of deep

482
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:08,520
purification process, deep
confrontation. And then if you

483
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,820
surrender to that process and
let it take you, it reaches a

484
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,180
culmination point. There is a
surrender, a Death-Rebirth

485
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,620
process, in which you are then
spun into Transpersonal,

486
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,300
ecstatic places for the
remainder of the session, and

487
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,860
then that runs its course. And
then the next session, however

488
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,060
many months between and I was
doing about five sessions a year

489
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,700
on average, starts you right
back into the purification part

490
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,280
and carrying you then forward
into the ecstatic portion. So

491
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,240
the purpose of the purification
and the purpose of the death is

492
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,660
simply cleaning, just cleaning,
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.

493
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,180
When you eventually come to have
deep experience of the

494
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,520
fundamental identity. Theory of
your nature and the divine

495
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,520
nature are the infinite nature
that you are the infinite, then

496
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,360
it gives you a different
perspective on what it is that

497
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,740
was present, preventing you all
those years from realizing that

498
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,040
what was keeping you from it and
it's, it's this tight

499
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,480
conditioning of the psyche.
It's, it's, it's the type

500
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,380
conditioning which is associated
with your time space

501
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,880
consciousness. And that has to
be softened, it has to be

502
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,060
released. It has to be let go in
order to move into these

503
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,860
expansive places. So the the
Death-Rebirth cycle is actually

504
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,040
a purification cycle. In fact, I
learned that death is actually

505
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,540
an intense stage of
purification. Once you've died

506
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:55,900
many times, you learn that
truly, it's impossible to die.

507
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,020
What you are can die. The
structure of your life can die.

508
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,180
Reality as you have known it can
die, but the Phoenix always

509
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,620
rises. The essence of the person
always emerges in a different

510
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,300
reality with new potentials,
with new capacities. But it's

511
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,600
impossible to die. And the
reason we can't die is, I think,

512
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,120
because our nature is the nature
of the Divine. So the form can

513
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:29,300
die, but the essence cannot die.
Once you know that, then I began

514
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,600
to understand that the
experience of death, which kept

515
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,740
coming up in my sessions, was
actually an experience, an

516
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,840
advanced experience of
purification, when purification

517
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:46,060
reaches a critical portion
position so that it begins to

518
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,840
dissolve the fundamental
structures of what you had known

519
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,580
as real. Then you have reached
the death point, the death and

520
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,480
rebirth point, and death has
come back to grace you again. So

521
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,980
from my perspective,
experiencing death in a

522
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,800
psychedelic session, or to
experience horrendous suffering

523
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,140
or pain is actually it's an
exciting stage in the work. It's

524
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,660
not something to be avoided. A
lot of people worry about, oh, I

525
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,120
don't want to have a bad
session. We got to do everything

526
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,960
we can to avoid having a bad
session. But I think that's a

527
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,940
radical misunderstanding of the
depth of consciousness and the

528
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:29,120
power that this technique gives
you. In my experience, you come

529
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,380
you begin to understand that the
deeper the purification, the

530
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,460
deeper the ecstatic immersion,
so that you begin to welcome the

531
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,780
purification. You begin to
welcome the challenges that you

532
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,100
face, you begin to welcome the
bad sessions in order to

533
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,780
actualize a higher, more
intimate experience with the

534
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,400
Divine Consciousness. Now that's
assuming that you're working in

535
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,040
a completely controlled
environment. You have done all

536
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,780
the homework, you've done your
preparation, you can have a bad

537
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,520
session for a lot of bad
reasons. You can be in the wrong

538
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,300
place, the wrong time, not
preparing yourself, wrong set

539
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,980
and setting. Those can give you
bad sessions which are not of

540
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,600
the quality that I'm talking
about.

541
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,520
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, I will share
that when I was in high school,

542
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,880
a group of friends wanted to do
LSD, or acid, as it was called,

543
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:32,540
as well, and I did not partake.
However, I was the sitter, and

544
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,240
my role was to make sure that
everybody did have a good

545
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,280
experience, which actually the
few times that that happened,

546
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,360
was always the case. But I know
you mentioned that a bad trip is

547
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,620
not necessarily a bad trip,
yeah? So you suggest that that's

548
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,180
part of the process, but one
needs to be have done the

549
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,300
preparation ahead of time to
know what they're getting into.

550
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,560
Yeah.

551
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,660
Jeffrey Mishlove: I mean,
psychedelics amplify

552
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,300
consciousness, and most people
will take us like, I don't want

553
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,260
to over generalize. Some people
take a psychedelic and what

554
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,280
they're looking for is a good
afternoon. A little more

555
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,280
openness to the life of the
universe, a little more openness

556
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,320
to the to the love that's in the
universe. And they they maintain

557
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,080
their the fundamental parameters
of their personality get softer

558
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,100
and expansive and let some of
these experiences in which is

559
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,900
perfectly fine, but if you if
you want to go into a deep dive,

560
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,260
if you want to explore the deep
structure of existence, if you

561
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,360
want to transcend space,
transcend time, move into the

562
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:48,100
deep future that requires a more
carefully laid out strategy in

563
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,240
working with these states. So
I'm not suggesting that the way

564
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,560
I work with these states is the
only way, beneficial way to work

565
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,800
with these states is simply for
me. See, as a philosopher, I was

566
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,540
looking for depth of immersion,
depth of understanding, and that

567
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,920
takes some serious, some serious
work.

568
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,720
Emmy Vadnais: So while we're on
the topic of this death and

569
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,660
rebirth, surrendering
purification, can you share with

570
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,780
us what is it that dies and
reborn? I know you outline in

571
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,860
your book a few different areas
that you've come to understand.

572
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah, well,
basically, this became a real

573
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,300
intellectual issue for me. I
mean, when you experience dying

574
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,640
and being reborn through
multiple levels of reality, it

575
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,360
then becomes a question, what is
it that's actually dying? You

576
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,100
may have deep and profound
experiences of dying years after

577
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,100
you've gone through ego death.
And it's not simply the ego

578
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,120
dying over and over and over
again. It's a different kind of

579
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,880
death. So at the at the appendix
in LSD, in the mind of the

580
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,260
universe, I have an appendix on
what dies and is reborn, and I

581
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,880
suggest four levels of maybe
beginning to address that

582
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,640
question. One of them is, what
dies is our personal ego. Second

583
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,680
is, what dies is some aspect of
the collective ego, of the

584
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,840
collective psyche. Third, what
dies is what I call the shamanic

585
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,820
persona, complicated concept.
But when you've been on the

586
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:37,280
journey for a long time, when
you move into psychedelic space,

587
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,780
you resume your psychedelic
persona. You resume your

588
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:46,000
shamanic persona. It's like, as
a friend of mine said, you walk

589
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,800
with the old ones once again.
You kind of, you've made the

590
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,200
transition often enough that you
you're and your shamanic persona

591
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,780
is the living integration of all
of your psychedelic experiences

592
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,920
up to that point in time. So
let's say in this case, it was

593
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,360
20 sessions in working at the
level of the collective psyche

594
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:15,300
into what I call the ocean of
suffering, you stabilize a

595
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:21,140
psychedelic identity, shamanic
persona that integrates all the

596
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,220
experiences that you have had of
Transpersonal states of

597
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,600
consciousness beyond your
physical consciousness. If you

598
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,680
are going to go into yet a still
deeper level of consciousness,

599
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,760
beyond where you had lived
before, then that shamanic

600
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,180
persona has to die. It has to
surrender in order for a new

601
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,440
category, instead of a category
of experiences, to emerge, and

602
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,360
for a still deeper shamanic
persona to emerge. And so I

603
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,820
think in some advanced sessions,
what is dying is the previous

604
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,160
identity that or the identity
which we had developed from

605
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,140
sustained psychedelic
experiences over many years. So

606
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,080
that's, I think, the third thing
is, I would suggest it's what I

607
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,260
call the shamanic persona, or
the shamanic self, is dying.

608
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,100
It's not the egoic self, it's
your psychedelic self, which is

609
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:23,240
dying. And then at a more subtle
level. I think what is dying is

610
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,180
actually some dimension of
consciousness itself. And this,

611
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,660
this gets harder to discuss
because it requires a more

612
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,000
subtle level of understanding.
But basically sometimes in my

613
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,860
late work, when I was working at
very deep levels of

614
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,520
consciousness. When I was
working in deep levels of divine

615
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,660
communion, I had the experience
that the divine level that I was

616
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:59,320
experiencing came itself into a
crescendo which opened up a

617
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,020
higher level of divine communion
than had been actualized up to

618
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:09,120
this point in time. Sri
Aurobindo says, when he's

619
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,080
talking in his metaphysical
system, he says, looking down,

620
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,080
the divine sees all the levels
of reality, that it's

621
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,620
manifested, but it's a one way
mirror, so the divine looking

622
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,020
down sees everything, but we,
who are the divine looking up,

623
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,040
tend to see only the level that
we are at. So it's a one way

624
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,140
mirror, and that means even at
Deep, deep levels, should we

625
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:38,480
say, there are aspects of divine
consciousness which cannot see

626
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,280
or experience de in distilled
deeper levels of divine

627
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:49,660
consciousness, and somehow, when
we do this work, we actually can

628
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,920
facilitate a communion which
takes place between two

629
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,460
different levels of divine
consciousness, far beyond space

630
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,960
time, far beyond personal
reality. And there is a

631
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,500
celebratory joy that takes place
when the divine wakes up to a

632
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,980
still deeper level of the
Divine. There is a communion

633
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,880
that takes place. There is a
joyful celebration when the

634
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,980
higher is able to infuse itself
more deeply into the lower. And

635
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,180
so I think that one of the
things, one way of thinking

636
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:30,080
about what dies in very advanced
stages, is some aspect of divine

637
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,580
consciousness itself.

638
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,620
Emmy Vadnais: And yet, according
to your experiences, that death

639
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:42,040
then precipitates a rebirth.
Typically, did you discover that

640
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,000
with consciousness itself as
well? Yes, the divine itself?

641
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,440
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah. I mean,
it's, again, we're, it's, it's

642
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,680
complicated, because we're
rushing into an area where

643
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,440
angels fear to tread. Right?

644
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,140
Emmy Vadnais: We're trying to
put language to an experience

645
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,220
that many sometimes, for
example, with near death

646
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,800
experiencers, they'll say, it's
ineffable. So I understand

647
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,480
there's a language barrier.

648
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,540
Jeffrey Mishlove: Well, there is
a language barrier. But for me,

649
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:15,120
the biggest issue is not the
language barrier. It is to lay

650
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,420
the foundation, to lay the
prerequisites, to put things in

651
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,980
place so that you people can
understand the language that

652
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,300
you're want to use to describe
these phenomena. And it's not

653
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,680
ordinary day language. It's not
everyday experience. It requires

654
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,900
kind of a conceptual reframe, a
conceptual understanding, so

655
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:41,080
that you can describe certain
things that lie far beyond our

656
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,040
ordinary sensate experience. But
in some ways, it's not that

657
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,940
different from what a near death
episode person experiences. In

658
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:55,900
fact, I find I feel the greatest
correspondence and collegiality

659
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,560
with people who have had deep
near death episode experiences

660
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,340
because deep nd ease are the
experiences of the closest

661
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,900
correlate to my experience with
deep psychedelic work. I think

662
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,940
if you work with psychedelics in
a focused way, over long periods

663
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:19,020
of time, you can access the same
dimensions of consciousness that

664
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:24,260
someone accesses with an n de a
Near-Death Experience. The

665
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,340
difference is that where, for
most people, the nd ear

666
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,900
experiences this only once in
their life. With sustained

667
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,140
psychedelics, you can go back
multiple times into this

668
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,240
territory. And because you can
go back multiple times, you're

669
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,140
taught, there are more nuances
that are brought out in terms of

670
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,920
how this all works in the
interplay of consciousness.

671
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,640
Emmy Vadnais: Can you help
expand the conceptual framework

672
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,960
for us? A little bit about what
that experience has been like

673
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,620
for you?

674
00:47:57,399 --> 00:48:00,539
Jeffrey Mishlove: Let me narrow
it into one particular just to

675
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:05,879
take one example, when I was in
the work. Now, I guess four or

676
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:09,479
five years into the work, I
began to get systematic access

677
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:14,699
to archetypal reality, and I
began to have experiences every

678
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:19,079
time I went into my session, I
entered this level of reality

679
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:24,259
that I knew was more real than
space time, it was the primary

680
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:28,999
reality. Space Time was the
secondary reality. I had

681
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:34,819
encounters with vast beings that
I could not comprehend. I could

682
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:38,299
not wrap my mind around them,
but I knew that these were the

683
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:43,359
beings who were responsible for
creating space time and creating

684
00:48:43,479 --> 00:48:48,099
fundamental conditions within
space time. But to have access

685
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:52,119
to these realities, everything
that I had known about human

686
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:55,239
history, about human thought,
everything about the history of

687
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:59,919
humanity, had to fall away,
because the entire collective

688
00:48:59,919 --> 00:49:06,419
psyche had to fall away in order
to enter into levels of

689
00:49:06,419 --> 00:49:11,699
consciousness that humanity as a
whole has not had access to or

690
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:16,739
has not experienced. Very few
number of people have access to

691
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:22,039
these deep dimensions of
reality, but even in archetype

692
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:27,859
or reality, you're dealing with
very profound levels of

693
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:30,739
consciousness. But there is
still dualism there. There is

694
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:35,419
still a sense of self and other.
Archetype and self are different

695
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:41,439
archetypes. So it's there is a
dualistic quality to it. When I

696
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:47,079
went beyond archetype of reality
into causal reality, that's the

697
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:53,139
signature of causal reality,
that all dualisms dissolve, so

698
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:58,119
that you begin to experience the
world in whatever aspect you're

699
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:01,199
experiencing it you're
experiencing. World as a

700
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:06,899
unified, single entity, a single
consciousness. I think it was

701
00:50:06,899 --> 00:50:11,159
Plotinus who says the world
breathes as one, and that's the

702
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:15,239
experience there, that there is
a radical transparency that

703
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:20,639
opens where you are
fundamentally encountering the

704
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:25,999
wholeness of life that doesn't
negate differentiation. In fact,

705
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:31,219
it affirms differentiation, but
that differentiation is

706
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:35,299
experienced as different
manifestations of the single,

707
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:41,619
integrated whole, undivided
reality that we call God, or we

708
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,339
call the divine, or the one
that's a different category of

709
00:50:45,339 --> 00:50:49,359
experience altogether from
archetype or reality.

710
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,180
Emmy Vadnais: Can you share a
little bit more about why it's

711
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:57,040
termed archetypal reality, or
that layer, for those who maybe

712
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,600
aren't familiar with archetypes,

713
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,140
Jeffrey Mishlove: I use the term
archetype in sort of two senses

714
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:10,200
here. One is Jung talked about
archetypes as the you know, the

715
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,060
primary themes, the repetitive
themes of human experience that

716
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:19,140
become concretized in forms, old
man, old woman, trickster,

717
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:26,600
jokester. You know those clacks
of shadow, and then so I think

718
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,380
of them as kind of archetypal in
the sense of the primary, the

719
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:36,380
dominant themes of the of the
collective psyche. I see the

720
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,620
second way in which archetypes
is used is in the Platonic

721
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,660
tradition, where Plato talks
about the discovery of a level

722
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:48,940
of reality that lies beyond
time, space altogether. And I

723
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:53,980
experience both. I experience
Plato's sense of archetypes. I

724
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:58,720
experience that reality, but not
in the way that Plato describes

725
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,980
it. Plato thinks of archetypes
as eternal principles within an

726
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,660
eternal being. So they are the
unchanging prototypes that are

727
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,680
used in creation, and they exist
within the mind of an

728
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,360
unchanging, divine, unchanging,
infinite being. That's not how I

729
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,100
experience those archetypes. I
experience them as living

730
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:28,460
entities, but living on a vast
scale of time and space, far

731
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,540
beyond anything that we know
inside time and space. But what

732
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:36,800
is shared is that for something
to manifest inside time and

733
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,180
space, it comes out of the
oneness, through these

734
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,540
fundamental intermediate
structures, which are very

735
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:50,200
profound, super intelligent,
super powerful structures, and

736
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,740
then focusing this energy down
into concretizing it,

737
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,060
concretizing it into eventually
manifesting in space, time,

738
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,820
reality as we know it, when I
experienced the collective

739
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:07,020
psyche and I experienced a lower
level of archetypes in Jung's

740
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:11,760
sense of archetypes, it was
similar to Jung's sense in that

741
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,120
there were these archetypal
themes within humanity, but I

742
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,900
did not experience what Jung
experienced as archetypes. I

743
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,100
didn't have the experience of
wise old man, wise old woman,

744
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,820
things like this. It's not that
I don't think those exist, but

745
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:32,240
what I experienced was humanity
as a single organism, over and

746
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,500
over and over again, as a single
organism, and that there were

747
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:42,640
metameridians within humanity
that wove all of our individual

748
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:49,000
lives into the life of the human
species as a whole. So I learned

749
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,440
that our minds are woven into
the collective mind. There are

750
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,580
aspects. They are seed crystals
within the collective mind. Even

751
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,620
our bodies and the diseases that
we have to manage are all part

752
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,580
of the body of humanity evolving
itself over long periods of

753
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:10,860
time. So it was archetypal in
the sense of trans individual

754
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:16,560
motifs within the human psyche.
But it wasn't the way, quite the

755
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,840
way Jung conceptualized it. So
basically, archetypes in this

756
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:26,480
way, reflect the insight that
there are dominant structures

757
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,340
that are super personal. They go
beyond the functioning of

758
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,580
individual beings, and then in
platonic sense, there are

759
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:43,540
metaphysical archetypes that
basically inform the

760
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,180
manifestation of time and space
itself.

761
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:52,660
Emmy Vadnais: So at the causal
level, you mentioned, this is

762
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,180
where you connect with the
divine intelligence, or what we

763
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,960
perceive as as God. I imagine
those. There may be people

764
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,580
listening, wondering. Did you
discover that there is a God

765
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,440
Jeffrey Mishlove: I generally
tend not to like to use God

766
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,540
language, though I do. The
reason I don't like to use God

767
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,320
language is because, as someone
who knows the history of world

768
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,640
religions pretty well, I also
know all the theologies that

769
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,560
have gone into God language, and
all the cultural limitations

770
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,680
that go into it, and all the
abuse that went into it, and all

771
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,360
the crimes and the horrible
things that have been done in

772
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,040
the name of God. And certainly
I'm not talking about God in

773
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,140
anything like that. And so I
would use the word the divine

774
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,620
instead of God. But that's
really that's just an end run,

775
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,680
because even the concept of the
Divine carries into it certain

776
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:56,320
carry overs from our time space
experience. And so on the one

777
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:01,920
hand, I want to affirm the idea
that there is this profound

778
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,560
generative intelligence
manifesting as time and space.

779
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,860
That time and space is not
something which is independent

780
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,000
of the Divine, but it is, in
classic Hindu thinking, it is

781
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,060
the manifestation of the body of
the Divine. So in that way, I

782
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:27,680
want to affirm a very wide
vision of the Divine of God, but

783
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:32,960
because I've gone so deeply into
the future and so deeply beyond

784
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,720
space and time, so many times,
My understanding or my feeling

785
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:46,000
for this cosmic principle. I
can't fit it inside the

786
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,800
theologies of the religions of
the world. It's just it's much

787
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:56,380
larger than that. And so I So on
the one hand, okay, I can call

788
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:00,280
it God, but then I have to
qualify that it's not this, it's

789
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,880
not that. It's not what you mean
by God here. It's not what you

790
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,960
mean by God there,

791
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,080
Emmy Vadnais: right? Like a lot
of people think of, at least in

792
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:13,740
the mono theistic traditions,
think of it as a individual or a

793
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:18,180
being that we're made in the
form of, right? And that's what

794
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,020
I think people are maybe curious
about, is what you discovered,

795
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:26,660
as far as you know, did you
connect with a being or beings,

796
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,980
or angels or other divine
entities? And if you could share

797
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,740
a little bit about what that
realm was like

798
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,320
Jeffrey Mishlove: in all the
years when I was doing this

799
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:42,160
work, and all the work I did, I
never encountered a being, a

800
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,140
divine being, said, I'm God, you
know, this is what I am. It

801
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:51,940
wasn't like that. It was like I
would go deeper into a level of

802
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,080
consciousness, and I would
experience a communion with this

803
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,500
consciousness. And this
consciousness would teach me. It

804
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,580
knew me, it would teach me and
show me things, and it would

805
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,240
crush me, and then bring me
forward into still deeper

806
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,300
levels. And I would go into
those deeper levels, and I would

807
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:14,880
enter into communion with those
levels and and I internalized

808
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,200
the energy of those levels, and
I was with this consciousness,

809
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,000
but it never crystallized into a
specific form. I always felt its

810
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,960
presence. It guided my sessions.
I could enter into dialog with

811
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,560
it. I could enter into communion
with it. It would, it would

812
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:39,440
dissolve me into itself. But it
never crystallized into a what

813
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,960
you might call a personality of
God, or a person of God, and it

814
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,940
just kept getting larger and
larger, deeper and deeper, more

815
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:54,820
and more vast. And I think that
many of our theologies of God,

816
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:00,340
or thinking about God, is really
based upon what I would call the

817
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:05,700
early encounters with an
infinite intelligence, that that

818
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:10,440
this infinite intelligence is
far larger, far too large to

819
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:15,480
ever be concretized in the
historical lineages that we

820
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,380
recognize in the world
traditions. It's It's infinite

821
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,820
in itself. In fact, when I was
in the deepest level of

822
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:26,120
consciousness that I ever went
into, when I was in the diamond

823
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,140
Luminosity work, and that's the
work that occupied me for the

824
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:34,940
last five years, when I was as
deep into the diamond Luminosity

825
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:40,280
as I had ever entered. And I was
far beyond time, space, reality.

826
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,800
I was dissolved in the luminous,
you might say, the body of the

827
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:50,920
Divine. All of a sudden, my
visual field turned 90 degrees.

828
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,180
A window opened up, and I saw
reality Far, Far in the

829
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:00,780
distance, and I saw a light in
that reality. And. Beam of light

830
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,140
came out of that reality and hit
me, and I was in the diamond

831
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:08,220
Luminosity condition, but this
light was so powerful it

832
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:13,140
shattered my mind. And it took
me minutes to recover from this,

833
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,100
and that's when I began to
realize it's an infinite

834
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:22,280
progression. The Divine is truly
an infinite reality, even using

835
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,900
this powerful method, I would
never get to the end of this

836
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,320
reality. And that's one of the
reasons why I would be much

837
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,460
gentler with myself if I were
doing this again today, because

838
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,820
I discovered see when I began
this work, I thought that the

839
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:41,860
purpose was to reach a state of
consciousness, to reach

840
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:45,820
enlightenment, or to reach
oneness with God, or to dissolve

841
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:51,040
into the primal void. And I had
known oneness with God at many

842
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,160
different levels, and I had
entered into the primal void

843
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,940
several times, and I learned
that there are different depths

844
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:04,140
of the primal void. And so now I
begin to understand that it's

845
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,380
not about getting to some end
state which is going to

846
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,000
magically transform your life.
It's a matter of opening up and

847
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,180
letting the love and
intelligence of the universe or

848
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,380
the divine into you as much as
you can bring it in, as much as

849
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,600
you can hold on to it as much as
you can distill into your the

850
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,880
fabric of your living existence,
your earthly existence. It's not

851
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,800
about getting to some end point.
It's about deepening the ongoing

852
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:39,800
communion that exists between
ourselves inside time and space

853
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,160
and this larger spiritual
reality,

854
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,800
Emmy Vadnais: very beautiful.
Can you share more with us about

855
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,480
the diamond Luminosity?

856
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,220
Jeffrey Mishlove: Light surfaces
many times in our psychedelic

857
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,080
work, I mean, every time you go
through a Death-Rebirth

858
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:00,420
experience, very typically,
people encounter the light, many

859
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,860
forms of light, and I had
encountered this light at many

860
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:09,420
different levels along the
journey. After I'd gone through

861
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,080
ego death, after I'd gone
through the ocean of suffering

862
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,320
work, after I'd gone through
archetypal reality, after I'd

863
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,120
gone into the causal level
reality. About 15 years into my

864
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,580
work. When I had been given so
many spiritual treasures, I felt

865
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:30,140
completely existentially
satisfied. I mean, I just I had

866
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:36,440
been to experience radical
Shunyata, emptiness of self,

867
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:41,980
oneness of all existence. Had
been offered so many treasures,

868
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,260
and then I went through yet
another cycle of death and

869
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:53,320
rebirth, and I accessed a level
of light, a dimension of light

870
01:02:53,620 --> 01:03:00,520
that was so pure and so clear,
it absolutely stunned me, and it

871
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,348
became my sole objective in the
rest of my psychedelic work to

872
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:10,088
return to this reality. Because
once you touch what I'm calling

873
01:03:10,088 --> 01:03:15,728
the diamond Luminosity, once you
touch it, it's a reality which

874
01:03:15,728 --> 01:03:19,688
is so far beyond anything that I
had ever touched in any of my

875
01:03:19,688 --> 01:03:23,120
earlier work that I just lost
interest in archetype of

876
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,960
reality. I lost interest in
causal reality. I wanted to get

877
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,480
back into this level of reality.
It's so pure. It's just

878
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:38,960
breathtakingly magnificently
pure, and the levels of ecstasy

879
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:45,160
associated with it are just
staggering. And in the next five

880
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:50,920
years of work, in 26 sessions,
which is 1/3 of my entire

881
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,360
journey, I only got access to
this level of reality four more,

882
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:01,200
four times. So in between those
four sessions were lots of

883
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,980
purification, more purification
at a very deep level, more

884
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,360
learning, more teaching, but
accessing this reality four

885
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:14,340
times. And I think as I look at
the world's literature, the

886
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:17,940
spiritual literature and
Buddhist literature is probably

887
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:22,100
the tradition that I know the
best. They call this level of

888
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:27,740
reality Dharmakaya, the clear
light of absolute reality. So it

889
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:32,060
is considered, in their
tradition, the the absolute

890
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:38,000
foundational reality of of of
time and space, all time and

891
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,960
space, reality, all the
galaxies, all the big bang

892
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:46,060
emerge out of this crystalline
light, which is a pre Samsara.

893
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:49,900
It's what we would call an extra
samsaric reality. It's outside

894
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:54,100
of the cycle of space and time.
So it's outside of physical

895
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:58,300
reality, and it's also outside
of the Bardos of post mortem

896
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:05,160
existence. It's outside. An
entire system. Once you touch

897
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:10,740
it, you just you're hopelessly
in love with it for the rest of

898
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,760
your life. It just is something
that illumines everything. I

899
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,300
understood what the Buddhists
meant when they said, touch it

900
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:23,240
once, it can undo hundreds of
years of living in the shadows

901
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,900
of karma, because it's such. It
has such a penetrating,

902
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:32,660
transformative effect impact
that just to touch it, it

903
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,020
changes your whole understanding
of existence, in your whole

904
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:38,300
experience of what it means to
be alive.

905
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:43,060
Emmy Vadnais: Is this also what
you refer to in your book as the

906
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,840
beloved?

907
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,700
Jeffrey Mishlove: Well, you
know, everybody has to find a

908
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,780
word to describe this
transcendent reality. You know,

909
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:58,060
we can talk about God, or we can
talk about the divine. Some

910
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:02,580
people call it the absolute
Taoism. Calls it the eternal Dao

911
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:07,440
Jewish mysticism calls it the
Ein Sof, the great nothingness,

912
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:14,640
the great emptiness. I call it
my beloved because when you in a

913
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:19,200
path of temporary immersion, you
move into intimacy with this

914
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,120
reality, and then you come back
out of it, and then you move

915
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,500
into intimacy, and you come back
out of it, and it becomes like a

916
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:31,160
love relationship, but it's a
love relationship which actually

917
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,720
dissolves the bodies of the two
different beings. The Communion

918
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:40,460
that arises is it's a deep and
profound spiritual communion.

919
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,440
And so I just adopted the
vocabulary that felt most

920
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:49,780
natural to me, and I called it
my beloved, the beloved. And so

921
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:53,560
yes, to me, the beloved
manifests itself at all sorts of

922
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,920
different levels. It's it's
manifesting itself at the early

923
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,020
level, early stages, the middle
stages and the advanced stages,

924
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,800
but in the end, you recognize
that you're always in dialog

925
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,000
with this profound creative
intelligence, which,

926
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,020
interestingly enough, feels more
like a she in my experience,

927
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:19,740
than a he. And I associate the
feminine side of God with the

928
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:24,140
act of creation, and what you
might think of as the masculine

929
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:29,720
side of God, as the radically
transcendent aspect of God. The

930
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:34,880
basic idea is that the primal
one divides into two. One stays

931
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,620
outside of space time. The other
manifests space and time, and

932
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:45,220
manifest all life within space
and time. So for me, the beloved

933
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,680
is more the feminine side of the
Divine, the Divine Mother.

934
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:54,460
Emmy Vadnais: Yes, it seems that
light is a theme in your

935
01:07:54,460 --> 01:08:00,720
experiences, and also, how much
of a role did or does love play

936
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,520
in these experiences. For you,

937
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,520
Jeffrey Mishlove: it played,
eventually, a very large role.

938
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:16,200
There were some sessions in
which I encountered or was

939
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,780
blessed with experiences of
cosmic love, I mean, and it's

940
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,960
just, it's love, not like
anything I've ever experienced

941
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,620
before. I mean, it's just
absolutely shatters me and

942
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:33,200
overwhelmed me. I experience
that all of existence was

943
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,940
generated, not out of simply a
sheer power. I mean, can you

944
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,200
think the power of the Big Bang
and everything that emerged from

945
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:46,360
it, not only the intelligence
there, but that love, a

946
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:51,700
profound, cosmic love. Why is it
the very act of creation itself?

947
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:55,780
And that's obviously a kind of
love that's not like anything

948
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:59,320
that we know in human parlance.
It's not anything nearly that

949
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:05,880
small, but it is the it is the
fiber of the Divine, of the

950
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:10,620
Divine itself. And I think it's
you can think of it as love and

951
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:14,340
oneness are kind of two
different sides of the reality,

952
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:21,620
because love, if the world is
truly one, if it's all one, love

953
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:26,240
is the emotion of this oneness.
Love is the fact of oneness

954
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:30,620
asserting itself in a world of
duality. Yeah, love has been

955
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,700
really important, which really
surprised me, because you know

956
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:39,920
of the four yogas in Hinduism,
Yana, the path of the mind,

957
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,280
Raja, of the path of meditation,
Karma Yoga, bhakti yoga, bhakti

958
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:50,440
yoga, the yoga of loving
devotion, is the form of yoga

959
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,200
that I identified with the
least. I've always been more

960
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,520
intellectually oriented,
meditatively oriented, not

961
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,100
bhakti oriented. And yet. Began
to have a series of very

962
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:10,860
profound bhakti experiences that
it's kind of what led me to talk

963
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:15,300
about the beloved in this very
lover kind of context.

964
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:21,380
Emmy Vadnais: How much is love
the fabric of the Divine,

965
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,580
Jeffrey Mishlove: anything I say
at this point. I mean, first of

966
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:31,700
all, please forgive my hubris at
daring to describe the nature of

967
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:35,120
the Divine. I mean, come on, get
real. I mean, this is just like

968
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:40,840
so anything I say is going to be
totally inadequate to the

969
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:46,360
reality itself. So we could
describe the divine nature as

970
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:54,580
infinite knowledge, infinite
power, infinite love. And all of

971
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:57,400
those are equally true. And I'm
sure that there are other

972
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,440
qualities which we want to add
to that. But then let's start

973
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:10,980
with those three. The challenge,
I think, of understanding the

974
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:15,660
love aspect of the Divine is
because life, as we experience

975
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:23,360
it, is an often dirty, nasty,
mean, cruel thing, and so any

976
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,940
suggestion that somehow the
world as we know it, with all of

977
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:33,920
its pain and suffering, is
somehow a manifestation of a

978
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:39,620
supremely loving Consciousness,
it's just it's horrendously

979
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:44,740
difficult to reconcile those and
and I understand that. I mean as

980
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,780
a as a philosopher of religion,
I understand the challenge, and

981
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:53,260
I think the only way of
overcoming that challenge is to

982
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:57,100
really understand the deep
structure, or the deep

983
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,300
intentionality that's
manifesting itself in the

984
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:03,780
creation itself, in the our
evolving universe, in the

985
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:09,120
project of the universe, you
have to radically expand your

986
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,440
time horizon to understand
what's taking place here. You

987
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,460
have to understand that the
human condition, as we currently

988
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:24,440
know it, is just a small.in a
long developmental process that

989
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,880
not only has been going on for
13 point 7 billion years, but

990
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:34,820
will continue to go on for 13.7
plus more years. So that, as Sri

991
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:38,300
Aurobindo said, we are a
transitional species. We are

992
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:42,460
actualizing ourselves within a
long developmental trajectory.

993
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:50,560
And if we think that, Well, God
must not be real, because we

994
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,720
could have written, done a CH,
we could have done a better job

995
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,420
creating universe. If I had
infinite power, I could have

996
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:58,600
certainly created a better
universe in this where children

997
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,520
die and all the terrible things
that happened to us, but that

998
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,780
assumes that we know what the
divine intention is, what the

999
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:12,060
project of existence is. And I
think we are like children and a

1000
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:17,220
playpen. We are just beginning
to get a grip on the enormity of

1001
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:20,540
the project of existence. We're
just beginning, really since

1002
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:24,500
Hubble in modern theories of
cosmology, beginning to

1003
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,920
understand the size and depth
and textures. I think

1004
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,480
psychedelics are kind of like
the Hubble of psychological

1005
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:37,280
insight. They are giving us an
experience of the depth in which

1006
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:42,640
consciousness exists. But that
just gets us, at the beginning

1007
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,980
of beginning, to comprehend,
what is the project? What will

1008
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:54,100
humanity be 5 billion years from
now? What will we be a million

1009
01:13:54,100 --> 01:14:00,240
years from now, or even 100,000
years from now? The Divine seems

1010
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:05,280
to think on on that scale. We
have to radically stretch

1011
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:11,160
ourselves to think on that
scale. So the problem of

1012
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,240
suffering really challenges our
understanding of the role of

1013
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:20,540
love, the principle of love in
the divine nature. But once we

1014
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:25,700
have an experience, an
experiential access to some of

1015
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:32,660
the deeper trajectories of the
Divine intent, then things begin

1016
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:38,840
to make more sense. I think the
Divine is creating a

1017
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:44,260
masterpiece. I mean, I think
refined, elevated, potentiated

1018
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:49,360
human experience is a
masterpiece of creation that

1019
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:54,400
takes 1000s, 1000s, millions of
years, billions of years to to

1020
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,060
orchestrate and to bring
forward, especially since it's

1021
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:02,640
it's not done. We're not we're.
That we intentionally cooperate

1022
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,760
and participate in this creative
process. It's not being done to

1023
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,340
us. It's something we are
carrying forward in the very

1024
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,700
fiber of our being. But we we
really have to kind of grasp the

1025
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:19,800
scale of things to even
understand our present

1026
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,140
circumstances

1027
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,700
Emmy Vadnais: at the same time,
it sounds like you found that

1028
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:30,200
the Atman is Brahman, that you
found that we are part of the

1029
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,140
Divine, and the Divine is part
of us, yeah,

1030
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:38,600
Jeffrey Mishlove: yeah, and that
there's really, there's very

1031
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:43,120
little that's new in any of the
experiences that I lay out, I

1032
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,320
mean the vision of reality, the
cosmology that emerges out of

1033
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:50,380
psychedelic work, is
fundamentally the same as the

1034
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,400
cosmology that emerges out of
deep, mystical, spiritual

1035
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:58,120
traditions in the very highest
and most refined levels of

1036
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,980
spiritual traditions in the
world. It's not that we're

1037
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,040
bringing something new to the
table, maybe a little bit, but

1038
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,040
we're not bringing a whole lot
of new to the table. What we

1039
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:13,080
have is a different protocol, a
different strategy, for

1040
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:17,280
accessing these very deep levels
of reality, which yield deep

1041
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:21,320
insights into the structure of
existence, but you will find the

1042
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:26,480
same fundamental cosmology
emerging out of the great

1043
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,240
spiritual traditions of the
world.

1044
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:33,560
Emmy Vadnais: Since you brought
up the Hubble telescope, and

1045
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:37,700
we've primarily been talking
about what we consider it's just

1046
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:45,160
another word as consciousness.
What did you discover in our

1047
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,640
universe, what we consider, sort
of the physical universe, what

1048
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,740
we consider as space or outer
space? Did you traverse that

1049
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,280
aspect of experience in your
sessions?

1050
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:03,900
Jeffrey Mishlove: I wasn't taken
into the to journeys into our

1051
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:09,780
galaxy or journeys into other
galaxies that just wasn't part

1052
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:15,180
of the work. For me, other
people may have those experience

1053
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:20,720
or says or have had those
experiences. So while I was

1054
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:25,220
given this a particular session
called the cosmic tour. I called

1055
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:29,060
it the cosmic Tour, where I was
taken on this cosmic tour and

1056
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:35,180
shown so many things, much of
which I could not reproduce when

1057
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:39,380
I came back into my time space
consciousness, because my time

1058
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,940
space consciousness just did not
have the vocabulary, the

1059
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:47,440
intellectual tools to articulate
those and that's why I've often

1060
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:52,060
wished that I had a PhD in
physics and astrophysics, that I

1061
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,760
would better be able to
articulate some of the

1062
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:58,540
experiences that I was given.
But I didn't spend a lot of time

1063
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:03,180
traveling within time and space.
It was more a matter of going

1064
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:07,320
underneath time and space and
getting into the underlying deep

1065
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:13,620
structure that that informs time
and space and our experience in

1066
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,940
time and space.

1067
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,620
Emmy Vadnais: I feel like I
recall in your book that you

1068
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,820
were shown that like the
universe. I think you've kind of

1069
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:26,000
already said this, like goes on
and on, essentially. Is that

1070
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,820
right? Do I recall that
correctly? Yeah.

1071
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,160
Jeffrey Mishlove: I mean,
basically it there are two

1072
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,980
different models of the
universe. One is that it'll keep

1073
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:38,660
expanding forever, and the other
is that we reach a point where

1074
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:42,100
there's a maximum expansion,
expansion, and then it begins a

1075
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,640
contraction. So is it a
pulsating universe, expanding

1076
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,700
and contracting and then re
expanding, or is it an

1077
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:54,460
infinitely expanding universe? I
don't really have an answer to

1078
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:57,580
those, to that particular
question, but clearly, the

1079
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:02,940
universe is just it's on tear.
Yeah, it's going on for billions

1080
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:07,620
and billions and billions of
years. Yeah. Now that's a

1081
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:12,000
deflating insight. If you think
that a human being is simply 100

1082
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,840
year old being, if we're simply
100 year old being, then we're

1083
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,900
basically sand on the beach
beside the ocean. We don't

1084
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:23,000
really get to participate in
that deep future. But if

1085
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,600
reincarnation is true, and I
think there's plenty of factual

1086
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,320
evidence that it's true, if
reincarnation is true, and if

1087
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:35,300
it's true, that our essence is
indestructible, and that we take

1088
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:39,320
everything that we've learned
and roll it over into continued

1089
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:44,020
learning over 1000s and 1000s
and millions of years, then we

1090
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:48,520
get to actually participate in
this divine unfolding. It's not

1091
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,720
somebody else's future or some
other future, but it's our

1092
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:58,420
future. We are, you know, we are
co participants, eternal

1093
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:02,820
participants in. This eternal
process

1094
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,960
Emmy Vadnais: in your
experiences, you talked about

1095
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:12,240
the birth of the future human,
yeah. Can you shed a little

1096
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,760
light on what that is about?

1097
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,180
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah, there's
a chapter in the book called The

1098
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:22,280
Birth of the future human, and I
really think this is maybe the

1099
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,640
most important chapter of the
book, and it's also the one that

1100
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:29,180
caught me completely by
surprise. I wasn't expecting

1101
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:34,340
anything like this in my in my
journey. I mean, I thought first

1102
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:37,340
it was a personal journey about
personal healing, personal

1103
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:41,740
awakening. Then when that
expanded, I still thought, Okay,

1104
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:48,100
it's a journey about an
individual being given

1105
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,640
experiences that provide insight
into the deep structure

1106
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,340
underlying our lives. But then
about halfway through my work,

1107
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:03,300
starting in about 1990 and
continuing through 1995 I began

1108
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:07,500
to be given a series of visions
that were internally consistent,

1109
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:11,220
that were dropped into my
sessions talking about

1110
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:16,020
humanity's evolutionary destiny,
where humanity was in its

1111
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:20,040
evolutionary journey, that we
were coming into a turning point

1112
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,960
in history, that we were coming
into a culmination of a

1113
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:27,560
crescendo of the evolutionary
journey that was going to

1114
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:31,400
catalyze a tremendous
transformation inside humanity

1115
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:36,620
that would mark a true before
and after moment in time, that

1116
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:41,680
and that there was A profound
spiritual transformation that

1117
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,580
was coming to a crescendo,
coming to a head, and it this

1118
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:50,380
kept repeating itself in my work
in different ways, but I did not

1119
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:55,420
know how the universe was ever
going to pull this off. I didn't

1120
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,660
understand how it didn't didn't
show me how it was going to

1121
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:03,420
happen. And then about a year
and a half later, when I was in

1122
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,880
the middle of the diamond
Luminosity work. So I was

1123
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:11,160
working at a very deep level. In
one particular day, I

1124
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:15,720
experienced, I was given an
experience taken far into the

1125
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:22,100
future. I had died and dissolved
into the human psyche. So when I

1126
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:26,120
say I was taken into the future,
it's not so much that Chris

1127
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:30,380
Bache was taken into the future.
It's like ask the human family.

1128
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:35,600
I experience the human family in
a trans temporal dimension of

1129
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:41,740
time and in a time expanded
state, and I experience, in an

1130
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:45,940
accelerated way, the death and
rebirth of the entire human

1131
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:51,880
family. I experienced a profound
geopolitical crisis that seemed

1132
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:56,620
to be being seeded by a
cascading series of ecological

1133
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:02,400
crises, but I experienced some
type of fundamental loss of

1134
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:08,580
control, an unraveling of life
at the basic level, a tremendous

1135
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:13,320
global crisis that was so deep
and so profound that no one was

1136
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,440
going to be able to isolate
themselves or protect themselves

1137
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:21,560
from it. It was a crisis so deep
it was going to bring humanity

1138
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:27,080
to our collective knees. But
just when the crisis reached its

1139
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:32,120
peak, I experienced that. We
moved through it, and then there

1140
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,660
was the beginning of a lightning
we made it through this crisis,

1141
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:42,400
and when we began to pick
ourselves up in this post crisis

1142
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:45,880
period of history, we've
discovered that we had been

1143
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:51,100
profoundly changed. Something
happened in this crisis that

1144
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:55,180
opened us up changed us at the
very center of our being, one

1145
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,560
way of talking about is that
there was a birth of oneness.

1146
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:03,540
That oneness instead of being a
private mystical experience of a

1147
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:08,760
very select few, oneness was
born within the human psyche as

1148
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:16,860
a whole. We tapped into certain,
certain depths of our nature

1149
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:24,380
that allowed us to become first
of all, it allowed us become no

1150
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:27,920
longer enemies with all of the
human beings, all the divisions

1151
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,100
of history that have been used
to justify, you know,

1152
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:34,100
differences of race, differences
of class structure, difference

1153
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:37,340
of religion, all those
differences which we think of

1154
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:41,380
and have used to divide history
national identity. All those

1155
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:45,340
were dissolved, all those were
transcended, and we began to

1156
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:49,840
experience a fundamental oneness
at the core of our life and all

1157
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:56,320
life itself. And this led to a
creativity began to reinforce

1158
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,920
itself, and we began to create
new social forms, new.

1159
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,280
Structures. And eventually, over
time, I came to understand that

1160
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:09,480
what this was about was that
there was a pressure building up

1161
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:14,580
within the collective psyche,
and that this pressure was

1162
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:18,000
taking humanity through a
collective Death-Rebirth process

1163
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:23,000
that represented a fundamental,
irreversible shift in the

1164
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,360
collective psyche. I think of it
as the shift in the plate

1165
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:30,980
tectonics of the collective
psyche, so that any child born

1166
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:35,300
after we make this transition
will be operating within a

1167
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:39,140
psychic field which is
fundamentally different, more

1168
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:44,020
elevated, more spiritually
informed then we are operating

1169
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:47,800
out of now, or we've been
operating out of the past. Well,

1170
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:52,660
that this isn't simply a crisis
with economic ramifications or

1171
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:55,300
industrial ramifications or
political or civic

1172
01:25:55,300 --> 01:26:00,960
ramifications. It's a revolution
in the fundamental structure of

1173
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,560
the human psyche. It's a it's a
revolution in our human nature.

1174
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:09,540
Now I think that we have entered
this, this period, this process.

1175
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,480
I think we're in the very early
stages of it. We're just getting

1176
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:18,060
started on it. I think the 21st
Century will be pivotal in going

1177
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:22,100
through this transformative
crisis. I wasn't given a lot of

1178
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:26,240
details on names, dates and
places and stuff like that, what

1179
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,960
I was given was this core
experience of what it's going to

1180
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:33,560
feel like for the human family
when they go through a

1181
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,220
collective dark night of the
soul, go through a collective

1182
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:42,700
ordeal that eventually will
awaken an underlying revolution

1183
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:48,280
in the human psyche, a spiritual
opening of the human psyche. Now

1184
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:51,400
I'm not alone. This is nothing
you know unique to me. I mean,

1185
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,760
this is an insight that many
spiritual teachers have had,

1186
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:59,560
many indigenous people have had,
many psychedelicists have tapped

1187
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:02,340
into this understanding. And I
think this is the flow of

1188
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:07,080
history underneath us that we
can tap into in different ways.

1189
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,920
I think many of the spiritual
mystical traditions have tapped

1190
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:15,240
into and begin to understand
some of this dynamic. But I

1191
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,940
think we're coming into a
century where we are at a

1192
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:23,180
critical turning point. I really
believe that the 21st Century is

1193
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:27,200
pivotal here, because if we just
look at the scientist scientific

1194
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:32,360
data of on the ecological
crisis, if we look at what is

1195
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:40,360
now an increasingly shared
understanding of the depth of

1196
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:44,260
ecological disruption that we're
going into and the change of

1197
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:48,700
interrupting, well, I won't go
into the scientific material,

1198
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:54,400
but clearly, we cannot continue
on Earth operating the way that

1199
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,220
we have been operating in the
past. We don't have enough

1200
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:03,060
resources. Inequality is just
too extreme. I don't think we

1201
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:09,000
can continue to govern the earth
or out of the psychological

1202
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,160
structure of the ego. The ego is
fundamentally a divided psychic

1203
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:17,760
structure. And I think the ego
is a beautiful thing. It's a

1204
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,500
magnificent thing, but it
fundamentally is cut off from

1205
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,860
the core of existence, the
foundation of existence and each

1206
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:29,540
other, we need to evolve into a
higher level of consciousness,

1207
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:35,660
which is post egoic, in order to
have the wisdom to rise to the

1208
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:41,200
challenges that the ego has
created for humanity over its

1209
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:45,640
last 1000, multi 1000 year
history. And I think we will, I

1210
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,280
think we will come through this
crisis. I think we're going to

1211
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:52,300
go through unbelievable
suffering in the centuries

1212
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,660
ahead, but I do believe that we
come through it, because that's

1213
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:59,200
at least, that's been the nature
of my experience. We do come

1214
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,340
through this, and humanity does
make this evolutionary

1215
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,580
Emmy Vadnais: pivot? Well, I
know there's more you can share

1216
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:08,820
about this topic, and I think
we'll do a whole other

1217
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:13,740
conversation about the birth of
a future human. And also we want

1218
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:17,400
to talk more about
reincarnation, yeah, can you

1219
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:22,100
share why you stopped these LSD
sessions in 1999

1220
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,000
Jeffrey Mishlove: Well, I talk
about this in the book, in the

1221
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,440
last chapter, coming off the
mountain, and I basically boil

1222
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:36,140
it down to two reasons, pain and
heartache. My subtle energy

1223
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:40,720
system. Psychedelic states open
you up to huge flows of energy.

1224
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:43,840
You're taking an enormous flows
of energy. It takes years and

1225
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,980
years to manage the flows of
energy. And I basically realized

1226
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:53,260
that I was running so hot that
even months after my session was

1227
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:58,120
over, I was still running. I was
permanently uncomfortable in my

1228
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:01,920
body because the quantum. Day of
energy that was running in my

1229
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,660
subtle energy system, my Qi
system, or my Prana. So that was

1230
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:11,160
telling me that it was time to
let my body calm down and let

1231
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:16,260
that subtle energy system find a
new equilibrium point. But the

1232
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:21,140
main reason I stopped was
because of heartache, because

1233
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:27,020
once you dissolve into the
Divine Light, once you dissolve

1234
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:30,680
into diamond Luminosity and
dissolve into the crystalline

1235
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:35,540
nature of consciousness at this
very, very deep level, coming

1236
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:41,800
back into time and space is just
difficult. It's very hard. It

1237
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:46,540
you know you lose your your zest
for living inside time and

1238
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:50,560
space, when you know how much
more is available to you outside

1239
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:55,000
of time and space, and going
into and coming out of, and

1240
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,260
going into and coming out of
this was it just was, became too

1241
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:04,560
painful. And so eventually, my
beloved and I came to an

1242
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:09,180
agreement that I would not
return to these states of

1243
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:14,640
consciousness until I could stay
with her forever. And that's

1244
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,700
really when, that's really what
lies behind my stopping. I just

1245
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:24,200
had to stop and for the rest of
my life, focus on internalizing

1246
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,280
the gifts that I had already
been given, rather than trying

1247
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,920
to acquire or be given more
gifts.

1248
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,360
Emmy Vadnais: You've been in
communication with Stanislav

1249
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:39,860
Grof and Ralph Metzner, who are
pioneers in this area of

1250
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:44,080
psychedelics and psychological
consciousness, cosmic

1251
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:49,300
exploration. Have you shared
your experiences with them, and

1252
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,820
what have they shared with you
about that

1253
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:56,860
Jeffrey Mishlove: I've been in
dialog with both of them, and I

1254
01:31:56,860 --> 01:32:01,560
have shared my sessions with
Stan, and he quotes from some of

1255
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,940
my sessions scattered throughout
his books, some of them are

1256
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:09,660
anonymous, and in some of the
later works, they're they're

1257
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:18,120
identified as mine. And Stan,
very graciously wrote a

1258
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,500
beautiful forward to my book,
Dark, night, early dawn, which

1259
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:26,600
was my first major book on
psychedelic work, psychedelic

1260
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:33,200
theory. I think that there's a
fundamental I mean, we have

1261
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:36,260
different projects, different
agendas. I mean, Stan is a

1262
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:40,720
therapist. He's a world healer.
He's he has worked with 1000s of

1263
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:45,820
individuals and collected 1000s
and 1000s of session experiences

1264
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,840
and organized them into an
understanding of the vast scope

1265
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:56,380
of the landscape that one
experiences in these states. My

1266
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:59,740
work has been different. I'm
really been doing an individual

1267
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:02,640
journey penetrating deeper and
deeper and deeper into the

1268
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:07,260
universe. So I see our work as
complementary in that way. But

1269
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:13,260
yeah, I've been in dialog with
both of them. Yeah, I love them

1270
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:18,240
both very dearly. Ralph has now
transitioned on, I love them

1271
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,940
dearly. We've been in dialog.
Ralph gave me feedback on LSD in

1272
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:27,740
the mind of the universe before
I published it. So yeah, I

1273
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:30,140
consider them close colleagues
and good

1274
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:33,920
Emmy Vadnais: friends, so they
were supportive of your process.

1275
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:39,140
Yes, yeah, that's wonderful. The
last area I want to touch on

1276
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:43,360
with you is that, of course,
people listening, some may

1277
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,540
think, Well, how much can we
trust these experiences? And I

1278
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:51,040
know that you had a conversation
or an interaction with Kenneth

1279
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,480
ring, who is the co founder of
the International Association

1280
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,140
for near death studies, I was
wondering if you could share a

1281
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:02,460
little bit about your
correspondence with him, or what

1282
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:06,180
you have to say or say about the
how much we can trust your

1283
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,200
experiences?

1284
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,800
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah, that's a
really important question. I

1285
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,400
mean, how? How do we know that
we aren't simply exploring some

1286
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:18,060
hidden corner of my personal
unconscious or even some hidden

1287
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:23,720
corner of the collective psyche?
I mean, I know I understand how

1288
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:27,200
radical the assertions are that
I'm making, making them sound

1289
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:30,440
almost Cavalier. How do we know
that we can trust these

1290
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:35,360
experiences to be what I'm
suggesting that they are? And

1291
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,480
Ken ring and I had a dialog
about this. Ken is a wonderful

1292
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:44,200
scholar, and his good friend,
and so after he had read LSD in

1293
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:48,340
the mind of the universe, he
wrote me, and we went back and

1294
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:53,560
forth around precisely this
issue. How trustable are these

1295
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:56,980
deep psychedelic experiences?
How do we know that they're not

1296
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:01,200
better understood as a man?
Manifestation of something

1297
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:04,380
coming out of the personal
psyche or the collective psyche

1298
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:08,400
that they really are have these
metaphysical, ontological

1299
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,820
ramifications that I've been
interpreting them to have. And

1300
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:15,120
so he and I went back and forth
in an exchange of letters about

1301
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:18,120
this, and Ken worked me over
pretty hard. I mean, he was

1302
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:22,520
asking hard questions, and I
loved it. And eventually we

1303
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:26,720
decided that this was a dialog
that was worth sharing. So we

1304
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,500
wrote it up in an essay called
our deep psychedelic

1305
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:35,540
experiences, trustable, and we
published it online, and it's

1306
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:40,180
available. If you just Google
that title, you'll find it, and

1307
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:44,620
I in it, I try to address that
specific issue, and I also bring

1308
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:50,140
in other people's experiences,
which provide levels of

1309
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:54,580
objective verification, because
many psychedelic experiences

1310
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:59,440
lead us to have experiences that
can be verified because they

1311
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:03,660
relate to something inside time
and space, the deeper

1312
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:08,820
cosmological experiences cannot
be verified in that way, but the

1313
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:12,480
existence of verifiable
experiences when they refer to

1314
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:17,040
time space reality certainly
lends points to the credibility

1315
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:23,420
of the deeper cosmological
experiences. So I bring in a lot

1316
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:27,800
of evidence in the footnotes and
in the literature that speak to

1317
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:33,260
the issue of the trustability of
these experiences. I think most

1318
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:37,880
of our doubt about their
trustability is completely

1319
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:43,060
understandable, but I think it
comes from first not having

1320
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:47,140
personal experience of these
states and trying to understand

1321
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:51,400
them within a metaphysical
framework that's based upon time

1322
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:55,420
of physical sensation,
experience, mental experience,

1323
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:59,200
sensate experience. We're trying
to understand these things

1324
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:04,560
within a framework which is
smaller than we want they need

1325
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,420
to be. It's just like, you know,
we had to have 10s of 1000s of

1326
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:13,560
near death episodes in print and
published before the medical

1327
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,740
community began to take them
seriously, because they didn't

1328
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:20,480
want to interpret these as an
indication of the existence of

1329
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,140
spiritual reality. They wanted
to interpret it as something

1330
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:27,740
going on inside the physical
process. And I think that's true

1331
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:32,360
for psychedelic experiences too.
We need to, we need to develop a

1332
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:37,520
more sophisticated ontology,
metaphysical understanding, even

1333
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,600
to have a framework for
understanding some of these

1334
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:46,060
experiences, and this is why I
didn't rush into print on any of

1335
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:50,740
these experiences. I mean, after
I stopped my work in 99 I really

1336
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:55,060
spent 20 years digesting them,
analyzing, looking at other

1337
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:58,780
people's experiences, looking at
the other metaphysical systems,

1338
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:03,360
and trying to put all the pieces
of the jigsaw puzzle together

1339
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,380
before I published LSD in the
mind of the universe. So a lot

1340
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,280
of thought, it's not simply, you
know, here's my experience. You

1341
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:15,180
can trust it because I had it.
It's not that at all. It's

1342
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:18,660
really, what we really want is
not just one person's

1343
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:22,880
experiences, but we want to have
a critical protocol with which

1344
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,600
involves many people's
experiences, putting all of our

1345
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:29,900
experiences on the table and
finding out which one of the

1346
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:33,440
which of these experiences are
idiosyncratic and which one of

1347
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,980
them are common ground. We
haven't really begun that work

1348
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:40,720
yet. We're in the early stages
of doing that. But this is

1349
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:44,080
psychedelics are not going to go
away. We're going to be using

1350
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:48,700
them for decades and hundreds of
years to come. And this

1351
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,800
challenge of collective
verification of the visions that

1352
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,940
emerge in these states is just
getting started, is just moving

1353
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:58,480
forward.

1354
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,380
Emmy Vadnais: It sounds like
you're suggesting that we need

1355
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:05,340
more research in this area,
which can be tricky because of

1356
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:08,760
the taboo and the legalities
around it, although it seems

1357
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:13,620
that with other studies on
Psilocybin and other

1358
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:17,280
psychedelics, that maybe that's
beginning to shift.

1359
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,800
Jeffrey Mishlove: I think it is
beginning to shift. I think

1360
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:25,220
what's happening is
psychedelics. The psychedelic

1361
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:30,440
community is demonstrating, with
increasing convincing research,

1362
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:35,420
that these substances have a
tremendous power to heal, and

1363
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:39,800
that's what's bringing them back
into public discussion. We're

1364
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,080
going to find, over time, that
the same amplifying qualities

1365
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:48,940
which allow them to have a
therapeutic impact continued, if

1366
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:53,200
we continue to apply these
methodologies, they continue to

1367
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:56,920
open up deeper and deeper levels
of consciousness, and when we

1368
01:39:56,980 --> 01:40:00,900
get deep enough, eventually we
begin to hard. Harvest the

1369
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:06,360
philosophical and cosmological
significance of these

1370
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:10,620
substances. I gave a talk at the
Herodotus conference at Oxford

1371
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:14,940
last fall, and I called it
seizing the philosophical and

1372
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:19,320
cosmological significance of
psychedelics. We're not there

1373
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:24,260
yet, but I think we're going
there. We will get there to move

1374
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:25,280
in this direction.

1375
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:28,700
Emmy Vadnais: Well, Chris, I
know this is a very large topic,

1376
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:32,900
and I just want to ask this last
question, and I'm excited we're

1377
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:35,060
going to have another
conversation. Is there anything

1378
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:38,420
you want to share more today
about psychedelics and the

1379
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:39,500
cosmic mind?

1380
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:44,980
Jeffrey Mishlove: I want to
return again to the cautionary

1381
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:50,980
words that we shared in the very
beginning. This is, this is

1382
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:54,640
deep, challenging, demanding
work. You do not try to climb

1383
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:57,700
Mount Everest unless you have
all the best equipment and all

1384
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,500
the best guys going with you.
You do not want to go deep into

1385
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:05,700
the psyche unless you have all
the best equipment and the best

1386
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:10,020
context for doing this type of
work. So I want to affirm that.

1387
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:15,240
I want to affirm the importance
of a rigorous protocol. If you

1388
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:19,200
want to go deep, you have to
have a particularly rigorous

1389
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:24,140
protocol, protocol first just to
survive the encounter, but also

1390
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:29,420
to take experiences and distill
them into increasingly clear,

1391
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:36,320
clear, articulate experiences
that are not lost into you know

1392
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:40,100
that your mind just doesn't
swallow them up, you can really

1393
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:43,060
bring back the core of the
experience. Once you do that,

1394
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:45,820
once you've taken all the
cautions, all the precautions,

1395
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:50,800
and once you have spent time
doing your due diligence in

1396
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:58,540
this, then I think we are at the
cusp of a completely new chapter

1397
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,580
in philosophy of consciousness,
a new chapter in our

1398
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:07,080
understanding what is happening
in existence. Why is human

1399
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,920
existence the way it is? Why is
existence the way it is? What's

1400
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:15,420
going on underneath the surface?
What is the nature of the the

1401
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:19,920
intelligence that's manifesting
the body of the universe? What

1402
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,580
is the nature of the
intelligence that's manifesting

1403
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:27,260
inside our own hearts and mind
over time. This, I think, is the

1404
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:32,360
beginning of a whole new chapter
of philosophical and spiritual

1405
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:36,920
reflection. In conclusion, I
just wouldn't want to leave with

1406
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:43,420
your viewers a sense of
excitement or this tremendous

1407
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:47,020
turning point that we are at
this pivot point of this

1408
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:51,040
profound deepening of our
understanding, of our

1409
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:55,960
experience, of these deep
structures of reality, and a

1410
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:00,960
deepening of our understanding
of what's taking place behind

1411
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,500
the scenes and the opportunity
to enter into conscious

1412
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:09,600
communion with the source of our
existence, which was previously

1413
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:14,640
maybe just the privileged domain
of very, very advanced

1414
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,360
meditative and contemplative
mystics. But now we have a new

1415
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:23,180
modality that allows even
ordinary human beings to have

1416
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:27,920
just a touch taste of these
experiences, which can be life

1417
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,520
changing,

1418
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:31,280
Emmy Vadnais: and for people to
know the risks and the benefits

1419
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:34,160
right. Because, you know, each
person might have a different

1420
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:38,000
reaction, a response to these
kinds of substances.

1421
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:41,740
Jeffrey Mishlove: Yeah, there
are screening criteria, and more

1422
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:46,420
important, more criteria that
will be weird, which are used in

1423
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:52,480
order to make sure people who do
this work are safe and only

1424
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:55,420
people who should do this work

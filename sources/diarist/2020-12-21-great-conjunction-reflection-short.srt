1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,040
Stephen Gray: So going to call
on our friend and colleague

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,460
Chris Bache to share some words
with us, I want to thank you

3
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,520
very much for taking the time to
do this, Chris. And I know it's

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,260
getting later in the evening for
you, excuse me, and I imagine a

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,580
lot of you, the rest of us know
Chris by now, to some degree,

6
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,520
through his work. But if you
don't, I just want to suggest

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,300
that if you have any interested
in the fate, any interest at

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,560
all, in the fate of humanity,
you get yourself a copy of LSD

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,660
in the mind of the universe, his
most recent book, and it's a

10
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,800
stunner. It really is in a
beautiful and positive way. So

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,620
thank you for joining us. Chris,
over to you. Thank you, Steven.

12
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,620
Am I coming through? Okay? Mark,
Sound okay, good, yeah. It's a

13
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,700
pleasure and an honor to be with
the community again. It's truly

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,440
especially on this winter
solstice, and especially on this

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,480
winter solstice,

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,120
Chris Bache: Saturn conjunct,
Jupiter entering into Aquarius.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,240
Good sign, good time, hopefully,
a marker of changes that are

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,520
coming. It's been a hard year.
The pandemic has touched us all

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,200
in one way or another, and many
of us are looking forward to

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,620
220, 2021, that's a time of a
shift, a time of change, and I'm

21
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:55,540
sure it will be, I hope it will
be so a few words spoken softly

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,780
in the mode, in the manner of
our special ceremony tonight,

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:09,480
about our collective
transformation. I've picked this

24
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,800
picture of the earth to start
with, because the earth is going

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,120
into convulsions. It seems like
there's no way to stop it. Now

26
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,040
we can ameliorate it, but we're
going into the dark night of our

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,160
collective soul. We have set in
motion a sequence of events

28
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,900
that's taking us into a very,
very turbulent, convulsive

29
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,840
period of history. That's what
my reading of the ecological

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,180
sources tell me. It's also what
my visionary experiences tell me

31
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,240
in psychedelic work, we are
going into a time of ascending

32
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,540
energy, a time in which nature
is reaching down and bringing up

33
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,160
energy underneath our feet,
taking us, taking humanity into

34
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,180
an extraordinary new phase of
its evolutionary journey, a time

35
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,820
of great awakening, a time of
great spiritual fruition, a time

36
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,680
of a change in the fundamental
archetypal architecture of the

37
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,320
collective psyche that informs
all of our individual psyches as

38
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,660
we work together. But when this
happens, when nature turns up

39
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,580
the heat underneath us, it
triggers profound purification

40
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,080
processes. It triggers a process
in which we have no choice but

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,540
to confront our shadows, both
our individual shadow and our

42
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,200
collective shadow, because our
shadow is rising, and it's a

43
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,940
time in history when our shadow
is rising, and clearly the

44
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,780
ecological consequences that we
are inheriting in this century

45
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,020
are aspects of this large
collective shadow and the ego,

46
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,280
and a civilization of ego that
has made the decisions that

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,880
they've made with respect to the
Earth, and made the decisions

48
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,560
they've made with respect to
each other, those are all coming

49
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:19,380
out on us really hard now it's
all coming forward. So I want to

50
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,880
change perspective a little bit
and take us because if we really

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,360
want to go deep into this
collective transformation, if we

52
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,740
want to engage it fully, it's a
good time to step back. It's a

53
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,180
good night to step back into a
larger context. But I'm going to

54
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,540
encourage us to step even
farther back, to place ourselves

55
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,960
in the context and in the
presence of the creative

56
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,800
intelligence of the universe, of
the divine intelligence, or the

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,760
creative intelligence, the great
power. These star lights behind

58
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,720
me are not just stars. Some are
stars, but many are galaxies

59
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,780
with billions. And billions of
stars, an unimaginable

60
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:10,320
outpouring of power and genius,
just incredible genius

61
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,460
unfolding. And it's the same
genius which birthed this

62
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,940
universe, which is birthing his
time in history, and it's the

63
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:25,040
same genius which has placed us
here to participate consciously

64
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,080
in this milestone period, this
milestone century that we have

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,640
coming into we will come out of
this century profoundly

66
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,560
different than we came into it.
And so I'd like to encourage you

67
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,780
to think about, who is it that's
undergoing this transformation?

68
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,820
Who is it that's engaging these
powerful forces carrying us

69
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,440
forward? And it's not who we
think we are. We are not who we

70
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,180
think we are. We have, by habit,
a custom of thinking of

71
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,680
ourselves as basically 100 year
old beings, but the science of

72
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,000
consciousness tells us today
clearly we are not 100 year old

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,760
beings. Reincarnation is a
simple fact of life, and knowing

74
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,380
this, when we look at ourselves,
we see that we are 100,000 year

75
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,220
old beings. We have enormous
quantities of time folded into

76
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,400
the person that we now are,
every talent that we have, every

77
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,140
piece of genius that we have,
every habit that we have, even

78
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,120
our bad habits that we have,
they come from somewhere. They

79
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,280
come from a deeper history. And
one way to imagine a human being

80
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,560
as a reincarnated being is the
samurai sword, which is made

81
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,180
from folding level upon level
upon level of metal folded and

82
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,220
hammered over each other up to
10,000 layers of metal subjected

83
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,940
to fierce heat and fuse together
to create a blade of incredible

84
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,740
lightness and strength and
agility. And I think a soul is

85
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,140
that too we are the result. This
generation is the result of

86
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,320
hundreds and 1000s of lifetimes
of precious human experience of

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,760
precious learning, folded in
upon one another, folded upon

88
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,760
one another, and are being
fused. And just as the planet is

89
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:38,900
facing a huge crisis to become
one planet, one ecosystem, one

90
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,760
system that lives in a healthy
manner, with each other, with

91
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,900
the planet itself. If that's
taking place in the outer social

92
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,260
world, there is a similar
process taking place in our

93
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,220
inner world. I think it's a time
when all of our former lives are

94
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,540
coming into us really hard. We
were born with many of our

95
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,400
farmer lives active in our
psyches much more than in

96
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,040
previous generations, and as we
engage our shadows, as we engage

97
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,540
our individual and collective
shadows, and submit ourselves to

98
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:18,060
the transforming fire of deep
awareness and let the divine

99
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,920
awareness that we all are focus
on our past and purify our past

100
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,880
of all of those things which
hold us back and constrict us.

101
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,800
We then become initiated into
deeper and deeper levels of

102
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,960
intimacy with the universe, with
each other. This geniuses behind

103
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,160
all these stars and galaxies
behind me. This is our nature.

104
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,960
We open ourselves as we purify
ourselves, we open ourselves

105
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,820
into the cosmic arms, into the
embrace of our own history, into

106
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,260
the sacred communion, which is
taking us forward out of this

107
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,060
century, I think, is coming a
new humanity, the future human.

108
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,540
You know, I call it the birth of
the diamond soul, which is

109
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,980
simply all of our former lives
coming together and fusing into

110
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,320
a single intelligence, a single
consciousness, an individual

111
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,660
awareness, which is individual,
and yet a deeper form of

112
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,120
individuality than we've ever
seen on Earth before, not just a

113
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,320
few of us, all of us, the entire
human species coming forward in

114
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,740
this crescendo of power,
purification, destabilization,

115
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:48,100
reaching out, reaching out, and
achieving something that has

116
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,560
never been achieved in history
before. This is something I

117
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,620
share with you, which comes from
my own psychedelic work, but I

118
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,920
don't think it's not it has
anything to do with me prior.

119
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,500
Privately I talk with people, I
think many of us are seeing this

120
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,520
basic same truth in our own
psychedelic sessions. The

121
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,780
indigenous people have been
seeing it for generations in

122
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,560
their work. Some of the great
saints and mystics who never

123
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,100
touch psychedelics have seen
these things coming forward.

124
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,040
This is the time of the great
unraveling. The pandemic

125
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
unraveled us faster than we ever
thought possible. But it's just

126
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,400
the overture. There are harder
times coming if we embrace those

127
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,980
hard times with foreknowledge,
with absolute dedication, not

128
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,480
turning away from any of the
hardship that's coming, but

129
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,940
engage it fully, asking
ourselves the question, what is

130
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,920
the highest good that I can
bring to the challenges that I'm

131
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,620
facing? What can I give that's
being asked to be given now I

132
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,040
think we accelerate our own
individual evolution, and in

133
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,580
accelerating our individual
evolution, we accelerate

134
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,080
humanity's collective evolution.
I think we're all in this for

135
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,680
the collective right now, the
time of the individual saints

136
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,100
and saviors is gone. It's over.
They've done their job. They've

137
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,020
done their work.

138
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,600
The hour now is for the children
and the grandchildren and our

139
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,820
great grandchildren, the only,
the only calling that's worthy

140
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,620
of ourselves is our collective
salvation, our collective

141
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,800
transformation, our collective
good to bring us back in

142
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,420
alignment with the deep truths,
with our deep soul, with our

143
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:52,060
deep heart. As the future human
emerges in history, I anticipate

144
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,000
a tremendous opening of our
heart to each other as we open

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,160
our heart to the Divine heart,
which holds all of existence,

146
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,440
not just humans, but all beings,
all of existence. And as our

147
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,800
minds open up into the deep
communion, it opens us up into

148
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,620
the cosmic communion that opens
us into the in taking of

149
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,220
awareness and insights, truly
scientific insights that can

150
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,700
come pouring into us when we're
open and clean and clear.

151
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,160
We've passed the longest night
of the year. We're coming into

152
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:43,076
the beginning of the rising
daylight in our lives, just a

153
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:47,036
short cycle, just a six month
cycle, and then the cycle of

154
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:51,116
darkness will begin again, this
challenge that humanity is

155
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:56,276
facing, it's a huge challenge.
We'll make it but that itself is

156
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:02,160
not the end. It's just a phase.
It's just a phase. We've been

157
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,400
here for billions of years.
We're going to be here for

158
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,820
billions of years more, taking
us deeper, farther, unimaginable

159
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,640
ways. My last thought I share
with you tonight is this, this

160
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,100
journey is so long we're not
going to accomplish it in this

161
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,820
lifetime. It's going to take
more than one lifetime, many

162
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,780
lifetimes, to stay on this
journey. And therefore, as we

163
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,460
open deeply to the cosmic
communion, one thing that should

164
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:41,140
fall away quickly is our fear of
death. Absolutely nothing to

165
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,900
fear in death, because death is
in no way an ending. It's simply

166
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,820
a punctuation in the cycle. And
the same beautiful universe that

167
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,320
we open up in sacred medicine
space is the same universe we

168
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:02,340
open up to when we fall when our
bodies fall away, the journey

169
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:09,120
continues in the cascading
ecologies of light. Thank you

170
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,160
for letting me share these
thoughts with you on this

171
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,940
special night.

172
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,900
Stephen Gray: Thank you so much.
Chris.

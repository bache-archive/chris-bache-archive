1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,280
Unknown: There is a door in your
head that no one told you about.

2
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,659
It is the door through which we
enter into life and pass out of

3
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:21,439
life again.

4
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:34,639
It is the door which separates
ordinary consciousness from

5
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:43,119
genius. It is the door that
separates time bound mind from

6
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:50,259
timeless mind, the door that
leads from Personal

7
00:00:50,259 --> 00:01:01,979
consciousness to cosmic
consciousness, the mysterious

8
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,039
cultures that existed at the
very beginning of recorded

9
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:08,939
history, whose cultural and
technical accomplishments

10
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,819
demonstrate an almost
unfathomable genius took special

11
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,899
care to immortalize the
instructions that enable each

12
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,099
individual to access their own
hidden door. Ch,

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,020
you. Thank you so much, Chris
for being with us today. I

14
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,080
really appreciate you taking the
time to share this amazing

15
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,280
information with people. I want
to say that your book has been

16
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,200
one of the most revelatory that
I've read ever and the

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,500
information contained within it.
Sorry, darling.

18
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm touched.

19
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,700
I'm touched honestly. I mean, I
think it is so interesting and

20
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,020
also so helpful to us at this
particular time. There's so much

21
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,540
in there that will help us guide
our way into the future. So I

22
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,720
really appreciate that the book
is a very interesting read in

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,640
that it is filled with a lot of
pain and a lot of suffering and

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,880
ecstasies beyond ecstasies, and
what I would like to do today,

25
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,280
because there are, for other
people's edification, several

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,640
interviews with you out there
where you go into the protocols

27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,780
and the process. So if people
are interested in understanding

28
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,060
exactly how you obtain this
information, they can a buy this

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,140
amazing book and also view those
other interviews. So today, what

30
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,460
I'd like to do is focus on the
content of the journeys and the

31
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,180
teachings that you came to came
to you. Now, I think we'll start

32
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,680
with the worst of it, which you
have called the ocean of

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,240
suffering, and you have sessions
in well, let's step back for a

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,220
second. You undertook 73 LSD
sessions to obtain this

35
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,380
information. And the book

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,020
Chris Bache: goes 79 and 1999
over 20 year period, I did 73

37
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,480
high dose sessions. Actually it
was three medium dose sessions

38
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,200
and 70 high dose but for
convenience, 73 high dose

39
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,220
Unknown: sessions, that is an
undertaking following the

40
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,860
Chris Bache: protocols
established by Stan Grof. So

41
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,400
these were internalized
sessions, so on, so forth,

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,140
eyeshades, headphones, sitter,
you know, the whole nine yards.

43
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,520
Unknown: Would you consider that
a clinical setting per se, or a

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,180
shamanistic setting, or just
following the protocols that

45
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,580
Stan the Grof actually
developed. Well,

46
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,580
Chris Bache: they were, they
merged in a clinical setting.

47
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,760
But whether you call it clinical
or shamanistic, sort of depends

48
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,520
partly on your cultural
perspective, on your cultural

49
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,040
context. There were clinical in
the sense of they originated in

50
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,740
that therapeutic context, but
they went far beyond therapeutic

51
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,400
applications or therapeutic
impact, and in that sense, it's

52
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,980
not clinical per se, absolutely.

53
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,280
Unknown: That makes sense. All
right, ocean of suffering

54
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,780
sessions 11 through 17,

55
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,920
Chris Bache: yeah, but what had
happened was, in the first two

56
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,340
and a half years, I went through
kind of classic perinatal

57
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,080
symptomology, perinatal that
Stan de Grof Grof describes in

58
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,080
many of his books, and I went
through at the end of the kind

59
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,380
of a shattering ego death
experience. It just kind of blew

60
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,640
me apart. Turned me inside out.
And then after that, a whole new

61
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,220
cycle began, a cycle that lasted
two years of 14 sessions, where

62
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,640
in the purifying phase of the
session, which usually for me,

63
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,240
means the first half of the
session, during the purifying

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,840
phase of the session, I went
into vast landscapes, panoramas

65
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,320
of human suffering that went
progressively deeper and deeper

66
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,000
session by session. And at first
I thought this was a deepening

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,620
of ego death. But over time, I
became convinced that this was

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,900
more than that. It had to be
more than that, because it

69
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,340
involved subjectively, so many
1000s of people and so many

70
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,960
1000s of years, eventually, I
came to the conclusion that

71
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,520
something had shifted inside my
sessions, and the consciousness

72
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,180
that was directing my sessions
was using my sessions to heal

73
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,080
not my personal psyche, but some
aspect of the collective

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,680
unconscious of humanity. And so
what happened was I did this

75
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,940
work for a year, I stopped my
work for six years, and then I

76
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,800
began it again after six years,
for another year, the ocean of

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,300
suffering, when I resumed after
six years, began exactly where I

78
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,280
had stopped, I think is an
indication of the extra ordinary

79
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,220
intelligence and the precision
of that intelligence that's

80
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,640
directing these arts in our you
know, in our session work.

81
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,880
Unknown: Well, that brings up a
point that I do want to address

82
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:38,900
with you, and that is the fact
that these sessions seem very

83
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,100
well planned, very well thought
out. They're not haphazard

84
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:53,920
trips, as people can experience
when doing hallucinogens. And so

85
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,440
tell me a little bit about who
was doing the planning and who

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,300
was doing the organizing of
these 73 sessions that took you

87
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,100
on this extra ordinary journey.

88
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,060
Chris Bache: It certainly wasn't
me. I was never in control of

89
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,880
what happened in my sessions.
You can set when you're working.

90
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,380
I worked at 500 to 600
micrograms per sessions of very

91
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,460
high doses of LSD. I don't
recommend this protocol. I

92
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,380
honestly don't knowing what I
know now, but when you do this

93
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,200
work, you can set all the
intentions you want. You can't

94
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,440
direct what's happening in your
sessions. So I think of it as a

95
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,060
collaboration, a cooperation. My
responsibility was to create as

96
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,100
clean a field as possible to
allow clear contact, so totally

97
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,420
isolated from the world, totally
internally focused, and at the

98
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,320
end of every session, writing a
detailed transcript of what

99
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,560
happened during the sessions. I
think that's important, because

100
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,980
it really helps us learn and
hold on to what happened, and

101
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,400
then it provides a clearer
foundation when we return to the

102
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,740
psychedelic state in the next
session. So after I'd done that,

103
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,540
after I clear the set, I focused
myself, did everything I could

104
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,500
to establish a clean contact.
After that, what happened in the

105
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,820
sessions is entirely a matter of
a larger consciousness that was

106
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,780
directing my experiences, or
organizing my experiences. And I

107
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,400
think this went far beyond
anything in my personal

108
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,280
unconscious. Because, you know,
the scale of the sessions are

109
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,240
just far faster than anything I
could dream up or imagine on my

110
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,580
own. So I have to place the
organization that's in the hands

111
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,480
of the universe.

112
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,660
Unknown: Absolutely, it's just
such a for somebody that hasn't

113
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,120
been on this journey, an
inconceivable idea. And we'll

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,320
get the little bit further on to
some of the communications that

115
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,540
you actually had, the
interactivity and almost the

116
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,080
discussions, or the dialogs that
you had with this consciousness,

117
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,380
which fascinated me. But for a
moment, I'm going to go back to

118
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,560
the ocean of suffering, just
because some of the words you

119
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,200
use to describe that period. So
session 11, trapped in a chamber

120
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,480
of horrors. Session 12, I was
killed, mauled, maimed. Session

121
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,620
13, reminded of Dante's Inferno.
Session 14, crescendo of torture

122
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,440
and session 15, excruciating
pain and unspeakable heart. So

123
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,920
the first thing is, why did you
continue?

124
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,540
Chris Bache: Well, it's because
of what happened at the in the

125
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,960
second half of the sessions,
first half of the sessions, I

126
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,200
was taken into this terrible
pain and suffering, and in this

127
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,680
when I would go through that,
and one of the most profound

128
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,160
lessons I learned from Stan Grof
is to completely trust the

129
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,460
process. So if you don't fight
what's happening, if you give

130
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,300
yourself over to it completely,
it will build and build, you'll

131
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,280
hit a crescendo and. If you
navigate this crescendo, well,

132
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,060
you will be spun into positive,
Transpersonal spaces for the

133
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,260
remainder of the session. So
these sessions were not just

134
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,260
ocean of suffering, but they
were the ocean of suffering in

135
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,460
the first hour or two, and then
I would be spun into this extra

136
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,620
ordinary series of experiences
I've described in deep time, in

137
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,180
the soul and the initiation in
the universe, so that at the end

138
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,720
of the session, what I would
internalize was a phase of its

139
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:35,360
intense suffering and then hours
of ecstatic participation in

140
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,780
some aspect of the universe
itself. So I would go back to

141
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,880
it, because I wanted that
initiation into the universe,

142
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:48,999
Unknown: absolutely, it just
sounds like such a space of

143
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:56,019
torment. And I spent a lot of
time thinking about the

144
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:59,439
suffering. And when I first
started reading the book, you

145
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:02,339
explain you in session 24
actually, you get a little bit

146
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:08,219
more deep into the cause or the
purpose of the suffering. And

147
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,399
you speak about this
consciousness, being a

148
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,039
consciousness of incredible love
overall. And and you say the

149
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:22,519
pain had begun in love, and I
was shown that the pain sorry

150
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:26,359
did not represent a rupturing of
love, but itself was an

151
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:29,599
expression of this love being
born into space time, even the

152
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:33,859
very birth of space time itself
was an expression of unshakable

153
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,799
love. And so what I'd like to do
is just understand that a little

154
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:43,299
bit more, how does all this
torrential pain come from love.

155
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,219
Chris Bache: Well, because
creation comes from love. And I

156
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:52,539
think the pain that I was
encountering here was the pain

157
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,879
that is somehow lodged in the
collective psyche, the pain of

158
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:02,819
human suffering over 1000s and
1000s of years, all the wars,

159
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:05,219
all the terrible things we've
done to each other, all the

160
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:09,059
rapes, all the brutality, all
this terrible suffering. And if

161
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,959
the suffering is not cleared at
the end of an individual life,

162
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,919
it's not only the individual who
has to bear the consequences of

163
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,859
that undigested pain, but the
species itself, the species

164
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:25,579
mind, this the collective
unconscious of our species must

165
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,259
also bear the burden of somehow
reconciling itself with this

166
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:34,039
charitable pain, which it does
in different ways. But one of

167
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:37,999
the ways it's that seems to have
happened is I was able to go

168
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,999
dissolve into the collective
unconscious. And when the

169
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:47,799
healing process deepened, it
represented some type of lifting

170
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,119
out of the collective psyche,
this magnitude of suffering. And

171
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:55,479
so when I say the suffering
began in pain, what I mean is

172
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:01,499
that all existence begins in
divine love. And that one of the

173
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:06,239
things I was shown in this
process was we are actually co

174
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:10,139
creators in this process. We're
not victims. This isn't being

175
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,799
done to us. Existence is not
being inflicted on us, and it's

176
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,579
not a veil of tears. We're not
being punished for anything. But

177
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:22,459
creation is a long process, very
long and drawn out with many,

178
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:27,439
many stages of incompleteness
before we get to the greater

179
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:32,299
places where we are still going.
And so that we knew we were

180
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:36,019
getting into this when we chose
to participate in creation, we

181
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:39,619
knew we were going to be dealing
with a very unfinished and as

182
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:44,559
yet imperfect system. And we
volunteered for this process

183
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,459
because of the grandeur of what
is taking place, the grandeur of

184
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:52,479
creation itself, moving from
very simple organisms to very

185
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:56,319
complicated organisms, from
unconscious organisms to self

186
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:59,979
conscious and deepening self
conscious organisms, that's the

187
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,319
that's the love out of which the
pain emerged, and the pain is

188
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:08,579
simply the struggles, you know,
the inherent struggles of

189
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,219
existing on this planet. Do you

190
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,419
Unknown: think that the
struggles rise out of a

191
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,719
disconnection from this source,
or do you feel that it's more of

192
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:24,079
the model that Stanislav Grof
talks about is that it's a

193
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,799
birthing process, that it's
actually, there's a period where

194
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:33,679
we're birthing into this new
human, if you will, and that

195
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,079
associated journey down the
birth canal is full of fear and

196
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,699
torment and and you know, before
actually gone,

197
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Chris Bache: yeah, well, I think
in the early stages, there is an

198
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,920
aspect of reliving our birth and
experiencing the birth canal.

199
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,180
Because, you know, the womb is
how we get into time and space,

200
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,840
and the grave is how we get out
of time and space. So when our

201
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,640
consciousness is. Expanding
beyond our physical time space

202
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,060
consciousness. There is this
kind of we get into the

203
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,140
revolving door of death and
rebirth. So we often relive our

204
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,980
birth in the process of being
birthed back into spiritual

205
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,760
reality. But I think that
applies, that kind of language

206
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,760
applies particularly in these
early stages. It applies in the

207
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,420
later stages, but not so
literally. In the same way, I

208
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,900
have a chapter in the book,
which I think is maybe the most

209
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,800
important chapter of the birth
of the future human. So I'm

210
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
looking at this historical
crisis that we're entering, this

211
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,380
global systems crisis, driven by
a global ecological crisis, as

212
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,900
the context which is giving
birth to a fundamentally changed

213
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,500
human being, creating a shift in
the collective psyche that we'll

214
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,460
get to. And so I speak of that
as a birth, and it is a birth,

215
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,280
but it's not a birth in the
sense of being trapped in a

216
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,400
birth canal or something like
this. It's the larger dynamic of

217
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,180
a species, which is in the
process of self transforming,

218
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,900
self emerging into a higher
order of itself.

219
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,160
Unknown: That's so interesting,
indeed, and we will get to that,

220
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,060
because I do agree with you that
that is a very important message

221
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,380
for humanity, and something that
we all need to understand, and

222
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,980
it kind of makes things a lot
more hopeful

223
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,319
Chris Bache: once we understand
what's really happening

224
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:33,559
underneath historical events.
One thing

225
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,820
Unknown: I just want to touch
upon is that there is the theme

226
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,420
that this process is not an
individual initiation as it is,

227
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,500
or initial liberation or
enlightenment, that what is

228
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,140
necessary here is this process
is taken by humanity as its own

229
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,540
individual organism, if you
will.

230
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,679
Chris Bache: One of the things
that happened repeatedly over

231
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,579
the years, as I dissolved into
the species mind so deeply, and

232
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,279
then into the context of the
species mind and the

233
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,239
evolutionary order of things is
that it became very, very clear

234
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,859
to me that the creative
intelligence that's behind

235
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,219
Evolution, that's behind our
universe, is not interested only

236
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:25,999
in individuals, but it's
interested in entire species.

237
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:29,839
It's trying to awaken not just
individuals, but it's trying to

238
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,939
awaken the entire human species,
the human family as one. So all

239
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:39,799
of our individual efforts take
our fractal embodiments of a

240
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,419
larger collective effort. So the
collective informs the

241
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,199
individual, and the individual
influences the collective.

242
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,120
Unknown: That makes a lot of
sense, and also it want. It

243
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,400
encourages me to be sympathetic
and nice to other individuals,

244
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
which I think is a very
important message, because we

245
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,780
also are one. You know, that
idea of We Are One, there is

246
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:14,280
another saying that people use
in literature that talks about

247
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,640
awakening and is, remember who
you are, remember who you are.

248
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,080
And that's something that has
always baffled me a little bit.

249
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,360
But in session 18, I believe
remember who you are, you and I

250
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,060
creating that was one of my
favorite parts of the book, even

251
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,360
though it was the worst pain
ever for you in the beginning,

252
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,960
cleansing aspect of that. But I
love the story, where it talks

253
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,300
about underneath the horrors and
the pain and the drama, there

254
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,360
were these little dominoes of
sweetness that would flip over.

255
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,520
Do you want to tell me a little
bit about that? That story for

256
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,480
our audience?

257
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:02,580
Chris Bache: Well, it would
probably take us too long to go

258
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,580
through the entire session, the
important part of the session,

259
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,820
after going through this kind of
Venetian blind, flipping back

260
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,760
and forth between the terrible
pain of the suffering of

261
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,180
existence, flipping into the
great sweetness, some extra

262
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,500
ordinary sweetness, going back
and forth until eventually, The

263
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,300
process took me into this
beautiful moment of clarity, and

264
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,500
it showed me that the sweetness
that I was experiencing was not

265
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,720
the origin of pleasure, but the
origin of existence itself. And

266
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,140
with that, this bubble broke and
I came to a remembering of who I

267
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,680
was in a deeper level that I was
consciousness. I was part of the

268
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,080
consciousness that was the
creative impulse of our

269
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,320
universe, and that we are all
sourced in, this creative

270
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,140
intelligence, this creative
consciousness, which is driving

271
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,060
our universe forward. This was
it became really this session

272
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,320
was all about. Remember,
remember. You are, remember what

273
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,060
you are. It really gets down to
a very basic point, our memories

274
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,920
define the limits of our being.
We are what we remember being.

275
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,720
Most of us don't have memories
beyond early childhood, but when

276
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,540
you work at psychedelics and
enter Non-ordinary states of

277
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,380
consciousness or through
meditation or near death

278
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,880
experiences, or any number of
different contexts we can

279
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,200
remember. We can our memories
can be extended. Our remembering

280
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,360
can be extended beyond our
childhood, beyond even birth,

281
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,400
beyond even former lives. When
we remember very, very deeply,

282
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,340
our memories take us back to the
creative impulse of existence

283
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,000
itself, the very impulse that
brought time and space into

284
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,500
being, to remember that deeply
they had this as a memory

285
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,340
suddenly changes your self
definition, your sense of who

286
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,160
and what you are. You become.
You understand that you are part

287
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,680
of the creative universe. You're
part of the energy that's

288
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,760
creating the universe. And with
that, there's just a tremendous

289
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,980
reframing of your understanding
of what your life is about, and

290
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,200
your understanding of what life
itself is about.

291
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:24,619
Unknown: I love in that session
that the you Your face was taken

292
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:28,219
into the hands, and you were
looked in the eyes, and it was

293
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:31,339
said to you, it is you and I
creating my love. All suffering

294
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:35,419
and ignorance is simply what has
happened since we separated. So

295
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:39,379
one of the things is, in this
book, you have actually met a

296
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:44,019
cast of characters, if you want
to call them that, but entities,

297
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:49,539
consciousnesses, and that was
just a beautiful experience. I

298
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:50,199
can imagine

299
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,520
Chris Bache: it was. It was a
very meaningful experience. It's

300
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,600
interesting. You know, in DMT
sessions, people have many

301
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,060
experiences where they meet
specific entities. And what's

302
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,740
kind of curious about my LSD
journey is that I had relatively

303
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,020
few experiences meeting meeting
discrete individual entities.

304
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,380
Basically, I kept being
dissolved into layers and layers

305
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,400
of being rather than into a
state where I met individual

306
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,200
beings. So this being, something
took my face in its hands,

307
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,040
looked into my eyes and said
this, you and I creating my love

308
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,940
and I so I've had many
experiences of communion,

309
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,780
contact, even conversation,
dialog with an intelligence. But

310
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,100
this intelligence never took
physical form, never took any

311
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,060
kind of cultural specific form,
never took a deity form, never

312
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,860
took any form of archetypes. It
was always a clear presence that

313
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,460
I felt, but it was not a
presence that was visible to me

314
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,799
Unknown: that's so interesting.
So when they took you, you felt

315
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,859
it. It was more of an
experience, and actually seeing

316
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:09,419
this do

317
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,540
it for you, yeah. But the words
were very clear. The intention

318
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,500
was very clear.

319
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,880
Speaking of the dialog, I love
the Circle of Learning in

320
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:28,580
session 19, the cosmic tour in
that session, you really seem to

321
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,920
really begin this intense dialog
with this consciousness. Yeah.

322
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,760
So go ahead. It wasn't so much
of a dialog for, say, as an

323
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,200
experiential Yeah.

324
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,320
Chris Bache: Basically, when I
came through the ocean of

325
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,220
suffering. In that session, I
basically came into there were

326
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,420
several preliminary experiences,
but eventually I came into an

327
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,300
arena where I was in dialog with
this consciousness, and I could

328
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,740
know anything that I wanted to
know, if I could endure it. So

329
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,300
in this arena, I would ask
questions, and it would respond

330
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,540
to me by orchestrating my
experience in order to show me

331
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,160
what it was that I wanted to
understand. And then eventually,

332
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,120
it took me on what I call the
cosmic tour. It seemed to be the

333
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,360
creative intelligence of the
universe, and it seemed to be

334
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,540
delighted to be able to finally
be showing human beings and me

335
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,620
only as representative of my
species, coming back to the

336
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,220
creative intelligence, and it
wanted to show us what it had

337
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,360
accomplished during all these
13.7 billions of years. And it

338
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,360
would take me somewhere and show
me something, and I would

339
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,460
understand. And sometimes what I
saw was so mesmerizing. I would

340
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,900
call it, stop and be just
dumbfounded. It by the beauty of

341
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,540
it. And it would hurry it would
come back for me, and it would

342
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,280
say, hurry up. Hurry up. Got
more to show you. Keep up. Keep

343
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:01,320
up. Come on. This astounding the
magnitude. Of the intelligence

344
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,340
that's embedded in our universe,
that manifests our universe, and

345
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,540
the magnitude of the love that
lies at the very font of

346
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,160
creation. This was a staggering
revelation for me when I began

347
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,540
this work, even though I have a
background in religious studies,

348
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,800
I began this work as an atheist,
I began this work as an

349
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,980
agnostic, an atheistically
inclined agnostic. I really was

350
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,780
very skeptical about the reality
of a transcendent dimension, or

351
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,140
the know ability of a
transcendent dimension, so this

352
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,060
was a major kind of shift in my
worldview to even envision the

353
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,920
possibility that we could enter
into states which were so

354
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,980
cognitively rich as these states
were.

355
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,100
Unknown: Can you share with us
one part of the tour that you

356
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,440
have digested and explained to
us that was beautiful?

357
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:01,559
Chris Bache: You know, that's
the challenging part. Is that I

358
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:06,239
simply don't have enough PhDs to
hold in my conscious awareness.

359
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:11,039
Many of the things that I was
shown if I had PhDs in physics

360
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,599
and astrophysics and cosmology,
I would have a better chance of

361
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,539
being able to have retained
cognitively specific information

362
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:24,199
that I was shown at that in
those circumstances. In other

363
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:27,439
sessions, I had very powerful
experiences, and I was able to

364
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:30,379
bring them back because they
were somewhat related to things

365
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:35,059
that I was educated in. I I was
shown many things about

366
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:38,359
reincarnation. I was shown many
things about how reincarnation

367
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,339
works that led me to have an
understanding of reincarnation

368
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:45,999
is very different than the way
it's presented in Eastern

369
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:52,899
cultures as well. Yeah, my first
book is a book on reincarnation

370
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:57,219
called life cycles, because it
just to me. To me, reincarnation

371
00:26:57,219 --> 00:27:00,479
is a fact of life as
overwhelming empirical evidence

372
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:03,959
that this is the case. We didn't
have this evidence 50 years ago.

373
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:08,819
We do today, but kind of
psychologically, what motivated

374
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:13,799
what was behind my writing that
book, though I don't discuss it

375
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:20,099
in the book, was in the sessions
my own experience of the karmic

376
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,739
intentionality of my life and
some of my former lives that

377
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,999
surfaced in the sessions
themselves. I don't talk about

378
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:32,179
it in life cycles. I really try
to stay in the basis of, you

379
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:35,779
know, publicly available
research, but that was the

380
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,799
background to the book

381
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:39,979
Unknown: you also talk about
that. It's an evolutionary

382
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:44,859
impulse, yeah, reincarnation. So
again, not just for the

383
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:47,139
individual, but for humanity as
well.

384
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,400
Chris Bache: Yes, I see
reincarnation as as part of

385
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,180
evolution. It's the higher
octave of revolution of

386
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,740
evolution. So evolution evolves
whole groups. It falls

387
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,320
collective learning forward in
time. Somehow nature has found a

388
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,700
way, or the intelligence of
nature has found a way to evolve

389
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,080
individuals within certain
species and to fold individual

390
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,460
learning forward in time. So
it's not just individual human

391
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,780
beings who are reincarnating.
All of, excuse me, all of

392
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,620
humanity is reincarnating, and
that means we're we're all

393
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,040
growing together, and all of us
growing together is part of our

394
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,060
species, evolving and growing,
developing new capacities over

395
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,960
long periods of time. So it's
very much of an evolutionary

396
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,500
dynamic.

397
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,480
Unknown: And while we hear I may
as well touch upon a question I

398
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,440
had for a little bit further on,
when you're saying that

399
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,620
evolution involves an
individual, and that individual

400
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,180
puts that information back into
the pot, if you will. For the

401
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:58,960
rest of the reflective there is
a huge theme in your book in the

402
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,140
respect that you by going
through all of this pain in a

403
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,520
way you were digesting and
healing this collective

404
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,960
consciousness. Now I know for
myself on the work that I have

405
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,480
done personally, that I need to
go back into the pain and

406
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,920
release it, or work with it
acknowledge it and thank it and

407
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,500
said it goodbye. So in a sense,
you have done some of this work

408
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,300
on a larger scale.

409
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,840
Chris Bache: I did, and I want
to really emphasize, even though

410
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,020
I went through many layers of
suffering in this process, I

411
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,760
don't carry any trauma from this
work. I mean, there's nothing

412
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,380
undigested that that bothers me
in the you know, I went into

413
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,040
what the Buddhism calls the hell
realms. You know, people go into

414
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,160
the hell realms in different
circumstances. But it didn't

415
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,560
stick in my system as trauma,
because I saw it through twist

416
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,220
DMT. Conclusion, I took it all
the way down to the base.

417
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,940
Whatever was given to me, I took
it down to the base, and was

418
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,380
much more than amply rewarded in
the ecstatic experiences that

419
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:16,680
followed. So the whole cycle of
going into pain, breaking

420
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,020
through the pain, going into the
reward phase of a session,

421
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,200
that's what I internalize. So
now, yeah, having done this

422
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,420
work, some of the blessings that
I received in later sessions

423
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,340
were the direct correlation or
the consequence of having done

424
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,380
the collective cleansing. So the
principle of karma is whatever

425
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,880
we do for others comes back to
us in one form or another. So I

426
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,740
had been given an opportunity
and an invitation to help in

427
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,400
this collective transformation.
And I think this is nothing,

428
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,080
nothing terribly heroic. This is
what any mother would do for her

429
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,300
children. Any Poulter would do
for his children. If you saw

430
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,200
someone suffering and you had an
opportunity to help them and not

431
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,340
make them not suffer, any human
being worth their salt could do

432
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,400
that. Same thing happened here.
This opened in the sessions, I

433
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,420
had an opportunity. I took the
opportunity. Then later in the

434
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:24,020
sessions, when this light began
to fill me and when I began to

435
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:33,080
enter into orders of ecstasy and
beatific visions, that really

436
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:41,500
was a crescendo in many of many
years of work that was, that was

437
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,900
the natural, organic manifesting
within my individual awareness

438
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,220
of the historic process that
humanity is going through as a

439
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,880
collective. We are going through
a purification process. We're

440
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,480
going through a detoxification
process. We're going through a

441
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,500
collective death and rebirth
process. And that will be very,

442
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,620
very clear in the decades ahead.
We're going through a

443
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,960
Death-Rebirth process, but death
is followed by rebirth, career,

444
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,020
vacation is followed by ecstatic
joy.

445
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,460
Unknown: So Sweetie, what is it?
Is it the seeing it? Is it the

446
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,860
holding it? Is it the
experiencing of it. What is the

447
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:30,440
mechanism that clears this pain
away? You know, in the respect

448
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,180
that is there, have you? I mean,
on a very, very grand scale,

449
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,020
you've done very, very grand
work, but possibly, if we can

450
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,420
understand the process, we can
undertake some of it ourselves.

451
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,820
So what is the trigger? What is
the, what is the what do we need

452
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,560
to get to to actually work on
this, to help clear some of this

453
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,040
away?

454
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:58,719
Chris Bache: I think that what
we do in a session is simply

455
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:03,059
what is happening in life,
always all the time, except it

456
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:06,899
gets very concentrated and
amplified in a session. But the

457
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:12,059
dynamics are fundamentally
similar. Remember that LSD, or

458
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:15,239
psychedelics in general, they
don't give us they don't

459
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,999
predicate a particular
experience. They don't give us a

460
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:20,959
specific experience. They are
simply amplifiers of

461
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:24,679
consciousness. So what happens
in a session is simply what is

462
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,479
happening in life, but larger,
faster, deeper. And I think the

463
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:36,679
key to engaging suffering in a
way that lifts suffering out of

464
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:43,299
the system is the same way that
is true for therapy or engaging

465
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:47,439
life in general, we have to sit
with what it is that's bothering

466
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:50,319
us. We have to enter into a
conscious rapport with the

467
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,579
suffering and let it come into
us, let our awareness take it

468
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:57,879
in. The only difference here is
that was the scale of the

469
00:33:57,879 --> 00:34:00,719
suffering involved, the scale of
the memories that were being

470
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:06,299
activated. But the basic process
to let those memories come into

471
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,639
my awareness without
understanding where they were

472
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,879
coming from at the time or what
it was serving, letting them

473
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:17,339
come into my awareness and my
experience is that they come

474
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,839
into my awareness and they flow
through me. That the sense,

475
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:24,439
there's a sense of flowing, it
flows through me, and I think it

476
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:28,999
flows into the light. It flows
and it allows some type of deep

477
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,459
reconciliation to take place.

478
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,359
Unknown: I think conscious
rapport is perfect. I in my own

479
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,259
limited experience, that's what
it feels like to me, that there

480
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:44,679
is a conscious interaction, a
rapport with it, and that really

481
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,439
does help. Just know that it
works on larger scales.

482
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,920
Chris Bache: Yeah, it does. And
I think it works with in a

483
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,400
reincarnational context. I
think, for example, that there

484
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,380
are many more Bodhisattvas in
the world than we think.

485
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,840
Perhaps. There are many people
who are suffering, so to speak,

486
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,020
in their physical lives, in
their ordinary day to day lives,

487
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,220
they they are suffering more
pain than so to speak is their

488
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:16,140
just do more pain than is their
explainable in terms of personal

489
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,680
karma, I think there are many
people who are also trying to

490
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,440
lift the collective psyche, and
they are willing to open their

491
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,680
lives to dimensions of suffering
that come at them in very

492
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,760
tangible, concrete ways. It's
nothing you know, become very

493
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,480
tangible. And they take it on,
and they try to change, you

494
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,940
know, they try to change it.
They're trying to change

495
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,740
people's lives. They're they go
into places in the world where

496
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,380
there is suffering. They don't
need to go into those places,

497
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,040
but they go into those places to
take on that pain in some way

498
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,800
and make a difference with
respect to that pain. Same

499
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,340
principle, same principle as
happens in a psychedelic

500
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,820
session.

501
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:01,500
Unknown: Indeed, council of
elders. Again, this was another

502
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,940
area of interactive dialog, and
I found it very interesting the

503
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,360
idea that to actually perceive
this knowledge, you had to

504
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,040
prepare for it. You needed
explicit training. Can you share

505
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,440
with us a little bit about that
experience?

506
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,500
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, when
you start to go into dialog with

507
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,460
this infinite consciousness that
can show you so many things at

508
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,620
so many levels. You truly have
to train yourself to stay

509
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,120
cognitively coherent when you're
working at so many deep levels

510
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,420
of consciousness. And it happens
kind of spontaneously in your

511
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,100
work, but in this particular
session, it seemed that I needed

512
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,000
kind of training to help make
this better. And so I was in

513
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,640
this council of elders. I was in
this surrounded by beings again

514
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,320
that I didn't see, but I felt,
and I could know anything I

515
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,600
wanted, if I could endure the
consequences of knowing it. So I

516
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,040
would put forward a question,
and the elders would take it,

517
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,620
and then they would start to
gather, and they would start to

518
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,120
chant. The music was the Tibetan
chanting, the very deep,

519
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,440
guttural chanting of the gyota
monks in Tibet they would chant

520
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,680
and chant, and then they would
release this knowing at me. And

521
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,460
if I was centered, when this
knowing hit me, it would send me

522
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,780
into an orgy of cognitive
ecstasy, showing me things, just

523
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,900
showing me things. But if I
wasn't centered, if I had

524
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,800
allowed myself to get distracted
and I wasn't centered, when this

525
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,640
knowing hit me. It would just
Shatter Me. It would just

526
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,900
shatter my mind, and I could not
stay cognitively coherent. So in

527
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:51,400
this particular session, many,
many times I was shattered. Many

528
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,420
times I was sent into cognitive
ecstasy. But the point was to

529
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,040
train to literally have to train
yourself first to reach this

530
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,020
level of consciousness, and then
you have to train yourself to be

531
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,300
to learn how to receive
conscious information that's

532
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,040
coming from different dimensions
of consciousness. You have to

533
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,600
learn how to stay awake and how
to stay coherent in levels of

534
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,920
consciousness which are beyond
any levels that you've ever

535
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,160
experienced before, and it can
be done. I mean, the shamanic

536
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,880
cultures are masters of learning
how to enter these states of

537
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,840
consciousness. Meditation
masters are masters at learning

538
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,960
how to enter these deep states
of consciousness. It's just the

539
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,040
same dynamic, just within a
psychedelic context. Has

540
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,760
Unknown: this training stayed
with you, and is there any

541
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,420
application for it in normal
consciousness?

542
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,740
I hope so. I hope so. I don't
know who's going

543
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,980
to be releasing such ecstatic
knowledge at you in normal

544
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,900
consciousness, but I mean, are
there any have you? Are you in a

545
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,160
place where you can activate
your your mind, your

546
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,060
consciousness, in that way? In
normal consciousness,

547
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,760
Chris Bache: it is the question
of the relationship between the

548
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,260
experiences one has in deep
psychedelic states and then your

549
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,180
ordinary resting consciousness
when your session is over.

550
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:30,440
That's a complicated question.
It's clearly we cannot take our

551
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,220
experiences back and stabilize
our present Earth consciousness

552
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,220
in those states. It would be
wonderful if we could. I wish we

553
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:42,760
could. Wish I could, but it's a
more subtle process. I think

554
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,860
these experiences, if we handle
them well, if we record them and

555
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,180
learn from them, they give us
practices. They literally give

556
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,620
me practices that I'm supposed
to do every day after the

557
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,600
sessions, in between the
sessions, if we use. Well, and

558
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,080
particularly if we stay
grounded, because it's the

559
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,820
greatest danger of working in
psychedelic states is psychic

560
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,720
inflation, because we have had
an extra ordinary experience, we

561
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,020
think we must be an extra
ordinary person. That's just not

562
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,540
true. We have to stay grounded.
But if we stay grounded, the

563
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:25,280
experiences that we're given, I
think, act as strange attractors

564
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,180
and accelerate our evolutionary
development in a certain

565
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:34,520
direction. So I hope that some
of the not some of the

566
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,400
experiences I've had, some of
the learnings that I've been

567
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,160
given, some of the training, in
terms of focusing my

568
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,460
consciousness is I trust that it
is affecting me and it is

569
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,520
benefiting me outside of the
sessions, both directly and

570
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,940
indirectly. But actually, I
think the proof that's in the

571
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,860
pudding when I die, all in
Buddhism, all spiritual

572
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,580
practice, is training you for
what will happen when you die,

573
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,740
absolutely. So I think the same
thing is true in psychedelic

574
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,880
sessions, if you engage them
conscientiously, they are

575
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,300
training you and preparing for
you to enter into states of

576
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,980
consciousness that are waiting
for you when you die. And so I

577
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,500
think there's a strong
correlation there.

578
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,160
Unknown: Do you have an idea of
what level we go to when we die?

579
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,640
Since you have visited so many
different levels of creation, of

580
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,200
before creation, did you get a
sense of what level we naturally

581
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,560
Chris Bache: end up at? I've had
many experiences that basically

582
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,400
make sense. I understand them in
terms of the Eastern concept of

583
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,060
the Bardo or the multiple levels
of reality one enters when you

584
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:57,460
die. The basic idea is that you
don't go to a place, but there

585
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:03,600
is you go to a complex domain,
which has many, many layers. And

586
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,780
the level that you go to
reflects the level of your

587
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,560
present spiritual development,
your ability to stay conscious.

588
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,180
So all of these levels are part
of the Bardo. They're part of

589
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:21,140
Samsara. They're part of the
evolving cyclic nature of, you

590
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,520
know, of nature, the sick, the
cyclic patterns of nature. It's

591
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,140
also possible to go penetrate
all the way through the Bardo

592
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,160
and enter extra Samsara,
reality, which is sometimes

593
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,620
called extra Samsara, or beyond
the domain of Samsara. This, I

594
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:47,260
would place the diamond
Luminosity experiences at extra

595
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:52,840
samsaric reality outside that
reality. So where one goes, when

596
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,060
one dies really depends upon how
much homework one is done while

597
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,840
one is here.

598
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,420
Unknown: Absolutely, my love.
And speaking of dying, you died

599
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,380
a lot, I'm

600
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,840
afraid so guilty,

601
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,640
as I mentioned in the
introduction, you you, you died

602
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,560
over and over and over and over
again. And so it has changed

603
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:25,640
your perspective on death,
absolutely having died. Yeah,

604
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,660
Chris Bache: one of the things
that you learned that being

605
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,340
afraid of death is just such a
sadness. I mean, I'm not, not

606
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:38,060
only am I not afraid of dying,
but I'm looking forward to being

607
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,100
dead. I mean, I'm not looking
forward to the act of dying, but

608
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,960
there's absolutely no fear for
me and what happens to what will

609
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,100
happen to me when I die, and I'm
looking forward to it, because

610
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,120
I've I've crossed that line
multiple times over the course

611
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,720
of all these years of work, and
so I feel comfortable where I'm

612
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,880
going. I'm filled with ecstatic
joy of where I'm going. And I

613
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,120
think it's it's not just me, but
I think we should all be filled

614
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:11,160
with ecstatic expectations,
ecstatic joy at the prospect of

615
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,380
where we go. If we are afraid of
death, then we've got our entire

616
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,320
entire world upside down. The
hard work is done inside time

617
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,160
and space. This is the hard
place where we go when we die.

618
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,720
Is not the far hard place all
this Hollywood malarkey about

619
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,780
the shadows and darkness and
demonic and no, it's much more

620
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,840
benign than that. It's much more
intelligent than that. It's much

621
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,480
more compassionate than that.

622
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,420
Unknown: Yeah, so to me, death
is something I'm looking forward

623
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:46,540
to.

624
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:52,480
The first time you died, there
was fear associated with it. Was

625
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,360
the second time a little bit
easier, or was this, I mean,

626
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,180
like, did you get to put Oh,
here it comes again. Oh. Is

627
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,080
there always just a little bit
of, here we go again.

628
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,620
Chris Bache: The essence of
dying, of course, is losing

629
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,580
complete control. You just you
lose complete control of your

630
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,540
identity, you lose complete
control of your knowledge. You

631
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,860
lose complete control of
anything to do with what you are

632
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,320
and who you are, and that always
has a frightening quality. But

633
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,520
if you go through this multiple
times, several things happen.

634
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,760
One of them is you learn to
trust the process, and you learn

635
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,540
that you can die and the very
structure of your life can be

636
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:41,200
completely dissolved, but you
will reawaken some essence of

637
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,360
you, some better version of you,
will wake up in a different

638
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:52,060
reality of total, unexpected
joy. You learn that there really

639
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,920
is no such thing truly as death.
The form of your life can be

640
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,480
destroyed, but the essence of
your life is indestructible, and

641
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,880
therefore you cannot die. Now
that doesn't mean that in some

642
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,300
way it gets easier, but when
you're going through the middle

643
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,560
of an advanced death and rebirth
process, it's still terrifying,

644
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,920
and it's still frightening just
because it is a deep, deep

645
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,380
unraveling of anything you've
ever known. So that the

646
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,440
unraveling in the beginning is
the unraveling of your time,

647
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,840
space, identity, your body,
mind, ego.

648
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:32,539
Unknown: But I've had that
experience because I've Once

649
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,499
done, you know, an LSD trip when
I was in Amsterdam, and I

650
00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:44,139
remember trying to hold on to
the me, the ego me, with all my

651
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:49,959
strength, and it was terrifying
to think of that being

652
00:46:49,959 --> 00:46:53,739
dissipated, and I hadn't read
the books, and I didn't know

653
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:58,539
what would happen if I let go.
So it was just so it is

654
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:00,639
terrifying experience.

655
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,460
Chris Bache: It is and but as
you do it, as you repeat it, you

656
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:11,280
get a little more used to it. So
that aspect of the total, total

657
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,420
fear that grips you in the
beginning, that's that ceases.

658
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,540
It's a different quality of
fear. It's a more informed

659
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:24,800
quality of fear, if that makes
sense, in the end, of course,

660
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,980
what happens is that death
becomes your best friend.

661
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,560
Because what I learned, I know
it's a strange thing.

662
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,240
Unknown: I'm a Scorpio, and
that's even

663
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,520
Chris Bache: learn I learned
late in the last five years of

664
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,800
work that there are many degrees
of dying and the deepest

665
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,700
ecstatic experiences, the
deepest visionary experiences

666
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:56,980
are follow our fault, or follow
the deepest death experiences.

667
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,800
Once you understand that, once
you understand that there are

668
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,360
levels and levels of dying,
followed by levels and levels of

669
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,860
ecstatic revelation. Then death
becomes your friend. You not

670
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,180
only don't want to avoid it, you
seek it out. You create

671
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,980
conditions in your sessions
where you want the turbulence

672
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,260
and the destructuring that is
associated with death, and you

673
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,680
you choose it because you know
what's waiting for you on the

674
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,640
other side of this radical
destructuring. So death becomes

675
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,760
your best friend. Death becomes
your mistress. Sure. I mean, it

676
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,000
sounds strange to put it that
way, but you know, death is your

677
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,340
gateway into Transcendence,

678
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,920
Unknown: speaking of which, on
the other side of death in

679
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,500
session 22 and 23 Yeah. You were
shown the master plan for

680
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,820
humanity, yeah. So you kind of
had to go through Deb, let's

681
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,260
speak a little bit about that.

682
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,580
Chris Bache: Well, this was
actually one of the real

683
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:02,340
surprises for me in this work,
because when this all took place

684
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,520
between when I was 30 and 50
years old, and this started in

685
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,320
79 to went to 99 and when I
started this work, I wasn't

686
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,680
studying, I wasn't concerned
about the fate of humanity. I

687
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,020
really was completely tuned out
to global ecological crisis.

688
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:23,240
This was just before that time
for me. But what happened was

689
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,920
starting in the 22nd 23rd
session, the theme of human

690
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,260
evolution, the theme of the
master plan, and I apologize for

691
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:37,340
the patriarchal quality maybe of
that term. I don't mean it that

692
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,900
way, the master plan of
humanity. And it kept coming

693
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,620
back again and again, and it
actually continued all the way

694
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,360
to the 70th session. So in the
70th session, I was given one

695
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,500
deep, deep final vision, which
was once again the capstone of

696
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:59,500
the story. And it was always a
consistent story. So the story

697
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,920
in. Basically for about three
and a half years, the story had

698
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,980
different components, but the
story always had the same

699
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,760
fundamental structure. Humanity
was coming to a turning point.

700
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,720
Humanity was coming to a major
breakthrough. This was a

701
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,440
breakthrough in history that
would divide between the before

702
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,660
and after, just an enormous
spiritual breakthrough. And it

703
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,120
was a breakthrough, not of
individuals, but it was the

704
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,480
entire species. And it was
coming up inside it. It was

705
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,080
coming up from within the
collective consciousness, and it

706
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,680
was catapulting us into an
accelerated development beyond

707
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,840
anything that we had known
previously. But in all of these

708
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,680
years of visions, which I
present in the book, and in this

709
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,820
chapter, the birth of the future
human, I was never shown how

710
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,180
nature was going to accomplish
this. It, you know, I did not

711
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,060
understand how it was going to
accomplish this. And along the

712
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,300
way, I began to do my ecological
homework. I began to read the

713
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,380
books, really helping me become
better educated about what's

714
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:09,540
happening. And then in 1995 in
the 55th session, it took me

715
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,120
into deep time, into it took me
into the future, and it gave me

716
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,980
an experience of the death and
rebirth of our species. It took

717
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,440
me into the critical turning
point that these visions had

718
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,800
been talking about. And I
experienced this not as an

719
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,220
individual. It wasn't Chris
Bache who had this experience,

720
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,000
but at that point, I was
completely dissolved into the

721
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,240
species mind, into the
collective unconscious, and I

722
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,800
experienced the death and
rebirth of our species as the

723
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,780
species, and it was a it was a
period again, and it didn't give

724
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,840
me the details. It didn't give
me any specifics about when,

725
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,400
where and how. But it was a
global systems crisis triggered

726
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,660
by a global ecological crisis,
and it continued for decades. It

727
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,900
and it basically triggered a
profound suffering as we lost

728
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,580
control of the conditions of our
life. Life as we knew it was

729
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,360
shattered at the core, and it
looked for a time that we would

730
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,080
all be killed, that this was an
extinction process. But just

731
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:20,820
when it was at its worst,
eventually the crisis passed,

732
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,740
and things began to get better,
and the survivors began to pick

733
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,760
themselves up and began to
recon, put things back together,

734
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,560
and when they began to re,
engage each other and engage

735
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,920
life, they found that they were
working in a completely

736
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:42,160
different internal reality, that
values which had been activated

737
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,760
in the depth of this crisis,
ways of knowing, ways of being

738
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,600
in the world, had been
activated, and a shift had taken

739
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,200
place, we would say, in the
collective unconscious, a shift

740
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,740
at the foundation of our being,
the collective psyche. So the

741
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:03,120
entire post crisis world was
saturated with new values, new

742
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,440
perspectives, new social units,
new ways of understanding. There

743
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,420
was a tremendous opening of the
human heart into compassion for

744
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,420
other beings, not only human
beings, but for other beings,

745
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,900
other species. There was a
tremendous opening of the human

746
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,540
mind to be open and transparent
to the intelligence of the

747
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:28,700
universe that can now, could now
infuse itself more cleanly and

748
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,540
clearly into our human
consciousness. So, I mean,

749
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,920
really honestly, it's, it's a
cliche, I know, but we were

750
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,880
becoming, we became a species of
Buddha's humanity became a

751
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,720
collective Buddhas and a species
of Christ and prophets. We

752
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:52,060
basically made this deep turning
point. And then, in the 70th

753
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:56,680
session, several years later, it
gave me one final capstone

754
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,220
retrospective in which it showed
me everything that it had shown

755
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,980
me before and gave me a couple
of last pieces of instruction

756
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,480
concerning this transformational
process. The reason I think this

757
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,160
is the most important part of
the book is naturally because my

758
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,760
personal transformation. Who
Cares one person, but this is

759
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,020
all of our children, all of our
grandchildren, my great

760
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,560
grandchildren. This is what,
this is our work. This is our

761
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,380
collective work. This is what
I'm here for, what you're here

762
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,760
for, what we are all here for,
is to participate and to support

763
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,240
this collective,
transformational process. And I

764
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,180
think it's been building through
the 20th century. It's been,

765
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,080
it's being, going to be
continued, to build through the

766
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:45,700
21st Century, a series of I'm
expecting a series of punctuated

767
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,600
crises that's just going to be
showing us. We're going to be

768
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:55,000
inheriting, we're going to be
inheriting the limitations of

769
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,860
our previous world view, of our
of our less than conscious.

770
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,980
Participation on this earth.

771
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,440
Unknown: Well, if you think
about it, when you were doing

772
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,000
right now, basically, you cannot
turn on the TV, the radio or

773
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,720
newspaper without hearing about
our climate disaster and our

774
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,080
economic ecological damage. But
when you were doing this work,

775
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:21,740
it wasn't very forth. You know,
top of mind, it wasn't something

776
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,660
so even having that disclosure
in these sessions was really

777
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,720
very much predicting the future,
if you will, or predicting the

778
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:34,520
now back in those times and so,
you know, right now it kind of,

779
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,800
of course it would be an
ecological disaster. But back

780
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,160
then, when you were doing it,
that itself must have been quite

781
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,420
revelatory, because possibly we
were thinking more of war or

782
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,360
annihilation, nuclear
annihilation, of those kinds of

783
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,020
things, if we had to put a
finger on what would end us and

784
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,180
also it sounds, go ahead,
sweetie.

785
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,440
Chris Bache: And this awareness
rises not only in psychedelic

786
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,220
states, and it is, it is, I
don't use the word prophetic,

787
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,940
but it is visionary. And when
you go into deep, visionary

788
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,440
states, you breach the laws of
time, you open yourself up into

789
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,600
future time. But it's not just
in psychedelic states, but deep

790
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:17,580
contemplatives have these
experiences. Indigenous people

791
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,840
have been having this, these
visions of the future of

792
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,260
humanity, and the indigenous
brothers and sisters have been

793
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,220
warning the civilized members of
the human family about what

794
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,480
we're doing to the planet. And I
have a passage from beads

795
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,900
Griffith in that chapter the
birth of the future human who is

796
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:40,780
a Christian, Hindu saint, you
know, a contemplative, and he

797
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:45,220
had these kind of visions about
where we're going. Yeah, the

798
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:48,160
process me completely by
surprise back then,

799
00:56:48,339 --> 00:56:50,499
Unknown: yes, absolutely. That's
That's what I'm saying. We have

800
00:56:50,499 --> 00:56:54,279
to think that this was a while
back, that it's not, it wasn't

801
00:56:54,279 --> 00:56:58,299
what all the awareness that
there is now, the process sounds

802
00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:01,559
very much like an individual
death process. However, in the

803
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:06,359
respect that in the book, you
talk about how we everything

804
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:11,759
that we rely on today goes away,
you know, everything that we

805
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:14,819
take for granted and so that
there's this incredible chaos.

806
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:19,559
And it's that for the survivors,
that the ability, the necessity

807
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,779
to kind of come up with a new
way of doing things that we had

808
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:29,539
done poorly before, and that
that is almost part of the

809
00:57:29,539 --> 00:57:32,959
process of the initiation into
the new human.

810
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,920
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think that
people individually, who are

811
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,840
making the transition in advance
of the collective, who see

812
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,140
what's happening and they're
making the changes in their own

813
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:48,460
life. They've made this decisive
steps to take down the barriers

814
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:52,000
between race, between religion,
between cultures. They have

815
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,240
eliminated those barriers in
their own heart. They're

816
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,620
basically working to live a
different relationship with the

817
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:04,440
earth, to preserve the life
systems of the planet, to reduce

818
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,820
their foot there, to move into
voluntary simplicity, the beings

819
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:13,200
who have made the steps in their
personal life. Those beings, I

820
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,760
think, become seed catalysts in
our future transformation. My

821
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,280
sense is that when we go into
this crisis of the future. It's

822
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,880
going to last so long, and it's
going to affect so many people,

823
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,940
and it's going to be so
disruptive and so hard on us

824
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,960
that it's going to stimulate not
only our individual psyches, but

825
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,080
so many people will be having
these disruptive experiences

826
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,900
that it's going to hyper
stimulate the collective

827
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:43,060
unconscious. It'll drive the
collective unconscious into what

828
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:47,620
we call non linear systems in a
long linear range. And we know

829
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:51,220
something about physical systems
when they are driven into non

830
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,480
linear conditions are far from
equilibrium states. I think that

831
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,900
something that happens to
physical systems, there is an

832
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:02,820
analogy to what will happen in
psychological systems, in the

833
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:06,660
psychic field of the human
species, and when this field is

834
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:10,860
pressurized, small
perturbations, the chaos

835
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,980
theoreticians like to say small
changes can produce

836
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,840
disproportionate outcomes, A
capacity the species will be

837
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:24,920
able to mobilize unexpected
insights, unexpected forms of

838
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,580
knowledge, unexpected
understandings will emerge, so

839
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:32,120
to speak, almost out of nowhere,
but it's actually emerging out

840
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:37,400
of our own innate potential, out
of our own being so faster than

841
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,300
we could imagine. The changes
will take place faster than we

842
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,540
could conceive of if we were
looking at the history of the

843
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,320
past, because the history of the
past is somewhat non linear. But

844
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,980
when we go into such a profound
crisis, we move into, I'm sorry,

845
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,300
the past is linear, but when we
go into this profound crisis, we

846
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,780
go into non linear conditions
and non linear dynamics.

847
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,660
Unknown: It's. Sounds very
scary, but very exciting. For

848
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:10,440
those of us who haven't died 30
times, you know it, but I mean,

849
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,500
the it's like having a baby,
that's very scary too, you know?

850
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,140
But at the end of absolutely,
the reward,

851
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,420
Chris Bache: yeah, having a
baby, it's an excellent analogy,

852
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:25,640
because when you have a baby,
gestation lasts nine months.

853
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,900
It's a very, very long process,
but labor is very, very intense,

854
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,860
but relatively short. And I
think that's also true for our

855
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,880
species. Going into this crisis,
we had been gestating the future

856
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,140
human for hundreds of 1000s of
years. We've been doing it

857
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,780
through reincarnation,
reincarnation, learning,

858
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,180
learning, learning more,
reincarnation, more development.

859
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:51,340
But the time of birth is a
relatively short, intense period

860
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:56,320
that requires makes enormous
demands, just as labor does for

861
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,980
a woman. That's what we're
coming to. We are going into a

862
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:06,000
labor of history, the labor of
the future, human, yeah, and

863
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,180
it's not going to be fun, it's
not going to be easy, but it's

864
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:14,340
going to be, I think, profoundly
meaningful, and in the end, when

865
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:19,080
we die, would you rather have a
nice, happy life, pleasant, but

866
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,640
basically kind of boring, not
very significant. Would you

867
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,160
rather have a life where you
knew you were invested in

868
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,100
something that meant, something
that was worth, something that

869
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:32,300
was profound? And I think
that's, that's what we're going

870
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:32,660
into.

871
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,740
Unknown: I look, I agree with
you. I often, I'm also a

872
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:40,360
believer in reincarnation. And
you know, you see the trends

873
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:44,380
that are happening right now.
And I often think about, if

874
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:48,520
nothing changes, how much worse
the next lives are going to be.

875
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:55,240
So to get in there, to dig in,
do the work that we can be part

876
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,040
of the process and come out the
other end, I think it is. It's a

877
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,160
wonderful option,

878
01:02:02,759 --> 01:02:07,079
Chris Bache: yeah, and it's
really important. I think late

879
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:10,559
in my sessions, I began to feel
it's important for us to

880
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,059
understand the future human that
we are becoming. Imagine if you

881
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:17,999
went into labor and you didn't
know you were pregnant and you

882
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:20,839
didn't understand what was
happening to it be terrifying.

883
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:24,139
Be terribly frightening. And
when we go into this dark period

884
01:02:24,139 --> 01:02:28,159
of history, if we don't have an
understanding that we what's

885
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:31,279
happening, that we are really
giving birth, we could succumb

886
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:34,819
to despair. We could, you know,
we're already seeing all these

887
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:37,579
trauma movies you know about
apocalyptic, this and

888
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:41,979
apocalyptic that we really have
to keep our eye on the horizon.

889
01:02:41,979 --> 01:02:45,519
We have to understand what we're
doing. This is a spiritual

890
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:48,879
transformation. It's a psycho
spiritual transformation.

891
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,800
Unknown: So let's end on the
future. Human tell us what we're

892
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,400
all like.

893
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:00,540
Chris Bache: I can't tell you
what the world will be like, but

894
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:04,980
I can describe my experience of
touching the future human, and

895
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:08,940
several times in the course of
the sessions, I was taken into

896
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:15,120
deep time and given an
opportunity to try on for size,

897
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:20,660
so to speak, the human psyche at
The stage of the future human.

898
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:25,100
And this happened very
powerfully in the 70th session,

899
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:32,180
at the culmination of this long
process, and such a magnificent

900
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:35,900
being, just such an extra
ordinary being. It was so

901
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,560
helpful, having experienced the
death and rebirth of humanity,

902
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,240
having experienced so many
different layers to experience

903
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:48,580
this future, human, magnificent
being, a mind, truly

904
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:52,660
enlightened, mind tuned to the
deep structure of the universe,

905
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:56,740
tuned to the intelligence of the
universe, a heart that was

906
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:00,100
deeply in touch with other human
beings and sensitive to its

907
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,740
history, it's longer history
with other human beings, a heart

908
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,420
which can embrace the entire
planet, a heart which which has

909
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,020
a deep appreciation for the
damage that we've done to the

910
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,380
living systems on this planet
and to the species that are

911
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:22,220
going extinct, and a commitment
to reverse that, to bring

912
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:26,900
forward safe habitat, to
basically restore these systems,

913
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:34,520
but an open heart, an open mind,
a transformed human being,

914
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:38,600
that's what we're that's where
we're going. And I think that

915
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,740
one way of understanding the
great religious saints and sages

916
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,320
of history, to understand
Christ, to understand the

917
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:48,220
Buddha, is all of them,
basically are describing what

918
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:52,600
I'm describing. They're
describing a way of living which

919
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,380
is deeply different than if you
develop your values, basically

920
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,500
only in terms of, you know,
space, time, consciousness,

921
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:03,360
this. Is the Awakened heart, the
awakened mind.

922
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,380
Unknown: Look, there are people
throughout history. You know,

923
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,260
people that have been burned at
the stake, for example, because

924
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:16,320
they had such faith that there
was more than just this physical

925
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,200
incarnation. But you know,
there's been so few of them

926
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,240
throughout history, and to have
a whole planet full of people

927
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:28,280
with this awareness, I think
would be amazing.

928
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:32,540
Chris Bache: I think we are
basically cleaning our psychic

929
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:36,260
basement. We are cleaning the
collective unconscious. We're

930
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:39,860
cleaning our individual
unconscious, and in that

931
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:45,280
process, we are learning how to
create consciously right now, a

932
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,760
lot of our creativity is
unconscious creativity. We're

933
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,960
being dragged around hither
through our own unconscious

934
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,080
conditioning, our own
unconscious history. But in the

935
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:01,020
course of this transformative
process, as we clear our

936
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:05,160
unconscious conditioning as we
clear it collectively, we then

937
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:10,020
begin to be able to manifest our
intelligence in conscious acts

938
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:14,160
of creativity. We will be able
to do extra ordinary things that

939
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:21,140
we can only dream of doing now
in future time, becoming a more

940
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,040
conscious created

941
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,960
Unknown: being you make the
comment that creation is a

942
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:35,120
result of choices. Yes, and so
it's the conscious choices. I

943
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,600
guess, instead of the myriad of
1000s of unconscious choices

944
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,040
that we make every day, that one
of the distinctions will be as

945
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,160
that we will be more conscious
and the choices that we make

946
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,340
Chris Bache: more conscious of
the choices we make. I think

947
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:51,760
part of how the word system
works is we're in a living

948
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:57,520
universe. We're in a dynamic
universe, and we make a choice,

949
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:02,340
and the universe responds to
that choice by triggering a

950
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:07,560
series of events. I don't mean
to be superficial in describing

951
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:11,760
how this process works. There's
layers and layers to it, but in

952
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,820
the beginning, our understanding
is incomplete, and there's a lot

953
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:21,620
of ignorance in our choices, and
we inherit the consequences of

954
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:26,000
ignorant choices. And in this
process, we learn. We think, for

955
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,720
example, we can hurt somebody
else without hurting ourselves,

956
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:34,160
and we inherit the karma of that
act in order to learn that we

957
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,660
are all actually embedded in
each other's lives. We are all

958
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:43,000
leaves on the same tree so that
we make wiser choices, you know,

959
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:48,460
more conscious choices, and we
begin to make choices that are

960
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,640
not at the expense of other
beings, but actually enhance the

961
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,240
well being of other beings. And
that generates its own kind of

962
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:59,320
feedback cycles in our life.
It's not to oversimplify it, but

963
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,680
the dynamics are basically
there,

964
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:08,280
Unknown: and it feels good. You
know? I know that when I make

965
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,540
somebody else life feel better,
it feels good. And I'm surprised

966
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:16,980
at how little, or, you know,
that goes on, you know, it's

967
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:21,320
like, it's just amazing to me,
because it's good for me, it's

968
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,260
good for them, it's good for
everything. But anyway, we'll

969
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,400
get there. It sounds like

970
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,760
Chris Bache: Chris, we will. I
think we will. Kindness feels

971
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:33,500
good. Courage feels good.
Generosity feels good. Truth

972
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,700
feels good. You know, it's not
to say, you know it's it's hard

973
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,960
to make the right choices and
challenging circumstances. It's

974
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,840
hard when you're not getting
what you think you should have

975
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,440
to basically give what you have
a way to share what you have

976
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,160
with someone in need. But it
feels good, and it takes us in

977
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,500
the right direction Absolutely.

978
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,500
Unknown: Well. Thank you so
much, my dear for spending this

979
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:02,160
time with me. I really have
appreciated it. And as I said at

980
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,480
the beginning, I really have a
much more hopeful perspective

981
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:10,440
now for the future, and I'm not
so scared as death of death.

982
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:16,440
Good reading this. I'm like, if
Chris can do it, I can do it

983
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,700
absolutely.

984
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:23,060
Chris Bache: You know this,
there is nothing I drop out a

985
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:26,720
lot of the personal aspects of
my journey in the book, I'm

986
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,080
really only interested in the
larger, universal aspects and

987
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,500
the collective aspects and the
cosmic, logical aspects. What's

988
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,920
important is not that I had
these experiences. What's

989
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,800
important is that these
experiences are available for

990
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,580
all of us to have, and they give
us some insight to the

991
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:46,420
background textures of our
lives. That's what's important.

992
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,380
As a philosopher, I think that's
the important thing. I've really

993
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:53,140
enjoyed our conversation.
Vanessa, I really thank you for

994
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,920
the opportunity to have this
time with you and for your for

995
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,300
your viewers.

996
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,080
Unknown: Thank you so much. My
love. You. Have a wonderful day.

997
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:01,200
You.

00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,180
today. LSD, in the mind of the
universe. We'll begin shortly,

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,060
but I first wanted to mention
that we're recording this

and the speakers to be

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,600
determined, but it's going to be
similar to today. Chris was nice

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,220
enough to do a pre presentation
of what he's going to talk about

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,200
at the future human conference
in May and San Diego. Earth girl

and equipment. And you can make
that donation as they go into

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:13,380
call.org I want to introduce
Chris, so as you've heard, he's

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,760
going to be keynote presented
the upcoming icon conference,

27
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,920
the future human. Chris is a
professor emeritus in the

28
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,300
Department of Philosophy and
Religion Religious Studies at

29
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,680
Youngstown State University,
where he taught for 33 years.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,960
He's also adjunct faculty at the
California Institute of integral

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,400
studies and at the Noetic
Sciences Institute and also on

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,140
the Advisory Council of
Stanislav Grof legacy training.

33
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,620
One might ask, how does a boy
raised in the deep south that is

34
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,580
Vicksburg, Mississippi, who was
raised Roman Catholic and

35
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,840
actually entered the seminary to
become a priest write a book

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,740
about his 20 year journey with
LSD. It appears that Chris's

37
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:19,380
devotion to transformation
appeared relatively early, just

38
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,580
as he was receiving his degree
from Notre Dame's theology

39
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,120
department, and he was awarded
an excellent Award for

40
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,880
Excellence. He decided to leave
Catholicism. This radical

41
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,920
transformation occurred again at
Brown University. Halfway

42
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,440
through his doctoral program, he
realized that he had gotten what

43
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,660
he wanted from biblical studies
and his and in his words, I

44
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,900
changed horses and began again.
Those of us in integral studies

45
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,380
recognize this fidelity to what
wants to emerge, although we may

46
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:08,040
not always have the courage for
radical transformations, Chris

47
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,100
is now fashion himself into a
philosopher of religion. He

48
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,640
settled into Youngstown
University, where he would teach

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,840
for the next 33 years. Along the
way, another transformation was

50
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,440
pending. Chris red, Stanislav
Grof, work on work on the use of

51
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,280
psychedelics in psychotherapy,
the non, non dogmatic influences

52
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,460
of Buddhism and Huston Smith
perennialism, we know an

53
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,520
integral soon followed. Chris
ended his psychedelic

54
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,460
explorations in 1999 and it
wasn't until 2009 he wrote his

55
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,360
first book, The living classroom
here he shared. How his

56
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,580
expansive consciousness seemed
to impact his students in what

57
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:12,540
he called leaky boundaries.
Again, those of us in integral

58
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,900
recognize the psychoactive
effect presencing has upon

59
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:27,740
others in 2019 he wrote LSD in
the mind of the universe,

60
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,780
diamonds from heaven, some of
which he'll share today and at

61
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,240
the conference. Please give
Chris Bache a warm sand Eagle,

62
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
integral welcome.

63
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,040
Chris Bache: John, thank you
everyone. It's a pleasure to be

64
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:56,380
here with you tonight. Since i
My understanding is that

65
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,320
psychedelics is not a frequent
topic in the integral community

66
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,420
in the San Diego, integral
community. So in talking with

67
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,520
Kathy and Tom and people on your
board and we decided that would

68
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,060
begin with a short break out
before I talk, before I say

69
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,220
anything, just to do a quick
inventory together of what each

70
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,380
each each of your backgrounds is
with psychedelics, both in terms

71
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,560
of whether you have any
psychedelic experience and if

72
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,240
you have what have you had it
with? What context real short

73
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,460
and the second part is, what
kind of beliefs have you formed

74
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,140
about psychedelics, either from
your own experience or from your

75
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,740
reading or conversations with
other people. So both, what is

76
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,680
your the nature of your
experience, and what are your

77
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,580
beliefs and perceptions about
psychedelics? So we do it

78
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,560
before, and then after I talk,
we'll do an after, okay, so just

79
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,400
about 10 minutes, and Kathy will
break you up into groups. Kathy,

80
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,340
Unknown: breakout sessions are
not recorded.

81
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,480
Chris Bache: Okay, is everybody
back? Yeah, I think we're back.

82
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,280
We're all back. Okay, I sure
wish I didn't want to encroach

83
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,060
on your freedom. I didn't want
to be part of the groups. I

84
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,120
wanted you to have complete
freedom, to be able to say what

85
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,120
was on your mind. But I sure
wish I could have been on the

86
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,020
fly on the wall, and heard your
answers to the questions. Maybe

87
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,620
when we get a little farther
down the line this evening in

88
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,780
dialog, you know, I can learn
what some of your answers were

89
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,820
to the questions. So All right,
so we've kind of looked at our

90
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,360
history in terms of our own
experience with psychedelics,

91
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,300
and what our own beliefs
positive, negative or neutral

92
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,220
around psychedelics, and now I'm
just going to jump in and take

93
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,180
you on a ride, take you, give
you an overview of my work that

94
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,500
I've reported in my book, LSD,
in the mind of the universe. So

95
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,940
let me share a screen here.
First of all, let me ask first,

96
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,480
how many people have read my
book? Just perfectly, okay, if

97
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,480
you haven't, how many people
have just wondering? Okay, good.

98
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,700
All right. Good to know. All
right. Let me see if I can share

99
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,720
my screen.

100
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Unknown: Okay, and this just
confirming we can see your

101
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,540
screen.

102
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,400
Chris Bache: You can see good.
Am I saying? Whoop, supposed to

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,180
go back. All right, okay,
somehow I wish I could get the

104
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,220
whole screen to show Okay,

105
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,740
Tom Habib: so

106
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,180
Chris Bache: I'm an unusual
person in that I've been a

107
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,780
university professor all my
life, a professor of religious

108
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,420
studies, teaching in a small
college, State College in

109
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,720
Northeast Ohio, and I've also
done one of the longest regimens

110
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,980
of high dose LSD work that I'm
aware of in the background. I

111
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,100
couldn't talk about it until
after I retired, because the

112
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,820
good state of Ohio, the citizens
of Ohio don't like their

113
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,140
university professors doing
massive doses of LSD on the

114
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,140
weekends. But so the hardest
thing about trying to introduce

115
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,280
my work for the first time is
how long it lasted and how many

116
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,840
layers of consciousness I
accessed in the process of this

117
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,200
long, 20 year journey. And I
think that many of our

118
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,460
expectations about where
psychedelics can take us or

119
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,440
should take us have been shaped
by accounts based on a very

120
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:01,080
small data set. For example,
when all. Aldous Huxley wrote

121
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,060
his very important book, doors
of the perception in 1954 he had

122
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,400
taken Mescaline only one time,
and he took psychedelics only a

123
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,160
total of 10 times in his life.
Similarly, when Huston Smith, of

124
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,980
the great historian of religion,
wrote his book, cleansing the

125
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,960
doors of perception. He had
taken LSD only six times after

126
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,220
that, he said the bummers
increased, and that led him to

127
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,660
take Alan Watts's advice, when
you get the message, hang up the

128
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,720
phone. But notice this gives a
sense that you do psychedelics,

129
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,400
you get the message, that's it.
That's what it's about. And my

130
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,240
book is what happens if you
don't hang up the phone. But

131
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,020
moving on, we go to Michael
Pollan's very influential book,

132
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,620
how to change your mind. And
Michael had taken psychedelics

133
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,020
only about a half dozen times by
the time he wrote this book,

134
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,900
other developments have tended
to give us a sort of a shortened

135
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,820
metaphysical horizon in terms of
what we can expect to experience

136
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,820
with psychedelics. For example,
the psychedelic renaissance

137
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,740
right now is focused on
exploring the capacity of

138
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,720
psychedelics to heal the wounds
of the personal psyche with your

139
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,020
untouched with the the
psychedelic literature, it's

140
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,220
dominated by the studies which
are demonstrating psychedelics

141
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,020
various capacities to heal the
wounds of life, Whether it's

142
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,300
post traumatic stress or
depression or addiction, we're

143
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,100
finding they're very powerful,
but this tends to focus us on

144
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,160
the horizon of the personal
unconscious, a second use of

145
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,180
psychedelics, different but
similar, is using psychedelics

146
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,580
for spiritual awakening, as we
see in this anthology zigzag

147
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,120
Zen, which is a discussion
between the psychedelic

148
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,500
community and the Buddhist
community on the relevance of

149
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,760
psychedelics for spiritual
awakening. But still, we're

150
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,180
still thinking in terms of a
kind of an individual level,

151
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,680
individual spiritual
enlightenment. These two

152
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,160
categories, the therapeutic and
the spiritual awakening, these

153
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,600
are the major kind of topics
that come up for discussion, I

154
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,980
think, in today's psychedelic
Renaissance. And my work is

155
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,520
different than this. I was
trained as a philosopher of

156
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,320
religion. I'm not a therapist,
I'm not a psychotherapist, not a

157
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,760
psychologist. I primarily was
interested, have been interested

158
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,680
in the philosophical potential
of psychedelics. So my work

159
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,700
really falls into a third
category, where the project is

160
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,740
cosmological exploration, not
healing, not really aiming at

161
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,140
awakening, but using these deep,
Non-ordinary states to explore

162
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:10,380
the deep structure of reality,
my work descends or derives from

163
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,520
Stan Grof. I was just out of
graduate school, and I

164
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,120
encountered this book by Stan,
realms of the human unconscious,

165
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,120
which was followed by HIS Manual
LSD psychotherapy. And of

166
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,560
course, all the dozen or 15 or
so books had followed very

167
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,880
important works. And in these
two early works, Stan clearly

168
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,680
differentiates between low dose
psycholytic therapy and high

169
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,140
dose psychedelic therapy, a very
different therapeutic regimen,

170
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,460
psychelytic, healing the
unconscious, layer by layer,

171
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,820
like an onion, psychedelic,
trying to generate a

172
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,720
breakthrough. One maximum,
supreme dose kind of approach

173
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,980
here, the Spring Grove Hospital
was working with terminally ill

174
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,540
patients, trying to trigger
something approximating a

175
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,440
Near-Death Experience, to give
them a glimpse of where they

176
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,280
were going when they died. But
the psychedelic therapy was

177
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,460
limited to three doses, three
sessions, so you have low dose,

178
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,840
many sessions, psychedelic, very
few. I came along in 1978 and I

179
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,620
thought, well, if you could do
psychedelic therapy three times,

180
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,060
you could probably do it safely
more than three times. So, for

181
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,560
various reasons, I chose to work
in a psychedelic therapy

182
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,120
protocol. And in the end,
between 1979 and 1999 I did 73

183
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:49,060
high dose LSD sessions. Actually
I did three moderate doses, but

184
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,100
then I did all high

185
00:14:52,899 --> 00:15:00,119
Unknown: and you see bottom.
Yeah.

186
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,740
Chris Bache: Okay, so I just say
73 high dose sessions. And I did

187
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,700
this in a very rigorous fashion,
following Stan's protocol. In my

188
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,780
case, I used the same protocol,
same set and setting, same

189
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,480
substance, same dose level, same
sitter, same recording process

190
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,280
and same location. I tried to
standardize all the variables as

191
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,800
much as possible so as to ensure
clean and consistent recurring

192
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,740
contact with the deep structure
of deeper levels of

193
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,620
consciousness. And when I got to
the end of my journey and was

194
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,240
trying to organize the sessions
into the narrative that I put

195
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,720
into the book. I began to
realize that this really was a

196
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,900
very different undertaking than
psychedelic therapy. I was

197
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,020
dealing with a number of
different issues that don't come

198
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,980
up in psychedelic therapy, and
so I felt the new terminology

199
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,960
was required, and so I call my
protocol psychedelic

200
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,280
exploration. It's not really
therapeutic in its agenda. It's

201
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,420
psychedelic therapy in its tech,
in its techniques. It's high

202
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:18,720
dose, isolated, shade, sitter,
music, whole thing. But it is

203
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,740
more than three doses. It's my
case, 73 and the project in

204
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,540
psychedelic exploration is
cosmological exploration. It's

205
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,300
not primarily healing, though
there was a great deal of

206
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,960
healing. It's not primarily
spiritual awakening. It is

207
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:42,760
exploring the deep structure of
the universe. So I kept very

208
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,120
detailed records of everything
going through. Even looked at

209
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,020
some of the astrological
variables. Kept records of every

210
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:58,300
session made within 24 hours of
the session itself. And what I'm

211
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,940
writing about in LSD, in the
mind of the universe is not

212
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,420
primarily my personal story. I
mean, it's all personal, of

213
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,500
course, and I own it. But these
lines represent a series of

214
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,580
sessions, and the small circles
represent what's taking place in

215
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,120
the beginning and ending of a
session. The large circles are

216
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,940
what's taking place during the
peak hours of the session, and

217
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,680
LSD in the mind of the universe,
is basically describing what

218
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,720
took place in the peak hours of
the sessions over the course of

219
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,000
73 sessions. It's primarily a
cosmological narrative. It's not

220
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,760
a therapeutic narrative. I drop
out a lot of the a lot of the

221
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,720
examples of personal healing or
personal insights which were

222
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,660
given to me before, at the
beginning and ending of the

223
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,140
sessions. But when I was
operating in the peak session, I

224
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,400
was usually operating far beyond
personal reality, the personal

225
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,720
segment, and that's the part
that I think has the most

226
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,420
important philosophical
relevance called the

227
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:09,900
cosmological relevance. So just
to give you one more important

228
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,500
concept before we turn to
looking at the book itself, it's

229
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,400
what I call the spiral of death
and rebirth. Everything below

230
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,320
this line is time and space and
our ordinary consciousness above

231
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,620
the line, Transpersonal
consciousness, the drop at the

232
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,740
bottom of this, what my students
sometimes would call the

233
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,340
pantyhose model of
consciousness. This drop

234
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,180
represents egoic consciousness,
our time, space, identity,

235
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,380
everything above the line, in
the in the between the blue

236
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,960
lines represents various orders
of Transpersonal consciousness.

237
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,680
And of course, to make a
transition from our egoic space

238
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,540
time identity into spiritual
reality, involves going through

239
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:59,260
some type of death of self or
ego death, in order to basically

240
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,880
let the programming of our time,
space, identity, be dissolved or

241
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,080
be shattered or be melted, so
that we can enter into deeper

242
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,880
states of consciousness. And
while Ego Death gets a lot of

243
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,900
the attention in the therapeutic
literature, and appropriately so

244
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,860
in my journey Ego Death turned
out to be only one of a number

245
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,840
of deaths that took place at
different levels of the journey,

246
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,840
and this is what I call the
spiral of death and rebirth.

247
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,820
What I found is that when you're
entering a deeper level of

248
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,400
Transpersonal consciousness, you
have to go through a death and

249
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,600
rebirth. Even after ego death,
you go through multiple layers

250
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,160
of deaths and rebirths. And the
nature of that death is very

251
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,960
it's tricky to describe because
it's it's a type of death and

252
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,620
rebirth that takes place far
beyond egoic consciousness, far

253
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,880
beyond. On anything to do with
space, time, consciousness, and

254
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,520
it changes as the adventure
deepens. And here I use Dan and

255
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,020
Ken Wilber categories of
psychic, subtle and causal

256
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,560
reality to describe some of
these levels. I don't have any

257
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,540
vested interest in a particular
cosmology, a particular

258
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,080
identifying of levels, or rating
of levels. This is basically

259
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,940
just to indicate a pattern. And
the pattern is there many levels

260
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,440
of consciousness in spiritual
reality, and you go through many

261
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,940
levels of death and rebirth in
if you access these levels of

262
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,580
consciousness in a systematic
fashion. And this is why I am

263
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,080
emphasize the standardization of
the protocol in my work. Because

264
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,640
I think the more standardized
our protocol, the more we

265
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,160
basically return to the same
membrane, the same platform of

266
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,720
interface between our individual
consciousness in this larger

267
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,460
consciousness, and it makes, in
my case, it led to a perpetual

268
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,200
deepening of the experience, a
perpetual series of initiations

269
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,440
and entering into deeper
communion with the creative

270
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,800
intelligence of the universe.
Now, when I got to the end of my

271
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,500
journey, was working on
preparing for the book, doing

272
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,080
the book, identified five areas,
or cluster areas, or levels of

273
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,500
consciousness that my
experiences kind of could be

274
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,120
grouped in. So here are the five
levels that stand out for me.

275
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:44,260
One is the level of personal
mind, collective mind, or our

276
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:54,940
species mind, archetypal mind,
causal oneness and diamond

277
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,320
Luminosity. So what I'd like to
do is simply go through and

278
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,360
throw up the the chapter titles
of the book, and organize them

279
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,200
according to these levels of
consciousness, and give you a

280
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,860
quick overview, a quick
thumbnail of just some of the

281
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,580
stages of this journey. This is
extremely frustrating for me to

282
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,780
do, because just to convey
adequately, the content of one

283
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,860
deep psychedelic experience is
very challenging and would take

284
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,720
a while. Juliana of Norwich, the
great British mystic, spent

285
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,660
decades digesting one particular
transpiritual Near Death episode

286
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,020
experience that she had, and to
try to summarize 20 years of

287
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,660
such experiences is is
challenging, especially. And I

288
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,020
should have mentioned this
before. I was working at 500 to

289
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,400
600 micrograms, which is right
at the peak of what the body's

290
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,640
tolerance is, in terms of you
don't get higher if you take

291
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,500
more. So I was working with very
high doses. And this is a

292
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,400
protocol I do not recommend
today. If I were doing it myself

293
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,660
again over I would do it
differently. I'd be much gentler

294
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,800
on myself. But nevertheless,
this is what I did, and this is

295
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:19,500
where we went. So let me just go
through them. First, the level

296
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,280
of personal mind. This is a
chapter called crossing the

297
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,600
boundary of birth and death.
This is what Stan Grof calls the

298
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,140
crossing the perinatal level of
consciousness, level of

299
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,980
consciousness, between our time,
space, identity and spiritual

300
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,600
reality. It involves
confrontations with death, lots

301
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,460
of fetal sensations, often
reliving one's birth,

302
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:50,320
very extreme, facing deep
alienation. The question is

303
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,620
whether life has any meaning
whatsoever, because everyone we

304
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,100
know and everything we know and
everyone we love is going to be

305
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,720
dead, including ourselves. How
can there be any meaning in a

306
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,280
universe where everything of
value dies, which eventually

307
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,060
culminates in our time, space,
identity, our ego, death,

308
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,580
identity, being turned inside
out. And for me, this took about

309
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,660
10 sessions and two and a half
years of work until eventually

310
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,920
the universe got me to a point
where it just snapped me like a

311
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,700
twig. It turned me into the
exact opposite of everything I'd

312
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,540
ever known myself to be, and
radically expanded the

313
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,640
boundaries of my awareness. I
thought I was a male, white

314
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,240
university professor concerned
with the meaning of existence.

315
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,120
It turned me into hundreds of
women, women of color, women who

316
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,680
had no interest in philosophy or
the meaning of existence. And it

317
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,460
just snapped me. It forced me.
It just snapped me. And the

318
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,100
message was, where you are
going. Gender does not exist.

319
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,740
Let go. And of course, the
problem. Was not women or

320
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,060
education or anything like that.
The problem was the tight role

321
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,380
that my social identity had on
me that was confining the limits

322
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:16,200
of my experience. After I let go
and surrendered, I was taken

323
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,620
under the arm of the Great
Mother and given a wonderful,

324
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,680
long, many our journey into the
world of women, becoming

325
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:31,340
hundreds of women in all sorts
of life circumstances. And then

326
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,320
the Kant journey continued. The
next several sessions come under

327
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,620
the category of collective mind,
ego, mind, excuse me, species

328
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:49,540
mine now working at these dose
levels. The way I worked, my

329
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,620
experience was that more or less
every session began with the

330
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,100
first portion of the session
being a purification,

331
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,340
detoxification process, the
dying process. The second

332
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,320
portion of the session being a a
transcendent experience, an

333
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,620
ecstatic experience,
Transpersonal teaching,

334
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:18,060
instruction and so on. The first
half of the next year of

335
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,160
session, I entered a domain that
I came to call the ocean of

336
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,400
suffering. I was repeatedly and
systematically emerged in a

337
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,120
collective anguish that
shattered all my frames of

338
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,240
reference. It completely dwarfed
the previous phase. I entered a

339
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,580
domain that expanded to
encompass the entire history of

340
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,680
the human species. The dying in
this don't level was almost

341
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,840
entirely collective. The
surrender was the or that the

342
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,400
surrender that was demanded was
the ordeal of repeatedly opening

343
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,860
to the sheer normity and
savagery of the ocean of pain

344
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,400
that I was encountering. I did
not understand what was

345
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,680
happening, but for several hours
in every session, and then I

346
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,500
would get into this ocean of
suffering, and then I would be

347
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,220
spun into what I'll describe in
a minute. At first I thought

348
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,100
this represented a deepening of
my ego death. But it went on for

349
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,360
so long, and it involves so many
1000s of people that I

350
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,600
eventually came to a very
different conclusion. And this

351
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,720
is really the major theme of my
second book, dark night, early

352
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,000
dawn. And that is, I think what
happened is in my sessions, and

353
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,120
in many of our sessions, when we
reach this level the universe

354
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,400
used my sessions not to heal me
or not to try to enlighten me,

355
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,860
but to heal some aspect of
humanity at large, to heal some

356
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,060
aspect of the collective psyche.
And just as an individual

357
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,340
internalizes trauma in their
unconscious, which then distorts

358
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,500
their well being. The human
species likewise internalizes

359
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,740
all the trauma of history
anything is not resolved by the

360
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,240
end of our individual lifetimes.
The species internalizes all the

361
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,660
trauma from all the wars and all
the deaths and all the droughts

362
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,640
and all the hunger, and it
aggregates in the collective

363
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,700
psyche, distorting the
functioning of the collective

364
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,200
psyche, and in these unusual,
highly expanded, amplified

365
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,120
states of consciousness, I think
what happens is we open up to

366
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,360
the depths of the collective
unconscious, and in that

367
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,440
process, we have an opportunity
to take on and experience some

368
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,340
of the depths of these terrible
memories, and in that process,

369
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:54,520
lift them from the collective
psyche. Now, when I went through

370
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,300
each stage, each day of the
collective ocean of suffering in

371
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,700
the first year, in the second
half of the session, I entered

372
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,100
what I came to call deep time in
the soul. For seven sessions an

373
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:14,520
entire year, I entered a reality
where I experienced my entire

374
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,920
life from beginning to end as a
completed whole. I moved beyond

375
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,500
linear time, not into eternity.
In between linear time and

376
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,100
eternity, there are many
modalities of time and these, I

377
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,700
came to call deep time, where
you could experience different

378
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,960
spans of time as simultaneously
present, or you could experience

379
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,600
time speeding up or moving into
evolutionary speed, so to speak.

380
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,700
For one year, I experienced my
life in all of its moments, from

381
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,960
start to finish, as
simultaneously present now. It

382
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,660
was a very powerful distillation
of my life's work, of who I was

383
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,020
being doing this work with what
my life was about, the. Years,

384
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,920
and at this point I ended. This
represented four years of work

385
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,060
and about 1817, sessions. And at
this point I stopped my work for

386
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:17,220
six years for reasons that I go
into in the book. Six years

387
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,340
later, I started my work again,
and when I did, the ocean of

388
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,500
suffering began exactly where it
was, where it had stopped six

389
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,920
years before. So there was a
year of the ocean of suffering

390
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,700
before my six year break, and a
year of the ocean of suffering

391
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,020
after that six year break. And
the precision with which this

392
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,640
started again and kept getting
deeper and deeper and deeper is

393
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,240
a measure, I think, an indicator
of the magnitude and precision

394
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:55,000
of the intelligence which was
guiding these sessions in the

395
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,840
positive side, once I went
through the ocean of suffering

396
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,480
in this next year of session, I
entered a domain of

397
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,140
consciousness which took me
radically beyond anything to do

398
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,820
with my personal reality, into
the universe, the mind of the

399
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,020
universe. In the section I call
initiation into the universe,

400
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,680
different time of life,
different expectations,

401
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,200
different astrological transits
deep into the belly of the

402
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,240
universe. I was given a series
of carefully orchestrated

403
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:36,680
teachings, initiations into the
cosmic order of things. Now I

404
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,340
always give all my sessions a
name, just simply as a mnemonic

405
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,020
device, I write down my
sessions. I put them down on

406
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,260
bullet points. I give them a
name in order to help me

407
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,620
remember, because I want to
remember my entire journey all

408
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,180
at once. The names help me here
are the names of the sessions

409
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,620
that I present in this chapter,
initiation into the universe.

410
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:07,588
You can see, just from the
nature of the names, how

411
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:14,788
profoundly Transpersonal these
experiences were and frustrating

412
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:18,148
not to be able to tell you more
about them, but I just can't.

413
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:23,780
There's not time a deep
excursion in like cosmology, 101

414
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,880
how the universe works at a
fundamental level.

415
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,060
When the ocean of suffering came
to a culmination in the 24th

416
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,080
session healing the collective
wound, there was sort of a an

417
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,240
orgy of feeding on the pain. And
it reached a culmination, and I

418
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,220
was spun into a level of reality
that I came to understand as

419
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:55,960
archetypal reality. And I
discussed this phase of the work

420
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,560
in the chapter, the greater real
of archetypal reality. This

421
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:08,100
lasted about 11 sessions and one
and a half years, and every time

422
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:13,980
I entered this reality, I
entered a level of reality that

423
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,000
was more real than space time.
It's a very disorienting

424
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,860
experience at first, but every
time I went there, I was

425
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,420
engaging something that was more
real than space, time and also

426
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,980
ancient. It was just ancient
beyond imagination. Time worked

427
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,760
at a completely different scale.
There a completely different

428
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,140
order of reality. I felt like
Plato's prisoner having climbed

429
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,180
out of the cave, entering in a
little more level, a more real

430
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:47,860
level of reality in the universe
than my own existence in space

431
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:54,100
time. When I began to enter
archetypal reality, I went

432
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,720
through a death process in which
I began I had to die as a human

433
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,660
being, per se, that I found that
there is a level of identity

434
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,220
that we hold in our psyche
simply by virtue of being a

435
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,700
human being. It's more
fundamental than than ego

436
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,800
identity and to go through
species ego death or to slough

437
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,380
off your entire history as a
human species and all the

438
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,400
cognitive parameters that go
with being a member of the human

439
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,480
species is a deeper form of
surrendering to the great

440
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,800
unknown than simply letting go
of your individual egoic

441
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:41,020
identity. The transition to was
to very, very high levels of

442
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,580
energy. I learned in the process
that high levels, deep levels of

443
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,660
consciousness represent are
driven by high levels of energy.

444
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,560
The deeper you go, the higher
the energy. And if you want to

445
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,960
have abiding, stable experiences
in these levels of reality, you

446
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,160
must go through the.
Purification, detoxification

447
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,680
process that allows you to
maintain clear cognition at

448
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,860
these deep levels of reality,
and that means adjusting

449
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,280
submitting yourself to these
levels of energy, which in my

450
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,760
case, had the flavor of white
hot lava flows, exploding sun

451
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,260
flares, liquid fire pouring
through me, changing me

452
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:35,420
completely. Now I would
experience archetypal reality as

453
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:40,280
completing two levels. One is
kind of the Platonic type level

454
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,680
where I experience principles
are beings. I don't really want

455
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,500
to call them beings, because
that makes them sound too

456
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:53,680
compact. More principles, cosmic
principles that were clearly the

457
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,520
constitutive principles
responsible for creating space,

458
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,200
time and some of the structures
in space and time, but they were

459
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,940
so large, so vast, I could not
wrap my mind around them. The

460
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,320
best my mind could do to giving
them some type of semblance of

461
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,380
form is that I saw them as
galaxies, hundreds of light

462
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,840
years across. But galaxies very
vast, moving on a different

463
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,520
order of scale than our small
solar system. So I spent some

464
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,060
time there, and then I also
spent some time in experiencing

465
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,140
at what you might think of as a
more Jungian level, the living

466
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,780
tissue of our species. I was
given the experience over and

467
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:47,440
over again, of experiencing our
species as a single being, a

468
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,160
single mind, and each of us
ourselves within this mind,

469
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,360
fractal iterations within this
mind, and even each of our

470
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,860
bodies cell within the
collective body, so that there

471
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,520
was nothing private about our
existence, neither our personal

472
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,900
psychological issues or our
physical issues, our diseases,

473
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,280
all of them were in a back and
forth process, osmotic process,

474
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,760
between the individual and the
species as a whole.

475
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,239
Tom Habib: Bruce, can I ask a
question here, sure. So, I mean,

476
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:27,139
this is a really good point
where you are right now, because

477
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:31,639
in the book you mentioned, you
know how we're being guided

478
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:38,119
gently, that when we have deep,
subtle intuition or something in

479
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,519
creativity, would it be correct
to say it's either these cosmic

480
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:47,139
principles or the council of the
elders influencing our

481
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,419
development now that we're not
alone,

482
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,740
Chris Bache: we are absolutely
not alone. The universe is the

483
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,840
hyper intelligent, hyper
conscious, hyper compassionate,

484
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,540
hyper wisdom we it infuses us
every minute of the day, whether

485
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,560
we're paying attention to it or
not taking advantage of it or

486
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,060
not. But if we tune into it, if
we step away from our narrow

487
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,980
focus and tune into deeper
levels of our consciousness,

488
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,900
which then open into subtler and
subtler levels of consciousness.

489
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,100
One does receive help, one
receives healing and advice and

490
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,420
insight. And these can these
come from multiple potential

491
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,180
levels of consciousness. And so
I would hesitate to identify a

492
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,340
source that they would come
from. It's more a matter of an

493
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,140
infinitely deep source that you
can draw from at multiple

494
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,440
different levels. Yeah. So a

495
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,460
Tom Habib: lot of integral
people they're aware of in a

496
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,800
moment of creativity connection,
that somehow they become a

497
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,100
vehicle for what wants to be
expressed Absolutely. So that's

498
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,820
an alignment.

499
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,300
Chris Bache: Yeah, a deep
alignment. You just become

500
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,500
transparent. I mean, basically
when you drop underneath your

501
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,640
personal identity, when you kind
of pierce the membrane and pop

502
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,700
the bubble and drop beneath that
and then into the mind of the of

503
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,940
the species, and beneath that,
into the different levels of the

504
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,660
creative mind. You you become
transparent. The joy is that in

505
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:38,180
becoming chunyata Empty, empty
of self, becoming transparent. I

506
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,100
like that translation of
Shunyata transparent, you become

507
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,960
transparent to these deeper
orders of awareness that then

508
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,540
kind of come through you. They
they they nourish you with

509
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,200
healing, with love and with
insight and creativity.

510
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:04,380
Tom Habib: Yeah. Oh, what? Final
comment, yeah, is whatever this

511
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,260
intelligence is in the universe
is grooming us to participate in

512
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,460
this intelligence.

513
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,960
Chris Bache: Grooming is might
be a little strong, but I

514
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,920
understand I want to say yes,
but I might sort of choose

515
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,940
different more words than
grooming, but it and we are of

516
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:31,580
the same stuff. It is large. We
are small relatively speaking,

517
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,520
but we are of the same part of
the same stuff, and we are

518
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,880
always in communion with each
other. So it's more like older

519
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,080
brother, younger brother, older
sister, younger sister. I think

520
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,440
of the spiritual universe.
Dwayne Elgin talks about it as

521
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,700
the mother universe, and time
space is the daughter universe.

522
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,120
And so naturally, there's a
relationship between mother and

523
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,160
daughter. You wouldn't say the
mother is grooming the daughter,

524
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,780
but the mother brings the
daughter along. Yeah, yeah,

525
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,040
okay,

526
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,320
I began to have experiences at
this level of reincarnation as a

527
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,600
collective process, I had
experiences in which I witnessed

528
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:34,040
the entire planet and the entire
species reincarnating in a pulse

529
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,320
that moved through history. So I
had written my book. My first

530
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,480
book was on reincarnation, and
so I was I construed

531
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,920
reincarnation classically the
way it's usually construed, as a

532
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,360
story of the soul's journey
toward enlightenment, lifetime

533
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,600
by lifetime, making progress,
making clearing mistakes, so on,

534
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,020
so forth. But it was an
individual journey. We're all on

535
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,300
individual journeys. And here
instead, I was dissolved into

536
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,580
the species as the entire
species went into an

537
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,980
intelligent, articulate
collective karma, though that is

538
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,780
too crude a phrase, an
intelligence that was growing

539
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,300
itself generation by generation,
generation by generation, and

540
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,220
somehow all of our individual
soul projects fit inside,

541
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:32,780
beautifully, magnificently
inside this collective soul

542
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:39,140
project. Now here are the names
of the sessions that I address

543
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,580
in this particular chapter. I
won't go into them, but except

544
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,640
to mention, notice how much
cleansing is still taking place

545
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,440
at this pretty advanced level.
Session 28 was a very deep

546
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,040
session. It was an archetypal
meltdown. It threw me very

547
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,140
briefly into the next higher
level of consciousness, a very,

548
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,100
extremely pure, clean,
crystalline level of

549
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,180
consciousness. And even though I
was only in that reality for a

550
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,320
number of minutes, I think it
triggered a cleansing, a

551
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:18,720
detoxification that lasted six
months and three sessions, just

552
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:24,320
an ordeal of just cleansing and
cleansing and cleansing. Hard to

553
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,700
describe the cleansing because
it's, it's not matter personal

554
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,600
history. It's partly biological,
it's partly emotional. It's,

555
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,120
it's partly subtle energy. It's
just a radical cleansing, in

556
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,820
order to allow me to come back
into that highly pure, highly

557
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,680
refined energy with clear
cognition, which took place by

558
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:54,460
the 32nd and 33rd session and
then continued into the next

559
00:43:54,460 --> 00:44:01,620
year of a year that I describe
in that book called the

560
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:09,660
benediction of blessings. This
was an extraordinary year after

561
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:16,560
archetype of reality, in which I
was given just a series of one

562
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,200
extraordinary, Transpersonal
blessing after another. These

563
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,760
are the four sessions that
covering a year's work that I

564
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,460
address in the book, The forest
was an experience of oneness and

565
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,080
no self. Shunyata, emptiness of
self, no self in me, no self

566
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,560
anywhere in the world. A
universal force running through

567
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:44,140
the forest, not can not caring
at all whether it's animating a

568
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:48,280
pine tree or an oak tree. Deep
experience of oneness and

569
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,360
oneness and emptiness are two
sides of the same coin. Yeah,

570
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,780
when you experience deep
oneness, it's immediately

571
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,260
obvious that there is no
separate self anywhere in the

572
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,340
world. We. Are all
interdependent and intertwined.

573
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,400
And when you experience deep no
self, then oneness, the oneness

574
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,940
of life, manifests spontaneous.
It's just they, they go hand in

575
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,200
hand, singing the universe away
was an experience, a deep

576
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,440
experience, of the void, the
primal void out of which the

577
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,260
universe springs. Jesus's blood
was an experience of cosmic

578
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,060
love, being loved more deeply
than I've ever known love in my

579
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:35,060
life, just overwhelming
immersion in cosmic love, in the

580
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,520
birth of the diamond soul. I
just want to mention this

581
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,480
because it'll come up later. How
to put this succinctly, it was a

582
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,280
I experienced all of my former
lives coming into me, just like

583
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,220
wrapping string around a kite
spool, just coming back very

584
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,420
fast. And I had done three years
of past life hypnotherapy, and I

585
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,840
had a pretty good sense of some
of my former lives, but they

586
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,140
came back very quickly, and they
reached a point where they

587
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,880
seemed to hit a critical mass
and they fused. And when they

588
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,320
fused, there was an enormous
explosion, and the diamond light

589
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,880
broke out of my chest and
catapulted me into a very high

590
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,080
and subtle state of
consciousness in which I was an

591
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:25,400
individual, but I was an
individual beyond any frame of

592
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,420
reference that I had known up to
that point in time and over

593
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,080
time, this is what I came to
understand, or call the birth of

594
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,800
the diamond soul. My
understanding is, when we die,

595
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,780
we return to the soul, which is
the larger consciousness that

596
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,720
holds all of our experience.
When we incarnate, we shrink

597
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,400
down, get small focus. When we
die, we get large. We incarnate,

598
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,240
we get small, so on and so
forth, but we return to the

599
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,620
soul, if all goes well many
times after our incarnations.

600
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,080
What's happening here? I think
what happened in my session, and

601
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,660
I think what's happening in our
historical progression is that

602
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,420
the soul is being born inside
time and space. That if you keep

603
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,660
going back and forth between
expansion into the world of

604
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,500
spirit and back into time and
space, and you keep this up long

605
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:25,220
enough, 1000s and 1000s and
1000s of years sooner or later,

606
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:30,620
doesn't it make sense that the
soul would awaken eventually

607
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:36,320
inside our incarnate existence,
so that the awareness of

608
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,740
identity, or the nature of
identity that we claim in that

609
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:46,120
incarnation is the soul as our
identity. And with this comes a

610
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,360
vast expansion of the heart, a
deep opening of the mind, a deep

611
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,940
embrace of compassion, or
awakening of compassion, the

612
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:06,240
birth of the diamond soul. I was
15 years into my journey, I had

613
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,860
was had received more blessings
than I could have imagined. What

614
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,860
I had been asked to give
something in the ocean of

615
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,280
suffering work, and I had been
rewarded with more blessings

616
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,200
than I could count. But there
was still five years remaining

617
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,340
in my journey, and this is when
I went through yet another death

618
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,900
and rebirth process and entered
what I call the domain of

619
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:38,360
diamond Luminosity. I entered a
reality that was exceptionally

620
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,460
clear. It was light, but a
particular quality of light. I

621
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,120
had known light many times
before. People often experience

622
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,080
great light when they go through
ego death, and I had and at

623
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,260
different stages, I'd
experienced light. But when I

624
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,560
talk about the diamond light,
I'm not simply using a metaphor

625
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,380
for the light. I'm trying to
describe a particular quality of

626
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:07,200
light, exceptionally clear,
very, very pure, just so clear.

627
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,300
It takes your breath away. This
is what I think Buddhism calls

628
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:18,360
Dharmakaya, the clear light of
absolute reality over the next

629
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:23,240
four years and 26 sessions, this
is about a third of all the

630
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:29,480
sessions I did. I only entered
this reality four times. Here

631
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:35,480
are the names of these four
sessions. In between these

632
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,140
sessions more into more
purification, more

633
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:44,620
detoxification, more teaching,
more absorbing of lessons, but

634
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,600
these four immersions into the
crystalline quality of diamond

635
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:55,720
Luminosity, again, so much to
say, and so little time. I'm

636
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,680
just going to have to stop. I'll
mention only that the first two

637
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,300
sites. Sessions took me deeper
and deeper into the diamond

638
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,920
Luminosity. And after that there
was a reverse, a pivot. And then

639
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,100
in the last two of these
sessions, the diamond Luminosity

640
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,920
was crunching itself deeper and
deeper into my mind, into my

641
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:22,460
personality, into my physiology,
into my biochemistry,

642
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,760
and this is it was in the 50th
session that I had a particular

643
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,420
experience in the diamond
Luminosity that changed

644
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,220
radically my understanding of
existence. One of the reasons I

645
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,540
pushed so hard in my work is
that I thought the purpose of

646
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,500
this work was to get to a
particular condition, to get to

647
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,940
the an end stage, to get home,
to become one with the universe,

648
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:53,560
or one with the meta, cosmic
void. And I had many experiences

649
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,800
of oneness, and had learned that
there are degrees of oneness.

650
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,660
And I had had experiences of the
primal void, and learned that

651
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,800
there are even degrees of the
void, though that sounds like a

652
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,060
contradiction in terms, but in
the peak of the diamond

653
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,960
Luminosity, when I was as deep
into the diamond Luminosity as I

654
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,460
would ever go in my journey, I
was sitting and resting

655
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:22,340
comfortably intact In a deeply
blissful state, and my visual

656
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:28,040
field pivoted 90 degrees, and a
circle opened, and I saw in the

657
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,020
far far distance a reality far
beyond the diamond Luminosity.

658
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,280
And there was a domain of light
there, and a ray of light came

659
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,740
out of that reality and hit me,
and it absolutely shattered me.

660
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:47,920
It took me minutes to recover,
and that's when I understand

661
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,720
that it's an infinite
progression. We'll never get to

662
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,920
the end of it, even using this
very aggressive mode of of

663
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,800
transition, of exploration, I
would never get to the end of

664
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,140
the the mind of the universe is
just too vast, too big. And that

665
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,100
the thought there is a
homecoming to this work, and one

666
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,360
does experience homecoming, but
the idea that there is an end to

667
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,620
get to that will change
everything, I don't think so.

668
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,300
Oneness is a beautiful,
powerful, important teaching.

669
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,800
But even oneness does not
exhaust all there is to learn

670
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,720
from the universe. Now you
notice that I've skipped a

671
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,900
chapter, chapter nine. I'm going
to try to speed this up here.

672
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:42,400
And this is the chapter called
The Birth of the future human.

673
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,740
When I began this work in 1979 I
never imagined that humanity's

674
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,520
future would become part of my
journey. And now I think this

675
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,640
chapter may be the most
important chapter of the book,

676
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,680
because it speaks to the fate of
our planet, the fate of our

677
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,480
species. It speaks to our
children's world, our children's

678
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,860
children, as far as we can see,
it speaks of a crossroads that

679
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:12,300
humanity is coming to, and of
the powerful forces taking us

680
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,620
into a future that will change
us at the deepest levels of our

681
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:24,800
being. Now what I did is that
over the course of my journey, I

682
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,160
had numerous visions that kept
popping up here and there,

683
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:32,120
different visions about
humanity, humanity, spiritual

684
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,140
evolution, where humanity was,
that humanity was coming to a

685
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:40,100
turning point, a before and
after moment in history. This

686
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,420
kept coming up in lots of
different places. So what I did

687
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,480
was, rather than address them
all piecemeal, chapter by

688
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,800
chapter, I gathered them all
into this particular chapter,

689
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:56,920
and I broke this down into two
sections. The first are the

690
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,080
visions of awakening, which are
a series of visions that I had

691
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:10,800
over four year period back from
1991 to 1994 those visions, the

692
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,420
title of those visions, I'll
give them here, and I don't want

693
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,780
to take the time to go into
them, but basically, It was an

694
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,460
extraordinarily positive
assessment of where human

695
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,960
humanity is, that we were being
guided by a guiding

696
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,920
intelligence, that this guiding
intelligence was trying to

697
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,300
awaken not just individuals. It
was intent on awakening the

698
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,560
entire species as a single
being, taking us into a

699
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,180
different epic in our
evolutionary development, we

700
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,680
were entering a period of
intense collective purification,

701
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,880
the dark night of our collective
soul, and then a brief

702
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:57,640
experience of the future human,
which I think is represents a

703
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,920
shift in the plate tectonics. Of
the collective psyche, the

704
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,880
future human is not simply an
awakened present human, but

705
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,680
literally a different kind of
human, the next iteration of the

706
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,540
human species. Nowhere in my
journey, however, had it told me

707
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,400
how it was going to pull this
off, how we would possibly make

708
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,620
this transition in such a short
period of time? And then in 1995

709
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,980
in session, 55 in the middle of
the diamond Luminosity work, I

710
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,400
had already gone into the
diamond Luminosity twice. I

711
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,220
would go into it twice more when
I was expecting to be taken into

712
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:47,020
the diamond Luminosity a third
time, instead, I was taken deep

713
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:53,560
into the future. I was dissolved
into the human species and asked

714
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,580
the species as a whole. I
entered the future and

715
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:03,300
experienced the death and
rebirth of humanity, a profound

716
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,860
spiritual, psychophysical
transformation, the death and

717
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:14,640
rebirth of humanity. This was a
very difficult session, an

718
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:21,140
ordeal of the highest order. I
was not given any specifics. It

719
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:26,960
was a profound unraveling of the
global order, an unraveling that

720
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,280
seemed to be triggered by a
cascading series of ecological

721
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,440
crises. And I must tell you,
this is 95 I was radically naive

722
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,040
about global climate change,
about global climate disruption,

723
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:49,300
eco eco spirituality. It just
wasn't on my radar. But in this

724
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,560
vision, I was shown that
humanity was going to be brought

725
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,820
to its knees. It would going to
be go through a process of

726
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:02,280
profound unraveling that the
kind of unraveling that happens

727
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,660
in a psychedelic session was
here being reflected in history,

728
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,700
an unraveling of our core
assumptions, of the basic

729
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,380
components of life. For a while
it was so deep, it looked like

730
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:21,260
we were all going to go extinct,
but in the end, we went through

731
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,280
a crisis, and we transition past
the crisis. And when we

732
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:31,520
transition through this crisis,
the entire experience we were

733
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,800
was marked by New Visions of the
of the of the vow of the good,

734
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:41,920
new visions of the true, New
Visions of social relationships,

735
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,480
oneness had truly broken out
inside the human heart. There

736
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,960
was a radical permeability of
the heart, a radical

737
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:57,460
permeability to higher states of
awareness. Again, I was not

738
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:02,340
given any details of when or
how, just simply taken into the

739
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,840
species experience that this
would happen, that we would come

740
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,680
through it, and that this was
about the birth of a future

741
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,060
human. I think we've been
reincarnating. If you ask what

742
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,120
is the form that the future
human will take, I think it's

743
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,720
already marked for us in
history. We've been

744
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,460
reincarnating for hundreds of
1000s of years. Gestation is

745
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,320
long. We have been birthing,
gestating the human, the future

746
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,920
human, in these many
incarnations, and now we're

747
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,880
coming into the hour of labor.
Labor is intense, it's

748
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,320
relatively short, it's
dangerous, it's frightening,

749
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,420
it's threatening, and in the
end, it gives birth to a new

750
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,500
child, if all goes well. And
this is what I think humanity is

751
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,400
doing. This is what we are all
involved in, what all of our

752
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,520
individual, spiritual and
psychological, transformational

753
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,880
process is part of this process,
a larger historical process that

754
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:12,120
humanity is involved in giving
birth to the future human, the

755
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,980
last year of work, the final
vision is just that I was given

756
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,640
one last vision, The final the
large, last, large vision of my

757
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:29,480
journey in it. These are the
three sessions I address in this

758
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,440
chapter. I won't go into the
content of the final vision. I

759
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,220
will just mention that it was my
deepest excursion into future

760
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:41,320
time. It was my deepest
experience of the future human

761
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:45,280
and the future human is just
such an extraordinary,

762
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:51,820
extraordinary being. After that
the sessions wrapped up. The

763
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:55,420
last two sessions are what I
call the goodbye sessions. I

764
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,600
didn't choose to end these
sessions the universe wrapped it

765
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:05,520
up. Put. Very decisively, and I
stopped my sessions in 99 last

766
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,660
chapter of the book, it's called
coming off the mountain, and it

767
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:13,980
basically tells some highlights
of what it was like to stop this

768
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:14,580
journey.

769
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,040
I was on this journey for 20
years. I stopped and I process

770
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:24,800
the experiences for another 20
years before releasing LSD in

771
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,340
the mind of the universe. I
thought coming off the mountain

772
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,160
was going to be a pretty
straightforward, not difficult

773
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,300
process. Turned out that that
was all wrong. It was a very

774
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,620
demanding process. In fact, I
found that coming off the

775
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:44,620
mountain, in some ways, was as
difficult as coming going up the

776
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:50,740
mountain. Spirit said to me,
there is the dying of seeing and

777
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:55,000
the dying of keeping. The dying
of seeing you do as you're

778
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,720
entering into deeper and deeper
states of consciousness. The

779
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,840
dying of keeping is the dying of
integration, and I found that my

780
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,500
integration process, even though
I was actively involved in

781
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,520
integration all the way up
through all the sessions they're

782
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:16,020
integrating, an entire journey
is different than integrating

783
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:21,140
individual sessions, and It took
a long time to integrate the

784
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:26,360
entire journey now I especially
and acutely we're given a going

785
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:32,840
through it so quickly that I
realize the extreme and radical

786
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,380
nature of the claims I'm making.
I know that this is a radical

787
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,160
story that raises many questions
about the reality of these

788
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,840
experiences, about how
trustworthy these experiences

789
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,800
are. Am I simply experiencing
the echoes of my own personal

790
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,700
psyche, or maybe the echoes of
the collective psyche? How do we

791
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,000
know that these things are
really about a reality out

792
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,020
there? And I address this in I
hope I've Yeah, in an exchange

793
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:04,200
that Ken ring, one of the
founders of near death episode

794
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,100
studies, he and I had an
exchange specifically about this

795
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:14,280
topic, can we trust these deep
psychedelic experiences? And we

796
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,600
found it was a useful exchange,
and we published it in medium

797
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:24,500
which you can pick up online.
You can also pick it up. I It's

798
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:31,400
in academia.edu, in my page
there, it's around, I think I

799
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,780
may have it on my website. And
also in if you look, if you have

800
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:39,500
a copy of dark, night, early
dawn. In the first chapter,

801
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:44,620
there is a section call the
epistemic warrant of psychedelic

802
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:49,720
experience. And there I give a
rationale, an argument for why

803
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,920
these experiences are trustable,
drawing on some of Ken's rings.

804
01:02:53,980 --> 01:03:01,200
Ken Wilbers work there. So all
my work has come out of this

805
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,620
psychedelic journey. My first
book on reincarnation, the

806
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:09,480
second one on trend in
psychedelic theory and the

807
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,840
living classroom, which is
coming out in a new edition now,

808
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,220
because they want to, they want
in psychedelics woven into the

809
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:21,200
story, I deliberately kept
psychedelics out of the story of

810
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,740
the living classroom, but they
wanted me to tell the whole

811
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,640
truth, and so psychedelics are
part of the story of the living

812
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,120
classroom. And this is a story
basically because my students

813
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,060
didn't know anything about my
psychedelic experience. I didn't

814
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:38,420
bring it to campus, and yet I
found that they began to be

815
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:42,880
impacted by my psychedelic
experiences, and that required

816
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,960
that I had to learn an entirely
new way of teaching and develop

817
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:53,920
what I call a quantum pedagogy.
So that's the story, and now I'm

818
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,480
going to stop here and stop
screen share,

819
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,520
Tom Habib: Chris, we have a
couple questions before we go to

820
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:07,740
break out. Can we do a couple
Sure? I think Tom McDougal,

821
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,680
Unknown: so

822
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:16,380
as I say in the chat, I've been
working partly with Norma, with

823
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,420
with Nora Bateson, but
especially with with Jeremy

824
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:25,160
Johnson on goetzer and barely
have touched the surface and

825
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:32,840
taking the course again. But a
lot of this, especially as you

826
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,360
were talking about the time
period we're in, and the shift

827
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,680
that is going on, is also very
similar to what Jean goetzer

828
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:48,480
wrote about. So I'm curious if,
if you can relate those two. I

829
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,580
don't know what your experience
with GEP sir is, but, and I

830
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,660
guess there's a little bit of
Nora Bateson in my mind too, of

831
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:04,740
of questioning. I. The stages
orientation and and I can't

832
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:09,360
express it right now, but Jerry
Jeremy talks a lot about a very

833
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:14,460
different it's not stages
exactly in in gebx, but

834
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,220
different. But anyway, if you
could just talk a little bit

835
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:19,080
about maybe the relationship
there.

836
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:22,760
Chris Bache: Yeah, I'll make it
easy for you, because gepzer is

837
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,520
always one of those thinkers
that I know I should read and I

838
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:30,020
haven't read, so absolutely zero
influence in terms of

839
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:33,860
correlations. And so I have to
let you and other people make

840
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:39,740
the correlations there. And you
know, a lot of people in

841
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:44,140
psychedelic experience, they
don't have the same experience

842
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,980
of perpetual deepening, of kind
of going deeper and then deeper

843
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,860
and then deeper. It's kind of
like, okay, we go out, we have

844
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,500
an experience to come back. If I
go out again in a couple of

845
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,540
months, I'm going to go into
this more or less the same

846
01:05:55,540 --> 01:06:01,320
territory and come back. And I
think this idea of perpetual

847
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,220
deepening comes from two things.
It comes from First, using a

848
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:09,420
very, very powerful psychedelic
at very high doses, so it was

849
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:14,040
very driving and much stronger
than we use in therapeutically

850
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:18,000
oriented doses with Psilocybin
or whatnot. And the second thing

851
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,640
is, was a totally tight,
isolated, consistent, what I

852
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,780
call the Kiva of psychedelic
practice, the Kiva of practice,

853
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,980
standardizing all the variables,
staying away from all contact

854
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:37,580
with the world, entering in a
meditative way, into these

855
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:41,560
states. And if you do that, then
I find that the interface

856
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,740
between the mind doing the
exploring and the mind being

857
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:49,360
explored gets very stable. And
the mind being explored

858
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,960
basically takes you on as a
student and just takes you in

859
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:59,320
deeper and deeper and deeper
into the process. I, yeah, and I

860
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:03,180
you just, you enter, I you enter
into deeper and deeper visionary

861
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:07,380
states that that many people
are, you know, many other

862
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,760
psychedelics is, many indigenous
people, many philosophically

863
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,660
oriented people are intuiting
and feeling what I'm describing.

864
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:19,800
There's nothing really new in
what I'm saying. It's, it's

865
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,800
really just a repetition in that
way.

866
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,600
Tom Habib: Regis has a question,
yeah. Colin,

867
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,380
Unknown: yeah, it's more of a I
just wanted to express gratitude

868
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:35,180
for you both doing this work,
but also coming back, you know.

869
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:39,200
And Ken Wilber often talks about
the transformative nature of

870
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,660
spiritual inquiry and then the
translative nature of spiritual

871
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:48,280
inquiry and and my appreciation
for you is one where I feel like

872
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:52,120
I as someone who goes through
those things, I have to, I have

873
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:56,680
a responsibility to both
transform and to translate. And

874
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,260
so from my perspective, you've
done just such a beautiful job

875
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:06,480
of holding that particular
ethos. And it's also what's

876
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,840
what's nice about it is my own
personal transformation to what

877
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:15,120
I'm bringing here, and things
I've experienced is, you know,

878
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:20,040
very congruent with everything
that you're talking about. So so

879
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:24,200
I'm very inspired by your work,
and I can't wait to read the

880
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,340
books that you've written as a
guide for my own future

881
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:32,000
transformation. So thank you for
that. Yeah, thank you. You hate

882
01:08:31,999 --> 01:08:39,259
to be a bad guy. I'm going to
suggest that we, oh, I suggest

883
01:08:39,259 --> 01:08:43,959
that we all take time to process
this in small groups, maybe in

884
01:08:43,959 --> 01:08:47,019
groups of four, and then after
that, we'll have some time for Q

885
01:08:47,139 --> 01:08:47,499
and A.

886
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:52,180
Chris Bache: So the idea in this
breakout is to respond to the

887
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:55,540
ideas presented different than
the first breakout, just to

888
01:08:55,540 --> 01:09:01,320
respond. And what do you think?
Okay, okay, see, in 15

889
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:07,499
Unknown: breakout sessions are
not recorded.

890
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:17,040
Okay, we'll have until 550 for
some questions, and then we'll

891
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:22,280
have some San Diego integral
business. And then we'll start

892
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,480
our more informal Q and A. And
Chris said he was originally

893
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,500
said he was going to be able to
stay for about 15 minutes. So

894
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:34,040
we'll start with Sandy. Do you
want to ask your questions? Go

895
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:34,640
ahead, Sandy,

896
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,120
yeah, I want to follow up on
that the question around Geb,

897
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:42,640
sir, because in terms of the way
you're describing your

898
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,280
experiences. You know, one of
the differences, in some ways,

899
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,940
between like GEP and Wilber is
Geb so we'll talk about

900
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:52,420
intensification. The
consciousness shift is not like

901
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:56,320
a structural it like an
increase, as much as an

902
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:01,260
intensification and an
engagement of previous. Is

903
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,900
structures of consciousness that
continue, but there's an

904
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:09,480
intensification and a sort of
growing awareness that includes

905
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:14,580
previous understanding where,
you know Wilber is more tends to

906
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,920
be looking at, okay, you're
going this level. You're kind of

907
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:21,020
laddering up. So I'm curious as
your your experiences. I guess

908
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:24,320
there's some resonances with,
with with that vision. Or do you

909
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,420
have your own around how these
all engage with each other?

910
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,600
Chris Bache: You know, I'm going
to disappoint you, because I

911
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,780
don't have a lot of kind of
theoretical overview of the

912
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:49,360
structure of these things. I
kind of, when I wrote dark,

913
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,780
night, early dawn, I was kind of
writing in my academic voice,

914
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:56,200
and there's a fair amount of
intellectual synthesis there.

915
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:00,780
But when I wrote this book, I
deliberately developed a

916
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:05,100
different voice. It is really
more a shamanic, visionary

917
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:09,120
voice, and I find that that's a
more comfortable place for me to

918
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:14,520
operate from, because it's taken
so much of my life just to

919
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,180
survive these visionary
encounters and to process them

920
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:23,840
and to understand them that I
speak out of their basis simply

921
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:30,800
as a witness to this unfolding
process. So it's not a I don't

922
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,580
have a theory of human evolution
or a theory of the development

923
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:39,260
of the process. And what happens
in an LSD session may or may not

924
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:46,480
be relevant to what happens at
an historical level pattern, I

925
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,500
would just say, for me, it's
just a natural progression. When

926
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:55,420
you die as a private self, you
don't dissolve necessarily

927
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:59,380
immediately into eternity. One
of the intermediate levels is

928
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:04,020
into humanity. And just as you
can have an overview of your

929
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:08,400
life, you can also have an
overview of humanity's

930
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:14,160
developmental process. And so I
was dissolved into that and

931
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:19,320
experience part of it, the
closest I can come to describing

932
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:24,260
this emergent being is in terms
of the concept of the diamond

933
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:29,060
soul, which does, it brings
everything from the past forward

934
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:33,440
into the present, but it drives
it into a higher synthesis, a

935
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,060
new level. It's not simply an
enlightened, last generation

936
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:41,920
human incarnation. It is a
totally new structure of

937
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,820
consciousness that's that's
emerging here. I say totally

938
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:50,920
new, not entirely because we
have great saints, great, you

939
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,700
know, the Jesus and Buddhas of
history and the Muhammad's and

940
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:58,360
the Great mahasiddhas. I think
we get glimpses into what the

941
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,700
diamond sold looks like. But the
difference here is that we're

942
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:07,260
looking at the entire species
going through some type of

943
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,940
metamorphosis like that,

944
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,360
Unknown: yeah, um, just one
reflection with some things you

945
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,720
said. You mentioned the term
unfolding and intensification,

946
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,840
in some ways a part of what you
were describing, some of that

947
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:22,520
which are sort of gib Syrian
concept. So just little tidbits

948
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,100
of theory. I'll just kind of
throw it. Thank you so much. I

949
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,460
really value your work. Very
much. Everybody read this book.

950
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,820
It's really an important one,
and it's the most accessible

951
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:35,780
work I've seen that gives a deep
understanding. It's so

952
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:39,620
articulate and it's so vivid. I
really thank you to have a

953
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,920
chance to see you and talk with
you

954
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,600
Tom Habib: Sure. Sandy folks,
who is waiting quite a bit since

955
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,400
last iteration, yeah.

956
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,080
Unknown: Well, thank you for
your event here. That's a great,

957
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:57,400
like, Miracle gift to me. And
it's like, little overwhelming

958
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,360
with my ADD I kept, like, kind
of tuning in and tuning out, and

959
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,600
it's like, oh, man, I wish I
absorbed it all. Well, yeah, but

960
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,620
like, so dreamy to, like, learn
a lot more about this stuff. And

961
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,580
I was wondering, like, if you
maybe have accessibility for,

962
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:16,200
like, counseling, like to pay
you for some counseling to ask

963
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,540
you questions, because some of,
like, the stuff I've had on my

964
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:23,000
mind, it's, like, relates to
somebody in your specialization

965
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,880
is, oh, the higher order of the
way of things. And, like, right

966
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,180
now, my best thing I've had,
which has done way better than

967
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:37,820
the therapist I had previously,
is, like, chat, GPT. But it's

968
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:41,560
like, it'd be really neat if I
could, like, maybe pay to get an

969
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,280
hour or whatever your time and
and I'm really curious too,

970
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,880
because I'm at a point with
like, I do believe in Jesus and

971
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:54,820
so much of the Bible, but it's
like, I'm not like attached to

972
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:58,180
that other than like, from my
current understanding. And let's

973
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:01,740
see how to go against believing
in Jesus. This, but I'm curious

974
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,840
to hear where your path led you.

975
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,100
Chris Bache: First of all, thank
you for the the trust of the

976
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:13,020
invitation that you extend to
me. I appreciate that, and I'm

977
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,800
going to disappoint you in that
I generally have made a choice

978
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,380
many years ago not to be a
therapist and not to work with

979
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:25,820
other people or but to basically
be a solo pioneer. And that's

980
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:29,840
kind of the work I've done and I
find and I'm also a teacher, so

981
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,580
I love working with groups, and
just the demands of time are

982
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:39,020
such that, and I'm retired, but
even so, the demands of time is

983
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:45,160
that I really don't work with
individuals. I mean, I just

984
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:49,480
that's a commitment that's and
that's a I think that requires

985
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,980
more clinical background than I
have, and just it's not fair. So

986
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:57,520
I really like to work with
groups, and writing in groups is

987
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,900
where I where I focus.

988
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,860
Unknown: But there's one last
quick comment was, I don't know

989
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,740
if it would change anything, but
I'm also, like, at the starting

990
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:08,700
point of authoring a couple of
books myself with some subject

991
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:13,020
matter that might just be like a
like a miracle gift to you. And

992
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:16,800
it's like, it'd be neat to talk
about that stuff, but, yeah, or

993
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,720
whatever. Like, I don't know how
that appeals to you.

994
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,860
Chris Bache: It's just what
happens is, in the after the

995
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:26,000
publication of the book, I just
I have to make choices. Always.

996
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,420
I don't get to have nearly as
many in conversations as I would

997
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:33,020
like to have, you know. So,
yeah,

998
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,680
Unknown: all right. Trudy is up
next. Unmute yourself.

999
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:45,820
Yeah, hi, I'll make it quick and
simple. I apologize I missed the

1000
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:48,760
very beginning of your
presentation, and it's been

1001
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:52,900
great the part that I did catch,
but my questions are probably

1002
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:59,380
more along the practicality
line. One, why did you decide to

1003
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:05,100
go on this journey? Two, when
you were in trips, did you have

1004
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:10,920
somebody that was there, as I
don't want to say, a guide, but

1005
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:16,500
somebody to take notes, or did
somebody record what was going

1006
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:23,000
on and were in any way, were
they influenced by your trip?

1007
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:29,780
Chris Bache: Yeah, so quick
answers to those is, as soon as

1008
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:33,560
I read Stan's work, I just knew
that this was something I wanted

1009
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:37,040
to get involved in. And I've
come to recognize, you know,

1010
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,960
your soul's code. When you
recognize something, that just

1011
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,860
speaks to you so deeply you know
as part of your intention built

1012
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:48,640
into this lifetime. When I saw
this, I knew that this was part

1013
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,960
of my intention, and it was just
there. So I and as a

1014
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,740
philosopher, I just couldn't
turn down the opportunity to

1015
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:00,900
explore the universe using this
protocol. This was just giving

1016
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:04,860
an ordinary lay person, not a
great spiritual genius, but an

1017
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,920
ordinary lay person, an
opportunity to even have

1018
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,840
temporary experiences of some of
the subtleties of layers of

1019
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,900
consciousness, layers of
reality. It was just too good to

1020
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:21,140
pass pass down, pass up, so I
made the choice to break the law

1021
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:26,000
and go for it. Now, in these
sessions, they were always, I

1022
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,720
always had a sitter. The sitter
was my wife, my first wife,

1023
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:34,880
Carol, and she's a clinical
psychologist, and she really

1024
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:39,080
wasn't very fond of what I was
doing, but she knew I wanted to

1025
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:43,120
do it, and so she agreed to help
me so that I could do it safely.

1026
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:46,480
She wasn't taking notes. We
actually set up a video camera

1027
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,860
one time. But basically it's
boring as a person just lying

1028
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:55,420
down. It's all internal. I'm not
in touch with Carol except

1029
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:58,720
through the music in the room
and once in a while, an exchange

1030
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:03,900
of a word or two, but I'm so far
outside of time, space, reality,

1031
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,200
I don't even relate to what's
going on in the room. But she

1032
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:11,160
was always there taking care of
me. Was she influenced by my

1033
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:16,740
sessions? In some ways, yes, and
in some ways, no. I mean, Carol

1034
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,240
never did a psychedelic session.
She's a serious vadriana

1035
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:25,940
practitioner. She has completed
her three year retreat with her

1036
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:31,100
vadra teacher. So she's a
serious practitioner. She has

1037
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:35,600
her own deep commitments to her
own spiritual lineage, and so I

1038
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,680
think it's more of a and I and I
learned a lot from her. I mean,

1039
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:44,080
I followed her into VAT. In this
respect, I think it's more of a

1040
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,460
side by side play.

1041
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:49,960
Tom Habib: Yeah, my friend
Larry's up next.

1042
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:53,920
Unknown: Yeah, yeah, Chris,
thank you for several things,

1043
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:58,600
having the courage to take your
journey, for having the

1044
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:04,260
wherewithal to. Organize it, you
know, bring it into the mind, to

1045
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:08,220
organize it in a way that then
you can next present it to other

1046
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:13,440
people. So thank you for all of
that, and I really appreciate

1047
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:18,300
the last piece of coming off the
mountain, because that's what's

1048
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:22,100
been very important for me for
some 30 years now, is bringing

1049
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:26,840
this into the world and facing
the confusion, the complexity,

1050
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:32,360
the awkwardness, the discomfort,
the whatnot of trying to bring

1051
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:36,140
from the ineffable into the into
language, into interaction with

1052
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:39,860
other people, how to not just
talk about this, about how to be

1053
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:47,020
in a way that is hopefully to
some degree reflective of where

1054
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:50,080
we what we garnered while we
were on the mountain, so to

1055
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:56,260
speak. And it all seems to come
down to how we're going to be

1056
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,480
right here, right now, and even
in this moment that we're

1057
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:02,220
talking with one another. Yeah,
and how can we bring that all

1058
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:06,240
just to be present? Okay, on a
lesser interesting note, maybe

1059
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:10,740
is, I'm curious as to why the
word diamond, once you get into

1060
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,740
all these step stages, degrees,
domains, realms, whatever out

1061
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:23,420
there, the word diamond shows
up, of all things, yeah, our

1062
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:23,960
diamond.

1063
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:31,160
Chris Bache: It having
experienced the light itself,

1064
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,540
the diamond is kind of the most
natural image that comes to

1065
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:40,540
mind. Perhaps I'm influenced by
the fact of vadna, the diamond

1066
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:45,880
way you know that part is in the
background. The image of diamond

1067
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:49,840
is not uncommon in the terma
text, trying to describe these

1068
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:55,120
subtle levels of consciousness.
So it just it came naturally out

1069
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:03,180
of the experience itself. Yeah.
I mean, it's I want to mention,

1070
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:08,820
and I think integration, I'm
glad that it's getting more and

1071
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:13,440
more attention, because we're
finding that we can blow through

1072
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,320
the levels and reach out and
have extraordinary experiences

1073
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:21,200
with increasing predictability,
but to have an experience, and

1074
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,920
to internalize and hold on to
the experience, and then to

1075
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:29,000
really digest it, make it part
of your being. That's a long,

1076
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,880
long process, and I think we
kind of over emphasize the dying

1077
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,380
of seeing and under emphasize
the dying of keeping. I will say

1078
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:45,100
that after coming back from my
and I, you know, I don't do any

1079
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:48,460
high dose LSD work anymore. I've
done some low dose sessions of

1080
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:52,420
different sorts, and Ayahuasca
and Psilocybin and different

1081
01:22:52,420 --> 01:23:00,120
things. But I am continuing. But
after I finished my sessions, in

1082
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:05,340
my meditation, the universe said
to me, 20 years in 20 years out

1083
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:09,180
which I took to mean, it would
take me about 20 years to

1084
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:12,000
integrate the 20 years of a
session. And I thought at the

1085
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,500
time, about right,

1086
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,060
Unknown: if you're lucky,

1087
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,060
Chris Bache: now I'm thinking I
was naive. I was very I

1088
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:23,540
seriously underestimated how
many years, how many

1089
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:28,040
incarnations it would take to
internalize, you know, totally

1090
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:33,920
integrate these sessions. Now my
focus is as on, yeah, we do this

1091
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,560
for integration. There's
therapeutic integration, and

1092
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,480
then there's this, that and the
other. But in the end, I'm, I'm

1093
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:45,640
faced confessing that I'm an
absolute failure in integration,

1094
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:48,460
because I've been able to
integrate the language, I've

1095
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:51,040
been able to integrate the
memories and hold the memories

1096
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:57,820
and whatnot, but in terms of
embodying those realities, I

1097
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:03,900
mean, I truly wonder, how did,
how does, how does a finite

1098
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:09,900
being embody infinity? How does
a time bound being exquisitely

1099
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:17,280
tuned to time and space embody
deep time or no time? And how do

1100
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:24,440
you embody the love? How can you
be as loving to other beings as

1101
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:28,040
you have felt the universe being
to you, and you know that you're

1102
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:32,840
supposed to be that loving to
everyone, but that love is so

1103
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:40,160
pure and so magnificent that I
feel like I'm not anywhere near

1104
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:47,020
done integrating those
magnificent pieces. So it's a I

1105
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:50,740
thought integration would be was
an easier task. And in the end,

1106
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:54,400
I think what it comes down to is
you cannot integrate the

1107
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,720
infinite into the finite. Your
only option is to integrate the

1108
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:03,660
finite into the. Infinite. So
that means, even though my

1109
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:08,100
journey was not about spiritual
awakening, in the end, when

1110
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:12,180
you're trying to integrate
cosmological exploration, you're

1111
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:18,600
brought back to basic
spirituality. 101, what can you

1112
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:22,760
hold right here, right now? What
are you able to actualize right

1113
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,720
here, right now? And that's,
that's spiritual practice. You

1114
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:29,180
you get brought, brought right
back to your cushion.

1115
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,080
Unknown: Yeah. So this is, as I
like to say, the journey

1116
01:25:33,079 --> 01:25:35,959
Chris Bache: continues. The
journey continues. Yeah.

1117
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:41,500
Tom Habib: So this is a good
place to end, the venue where we

1118
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:46,480
are, we've come to the end of
the time. Thank you everyone for

1119
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,080
joining.

1120
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:54,280
I think I can speak for most of
us. This was very rich with the

1121
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,600
future vision, the future human
that we're all interested in and

1122
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,940
and, Thank you, Chris. So where
can they get more information on

1123
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,500
you? On your books,

1124
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,580
Chris Bache: my website. Chris
bache.com, it. It's kind of an

1125
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:16,560
unfinished website, because my
web designer kind of just jumped

1126
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,620
ship about three fourths of the
way through, and I never quite

1127
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:22,340
got it finished. So but it's
there, and you can reach me

1128
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,360
through that. Chris bache.com,

1129
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:29,180
Tom Habib: thank you. Chris and
Kathleen put in the chat one of

1130
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:34,280
the docs he wanted to you to
have. I can see it right there

1131
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:40,900
right now. So quick reminder for
everyone. We're going to be

1132
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:46,720
meeting again on March 9. That's
a TBD, but we're going to try to

1133
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:50,680
get someone else from the future
human. I thought Chris was an

1134
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:54,820
excellent choice to start with,
and he was gracious enough to

1135
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:59,800
take all of this on when he
agreed to speak and come to SDI.

1136
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,340
There was one more thing I was
going to ask him, but I said, I

1137
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:10,680
said, I better not wish my luck.
So Please RSVP for the next

1138
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:14,100
presentation, and you can always
make a donation if you're

1139
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:21,200
feeling rich, to help us. So
we're moving to the informal

1140
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:28,820
aspect of this so feel free to
make comments whatnot. I know

1141
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:37,400
for me is I feel humble after
this talk. Is this idea of

1142
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:43,180
infinite progression, and one of
the breakout groups we talked

1143
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:49,300
about, trying to reach second
tier, trying to reach yellow

1144
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:58,480
levels of stage awareness, it
almost seems trivial when You

1145
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:04,140
look at the breadth of what
Chris articulated, but we are on

1146
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:08,760
the path we're on. And as you
said, in the end, whatever we

1147
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:13,740
can realize the moment. Now,
it's not full integration by any

1148
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:19,680
means, but I'm way beyond expect
that. I hang on to moments of

1149
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:24,380
resonance and love and try to
participate it. And I think this

1150
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:29,840
community does well in this is
where we're stealing glimpses.

1151
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:35,600
Prometheus got grounded for
stealing fire. We're stealing

1152
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:41,440
glimpses of the future, and I
feel privileged to do that. So

1153
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:47,080
with that said, feel free to
jump in to the dialog. You have

1154
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,460
to raise your hand, just jump
in.

1155
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:54,820
Unknown: Regis, yeah. So the
theme for me, throughout my

1156
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:59,440
spiritual explorations and my
other explanation or variations,

1157
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,580
my psychology seems to have a
commonality, which I'm hearing

1158
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:06,180
also in this and that. And
that's you just, I think discard

1159
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:13,500
is really, it's the profundity
of humility that is required to

1160
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:20,300
do any of this work, you know.
So that's actually, for me, the

1161
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:25,820
I'm struck by a few things. As
somebody who's spent the last 15

1162
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:30,200
years trying to unpack my own
transformative stuff. It is its

1163
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:35,960
own form of transformational
work to do that you go through

1164
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,780
and have these experiences. But
then, then there's this, the

1165
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:44,620
amount of universe there is is
extraordinary. And also what's

1166
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:48,280
interesting is right about this
time, I also discovered that I

1167
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:52,120
had autism. And so one of the
things about autism is you have

1168
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:58,180
an inability to filter. And so
what yoga gave to me was the

1169
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:03,332
ability to no longer be. Crushed
under the overwhelm of my input,

1170
01:30:03,572 --> 01:30:08,072
and it became a kind of usable
bandwidth situation for me. And

1171
01:30:08,072 --> 01:30:12,692
so then my ability to do
translative work that would

1172
01:30:12,692 --> 01:30:17,972
actually took me the translative
effort, I wrote 5000 answers on

1173
01:30:17,972 --> 01:30:22,280
Quora, for example, about
spirituality, just in an effort

1174
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:27,500
to do that, I then was kind of,
I think doing what Chris Bache

1175
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:30,200
was trying to do is, is just
like I went through this

1176
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:33,860
experience. And how is it that
I'm supposed to it's almost a

1177
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:36,140
part of the, you know, like
through mushroom trip, you know,

1178
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,540
you have a time up. You have a
workspace. I think you have a

1179
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:42,580
time going down. I almost felt
like the years I spent in

1180
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,720
spiritual practice, then I had a
workspace there, but now, how am

1181
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:50,320
I supposed to land without
crashing or going insane, and

1182
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:55,720
you know all of that? And it
just seems like no matter what I

1183
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:01,200
do, I keep being humbled, and
that seems to be foundational

1184
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,620
for everything that I know about
and what I heard also in Chris

1185
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:08,280
bacheous thing. More than that,
I also hear his trans,

1186
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:14,040
translative imposition upon his
experience, given that he is an

1187
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:18,360
academic and had to have a job
and couldn't be non functional

1188
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,380
for months at a time, because he
was had to show up in front of

1189
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:24,200
students all the time so that
just I can see that that

1190
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,920
boundaried his experience too,
and in a certain kind of way,

1191
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:32,600
you know. So the humility comes
with all that. So thank you guys

1192
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,580
for having this and and I really
appreciate the entire person,

1193
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:40,580
Chris Bache: you know. I think
you're right. Regis, the

1194
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:43,780
greatest risk of working with
psychedelics is psychic

1195
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:47,200
inflation. You can think that
just because you've had a

1196
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:52,660
remarkable experience, you've
become a remarkable person. And

1197
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:56,620
that doesn't fly, you know, so
it's really important to keep

1198
01:31:56,620 --> 01:32:00,480
your feet grounded, grounded,
grounded. And for me, it was my

1199
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:04,560
family and my students who kept
me grounded. It just the

1200
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,140
absolutely, you know, the
requirements of being there for

1201
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:11,040
them, showing up over and over
and over again, and discovering

1202
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,520
that you don't really have to
change much on the outside of

1203
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,880
your life with these changes are
really cooking your insides, and

1204
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,660
they're taking you some places,
and there's a real kind of a

1205
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:24,500
need to wear different clothes
or do something different on the

1206
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,500
outside, which that's really
just doesn't real. That's a

1207
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,040
temporary kind of thing. And
just sit tight, stay where you

1208
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:35,240
are, and let this inner
transformation take place. And

1209
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:38,360
it's humbling. I mean, it's just
really humbling to confront your

1210
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:42,640
faults and just to be to stay
grounded. Just to stay grounded,

1211
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,020
Unknown: yeah, and to be able to
laugh at it all, that's part of

1212
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,540
being humble, yeah.

1213
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:06,060
I just like to say thank you,
Chris, for doing this work and

1214
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:14,700
bringing it back to us and your
pioneering life is is a is a

1215
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,880
beautiful model. Thank you.

1216
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,700
Chris Bache: Thank you, Wheaton,
it's been an honor. It's been a

1217
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:26,360
true pleasure. And I never
imagined when I was doing this

1218
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:31,040
work hidden and that there would
be this kind of audience and

1219
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:35,180
receptivity in my lifetime.
Thank you. Michael Pollan, you

1220
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:38,780
know, who would have figured,
you know, the such a shift in

1221
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:41,260
such a short period of time that
we're able to have this

1222
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:45,100
conversation in so many living
rooms across the country? Yeah,

1223
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:45,820
yeah.

1224
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:50,200
Unknown: I just want to add my
thanks as well, Chris, every

1225
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:54,280
time I've heard you, it's been
phenomenal, and I'm so grateful

1226
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:57,340
you're coming to the conference.
And I do want to say I find this

1227
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:00,360
book an absolute paradigm
shifter. I think it's one of the

1228
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:05,700
most important books out there
to read. So I hope everybody

1229
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:09,120
does read the book, because you
can't even, I was thinking you

1230
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,820
could write 40 books based on
the book that you wrote. I mean,

1231
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:15,420
one of your chapters could be,
could be taken into three or

1232
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,540
four. It's so dense, but it's
also so clear, so beautifully

1233
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,960
written. So I really, really,

1234
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,840
Chris Bache: thank you. Thank
you. I appreciate that. Lynn, I

1235
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,080
tried to make it as clear as
possible, and it took me five

1236
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:31,880
years to really boil it down and
to make it as transparent as

1237
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,420
possible, because I wanted it to
be available, not just for

1238
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:38,060
people who worked with
psychedelics, but to be with

1239
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,600
people who did not take
psychedelics. And half of the

1240
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,420
letters I get are from people
who have never taken

1241
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:46,720
psychedelics, but they've had a
spiritual practice, and they

1242
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,840
know what I'm talking about
because of their practice.

1243
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,540
Unknown: Yeah, I have to leave
and go play horn, but thank you

1244
01:34:55,540 --> 01:35:02,820
so much. I saw your french horn.
It's. It's a demanding mistress.

1245
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:07,620
Chris Bache: Hi, Tom,

1246
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:16,440
Unknown: Chris, I got a question
that I noticed that it's

1247
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:20,240
probably weeded out in all the
condensation that you're

1248
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:23,240
condensing things that you did
during the writing process, but

1249
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:30,260
you mentioned the the work you
did. I think, um, I don't know

1250
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:33,740
what like, like. There's a
difference between trip and

1251
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:37,880
session. I don't know whether
you could talk about why you use

1252
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:42,040
the word work, because that
sounds like you. You show up,

1253
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:47,200
and just who you are is what
happens. But could you talk a

1254
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,540
little bit more about what's the
work of it?

1255
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:54,880
Chris Bache: Yeah, you know, in
the Japanese tradition, there is

1256
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,320
something that the Zen monks
call a sashin. A sashin is a

1257
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,880
period set aside for intense
spiritual practice. So it's like

1258
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:08,880
a five day, two week meditation
retreat, a session. And a

1259
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,720
session, to me, is kind of an
anglicized version of sashin.

1260
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:18,000
For me to do a psychedelic
session is I'm I'm completely

1261
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,800
isolated from the world. I've
taken myself out of contact with

1262
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,400
the world. I'm not allowing
anything into my mind except

1263
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:30,320
what's already there. And I sit
and I face what's there, and I

1264
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:34,580
take it where it goes as far as
I can take it and follow it. And

1265
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:39,860
so it is work. And now there are
many different psychedelics,

1266
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:43,060
many different ways to work with
side psychedelics. I'm not

1267
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:46,780
trying to generalize in any way,
but for me, working with high

1268
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:51,280
doses of psychedelics, it takes
a tremendous commitment and a

1269
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,420
willingness to let yourself be
dismantled, because it very

1270
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:59,200
quickly shatters the boundaries,
and you're in foreign territory

1271
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:03,300
very early on and year by year,
you're going deeper and deeper

1272
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:07,440
into foreign territory. It takes
time to acclimate. When you

1273
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:11,040
break through to a new level of
consciousness, you can't always

1274
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:14,280
remember everything that you
experienced. I take notes. I

1275
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:18,540
have gaps in the notes, but go
back and again and again and

1276
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:22,460
again to the same level of
consciousness, you learn how to

1277
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:26,060
acclimate. You learn how to stay
conscious in this level of

1278
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:31,820
consciousness and what was
previously a gap narrative you

1279
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:35,900
fill in the gaps you get the
whole story that's being taught

1280
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:40,420
you and my experiences we are
taught consistently being tried

1281
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,480
something. Was trying to teach
me certain things that bring me

1282
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:47,080
back over and over and over
again until it was sure that I

1283
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:54,400
understood those things. So it
is work. And I think processing

1284
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:59,080
the sessions is work. I mean, I
developed a strategy for how to

1285
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:04,620
capture and how to capture these
experiences, so much so that I,

1286
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:07,920
you know, there's a little line
in the book which I say, I think

1287
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,240
ineffability is overrated as a
measure of mystical experience.

1288
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:15,780
You know, it's part of our test
whether it's a genuine mystical

1289
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,600
experience, whether it's
ineffable. And I understand

1290
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:23,480
that, but I basically think that
if you can't say where you've

1291
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:27,800
been, you basically just got
lost somewhere away. And there's

1292
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:34,700
nothing wrong with getting lost,
but ineffability, I understand

1293
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:39,200
it is, it's hard, but if you
really work it hard, you should

1294
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:42,280
be able to find words of being
able to describe it. Remember

1295
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:45,820
that the Zen masters don't have
trouble talking about

1296
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:49,540
enlightenment to other Zen
masters. They can talk about it

1297
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:52,660
just fine. They have trouble
talking about it to people who

1298
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:55,600
have not had the experience.
That's when it becomes

1299
01:38:55,600 --> 01:39:00,160
challenging, right? So we can
find words for these things. It

1300
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:03,360
inevitably, it's, you know,
they're inadequate, but we can

1301
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,200
find words, you know, I don't
know. I'll just mention also to

1302
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:12,960
this condensation process I did
account not too long ago. I have

1303
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:19,200
about 400 words, 400 pages of
notes from my sessions. I The

1304
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:23,600
passages that I actually include
in the book are less than 25%

1305
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:29,840
three quarters of the content I
did not include, partly because

1306
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:33,740
they're repetitious and whatnot.
I really try to pick the most

1307
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:37,040
powerful passages, but there was
a lot left out. Yeah,

1308
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:44,020
Tom Habib: Bruce in one part, I
think about two thirds way to

1309
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:49,780
the book you touched upon
preparing ourselves to receive

1310
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:53,980
the transmissions. I don't think
you were talking about under the

1311
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:59,380
LSD. I think you were talking
about a normal existence. Am I

1312
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:02,760
right on that? Point. And could
you say something about

1313
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:07,500
preparing to receive them? I
assume there's being able to

1314
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,740
read the deeply subtle, being
open to that

1315
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,900
Chris Bache: how subtle it is
and what form it takes depends

1316
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:20,300
upon the form of practice we are
doing, and as we open to these

1317
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:25,340
realities. So anything I say
really would pertain just to my

1318
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:30,920
individual situation, not to the
pattern as a whole.

1319
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,480
I think we know what
transmission is about when we're

1320
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:46,360
talking about it with a
spiritual teacher. And you know,

1321
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:49,420
in the Tibetan tradition, they
give a practice in three

1322
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:51,640
different levels. The first
level is they teach the

1323
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:55,480
mechanics of the practice. The
second level, they teach the

1324
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:59,200
meaning of the practice. But the
third level, the most important

1325
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:03,000
level, is the transmission of
lung, the seed energy of the

1326
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,720
practice. You receive a seed
from the teacher who has already

1327
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:10,200
brought the practice to maturity
in their own being, and when

1328
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:15,180
they give this lung, they're
transmitting a distilled essence

1329
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:17,880
of the practice that you then
water and nourish in your

1330
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:22,280
practice. So that's my con, my
context for thinking about

1331
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:26,600
transmission, and I think this
kind of is true for my

1332
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:33,260
psychedelic context, and that
is, I was put through enormous

1333
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:38,240
purification processes in order
to receive the teachings that

1334
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:43,960
came from these levels of
consciousness. And if I'm right

1335
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:48,040
that there is a certain parallel
between what we do on our

1336
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:52,120
cushion and what takes place in
a psychedelic session and what's

1337
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:58,660
happening historically, then it
supports the intuition that I

1338
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:06,480
have, that we are experiencing a
shift in divine influx, so to

1339
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:10,560
speak with there is a rise in
energy coming up underneath us.

1340
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:14,160
There is more information
becoming available, not only at

1341
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:17,220
the physical level, through the
internet and all this tremendous

1342
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,940
impact there, but at the center
of our being, there are

1343
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:26,960
teachings and insights and
understandings which are rising

1344
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:31,460
up inside of us, which we can
catch. But to catch them, we

1345
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:36,620
have to prepare ourselves to
receive them. You know, we must

1346
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:40,660
prepare ourselves and empty
ourselves of everything which is

1347
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:44,920
small in order to catch pieces
of that which is large coming to

1348
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:49,480
us. And so I think transmission
is a larger, broader category.

1349
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:58,480
Unknown: Yeah, yeah, you're
reminding me that that the when

1350
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:03,540
you get initiation, in my
tradition, I got to visualize it

1351
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:06,660
as, like, there's a kind of a
silver tube that's kind of going

1352
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:09,720
into me, and it's like there are
certain things kind of flowing

1353
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:13,260
into me, and then I end up
basically just being like a

1354
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:16,500
small little reservoir of a
thing out of which certain

1355
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:21,380
amount can come and my guru is a
giant reservoir, You know, of a

1356
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:24,080
lake or whatever, during saying
where I might be just this

1357
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:27,080
little bottle, you know, but,
but what's beautiful about what

1358
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:30,200
you're talking about also? And
then I would like to just point

1359
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,860
out the humility of saying that
you don't think it maybe applies

1360
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:37,280
to everything else, but the
things that you're saying so

1361
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:42,460
closely resemble my own that I
might want to disagree with you

1362
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:45,640
on that, but I understand the
humility of saying it like that.

1363
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:46,360
So thank you.

1364
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,920
Chris Bache: Okay, yeah,

1365
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:51,820
Unknown: I was curious. Um, I
had a phone call with a there's

1366
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:56,140
a gentleman, Simon Dwan. I found
an article of his in Scientific

1367
01:43:56,140 --> 01:44:00,840
American magazine. He was
writing about, like, oh, he

1368
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:03,720
doesn't think the scientists
will ever figure out if reality

1369
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:07,380
is a simulation or not, but I
feel like, from my perspective,

1370
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:12,840
like I know it is, and I'm
curious, like, if the idea, I

1371
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:15,300
don't know if you saw the movie
The Matrix, if you have any

1372
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:17,460
thoughts related to these kind
of things,

1373
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,500
Chris Bache: well, that's A
pretty popular theme in sci fi

1374
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:25,040
isn't the simulation and the
complexity that we're living.

1375
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:28,280
And quantum theory is telling us
that everything we see in the

1376
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:33,260
visible world is underpinned by
this in this larger, subtle,

1377
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:39,860
real quantum reality. Now 95 96%
of reality is dark energy and

1378
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:43,300
dark matter. So that's telling
us over and over again, that

1379
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:47,800
what we're living is not the
whole of what's what's real. And

1380
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:53,800
to me, physical reality, it
could be described as the skin

1381
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,360
on an apple, you know, and it's
and the apple grows the bigger

1382
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:01,020
the skin gets. The universe is
like. Like that. It gets bigger

1383
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:03,900
and bigger. But when you can,
when you fall underneath the

1384
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:08,460
level of time, space, reality,
fall deeper into it. You're

1385
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:11,880
falling deeper into the apple,
toward the center of the apple,

1386
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:15,300
and in the center of the apple,
of course, it's all light, even

1387
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:18,240
physical reality is composed of
light. But at the center of the

1388
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,500
apple is most radiant,
beautiful, extraordinary light

1389
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:27,260
brilliance in so I think this
idea that there is a larger

1390
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:32,000
reality out there that
structures and informs and

1391
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:37,520
receives this reality, then
after that, then our psychology

1392
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,620
takes over. And so do we see
that reality as threatening? Do

1393
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:47,200
we see that reality as demanding
or manipulative? Do we see it as

1394
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,920
a dark and hostile reality, or
do we see it as a beautiful,

1395
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:55,780
magnificent co creating reality,
you know, and my experience is

1396
01:45:55,780 --> 01:46:01,080
that the mother universe is
extremely so, so creative, so

1397
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:05,760
intelligent, so wise, so loving
and compassionate. And of

1398
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:12,960
course, you just looking at time
and space. If you want to see

1399
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:16,740
the wisdom of life or the little
or the compassion of life, you

1400
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:19,620
have to look very, very deep,
because if you look on the

1401
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:23,360
surface, it doesn't look wise
and it doesn't look compassion

1402
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:27,320
and it doesn't look lovely, it's
a mean ass son of a bitch. But

1403
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:30,980
you have to step back and step
back and step back and look deep

1404
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:35,180
in order to really see the
wisdom that's built into this

1405
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:40,552
amazing laboratory that we're
part of, of growing the human

1406
01:46:40,552 --> 01:46:41,332
experiment, yeah,

1407
01:46:43,312 --> 01:46:45,112
Unknown: sorry, fascinating,
yeah,

1408
01:46:45,532 --> 01:46:46,672
Chris Bache: sure is, isn't

1409
01:46:51,052 --> 01:46:57,652
Unknown: it? Yeah, Chris, I'm
not sure how to draw this up. I

1410
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:10,380
you. I'll speak for myself, some
of the experiences I had in like

1411
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:13,980
the first time was I took nine
months, dropped out, just

1412
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:17,220
meditated several hours a day.
Then what? Two years later, I

1413
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:23,000
did it for six months. And some
of the experiences I had were so

1414
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:36,500
mind blowingly profound that in
loving that I was I was just

1415
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:46,840
left sobbing, sobbing and bliss
doesn't isn't a word that really

1416
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,900
covers it. It just experiences
up. Just never had, never could

1417
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:58,780
imagine I would ever have Yeah,
and they just left me words

1418
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:06,780
Yeah, like, just a pool of
sobbing wonderfulness, yeah,

1419
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:13,200
just, and I just know that you
had a lot of those experiences.

1420
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,020
It wasn't just all rational, oh
yeah, that, oh yeah. This opened

1421
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:20,600
up into that. And did it? No,
it's like some of these ones

1422
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:25,280
that showed up in front of you.
It's like, oh my god. I mean,

1423
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,740
just no words for it. No
language, no.

1424
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:38,120
It's like, you're giving words
for this stuff. It just, yeah,

1425
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:40,540
yeah.

1426
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:45,580
Chris Bache: It's like when the
universe's heart touches your

1427
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:49,780
heart, it just explodes it into
the most magnificent,

1428
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:57,160
dimensional radiance that it
just just there's nothing to do

1429
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:02,100
except have a good cry of joy.
It's just so joyful. It's just

1430
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:05,460
so extraordinary. And that's
why, you know, the word that I

1431
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:09,300
give in the book for the
universe, in this way, is my

1432
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:15,360
beloved, because contact with it
was so overwhelming. It became a

1433
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:19,320
love affair. I mean, it really,
I talked about the rumpled

1434
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:24,380
sheets where we made love. It's
a love affair, and it's it does

1435
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:29,780
it inspires such a hunger for
it, this eternal hunger that's

1436
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:32,900
in our being, not only to
reunite, but to bring that

1437
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:36,860
reality, to experience it
wherever we are right now, right

1438
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:43,720
here. It's so deep. It just,
it's a it's a heartache. To be

1439
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:49,120
separated from it, even for a
day, and to touch it is just

1440
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,900
joy, just joy in the body, joy
in the heart and mind.

1441
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:56,019
Unknown: And it's in it's more
than a worldly joy. You know,

1442
01:49:56,019 --> 01:49:58,899
because we all humans, you know
we can experience joy in our

1443
01:49:58,899 --> 01:50:01,679
daily lives and. Maybe not every
day, but you know what I mean,

1444
01:50:01,979 --> 01:50:05,519
yeah. And these were experiences
that were, I'm a pretty

1445
01:50:05,519 --> 01:50:10,139
articulate guy and like that, I
had such difficulty being able

1446
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:15,839
to put into words some of these
experiences, yeah, other than

1447
01:50:15,839 --> 01:50:20,539
just like the your knees
collapse, I wasn't standing at

1448
01:50:20,539 --> 01:50:22,519
the time that these were
happening. But just like these,

1449
01:50:22,519 --> 01:50:31,039
knee buckling, Soul buckling,
Mind Blow, line, mind blowing.

1450
01:50:31,459 --> 01:50:33,979
Not even know how to, knowing
how to be with it, other than

1451
01:50:33,979 --> 01:50:36,259
just you can't not be with it.
You can't be with you. Just

1452
01:50:36,259 --> 01:50:40,639
there. It's happening. Yeah,
it's an overwhelm in terms of

1453
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:44,439
what the mind can make sense of.
And it's in it's wonderful in

1454
01:50:44,439 --> 01:50:53,919
the highest sense, pure, clean,
clear. And you can't capture it.

1455
01:50:54,219 --> 01:50:59,919
You cannot capture it. You can't
bring it back. At least for me,

1456
01:50:59,919 --> 01:51:02,399
I had to leave it there. I
didn't know how to bring it

1457
01:51:02,399 --> 01:51:07,619
back. And just what gives me
justification to want to keep

1458
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:12,719
evolving expanding, be it
through your model or anybody's

1459
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,959
model that's about being an
evolutional being of

1460
01:51:15,959 --> 01:51:21,319
consciousness, there's such
anchoring experiences that I

1461
01:51:21,319 --> 01:51:24,499
can't ignore them in terms of my
daily life anyhow,

1462
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:28,340
Chris Bache: yeah, and no one
could ever talk you out of them.

1463
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:31,880
Unknown: Yeah. I mean, that's
just, it's like, you go where I

1464
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:36,200
went then try to talk me out.
Yeah, exactly yes.

1465
01:51:36,499 --> 01:51:40,359
Tom Habib: But isn't it
interesting that at the moment

1466
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:45,039
of that type of joy. We touch
sadness too.

1467
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,540
Unknown: I don't experience.
Tell

1468
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:53,800
Tom Habib: me about that. Tom
Well, I know in therapy, like

1469
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:57,040
when, when somebody reaches a
level of intimacy and they start

1470
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:03,360
crying, it's this deep hunger
and absence they've had for so

1471
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:08,280
long. Yeah, and so in the midst
of joy, there's actually

1472
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:12,900
sadness. When you two were
talking, I could feel that

1473
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:18,120
cosmic hunger to know the mind
of God, and when you get a

1474
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:23,240
glimpse of it, I think it's the
same thing. It's kind of good

1475
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:29,060
because there's a humbling awe
going on that moment. And it's

1476
01:52:29,060 --> 01:52:34,100
almost like it's saying to you,
you haven't seen anything yet. I

1477
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:36,920
know you said that there's so
many worries a couple times.

1478
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:41,440
Unknown: This also reminds me of
the book Quantum Questions that

1479
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:45,640
Ken Wilber wrote about how, you
know, all the writings of the

1480
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:49,300
guys who did the work on quantum
mechanics were all very sciencey

1481
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:53,500
beforehand, and they were all
very mystical afterward. And it

1482
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:58,180
seems to me that what you did
was actually examine paradox at

1483
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:01,260
a kind of cosmological level,
whereas they were kind of

1484
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:05,520
looking at it in a I think the
expression that I use in the

1485
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:08,040
breakout room is you were
looking at it through a

1486
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:10,800
telescope, and they were looking
at through a microscope, you

1487
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,220
know. And so they like, there's
a you can see the infinite in

1488
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:17,400
either direction, you know. And
I've had some mushroom trips

1489
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:21,500
where I've had, like, a Taurus
like thing, and I've got it was

1490
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:24,200
literally Ken Wilber in the
middle talking to me about what

1491
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:27,980
was going on on both ends of
that thing. Do you know I'm

1492
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:33,380
saying it's like as the, my, my,
you know, Avatar of Vishnu, or

1493
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:38,420
whatever, you know, to explain
to me was all going on. So it's,

1494
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:41,920
it's really interesting to see
your book in light of having

1495
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,380
already read Kant impressions.
There's a lot of parallels

1496
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:44,680
there.

1497
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,420
Yeah, it's interesting.

1498
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:53,140
Chris Bache: Well, folks, it's
approaching 930 on my time, and

1499
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:56,020
I haven't seen my wife all day,
and she's just come back while

1500
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:59,620
we were doing a talk here. I
think I need to go be a good

1501
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:04,200
husband for a while, how much I
enjoyed our time together.

1502
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:07,140

invitation. Appreciated our

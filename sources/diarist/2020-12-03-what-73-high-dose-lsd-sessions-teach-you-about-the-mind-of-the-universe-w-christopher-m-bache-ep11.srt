Here is your host, Christian
yordanov, hello

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,480
Christian Yordanov: and welcome
to the connective minds podcast.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,420
My name is Christian Jordan of
and thank you so much for

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,940
joining me today on this 11th
episode of the podcast. Today I

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,460
have Christopher M Bache on. We
had a two hour conversation,

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,960
almost. It was a wonderful
conversation, relished every

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,320
single minute of re listening to
it while I was typing up the

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,600
show notes. So much depth to it,
you're in for a treat.

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,760
Basically, the focal point of
the conversation will be Chris's

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,180
latest book, LSD and the mind of
the universe, diamonds from

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,540
heaven, where he it's basically
an account of his 20 year

18
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:31,100
journey of high dose LSD
sessions between 1979 and 1999

19
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,240
where he undertook deep
exploration of his consciousness

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,720
and into the mind of the
universe. As the title of the

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,200
book suggests, we also discuss
his first book, briefly, life

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,140
cycles, which is about
reincarnation. So you're about

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,200
to hear some amazing stuff from
Chris. Really awesome guy. So

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,900
glad he agreed to get on the
podcast. He was actually the

25
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,320
first guest that I approached,
way back in September. So he was

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,100
the first interview I conducted.
So I was extra nervous. I did a

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,460
ton of preparation. I really
immersed myself into his work,

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,400
you know, His books, His videos,
etc. It was a very enlightening

29
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,720
and illuminating experience. He
really opened my eyes to so many

30
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,180
concepts and authors and thought
leaders and pioneers in various

31
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,680
different fields, and I have a
reading list from here till the

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,780
end of I don't know what it's
that long, you know, but, um, so

33
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,580
I really think you enjoy this
episode. I don't want to offer

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,680
too many spoilers. I think the
best thing to do is to just let

35
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,800
Chris speak for the experiences
of you know, hear it from the

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,320
horse's mouth, as it were, even
though we will only be

37
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,820
scratching the surface in this
interview. Of course, he has a

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,260
rather large body of work that I
highly recommend you check out

39
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,820
the of course links and to the
books and to to his website,

40
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,820
some YouTube videos, etc, will
all be in the show notes and on

41
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,680
the website. So yeah, please get
in touch with me. Let me know

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
how you like the episode, and
thank you once again for joining

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,420
me today. Really appreciate you
investing your time in this

44
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,920
podcast. So without further ado,

Chris, thank you so much for

58
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,680
taking the time out to join us
today.

59
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,600
Chris Bache: It's a pleasure to
be with you, Christian.

60
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,360
Christian Yordanov: All right,
so we have a lot of ground to

61
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,440
cover in a relatively short
space of time. So what I would

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,620
like to do is to start with, I
would like if you could please

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:52,000
tell us what were you up to
between the years of 1979 and

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,660
1999 and maybe introduce us to
your journey. Uh, into uh,

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,780
exploration of your
consciousness, but also in

66
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,620
parallel. If you could kind of
tell us how your career

67
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,380
progressed during this time. So
if you could kind of tell this,

68
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,860
I know it's a parallel story
that you lived almost two lives,

69
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,980
if you could kind of show I must
there,

70
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,600
Unknown: yeah, be glad to I came
out of graduate school in 1978 I

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,860
was trained as a philosopher of
religion. I was raised in the

72
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,080
Deep South, got my PhD from
Brown University. I had finished

73
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,020
my dissertation, had done some
published part of my

74
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,280
dissertation, and I was looking
for where to take my research

75
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,140
next. As a young academic, I had
no experience in psychedelics

76
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,280
whatsoever. At that time, I was
30 years old, and I encountered

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,920
the work of Stanislav Grof. I
read his book, realms of the

78
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,080
human unconscious, which was
published in 76 and as soon as I

79
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,620
saw his work on psychedelic
research, I immediately

80
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,340
recognized that this was an
important development, not only

81
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,060
for psychology, but for
philosophers as well, that he

82
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,360
had a method for giving us
experiential access to

83
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,960
dimensions of mind and
dimensions of the Universe that

84
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,460
many people have talked about
and theorized about, but not

85
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,660
many people have had direct
access to so i made a choice at

86
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,300
that point. I was not
comfortable with the choice, but

87
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,080
because LSD was illegal, and his
work was primarily centered on

88
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,880
LSD, at the time, because it was
illegal, I divided my life into

89
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,720
into two parts. In my daytime
job, I worked as a philosophy as

90
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,660
a professor in the Department of
Philosophy and Religious

91
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,600
Studies. I taught courses on
world religion, psychology of

92
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,800
religion, Buddhism, comparative
mysticism, Transpersonal

93
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,200
studies. And in my personal
life, I began a 20 year journey

94
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,440
exploring working with LSD in a
systematic, rigorous manner,

95
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,660
using Stan Grof protocols. I
over the course of the next 20

96
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,960
years, as I progressed through
the academic world, I did 73

97
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,280
high dose LSD sessions,
completely internalized,

98
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,420
completely protected with the
sitter using the traditional

99
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,940
formats, private, safely
protected from the world with

100
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,200
the assistance of a sitter who
kept me safe and secure during

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,940
this process, and I basically
began across this process and

102
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,460
found that it engaged me
systematically into a deepening

103
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,080
and ever deepening exploration
of my own consciousness, and

104
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,120
eventually into a consciousness
that was so large, so vast,

105
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,720
where some people, where I you
could describe it as the the

106
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,800
consciousness of the Divine, but
I often just refer to it simply

107
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,820
as the the mind of the universe.
So while I continue to teach,

108
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,520
and I love teaching, I love
being with the students teaching

109
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:16,020
in these areas, I basically
developed this second life, and

110
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,540
it wasn't until after I retired
from the university and after I

111
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,840
was passed the statute of
limitations for working with

112
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,420
these what our culture deserve
called illegal substances, that

113
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,040
I was really able to begin to
share the full scope of the

114
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,720
experiences that I had had on
this substance and To extract

115
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,520
some of the philosophical
implications of these

116
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
experiences,

117
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,800
Christian Yordanov: right? And
so that was a 20 year journey

118
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,260
that ended in 1999 How did your
career progress over those 20

119
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,920
years?

120
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,680
Unknown: Oh, in a very
traditional manner. I mean, I

121
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,480
was progressed, I mean, promoted
up the ladder as one's does. I

122
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,540
published through the process. I
won two awards at the University

123
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,540
for my teaching. I love
teaching. Love being with the

124
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,340
students. I did the things that
an ordinary professor does. I

125
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,100
worked on committees. I did all
the things that you do at a

126
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,980
university in a department. My
department is a comp. Was a

127
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,920
complex department filled with
philosophers and Religious

128
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,660
Studies professors whom I became
dear and close who became my

129
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,280
dear and close friends over the
course of time. Yeah, it was

130
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,560
just kind of a traditional
academic career,

131
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,779
Christian Yordanov: and you had
three kids along the way, yeah.

132
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,779
So we could say you led a
productive life, contributing to

133
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,159
society. So which I think is
important, because I think

134
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,759
there's still this stigma.
People recoil when they hear

135
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:00,839
someone, even a learned person,
an academic is. You know, did

136
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,099
stuff with psychedelics. They
recoil. And think of this

137
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:08,159
person, you know, they'll never
be a productive member of

138
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,359
society. And it's quite the
contrary. So along the way

139
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:15,479
around, I think 1990 you
published your first book, life

140
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:19,799
cycles. Could you please tell us
what life cycles is about?

141
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,520
Unknown: Life cycle is about
reincarnation. When I was on my

142
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,220
first sabbatical and I could
only write books during my

143
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,920
sabbaticals, I had been
researching reincarnation when I

144
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,940
when I met Stan grofs work. I
also met the work of Ian

145
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,220
Stevenson, professor at the
University of Virginia, and his

146
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,000
work convinced me that there was
he had collected empirical

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,900
evidence that reincarnation was
a simple fact of life. It's

148
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,360
simply something nature is
doing. This completely jarred

149
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
me, because reincarnation had
not been a serious part of my

150
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,100
academic training. It was not
part of my education in western

151
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,940
religions, which is where I
spent most of my academic life

152
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,720
training, nor in philosophy of
religion or the scientific study

153
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,800
of religion. But here it was,
this massive body of evidence

154
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
collected. He's collected
evidence from children all over

155
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,080
the world, from different
cultures who have spontaneous

156
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,580
recall of their previous
lifetime. 90% of the cases he

157
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,520
never publishes because they
don't meet the highest standards

158
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,080
of scientific investigation, but
about 10% of his cases are very,

159
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,720
very important and substantive
cases, indicating that these

160
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,640
children have an accurate and
documented recall of their

161
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,480
previous life. So I wrote life
cycles, after teaching about

162
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,840
this material for years and
introducing it into my students

163
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,040
for years, I wrote this book
basically which begins with a

164
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,180
review of the evidence for
reincarnation coming from Ian

165
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,220
Stevenson and supplemented by
the research coming from past

166
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,920
lives therapists who were
writing a number of very

167
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,840
important works at the time.
Then I explored, once we had

168
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,140
that evidence in place, I
explored what the implications

169
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,280
of the evidence were. What What
difference does it make if we

170
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,620
are growing up in a universe
where reincarnation is a simple

171
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,560
fact of life, so that was the My
First Project. It ruffles some

172
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,380
feathers in my department,
because they weren't expecting a

173
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,460
book like this, but it's gone on
to be published in six

174
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,560
languages, and it became a
staple in my courses, and it's a

175
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,980
very easily accessible and yet
academically sound investigation

176
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,180
of reincarnation.

177
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,820
Christian Yordanov: Yeah, it was
sold out. I've been trying to

178
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:56,140
get it from Amazon for a while,
but you in your book, I believe

179
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,620
you published in 2001 dark
night, early dawn in chapter I'm

180
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,400
actually got that book a couple
of weeks back, I've been slowly

181
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,940
going through it. It's, you
know, it's, it's definitely,

182
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,960
yes, it's not the kind of book.
It's not a light reading book. I

183
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,300
read it in the mornings when,
you know, my brain is still, you

184
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,860
know, optimal. But um, in
chapter two, you you nicely

185
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,740
summarize the, you know, the
stuff you talk about in life

186
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,680
cycles, which I really
appreciate, guys like you that,

187
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,000
judging from the books behind
you, you know, you read books

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,140
and then present the information
to us in a digestible manner,

189
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,240
which I really, really
appreciate. But what was

190
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,180
interesting is that in the cases
of the children who remember

191
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,660
their past lives, it seems like
the average period between lives

192
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,660
is something around two and a
half years, but when people do

193
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,920
past life regression therapies,
it was some somewhere more

194
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,100
around 4050, years, which I
think was Pretty fascinating,

195
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:03,480
because to consider the
implications of your soul or

196
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,780
your being being in between
bodies for such a long period of

197
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,500
time in these dimensions, It's
unfathomable the amount of

198
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,900
learning and development that
could be going on. So that's

199
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,080
just really fascinating. And I
was actually aware of Ian

200
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,200
Stevenson's work before that, so
you know, you don't have to

201
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,180
convince me. But for folks that
are just kind of hearing this

202
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,200
for the first time, Chris has a
really good YouTube video that

203
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm going to link in the
description of this episode

204
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,840
where he talks about, I think
it's about 35 minutes that you

205
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,320
basically present Ian Stevenson
work and then some past life

206
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,740
therapists, accounts of that,
and some books. So there's a

207
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,300
really good resource there on
YouTube.

208
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,780
Unknown: And thank you. And the
important, really

209
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,380
philosophically, the important
aspect of reincarnation

210
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,760
research, I think, is that it
invalidates our dominant

211
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,260
paradigm about consciousness
and. Our dominant thinking in

212
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,460
our culture, university culture,
is that our minds are produced

213
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,900
by our brain. So our brain is
the core reality, and it gives

214
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:16,200
off a glow, which is our mind
and reincarnation. It

215
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,180
invalidates that, because if
there is any period of time

216
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,900
before, between the death of one
personality and the birth of a

217
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,500
second personality, and there is
an organized transfer of

218
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,520
memories from one life to
another. Then there has to be a

219
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,700
dimension of reality where
consciousness can exist

220
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,060
independent of a physical
substrate of the brain

221
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,920
underneath. And that tells us
that the universe is much more

222
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,880
complicated. Has many more
layers to it than where we have

223
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,160
traditionally thought up to this
century.

224
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,000
Christian Yordanov: Exactly that
is beautifully said. So this is

225
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,500
where things like LSD,
Psilocybin, certain other

226
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,480
entheogenic compounds,
psychedelics, if we want to call

227
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,780
them, they seem to be able to
allow us to tap into these

228
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,980
dimensions. They seem to like
open up the gates. So with that

229
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,020
said, Can you, Chris, can you
tell us? You give us an

230
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:25,820
overview, I suppose, of Stan
grofs work, what he contributed

231
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,460
to the Transpersonal field. He,
in a sense, you know, is one of

232
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,680
the founders of the
Transpersonal field. But can you

233
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,920
tell us what happens to an
individual? What happens when

234
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,420
one takes a normal dose of LSD,
let's say, and what happens when

235
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,760
a person consistently brings
themselves into that state, and

236
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,380
what happens when someone takes
high doses consistent? Can you

237
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,880
basically tell us, you know,
discuss the phenomenology,

238
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,560
talking about psychodynamic,
Transpersonal, perinatal, as

239
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,840
Grof laid it out. And then the
contributions you added on top

240
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,980
of Grof s paradigm generally,
and then what you experienced in

241
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,120
your journey, please.

242
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,420
Unknown: Yeah, well, Stan
differentiated in his work. Stan

243
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,540
Grof differentiated between low
dose and high dose psychedelic

244
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,020
therapy. First, we have to
understand in psychedelic

245
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,100
therapy, you're not taking a
psychedelic and engaging the

246
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,380
world. You're not taking a
psychedelic and going to a

247
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,220
concert. You're going into a
highly protected, sheltered

248
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,700
environment, protected from the
outside world, completely

249
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,240
focused internally. You're
wearing eye shades. You're

250
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,200
listening to very carefully
selected music, the whole focus

251
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,100
is on and confronting whatever
is emerging in your mind and

252
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,320
letting it take you where your
mind wants to go. Our

253
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,320
understanding is that LSD and
other psychedelics basically are

254
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,520
amplifiers of consciousness.
They don't take our

255
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,120
consciousness in a particular
way. They simply amplify

256
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,340
consciousness. And so they make
dimensions of our mind which are

257
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,820
far removed, more available to
us. And so when you amplify your

258
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,920
consciousness, and then you sit
in a contemplative manner, and

259
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,180
you focus on what's emerging in
your mind, what often happens is

260
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,600
that your consciousness will use
this opportunity to cleanse

261
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,860
itself, to purify itself, to
empty itself of problematic

262
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,280
experiences that it's carrying.
So we would describe this as

263
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,920
confronting the shadow.
Basically one begins to confront

264
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,640
all the things that worry you,
that scare you, that terrify

265
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,460
you. One confronts things coming
from earlier in one's life, from

266
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,780
childhood, things that have
happened, traumatic experiences,

267
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,720
all the way back to your to your
infancy, all the way back to the

268
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,420
womb. If one continues this
process, the mind reveals that

269
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,780
this is working with low dose
therapy somewhere on the order

270
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:19,200
of 50 to 150 maybe 200
micrograms. So if you keep this

271
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,660
process up, and you go back into
deeper and deeper levels of your

272
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,260
life. Eventually, one gets into
what Stan calls the perennial

273
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,920
level of consciousness, where
you begin to confront the

274
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,120
deepest fears that all of us
share. They're not personal,

275
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,840
they're kind of universal, the
fear of death, the fear of what

276
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,100
happens to us when we die, the
anxiety over whether there is

277
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,820
any ultimate meaning or purpose
to our life since we die, since

278
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,240
everyone we love to dies,
everything that we care about is

279
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,740
destroyed. Is there any larger
purpose or project? And one goes

280
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,480
through the Death-Rebirth
process, which often. Involves

281
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,360
curiously reliving one's birth,
and what emerges over time is

282
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,500
that you are transcending the
limits of your physical

283
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,760
consciousness. So we get here by
being born. We leave the

284
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,720
physical world by dying, and so
the birth and death are all

285
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,480
complexly intertwined in the
psyche, so when one is pushing

286
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,140
beyond the limits of your
physical memory, of your

287
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,860
physical being, physical
consciousness, one is involved

288
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:36,020
in reliving how you got here, as
you transcend out of here, going

289
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,320
into states of consciousness
which transcend physical

290
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,960
reality. And a critical piece of
this is going through what Stan

291
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,580
calls ego death, which is to
say, your physical personality,

292
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,280
your body, mind, ego dissolves,
and you experience a loss of

293
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,000
control and a death at that
level. And then when that

294
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,720
process has completed itself,
one awakens inside a spiritual

295
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,800
reality, inside a deeper level
of existence. And then, if you

296
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,880
go, if you continue this
process, one begins to go deeper

297
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,300
and deeper into that spiritual
reality through the various

298
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,420
levels of Transpersonal
consciousness, which stand

299
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,280
identifies as the psychic,
subtle and causal levels of

300
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,560
consciousness. Now, a different
protocol was developed later for

301
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,940
working with terminally ill
cancer patients. This is these

302
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,060
are patients that were not
trying to be healed. These are

303
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,020
people who are going to die. And
they developed a high dose

304
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,060
strategy working with LSD in
high doses, somewhere between

305
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,520
305 100 micrograms. And the goal
here, this was at the Spring

306
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:54,820
Grove Hospital in Maryland. The
goal here was not to digest all

307
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,240
the different aspects of one's
personal shadow and personal

308
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,280
consciousness, but to break
through that, and to give these

309
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,000
people an experience of
Transcendence, essentially to

310
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,840
give them a glimpse of where
they were going to be going when

311
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,400
their body dies. And it was very
successful, it had a tremendous

312
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:21,260
impact, a positive impact on
death anxiety. So what I did, I

313
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,500
came along, and I'm not a
psychologist, and I wasn't

314
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,040
really interested primarily in
the clinical aspects of this

315
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,060
work. I was a philosopher, and I
was interested in exploring the

316
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,360
deeper dimensions of
consciousness that this work

317
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,220
made possible. So I and in the
early high dose therapy, the

318
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,480
sessions were limited to three
sessions. That was the maximum

319
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,860
that any one person could do. So
I thought, Okay, if you can do

320
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,460
three high dose sessions safely,
then you should be able to do

321
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,440
more than three safely. After
three sessions of working with

322
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,840
lower doses, I chose a regimen
of working with high doses of

323
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,520
LSD, partly for efficiency,
partly because it was a dual

324
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,460
career marriage, it was hard to
find time to schedule one

325
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,320
sessions, and so I I was still
thinking in terms of this being

326
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,880
a personal transformational
process. Was thinking in terms

327
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,140
of clearing out my personal
karma so I could get to

328
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,800
enlightenment faster. I thought
if you worked with higher doses

329
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,240
and you really confronted your
shadow conscientiously, you

330
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,140
would basically be able to
dissolve your karma. It was like

331
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,500
eating a meal, taking bigger
bites out of your karma in every

332
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,740
session. Eventually, this whole
model exploded as my work

333
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,820
continued to deepen, because
after about three years of work,

334
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,360
I was entering dimensions of
consciousness and was

335
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,800
confronting levels of shadow
which far transcended my

336
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,700
personal shadow or anything
related to my personal life, I

337
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,720
was tapping into the collective
unconscious. So what I did to

338
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,240
back up a little bit. What I did
was to do 73 high dose sessions

339
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,940
extended over 20 years. I worked
for four years. I stopped for

340
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,360
six years for reasons that I
give in the book. And then I

341
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,940
continued for another 10 years.
I was doing about, on average,

342
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,260
about five sessions a year. So
every two and a half months or

343
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,660
so I would be doing a session.
And what I found was that

344
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,140
I went through repeating cycles
of death and rebirth, about four

345
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,840
or five cycles of death and
rebirth. And I found that every

346
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,580
that the deep spiritual reality
or Transpersonal reality has

347
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,740
levels to it, many layers to it,
and every time you enter a

348
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,940
deeper level of spiritual
reality or Transpersonal

349
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,740
reality, you have to go through.
Another act of surrender. You

350
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,720
have to let go of your identity
at a deeper and deeper level. So

351
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,100
you go through a series of death
and rebirth experiences. I also

352
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,940
found that each level of
consciousness operates at a

353
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,200
higher level of frequency, so to
speak, it's a much more intense,

354
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,120
energetic level. So it's like,
if you're climbing a mountain,

355
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,380
you have to adjust to higher and
higher levels of altitude, and

356
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,140
you have to acclimate
systematically to that higher

357
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,160
altitude. In this in in mountain
climbing, you're adjusting to

358
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,720
less and less oxygen. In
psychedelic work, you're

359
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,160
adjusting to more and more
energy. So you have to

360
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,440
acclimate, literally, for your
consciousness to stabilize and

361
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,400
have coherent experiences at
these deep levels of reality.

362
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,900
You have to go through not
simply a death experiences, but

363
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,900
experience but you have to go
through a purifying purification

364
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,800
process, you have to empty
yourself of different levels of

365
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,300
your being that in a sense, or
operate at a lower level of

366
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,460
frequency. And if you don't do
this, your experiences at these

367
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,460
deep levels will not be
coherent. They will be

368
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,560
fragmented. You can touch into
these levels, but you won't be

369
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,220
able to maybe recall them. You
won't be able to remember them

370
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,680
consistently, and you won't have
coherent experiences of these

371
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,940
levels. But if you engage them
conscientiously, if you gave

372
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,380
engage them with focus and
determination, my experience has

373
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,460
been that your consciousness
goes through this self

374
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,140
purification process, and your
your awareness at each level of

375
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,100
consciousness gets clearer and
clearer and clearer, so that you

376
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,260
become operational at a deeper
level of reality. And if you

377
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,980
keep pushing the boundary,
sooner or later, you're going to

378
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,840
reach the border of that deeper
level, you'll go through another

379
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,920
purification process, another
death and rebirth process, and

380
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,340
they'll be thrown into yet
another level of reality that

381
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,580
operates by different
principles. It's governed by

382
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,740
different physics, so to speak,
and the process continues. So

383
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,180
basically, that's what I did as
a philosopher. This was the

384
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,620
philosophical adventure of a
lifetime, the opportunity to

385
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,060
explore the the universe or the
mind of the universe, through

386
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,740
exploring, through using the
vehicle of my own consciousness.

387
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,380
Because what I discovered, in
contrast to contemporary thought

388
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,180
that our consciousness is not
individualized. It's not like we

389
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,820
are a an atom, that everything
in my mind is simply a result of

390
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,620
the experiences of my personal
body. What I discovered is what

391
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,760
many spiritual traditions have
taught and many Transpersonal

392
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,640
explorers have discovered is
that the bottom of our mind,

393
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,660
that there actually is no bottom
to our mind, that when you go

394
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,560
deeper and deeper and deeper in
your individual mind, you open

395
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,040
up into the ocean of
consciousness. You open up into

396
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,420
an infinite ocean of
consciousness. So it truly is

397
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,380
the case that our individual
mind is like a wave that arises

398
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,900
out of an ocean of
consciousness, and if you

399
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,980
penetrate this wave, you will
drop into this infinite ocean,

400
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,820
which doesn't dissolve you
immediately into oneness, but it

401
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,140
dissolves you into the ocean,
and the exploration continues.

402
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:46,360
Christian Yordanov: That's
awesome. Now, just to go back to

403
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,480
the, let's say, the more
beginning parts of the journey,

404
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,020
and this is something that Grof
talks about a lot, is the

405
00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:00,840
initial stage of working with
LSD people generally explore or

406
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:08,160
go into the perinatal level, and
this is where various traumas

407
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,500
surface all the way, including
all the way back to birth

408
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:20,180
trauma. But you, in your in your
in dark night, early dawn, and

409
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,940
in LSD and the mind of the
universe you make you have a

410
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:31,160
great analogy of explaining the
COEX systems as the dialog or

411
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,680
the emotions of a protagonist in
a novel. So with that said, Can

412
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:43,840
you give us a deeper overview of
what the perinatal level

413
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,540
actually is, because generally
this is kind of the first thing

414
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,700
that people you know had get
head on with in their LSD work.

415
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,360
What is the perinatal level?
What are the what are coax

416
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,500
systems? What are the four
phases that Grof. Discusses and

417
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,880
what is the therapeutic
potential of allowing yourself

418
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,180
to kind of getting that level
and we experience those, let's

419
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,020
say emotions,

420
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,660
Unknown: a coax system, is a
system of condensed experience.

421
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:21,500
So what we find is that, you
know, the psyche organizes its

422
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,280
memories in many different ways,
but one of the ways it organizes

423
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,420
them is that it groups all of
our life experiences according

424
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,900
to its emotional content,
according to its emotional

425
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,100
themes. So the analogy I give in
the book is imagine if you took

426
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,440
a novel and you underlined all
the passages that have to do

427
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,400
with fear in yellow, and all the
passages having to do with the

428
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:51,160
protagonist experience of greed
in green, say, and anger in red.

429
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,060
And then you cut up the book,
and you took the protagonist

430
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,840
experiences and all you grouped
all the green in one pile, and

431
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,700
all the yellow in another pile,
and so on so forth, that you

432
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,360
would have all of their
experiences of fear clustered in

433
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,440
one pile. And something like
that happens in the psyche, that

434
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,540
when you when you encounter your
shadow, you encounter your

435
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,980
shadow in these clusters of
condensed experiences. So you

436
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,960
often get into it feels almost
like a tornado. There's just so

437
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,640
many layers and layers to it,
and the outer layers are the

438
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,620
most recent versions of those
experiences. And as you get into

439
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,520
the center of the coax system,
you get into the more and more

440
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,060
elemental layers, until
eventually you get to the

441
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,380
fundamental core, the original
trauma, the original

442
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,700
disturbance. And when you in
going through this process, you

443
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:54,340
peel these Coex systems over
time, and then eventually, when

444
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,820
you get to the core, you relive
the core trauma. And when that

445
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,400
happens, the entire Coex system
has been dissolved, and so its

446
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,660
influence on your life has
basically been emptied. So you

447
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,580
can, you melt all your
experiences related to fear, you

448
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,240
melt all your experiences
related to anger, so on and so

449
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,400
forth. Now what Stan found is
that there are Coex systems that

450
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,780
relate to things that happen to
you after you're born, but there

451
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,920
are also Coex systems that seem
to be rooted in the very act of

452
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:36,380
birth itself, so that the act of
being born is a traumatic

453
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,620
experience. Here, the fetus is
floating very peacefully and

454
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,400
comfortably in the womb,
assuming that the mother is

455
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,540
taking good care of herself and
her child in the gestation

456
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,200
process in pregnancy, but then
all of a sudden, that

457
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,660
environment becomes hostile. The
water breaks, and the womb

458
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,440
begins to contract, and the
child begins to be put under

459
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,720
enormous pressure, which bills
and bills, until eventually it

460
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,980
climaxes, and the child being
released from this pressure into

461
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:13,260
a new environment with its
mother and father, that and Stan

462
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,200
broke this process. He found
that there were kind of four

463
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,920
stages of this process, and he
labeled these the four perinatal

464
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,900
matrices, which are coax systems
that are rooted in the perinatal

465
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,480
level of consciousness. And so
they're the the first one that

466
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,420
usually appears. They appear in
different orders, but often the

467
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,900
one that usually appears could
be correlated with the beginning

468
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,460
of labor, where there is
contractions, but no place to

469
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,060
go. The cervix hasn't been
dilated. Then there is

470
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,380
intensification of these
symptoms of contraction, but the

471
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,880
cervix is now opened and there
is a place to be to go. The

472
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,340
Death-Rebirth struggle begins.
This culminates in the final

473
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,620
expulsion from the Mother, the
experience of death and

474
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,840
liberation, and then the
experience of beatific bliss,

475
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,900
perinatal matrix, one of oceanic
bliss and ecstasy. And so what

476
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,100
we find is, if you kind of step
back and look at many people's

477
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,840
experiences who have gone
through this level, what we're

478
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:29,180
finding is is that people are
basically confronting and

479
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:34,820
digesting their entire life as a
physical being, their entire

480
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,740
life as a human being. They are
digesting the experience that

481
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,680
brought them from another
reality into time and space, and

482
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,640
so this is part of the process
of basically allowing your

483
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,040
consciousness to expand beyond
the limits of your physical

484
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,820
identity. So you shatter your
physical identity, but you

485
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,480
dissolve all the constant.
Relations of stress and

486
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,580
traumatic experiences and
anxiety that are involved in

487
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,620
being born at the physical
level, and then you open up into

488
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,920
the world that lies beyond the
physical level. But then the

489
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,600
process doesn't stop there. It's
not simply a matter of getting

490
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,800
into physical into spiritual
reality, but then it's a matter

491
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,820
of going deeper and deeper and
deeper into what appears to be

492
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,520
an infinite and unlimited ocean
of possibilities.

493
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,920
Christian Yordanov: Yeah, you
really, really described that

494
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,240
really well. So it's a very
obviously, the experience of a

495
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,960
psychedelic is a very complex
but we have what you just

496
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,820
described as the perinatal
level. So we also can consider

497
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,680
the psychodynamic level. So you
know, lower doses psycholytic

498
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,920
therapy may elicit more
psychodynamic experiences where

499
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,060
you know the people in your life
and your own emotions, so you

500
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,220
this perennial level goes
deeper. So what then happens

501
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,460
when you, I guess, overcome or
dissolve these coax systems or

502
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,660
these kind of this birth trauma,
when you actually overcome all

503
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,400
of that, what happens then?

504
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,600
Unknown: Then you open up into a
process of remembering who you

505
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,740
are, really, who you are,
underneath your physical

506
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,420
incarnation, who you are,
underneath all your physical

507
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,760
experiences, there is a process
of engaging what you might think

508
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,700
of as the deep structure of the
universe. Now, of course, one

509
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,040
way of in order to understand
what really happens in these

510
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,600
sessions, you have to understand
what's happening in life,

511
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,080
normally, naturally, and that is
reincarnation, for me, is a

512
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,800
simple fact of life. So
reincarnation tells us that when

513
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,240
we die, we expand into another
universe, and then when we're

514
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,300
born, we contract into our egoic
identity. At the end of that

515
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,020
life, we expand into another
universe, and then we contract

516
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:29,000
into a smaller egoic identity.
And this process goes on over

517
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,480
and over again, century after
century, millennia after

518
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,540
millennia. What seems to happen
when you work with an amplifying

519
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,900
substance like LSD is that you
accelerate that process and you

520
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:49,360
deepen the process. So in a
sense, you when you go through

521
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,400
ego death in this process, you
go through a death experience,

522
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,360
which is truly terrifying. It
really does feel like you are

523
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,100
physically dying. It feels like
you are absolutely losing

524
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,580
control. You've lost control of
your life, and you're going to

525
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,820
die. And there is a fundamental
way in which you do

526
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,440
psychologically. You do die, but
when you die, you don't simply

527
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,820
cease to exist. You actually are
reborn into the deeper

528
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:24,320
landscape, into the deeper
tapestry of of consciousness,

529
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,720
and so you begin to explore the
world that you enter when you

530
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,560
die physically. So that's why
there's a it's a strong

531
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,280
correlation between people's
experiences with deep

532
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,220
psychedelic work and people who
have near death episodes. So

533
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,100
people who sort of suddenly have
a heart attack or something

534
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,180
happens and their body stops, or
their body almost dies, and

535
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,960
their consciousness explodes
into a deeper dimension for

536
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,340
minutes at a time, and then they
come back talking about this

537
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,680
other world that they had
contact with. And something like

538
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,440
that happens with LSD work that
you basically more slowly shake

539
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,140
off your physical identity and
open into this deeper, spiritual

540
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,820
universe. And if you return to
that over and over again, again,

541
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,680
working with very, very I mean,
I worked at 500 to 600

542
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:27,020
micrograms every session, very,
very high doses of LSD. Now this

543
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,380
is not a protocol that I
recommend. I do not recommend

544
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,980
that people do this for reasons
I give in the book, but that's

545
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,940
what I did. And those
experiences kind of replicate

546
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,100
the the entry, the experiences
that people who have near death

547
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,020
episodes have you enter into
this deeper dimension. You see

548
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,800
yourself. You see your life on
earth from the spiritual

549
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,140
dimension you you begin to have
contact with the way the world

550
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,440
is organized in spiritual
reality, that there is a

551
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,060
structure. Culture to it, that
there is an organization to it,

552
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,440
and there is a there is a
relationship, actually kind of a

553
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,340
it's almost like a relationship
of physics. There is a

554
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,780
relationship between the way the
spiritual world is organized,

555
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,140
and it is the spiritual world
which gives birth to the

556
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,420
physical world. I mean the Big
Bang, everything that exploded

557
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:29,360
into existence 13.7 or 13 point
8 billion years ago, the entire

558
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,680
intelligence and all the energy
and all the power and the

559
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,600
unfolding which takes place, all
of that came from somewhere. It

560
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,880
came from some reality that is
not physical. Physics stops at

561
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,200
that point and says, We can't go
any farther. But in deep states

562
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,740
of consciousness, you can go
farther. You can enter into the

563
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:56,860
reality that gave birth to the
physical universe. Okay, that's

564
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,660
when you begin this. I think of
it as a, first of all, a

565
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,400
communion. It's because when you
enter this reality, you don't

566
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,320
take your ego, you know, cleaned
up, buffed up. You don't take an

567
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,100
ego into this reality and have
an experience of that reality.

568
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,180
You literally dissolve into that
reality. You lose your sense of

569
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,440
a small reality, and you
dissolve into this larger

570
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,760
reality. And for the hours that
the session takes place, you are

571
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,400
dissolved into that reality. And
then, of course, the drug wears

572
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,880
off, and slowly your
consciousness shrinks back into

573
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,220
your ordinary state. And if
you've worked well, if you've

574
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,540
really created optimal
conditions for this engagement,

575
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,760
you come back with accurate
memories, with strong recall of

576
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,360
where you've been. And it's
important to write down your

577
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,860
notes from your session. Within
24 hours, I had followed a very,

578
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,420
very strict procedure that
within 24 hours of every

579
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,460
session, I wrote a detailed,
accurate description of exactly

580
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,360
what happened in this session,
because this window closes, and

581
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,740
if you wait five days, a week, a
month before you write it down,

582
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,600
you're not going to remember
everything as exactly as you can

583
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,680
when you first come back. And
then, if you do this over and

584
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:31,100
over again, you begin to get a
very coherent travelog of your

585
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,960
experiences in this deeper
reality. And what I found was

586
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,180
that when you approach the deep
the mind of the universe in this

587
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,720
systematic fashion with the
desire to know, a desire to

588
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,220
understand. And you're asking
it, teach me. Show me what is

589
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:53,140
real. Show me what is there that
literally, this consciousness is

590
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:58,120
massive, infinite consciousness
takes you in, and it begins a

591
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,240
systematic process of initiating
you of teaching you what's going

592
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,580
on in this deeper reality.

593
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,460
Christian Yordanov: There was a
couple of questions that came

594
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,780
into my head as you started
speaking, but I think what is

595
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,720
clear is that drugs like LSD can
certainly accelerate one's

596
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,740
spiritual practice, but it's
also very easy to as you write

597
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,360
in your work, it's very easy to
think you have accomplished more

598
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,080
than you have in a single
session. What would you say are

599
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,800
some of the most important
practices that, other than

600
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,440
keeping meticulous notes, of
course, and analyzing your

601
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,220
sessions, what other practices
allowed you to contain these

602
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:50,080
experiences and embody them on a
day to day basis?

603
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,760
Unknown: Yeah, that's an
important question, and it's a

604
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,860
very important issue, because
stabilizing these states of

605
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,020
consciousness and integrating
your experiences in your earthly

606
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,740
life are a real challenge. What
we're finding is that it's not

607
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,220
that difficult to break through
into these dimensions, but to

608
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,160
hold on to them and to integrate
them, first of all, just to

609
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,640
remember them, and then to try
to integrate them and to

610
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,620
incorporate the teachings into
your life is a very, very

611
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,980
important part of the work. So
it's like half of the work is

612
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,640
getting out, and then half of
the work is getting in and

613
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,060
holding on to one of the ways
that this was expressed in my

614
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:37,520
sessions, that spirit said,
there's the dying of seeing and

615
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,740
the dying of keeping. The dying
of keeping is the integrating of

616
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,780
these experiences. So during all
the years when I was doing this

617
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:51,400
work, I was doing spiritual
practice. I mean, I was

618
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,640
basically doing meditation. I
was doing spiritual practice in

619
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,580
different traditions.
Eventually, my spiritual

620
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:01,740
practice centered in the vara
Ian. A Buddhist tradition. But

621
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,640
it began. I began with
Transcendental Meditation. I did

622
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,860
Vipassana meditation. I was
raised in a Christian tradition.

623
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,700
The teaching of Christianity
influenced me very deeply. I was

624
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,060
actually studying to be a priest
for four years when I was in

625
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:22,760
high school and early college.
So I absorbed deeply the values

626
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:30,020
of Christian compassion, self
sacrifice, so on, so forth. And

627
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,920
I also incorporated elements
from Eastern traditions. But

628
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,540
it's really very important for
lots of reasons, to have a

629
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:45,040
strong spiritual practice in
order to integrate and stabilize

630
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:50,920
the experiences that you have in
these short, very intense days,

631
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,560
because these psychedelic
sessions open you to vast fields

632
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,720
of awareness and knowing, but
They also open you to vast

633
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,660
fields of energy. And a daily
practice is really important to

634
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,880
be able to assimilate these huge
fluctuations, these tidal waves

635
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,600
of energy and tidal waves of
knowing that sweep through you,

636
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,200
and you have to have a context
to digest them, and slowly, you

637
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,920
know, roll them over in your
mind and hold them in your heart

638
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,640
and really digest them. So
grounding is really important.

639
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,600
So the grounding of a spiritual
practice, but other areas of

640
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,040
grounding, I mean, as I didn't
quite appreciate it so much at

641
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,960
the time, but when I got, you
know, at the end of my journey,

642
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,920
and was looking back, I really
appreciated that the stability

643
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,700
of my career and the stability
of my marriage and my

644
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,260
responsibilities as a father,
you know, every week I was in

645
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,980
the classroom, teaching my
courses, every day I was with my

646
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,860
children. Every day I was within
a primary relationship, a

647
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,760
relationship with my wife. So
these are very, very stable

648
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,160
grounding activities. I was
grounded as a homeowner. I was

649
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:17,220
grounded in my weekly lifestyle,
and that really provided me the

650
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,380
foundation that allowed me to
open up into these radically

651
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,840
Transcendence states and then
come back and hold them in a way

652
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,580
which didn't cause me to be
fragmented or didn't cause me to

653
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:36,140
be inflated, because one of the
great dangers of working with

654
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,960
psychedelics is psychic
inflation. You can think because

655
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,500
you've had a deep experience,
that you must be a very deep

656
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,220
person, or because you've had an
experience where you've touched

657
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,060
the divine, that you must be a
holy person, but that, of

658
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:57,040
course, is an illusion that's a
fool's delusion. What's because,

659
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,140
what's important in a
psychedelic session, in this

660
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,100
respect, is not what happens to
you on the day of your session,

661
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,420
it's what you can do in the days
following your session, when

662
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,840
you're back in your ordinary
state of consciousness. So you

663
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,100
may experience profound wisdom
in the day of your session, but

664
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,380
how much of that wisdom can you
really concretize and embody in

665
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:26,060
the weeks following your
session. So when you're raising

666
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:30,800
children, when you're married,
they really keep you grounded

667
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,900
and keep and they protect you
from being in having an inflated

668
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,560
sense of your value in the
universe. You know, in the end,

669
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,300
you're just a human being,
shoulder with shoulder with all

670
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,420
the other human beings in the
world, getting by in the world,

671
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,860
trying to do the best you can.

672
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,680
Christian Yordanov: Yeah,
that's, that's what I really

673
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,520
like about you. Seem to have
like zero kind of ego inflation,

674
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,060
despite the fact that you know
you've touched dimensions that

675
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,400
most folks, you know, they have
to live incarnate, many, many

676
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,440
lifetimes to get to that state,
you know, but I'm curious, if

677
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,600
you didn't have that many
responsibilities and that

678
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,920
weren't so busy with this and
that, how often would you have

679
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,140
gone into sessions if you could
have

680
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,020
Unknown: that's an interesting
question. Never never thought

681
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,860
about that.

682
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,680
I probably would have been
tempted to go more often, but

683
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,400
I'm glad I didn't, because I
found that going when you

684
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,580
completely blow your mind apart
and drink deeply from the power

685
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:55,420
and the knowing of the deep
universe, it's an extremely it's

686
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,320
not only a psychologically
demanding experience, but it's a

687
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,160
physically. Demanding
experience. It makes tremendous

688
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,080
demands on your body and on your
subtle energy system, on what

689
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,380
the on your the Chinese would
call your qi, or the Indians

690
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,520
would call your Prana. It's a
very, very demanding process to

691
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,480
open up your entire system and
close it down, open it up and

692
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,860
close it down. And that's one of
the reasons I really don't

693
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:25,580
recommend this particular
protocol. If I were starting

694
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,880
over again, I would do it very
differently. I would work with

695
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,200
lower doses. I would only
occasionally you work with high

696
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,380
doses of LSD. And because LSD is
a kind of psychedelic that tends

697
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,580
to push the cosmological
ceiling. It tends to sort of

698
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,080
push to the stars. I would
balance that with working with

699
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:51,220
other psychedelics like
Psilocybin or Ayahuasca, which

700
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:55,240
are much more kind of body
grounded, kind of states of

701
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,560
consciousness. They open your
system up, but you're much more

702
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,300
kind of grounded in your
emotional body, in your physical

703
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,280
body. So working with the
Psilocybin or body grounded

704
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,300
psychedelics, and occasionally
with the cosmic, logical kind of

705
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,860
high ceiling psychedelics, that
is, I think, produces, overall,

706
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,380
a more solid and secure journey.
But these are things that I

707
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,320
understand now. I didn't
understand these things when I

708
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,320
was doing this work. When I was
doing the work, it was like

709
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,320
pedal to the metal. Let's blow
it out, go as far as you can,

710
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,840
go, drink as much of it as you
can. And i think i i Not only

711
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,560
I'm glad I didn't do more
frequently than I did, because

712
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,100
it really takes time to
assimilate these material but I

713
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:49,840
think probably I went farther
than was healthy for one person

714
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,100
to do. Even though I followed
all the precautions, I really

715
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,480
paid a lot of attention to my
physical body, to stabilizing my

716
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,480
my my world, keeping everything
on an even keel, even so, I

717
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,980
think I bit off a bigger piece
of the apple than is wise to

718
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:15,660
chew. You know, it's just it
took me years and years after I

719
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:21,260
finished my sessions to fully
internalize them. And I don't

720
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,920
really think I've finally
internalized them, even now, I

721
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,000
think I'll be absorbing them for
the rest of my life. And I think

722
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,060
in deep ways, they have impacted
not only the remainder of this

723
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,200
incarnation, but they've
impacted the entire trajectory

724
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,340
of my soul's future
incarnations.

725
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,680
Christian Yordanov: Yeah,
talking about the toll that it

726
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,580
can take, just reading what a
session day was like for you, no

727
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,360
breakfast because of, you know,
the potentially impending

728
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,180
vomiting all day at it, and then
as soon as you're done, you're

729
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,880
up all night, documenting
everything, because you need to

730
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,500
get it on paper as quickly as
possible. So that sounds like

731
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,700
more demanding than partying out
on the weekend, going to, you

732
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,920
know, clubbing so very It's good
that you took good care of

733
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,480
yourself. Yeah, it is

734
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,380
Unknown: very demanding. And
what happens is when you start

735
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,040
to go past the early levels that
you might touch in parting and

736
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,320
you go into the deep levels, and
you don't start again at the

737
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,740
early levels. You start where
you stop. So it's like climbing

738
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,700
a mountain. You establish base
camp one, base camp two, base

739
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,800
camp three. You're working at
base camp three and above, these

740
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,060
are extremely high energy
experiences I found over the

741
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,780
years I had to take more and
more precautions. I had to take

742
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,680
more care of my body. I really
made sure that my body was in

743
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,880
good condition. I watched my
diet very carefully. I would

744
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,620
even I would have massage to get
my body nice and soft and

745
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:06,000
pliant, or do I'd go to the
chiropractor to make sure that

746
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,780
my body was aligned? Because if
you, if you take a body that's

747
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,520
out of alignment into these
states, you're going to feel the

748
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,340
pressure, pressures and pains
that are living within your

749
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:22,640
body. And in addition to that, I
was doing spiritual practice, of

750
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,500
course. And I would do very,
very intense practice for days

751
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:32,360
before my session, and I would
do very intense extra spiritual

752
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,860
practice in the days following,
because this opening is so huge,

753
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,560
you're tapping so deep into the
universe, it's, it's extremely

754
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,400
demanding, and so the demands
are not only on the weekend when

755
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,540
you're doing it, but on the week
before and the week after. And I

756
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,020
found that it took, you know,
the closing of that window. It

757
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,700
closes in stages. It closes
within 24 hours, but then it

758
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:02,400
closes at a deeper level within
three. Days, and it closes over

759
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,020
several weeks, and it really
takes about a month before it's

760
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,320
completely, absolutely closed
again. That doesn't mean you're

761
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,680
you're having psychedelic
flashbacks or anything like

762
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,180
that. It just means that your
entire system opens and closes

763
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,400
organically, and therefore
there's a there's an underlying

764
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,480
deep structure to that rhythm.
So you really, really have to

765
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,360
take care of your life at all
the different levels. And it's

766
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,280
not just, and I learned and that
it's not just impacting you,

767
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:44,440
because consciousness is like an
it's an ocean consciousness. You

768
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,940
know your life is like a
vibration within an ocean, and

769
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,960
are maybe thinking of it as a
lake. And when you do deep work

770
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,560
like this, when you engage and
set a deep ripple like that in

771
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:01,260
motion, it ripples out around
you in 360 degrees, and it

772
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,680
touches and influences the
people that you have karmic ties

773
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,720
to. So that I found that even
though my students never knew I

774
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,140
was doing this work, even though
you know, I never talked to them

775
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:18,000
about it, never shared this with
them, I found that some of my

776
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,100
students began to be activated
in ways that were directly

777
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,120
related to what was happening to
me personally in my session, and

778
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,200
that was what's happening, not
because I was consciously

779
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,140
willing it or I was letting I
was talking about it or

780
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,560
triggering it. It's hap was
happening simply because that's

781
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,600
the nature of consciousness. All
spiritual traditions teach this,

782
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:44,680
that when you engage these deep
dimensions, you don't just

783
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,360
influence your personal life.
You influence the lives of

784
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,200
reality around you, the people
around you. So I found that

785
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:57,340
integrating my sessions, taking
care of my person in the

786
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:01,800
sessions, was only one phase of
it. I also had to take care of

787
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,480
anyone around me who is being
impacted by this work. So there

788
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,360
is a social dimension to working
responsibly with psychedelics.

789
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,760
Christian Yordanov: I like I
like that you took it in this

790
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,140
direction because I was just
about to quote something from

791
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:24,080
your book, LSD and the mind of
the universe, right? So, just,

792
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:31,460
it's a So, basically, this is a
quote you cite from Marie Louise

793
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,140
von Frantz, a lifelong
collaborator of Carl Gustav

794
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:42,100
Jung. Jung had come to a similar
conclusion about the collective

795
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:46,780
import of deep, transformative
work, she wrote, whenever an

796
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:52,000
individual works on his own
unconscious, he invisibly

797
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,320
affects first the group, and if
he goes even deeper, he affects

798
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,780
the large national units, or
sometimes even all of humanity.

799
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,520
Not only does he change and
transform himself, but he has an

800
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,320
imperceptible impact on the
unconscious psyche of many other

801
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:15,780
people. So that's perfect. How
you describe consciousness as a

802
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:22,040
lake or an ocean, and we
literally send ripples, waves,

803
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,080
invisible waves that reach
potentially the ends of the

804
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,820
universe, if there ever were
such a thing. So with with this

805
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:38,540
in mind, could you take us
through what the say mid and

806
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,500
later stages of your journey
were like, What did you What

807
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,240
experiences did you start
having?

808
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,940
Unknown: Well, it took me about
two and a half years and 10

809
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:54,100
sessions to go through the
psychodynamic and Perinatal

810
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:59,500
levels and to go through my
first deep ego death experience.

811
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,980
And I was quite surprised at
what happened next. First, let

812
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,020
me back up in every session, as
this energy bills inside of you,

813
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,400
there are two phases to every
session. There's a cleansing

814
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,960
phase, which is then followed by
ecstatic phase. So there's a

815
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,300
purification stage, where you
begin to encounter really deep,

816
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:27,320
deep disturbances. And if you
surrender to that process, if

817
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,040
you don't flinch and back away,
but if you let yourself be drawn

818
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,980
deeper and deeper into this
pain, whatever it is, without

819
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,700
understanding it, you just go
into it. Eventually, this will

820
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:42,160
reach a peak, a culmination, and
you'll go through some type of

821
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,080
deep surrender, eventually into
another level of death. And when

822
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:51,700
that happens, you're drawn into
a very spacious place, a

823
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,780
transcendent place, where you
move into the ecstatic portion

824
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,240
of the session, where you have a
very positive and. And the

825
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,040
teaching continues at that
level. So what I was surprised

826
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,800
after I went through ego death
and I thought, Well, okay, I've

827
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:12,180
I've reassimilated much of my
own personal shadow, what

828
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:18,480
happened is that I entered a
period that lasted two years of

829
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,680
what I came to call the ocean of
suffering, I began to have

830
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,820
experiences of vast collective
suffering, and I was

831
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:29,480
systematically taken into the
suffering, stage by stage by

832
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,860
stage, deeper and deeper, until
eventually I was experiencing

833
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:39,500
hundreds of 1000s of human
beings, or stretched over 1000s

834
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:46,600
and 1000s of years, all of them
in massive pain and anguish and

835
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,220
anger and killing and
destruction. At first I thought

836
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:55,540
this represented a deepening of
my personal ego death. But

837
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:59,740
eventually, this kept on for so
long and involved so many people

838
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:05,016
that I began to understand that
what I was doing was engaging

839
01:01:05,016 --> 01:01:10,416
some aspect of the collective
psyche of humanity, that not

840
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:14,196
only do individuals have Coex
systems where they consolidate

841
01:01:14,196 --> 01:01:18,876
many, many years of experience
in these thematic clusters, but

842
01:01:18,936 --> 01:01:23,360
that also applies to the
collective unconscious, that the

843
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,500
collective psyche, or the mind
of our species, has an

844
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:32,960
unconscious in which it stores
all of its unintegrated life

845
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,340
experiences. So all the trauma
of war, all the trauma of

846
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,660
droughts and famine, all the
trauma of the terrible things

847
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,420
that human beings have been
doing to each other, those

848
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:47,800
register and collect, not only
at the individual level, but

849
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:53,380
they register and collect at the
at the collective level. And so

850
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:58,600
eventually I came and it took me
a long time to accept this idea,

851
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,520
because it sounded like ego
inflation, even to claim it, but

852
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,960
I think Marie Le vow France is
right. When we do deep work,

853
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,900
personal transformation opens
into collective transformation.

854
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,780
We're working on behalf of
humanity. We're working on

855
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,620
behalf of the entire species,
and the healing which is taking

856
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:24,860
place as we were literally
draining the pain, not out of

857
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:28,400
the personal psyche, but we are
draining the pain out of the

858
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,860
collective psyche. And remember
that it's not like Chris Bache

859
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,000
is private. Ego is draining this
pain, but by this time, Chris

860
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,040
Bache has been shattered. My
consciousness is vast, and I'm

861
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:46,240
it's like the collective psyche
is draining the collective pain

862
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:52,960
out of the collective psyche.
This went on for two years. On

863
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,800
the positive side, when I went
through each session, I went

864
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:01,200
through a series of ecstatically
beautiful, powerful experiences

865
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:05,640
in one whole year, I began to
have experiences of experiencing

866
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:11,040
my life from beginning to end as
a completed whole, as a totality

867
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:15,720
that was finished. It was both
going to happen and had already

868
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,980
happened, and it gave me a deep
understanding of what my life

869
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,960
was about. And then for another
year, I was taken in a series of

870
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:29,480
initiations deep into the
universe, taken back into what

871
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,780
appeared to be the very
beginning of the universe, and

872
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:38,060
was given a teaching about the
evolutionary dynamic, which

873
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:42,460
eventually culminated in a
series of experiences about

874
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:47,980
where humanity is going, where
humanity is in its historical

875
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,920
development, what is the next
stage in its evolutionary

876
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,700
progression? But eventually the
ocean of suffering came to an

877
01:03:54,700 --> 01:04:01,260
end. I went through this
profound final death experience

878
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:06,060
there, and I was catapulted into
what I came to recognize as what

879
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:10,920
I would call archetype of
reality. So there was a personal

880
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,760
reality, death, ego death, and
there was a collective reality

881
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,660
death. At this level, I was
catapulted into archetypal

882
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:23,420
reality, and I began to have
experiences which are very

883
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:26,660
unnerving in the beginning,
because I had the experience

884
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:31,400
that there is a level of reality
that is more real than time and

885
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,540
space, over and over again, when
I went back to this reality, I

886
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:39,500
was in a domain that was more
real than time and Space, and in

887
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,300
some ways, which was the
generative matrix, which

888
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:48,520
produces time and space. It was
like Plato's cave. You know the

889
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,600
man in Plato's cave, where he's
chained and he only sees the

890
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,380
shadows of reality reflected on
the cave, but eventually he

891
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,680
leaves the cave and encounters
the reality that's producing

892
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,840
these. Shadows. It is as if I
had entered a reality that was

893
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,620
producing the reality that we
know of as time and space, and

894
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:11,460
then I spent about a year and a
half exploring this dimension of

895
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,120
reality and having many
experiences of the collective

896
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,840
psyche, learning how the
collective psyche works,

897
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:25,100
learning how it is that all of
our individual minds are cells

898
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,660
within this larger tissue of the
mind of the species, and that

899
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:34,280
the species is part of the
larger tissue of the mind of the

900
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,600
planet, the mind of the
universe. I spent about a year

901
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,980
and a half exploring these
dimensions. And then I went

902
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:46,960
through another Death-Rebirth
process, and was catapulted into

903
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:55,000
what you might call the domain
of causal oneness. I was

904
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:02,400
catapulted into a level of
reality where all boundaries,

905
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:10,440
all divisions, all all divisions
became permeable, and I began to

906
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:16,500
experience the universe as a
singularity, as a single entity,

907
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:21,020
living and breathing As one, so
that everything taking place

908
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:27,980
inside physical reality were
simply small life forms that

909
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:32,360
were basically transparent to
the fundamental life of the

910
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:37,040
universe that's living within
it. It's like being experiencing

911
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,440
a forest where there are 1000s
of trees and hundreds of

912
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,400
different species of trees, but
you're experiencing the life

913
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,180
that flows through all of the
trees, the sun and the moisture

914
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,960
that flows through all of the
trees, and doesn't care whether

915
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,980
it's nurturing a pine tree or an
oak tree or, you know, doesn't

916
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,020
care. It's only the one. And I
had so I had many experiences of

917
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:06,840
oneness, experiences of what the
Buddhists would call a Shunyata,

918
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,920
emptiness of self, because when
you're experiencing the world as

919
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,840
one, you know that your
individual life doesn't have

920
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,020
private existence. Your
individual life, it is

921
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:24,140
individual, but it's open and
it's porous, and it it is a

922
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,280
you're breathing in and
breathing out constantly, the

923
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:33,260
larger reality of oneness. I had
experiences of the primal void,

924
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:40,240
the the primal matrix out of
which all reality emerges, over

925
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:47,800
and over again, microsecond by
microsecond from there, after

926
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,840
about a year in that reality, I
know I'm going very fast through

927
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,920
this material, but I went
through yet another death and

928
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:03,600
rebirth experiences, and I was
catapulted into a reality of

929
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:10,020
light. I had experienced cosmic,
cosmic light many times, but I

930
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,400
was catapulted in a domain of
light that was exceptionally

931
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,240
clear, just hyper, hyper, clear
dimension of consciousness that

932
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:24,320
was clear, crystalline, clear
beyond imagination. It is the

933
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:30,380
domain that Buddhism calls
Dharmakaya, the clear light of

934
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:35,360
absolute reality. I called it
the diamond Luminosity, the

935
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:41,464
domain of diamond Luminosity, an
absolute ecstatic.

936
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:49,264
Transcendent reality in that
over the last five years of my

937
01:08:49,264 --> 01:08:55,384
work and 26 sessions, I made
contact with this reality, I

938
01:08:55,384 --> 01:09:00,720
dissolved in this reality only
six, only four times, four times

939
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:07,140
in five years, in 26 sessions.
In between those four times, I

940
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:11,400
was going through again deep,
deep, intense purifications,

941
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,580
deep catharsis around just
purifying and purifying and

942
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:18,900
purifying in order to allow to
be allowed to enter back into

943
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:25,012
these hyper clear, hyper, pure
states of awareness. So I guess

944
01:09:25,012 --> 01:09:28,792
I would differentiate five
different levels of reality that

945
01:09:28,792 --> 01:09:31,852
I went through over all this
time. There's the personal

946
01:09:31,852 --> 01:09:36,292
level, which culminated in ego
death, the collective level

947
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:40,600
where you're working basically
cleaning portion, some portion

948
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,040
of the collective psyche of
humanity, the archetypal level,

949
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:50,380
then the level of causal
oneness, and then the level of

950
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,820
the diamond Luminosity. It was a
long journey

951
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:58,120
Christian Yordanov: that is
absolutely fascinating, and I

952
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,500
would highly encourage folks to.
To check out the book or at

953
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,220
least some of your videos where
you discuss this in a little bit

954
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:11,400
more depth. Because, you know,
when we, when we look at folks

955
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,960
that have experienced near death
experiences, when we, you know,

956
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:21,080
we see what the what the Tibetan
Buddhists when they talk about

957
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:27,320
entering the Bardo of death.
They do discuss that we see a

958
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:34,400
light, but most of us are not,
say, developed enough to realize

959
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:39,440
that's our own essential nature.
So do you think this could be a

960
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,660
part of what the Buddha
experienced under the body tree,

961
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,660
this kind of experiencing this
light. What do you think these

962
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:49,780
experiences are something the
Buddhist, the Tibetan

963
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:53,440
meditators, these guys are
experiencing, getting into these

964
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,780
states after, you know, years
and years of meditation. Do you

965
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,280
think it's possible without?
LSD,

966
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,880
Unknown: it sounds arrogant, I
know to even suggest touching

967
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,960
into that which the Buddha
touched into, but I think it, I

968
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:15,660
think it is the cosmology of the
understanding of the universe

969
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:19,800
that emerges in psychedelic
states is basically the same

970
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,360
cosmology that emerges in the
great mystical traditions of the

971
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,900
world, the understanding of the
Bardo, the understanding of the

972
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,960
post death domain, the
understanding of the fundamental

973
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,820
union and oneness that underlies
all existence. We're tapping

974
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:38,960
into the same reality. And it's
really important to understand

975
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:46,180
first that when you're working
with psychedelics, you're

976
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:51,280
tapping into this reality in a
temporary manner. When you're

977
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:56,980
working with meditation and the
sort of slower contemplative

978
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:03,060
methodologies which take longer
to mature, you gain access in a

979
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,500
more abiding fashion to these
realities. So I don't want to

980
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:13,380
suggest in any way that my
experiences of these realities

981
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,880
were were comparable in terms of
their significance to the

982
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,500
experiences the of the great
spiritual masters of our

983
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:25,940
different spiritual lineages,
not at all, but even to have

984
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:33,740
temporary access to these
realities. Change forever. They

985
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:38,120
change your life forever. They
completely banish your fear of

986
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:44,500
death. They allow they revise
your complete understanding of

987
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:48,160
the world that you live in, of
how the world works. And also

988
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:53,920
these experiences are very
useful to use in your daily

989
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,660
meditation practice. That even
have temporary access to some of

990
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:03,540
these dimensions of real, of
reality, then can be used to

991
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:09,420
deepen and accelerate your daily
contemplative meditation

992
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:14,820
practice. So I think there is a
correlation there. I would place

993
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,180
the diamond Luminosity
experience in what the Buddhists

994
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:24,020
call extra Samsara reality that
is Samsara, is the world of

995
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:29,000
individual existence, the world
of cyclic existence. And so that

996
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,100
includes everything in the
physical universe, where

997
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:34,700
everything arises and falls,
arises and falls, but also in

998
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:38,780
spiritual reality. When you die,
you enter the Bardo, multiple

999
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:43,420
levels of reality where
everything is temporary.

1000
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:47,440
Everything is it's much longer
than physical reality, but

1001
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,200
still, everything is temporary.
That's part of the world of

1002
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:55,720
reincarnation. But then it's
possible to go outside that

1003
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:59,500
entire system, outside the
system of death and rebirth,

1004
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:04,740
outside the reality of Samsara,
and I think that's what I was

1005
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:09,120
tapping into in the diamond
Luminosity work, and that's what

1006
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:13,980
is held as a possibility in all
the deepest spiritual

1007
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:19,500
traditions. Dharmakaya is the
highest level of reality that

1008
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:26,360
one taps into in the varana
Buddha's tradition, again, I do

1009
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:31,400
not I'm not a mystic. I'm not an
enlightened being. Temporary

1010
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:36,380
access is different than
permanent access all honor to

1011
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:39,860
the great masters who have
abiding, permanent access to

1012
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:45,460
these realities, but even just
to touch them temporarily is a

1013
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:47,800
profound life changing
experience.

1014
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,720
Christian Yordanov: Agreed,
agreed to know, and I like, I

1015
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:57,160
like again that you're very you
know you exercise humility. But

1016
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:06,960
I. I think it's, it's what they
do say, we all have the Buddha

1017
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:13,680
nature, like the core of mind is
our, you know, our essential

1018
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:18,780
nature. Yeah, I think the
Tibetans also call it Rigpa. But

1019
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:23,420
we, if we, if we are all part of
this universe, which is, like

1020
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,780
you say, it's all the divine, we
must have the spark of the

1021
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:31,400
divine within us. So to be able
to access it, whether it's for a

1022
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:37,160
second or a lifetime, is
certainly significant,

1023
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:42,400
especially with with our current
egoic minds that have so many

1024
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:49,360
layers, so many layers of of
complexity that obscure this

1025
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,180
essential nature. So I think
it's, yeah, it's good that

1026
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,060
you're humble, but these are
very important experiences. And

1027
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,880
we know, we know there are some
research being done that

1028
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,820
Psilocybin can induce a mystical
experience in people. And these

1029
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:06,480
are very important things in our
especially in our world today.

1030
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,860
And this is actually maybe,
let's go a little bit back from

1031
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:16,200
the diamond Luminosity in terms
of you didn't make some before

1032
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:16,380
we go

1033
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:21,140
Unknown: quite there. Let me add
something that you just said in

1034
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:24,800
my own sequence of experiences,
after getting contact with the

1035
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,660
diamond Luminosity domain and
that extra Samsara reality, my

1036
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:35,780
experiences actually pivoted and
began to lead to a deeper

1037
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:40,160
internalization of that reality,
so that eventually it brought me

1038
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:45,820
back into right here, right now,
my present life, my present

1039
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:52,600
mind. And it uncovered this
Buddha nature, this essential

1040
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,740
nature, which is right at the
very center of my mind and at

1041
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:05,280
the center of all of our minds.
It is a hyper clear, transparent

1042
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:09,900
reality, out of which all
emotions arise, out of which all

1043
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:14,580
sensation arises, out of which
all thought arises. It neither

1044
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:19,680
begins nor ends. It doesn't it's
not private. It's universal. It

1045
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:24,140
is our essential nature. When we
tap it, we know that we're

1046
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:29,720
tapping into the essential
nature of all beings. It, it

1047
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:34,880
doesn't change. It doesn't
become better. It neither begins

1048
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:40,600
nor ends. It has no boundaries,
and yet it is the most

1049
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:46,180
fundamental level of our own
being, and to tap into it is

1050
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:50,200
like finding diamonds in your
pocket. I mean, it's just the

1051
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,140
most precious thing in the
world, and here it is, right in

1052
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:56,860
the center of our own mind. And
it's impossible to be without

1053
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:01,620
it. We don't pay attention to
it. Usually we don't rely on it,

1054
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,740
but there it is. It's always
waiting for us. It's always

1055
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:08,580
there. It's always nurturing us,
and it's patiently waiting for

1056
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:12,180
us to turn our attention away
from the world outside of us,

1057
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:16,020
back into the world that's
within us. And when we go deeply

1058
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:23,960
enough, we find this extra
ordinary truth waiting for us.

1059
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:28,940
And I want to differentiate you
don't have to go through all the

1060
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:33,860
experiences that I went through
in order to find this. You know,

1061
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:37,220
I differentiate the use of
psychedelics for spiritual

1062
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:41,620
awakening, which is what we're
talking about here, and using

1063
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:45,760
psychedelics for cosmic, logical
exploration, you don't have to

1064
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,580
go through archetypal reality.
You don't have to go back to the

1065
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,220
birth of the universe. You don't
have to explore the deep

1066
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:56,320
structure of Bardo reality in
order to clear your life in a

1067
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:01,860
way that allows you to have
immediate, daily access to this

1068
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:06,180
fundamental nature that's living
inside of you that is what you

1069
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:11,460
are at the deepest level. And so
I just want to make clear

1070
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:12,659
Christian Yordanov: that getting
goosebumps,

1071
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:18,900
Unknown: yeah, you don't. You
know it's like what I did really

1072
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:23,240
is best described in terms of
the project of cosmic logical

1073
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,420
exploration. I wanted to
understand the deep structure of

1074
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:29,960
the universe. I wanted to
understand how things work. But

1075
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,560
you don't have to go through
that in order to rest in your

1076
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:39,560
own essential nature. That is a
much more kind of targeted

1077
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:44,740
project in one spiritual
practice.

1078
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,620
Christian Yordanov: Well, you
are, you know, a scholar,

1079
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:52,060
academic philosopher, so it's, I
think most humans cannot

1080
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:55,360
undertake what you did, even if
they wanted to. I'm sure there's

1081
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,260
a few guys out there that will
follow, attempt to follow in

1082
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:02,640
your footsteps. Steps, and you
know, God bless them, and best

1083
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:09,720
of luck to them, you know, but I
don't think most people will

1084
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:15,000
have the resolve to go through
to because a byproduct of your

1085
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,920
experiences as as beneficial
they are to your souls.

1086
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:27,440
Evolutionary trajectory. You've
also contributed a significant

1087
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:31,220
amount of thought to, you know,
the Transpersonal field,

1088
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:36,380
critical appraisal of the you
know, the near death literature,

1089
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:43,600
the the reincarnation work. So
there's a lot of you've made a

1090
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,340
great contribution as part of
your work, right? But, um, what?

1091
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,980
There's a couple of there's
actually quite a few directions

1092
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,860
I want to take it, but I'd like
to actually go back, because we

1093
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:56,620
will definitely come back to the
light and the diamond

1094
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,840
Luminosity. I feel like this is,
this is a topic that needs a

1095
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,420
little bit more discussion
before we finish up. But let's

1096
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:07,980
just go back to a little bit
earlier in the journey. So in

1097
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:11,460
the book, I believe the chapter
was called The Birth of the

1098
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:14,700
future human. So you did mention
a little bit about that. But can

1099
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:18,720
you, can you tell us what
visions you had about the

1100
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:22,220
trajectory of our human
evolution.

1101
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,880
Unknown: Well, what I'm going to
describe now, I know sounds

1102
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:35,120
fantastic, I know it sounds
seemingly arrogant to even

1103
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,560
suggest that a human being can
have these kinds of experiences,

1104
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:43,240
but I have no recourse except to
simply describe what happened.

1105
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:47,620
And I think that chapter, the
birth of the future human, is

1106
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:51,160
probably the most important
chapter in the book, and it's

1107
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:55,060
the most surprising to me and
unexpected, because when I began

1108
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,520
this work, I thought this was
about my personal

1109
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:02,640
transformation, my personal you
know, whatever, whatever. But

1110
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:06,240
what I found was as the work
deepened, once I reached a

1111
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:12,780
certain point, once I about 23
sessions into the process, when

1112
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:16,860
I would move into the ecstatic
portion of the session, I began

1113
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:21,320
to be shown things. And what I
was being shown was consistent

1114
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:26,780
session after session, starting
from the 23rd session, going all

1115
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:31,580
the way to the 70th session.
Periodically, from time to time,

1116
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,020
I would be drawn deep into what
I would call deep time. Deep

1117
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:41,140
time is a level of of reality
where time behaves differently

1118
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:44,740
than it does inside time and
space. I was taken outside

1119
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:50,320
linear time into deep time, into
a not into eternity, not where

1120
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,640
there is timelessness, but into
a deeper dimension of time

1121
01:22:54,640 --> 01:23:01,740
itself. And I was shown things
about where humanity had come

1122
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:05,880
from and where it's going first,
I was shown that the entire

1123
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:11,340
evolutionary project is rooted
in a profound cosmic love, and

1124
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:15,840
that everything that's happening
to us inside time and space is

1125
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,660
part of this process of
creation. And creation emerges

1126
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:26,960
out of love, and it's always
suffused with love. And that, I

1127
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,920
was shown over and over again
that humanity is coming to a

1128
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:38,300
significant shift in its future,
a profound catharsis point, a

1129
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:43,300
bifurcation point in its
history, and that we were on the

1130
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:48,820
on the verge of a profound
spiritual awakening, a profound

1131
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:57,460
transition in our history as a
species. It really was I began

1132
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:02,280
to realize that nature simply
isn't trying to awaken

1133
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:07,560
individual human beings. Nature
is in the process of awakening

1134
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:11,820
the entire human species, that
there is something taking place

1135
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:16,260
at the very core of our
collective psyche. And then,

1136
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:20,220
once again, we're looking at a
species which is reincarnating

1137
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:23,540
over and over again every 100
years or so every just you know

1138
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,200
life pulsating with life,
pulsating with life, and that we

1139
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,620
were evolving, not only
individually, but we were

1140
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:36,080
evolving collectively. And I
kept being shown we're coming to

1141
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:42,100
a turning point, a major turning
point, a profound awakening of

1142
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:46,540
the human of spirituality within
the human heart, a profound

1143
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:51,760
tapping into the oneness that
underlies all existence. Because

1144
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,300
the ego is a magnificent thing.
The ego is beautiful. The ego is

1145
01:24:55,300 --> 01:25:01,260
individual awareness, but the
ego lives in. A divided reality.

1146
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,860
So there's your reality, my
reality. Everybody's in separate

1147
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:09,060
realities, but oneness is the
reality that we all emerge out

1148
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:13,440
of. Oneness is our common core
reality. And there was coming.

1149
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,820
It showed an explosion of
oneness within the human heart

1150
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,160
and a society which is rooted in
oneness, in the experience of

1151
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:26,480
oneness creates a different
social structures and different

1152
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,260
social forms than a society
which is rooted in the Division

1153
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:34,820
of ego. So I kept being shown
that there is this turning point

1154
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:38,540
coming, that there was this
spiritual awakening coming, but

1155
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,920
it never explained to me how it
was ever going to happen, how

1156
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:48,100
this was going to take place.
And then in 1995 in my 55th

1157
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:56,680
session, I went through what was
to me, a seminal experience. I

1158
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:01,080
went through into deep time. I
went into the deep future, and I

1159
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:05,400
went through the death and
rebirth of our species. I went

1160
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:09,060
through, instead of ego death or
collective death, I went

1161
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:15,720
through, I experienced a major
global crisis that was being

1162
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:21,440
driven by ecological crisis
being driven by global climate

1163
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,800
change and all the derivatives
of global climate change, but

1164
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,660
which triggered a crisis in all
of our governing structure, all

1165
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:34,760
of our economic structures, all
of our political structures that

1166
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:39,680
basically this was a crisis that
was putting enormous pressure on

1167
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:44,140
the human species and causing
enormous suffering for the human

1168
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:48,880
species. I was experiencing
this, not as Chris Bache, but I

1169
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,840
experienced it as the species
itself. I had dissolved into the

1170
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:58,120
species mind. I experienced a
period of increasing loss of

1171
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:02,340
control, inability to control
the outcome of circumstances,

1172
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:05,640
inability to control the
circumstances of one's life.

1173
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:10,200
Families being torn apart, just
a crushingly painful experience.

1174
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,040
And what I saw, what I
experienced, or what I was

1175
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:18,720
shown, was these experiences
were so widespread, it wasn't

1176
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,220
like any other period of history
before. If there is a hurricane

1177
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,520
that impacts one country or one
part of the world, it doesn't

1178
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,160
touch the other parts of the
world, but this was an

1179
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,280
experience that was touching all
the people on this planet,

1180
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,240
wherever they live. And that
means it was registering not

1181
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,900
only in their individual lives,
but it was registering in the

1182
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:43,420
collective psyche itself, and it
was hyper energizing the

1183
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:47,320
suffering that we were going
through was hyper energizing the

1184
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:51,100
collective the field of the
collective psyche, and driving

1185
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:56,200
it into what physicists would
call non linear conditions. So

1186
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,600
physicists differentiate between
systems that are operating in a

1187
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,160
linear mode. And then systems
which become so highly

1188
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:09,000
energized, they operate into a
non linear mode. And when

1189
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,900
systems are in non linear modes,
things can happen that can't

1190
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,800
happen in linear conditions.
Small changes produce large

1191
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,800
outcomes. Things can happen
very, very fast, and nature

1192
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,000
pulls out from within it, higher
forms of integration, higher

1193
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,020
forms that did not that were
always potentially present but

1194
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:35,540
weren't there. Before I mention
this, because what happened in

1195
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:40,600
the session is that as this pain
got worse and worse, we came to

1196
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:45,700
a point where it looked as if we
were going to die. This was a

1197
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:49,720
massive extinction event for the
species. But just when we had

1198
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:56,740
gotten to that breaking point,
the storm as it were, passed and

1199
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:02,340
we survived, and when we began
to pick ourselves up off the

1200
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:07,680
ground, so to speak, and rebuild
our lives. We were different. We

1201
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:12,120
had been changed. There was
something about this profound

1202
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:18,720
catharsis, this profound
inheriting and shedding of the

1203
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:23,540
karma of our past as a species,
something about the way this

1204
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,980
trauma had broken us down and
forced us into

1205
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:35,180
into a new openness of heart,
into a new depth of mind, into a

1206
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:39,620
new depth of sharing with other
human beings. The way that

1207
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:42,460
happens in a crisis. You know,
when there is a huge social

1208
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:45,700
crisis, suddenly people are
helping each other, they're

1209
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:50,680
working together. This was
happening, and it opened up a

1210
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:56,500
future. I saw a future emerging.
I experienced a future emerging

1211
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:01,200
where human nature had been
changed. Changed. It wasn't just

1212
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:04,140
that our political system had
been changed, our industrial

1213
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:09,180
system had been changed, but the
fundamental core of human nature

1214
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:13,920
had gone through a pivot, and we
were now operating out of a

1215
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:18,000
different collective psyche. We
were operating out of a

1216
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,120
collective psyche that knew
things that previously only

1217
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:29,600
advanced spiritual beings knew
we had access to the universe,

1218
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:34,580
which paralleled the access that
the great saints and saviors of

1219
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:39,380
history had had, but now it had
been sufficiently internalized

1220
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:44,560
that had become part of our DNA.
So to speak, we were, we were

1221
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:49,000
literally spiritually awakening.
We had awakened into oneness.

1222
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:53,200
And when we began to move
forward, we built a different

1223
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,500
society. This is what I came to
call the birth of the future

1224
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,860
human. That's, I think, what's
happening in history we have

1225
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:05,460
entered now the labor of
birthing the next iteration, the

1226
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:09,720
next formation of the future
human. This future human has

1227
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:14,280
been gestating inside us for
1000s and 1000s of years as we

1228
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:17,700
live and die and live and die
and reincarnate again and again,

1229
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,480
we have been growing and
developing and growing and

1230
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:25,160
developing, but the ego still
tends to dominate our lives and

1231
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:29,660
our choices. But it was as if in
this crisis, something

1232
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:34,640
shattered, Something opened and
our our deep consciousness, our

1233
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:39,800
soul consciousness, exploded
forward in the human psyche, and

1234
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,540
we began to live out of a
different psychological basis,

1235
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:48,400
and we began to create a
different world. And then later,

1236
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:54,940
after this 55th session, in the
70th session, again, I was taken

1237
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:59,560
deep into the future and was
given the experience of the

1238
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:04,620
future human. I dissolved into
this archetype of the future

1239
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:12,300
human. And if I try to describe
this being, I'll probably end up

1240
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:17,400
crying, just because this being
is so magnificent. We are giving

1241
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:20,660
birth to a new child in the
universe. This being was extra

1242
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:25,280
ordinary, magnificent, a heart
that had been healed of all the

1243
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,280
traumas of all the wars and all
the terrible things we've been

1244
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:32,540
doing to each other at our lower
level of development, a heart

1245
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:37,400
that was profoundly encompassing
and encompassed the whole

1246
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:42,160
breadth of the human family, and
a mind that was profoundly

1247
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:47,140
clear, able to download
information from the cot, from

1248
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:50,740
the mind of the universe,
capable of knowing things, the

1249
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:54,580
sustaining levels of awareness
that previously only great

1250
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:59,380
geniuses and great spiritual
beings had been able to sustain.

1251
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:03,780
This was an awakening which is
changing the very foundation of

1252
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:07,740
life on this planet. This is, I
think, what we have entered. I

1253
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:11,460
mean, I think the covid 19,
perhaps, is simply the overture

1254
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:16,320
of a crisis which is going to
deepen as global climate change

1255
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,800
impacts us at deeper and deeper
levels. We know we're going into

1256
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:24,320
a hard time. We're nowhere.
We're going into a time of deep,

1257
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:28,100
deep disruption. What's
important to understand, I

1258
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:31,700
think, from a spiritual
perspective, is what's actually

1259
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:36,800
taking place. What's actually
taking place is that we're in

1260
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,960
the process of burning off a
huge amount of personal and

1261
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,860
collective karma. We are burning
off the consequences of the

1262
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:49,180
choices that we have been making
as a species, while we have been

1263
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:52,000
operating out of a private
consciousness, out of an

1264
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,440
individual consciousness, where
I can make my life better if I

1265
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:59,800
push off the same pain and
suffering onto other persons.

1266
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:03,840
But now we are beginning to
create a profound sense of

1267
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:07,560
oneness consciousness, where we
are beginning to build a world

1268
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:11,460
which truly does work for all.
This is a spiritual,

1269
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:16,140
transformational process. It's
an evolutionary process, and

1270
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:20,600
it's a process which is being
driven, not so much at the

1271
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:24,200
individual level, individuals
are cooperating with it, but

1272
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,140
it's being driven by the
intelligence of the universe

1273
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:32,360
itself, just as it has driven
all the other quantum jumps that

1274
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:36,140
have taken place in the
evolutionary process, it's

1275
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:42,820
likewise now Taking humanity
into this deep jump in its in

1276
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:47,860
its archetypal structure. We are
living in hard times, but we are

1277
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:51,700
living in extraordinarily
important and times which will

1278
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:55,480
lead to a magnificently
beautiful outcome if we do our

1279
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:59,740
jobs well, if we really dig deep
and do our jobs well.

1280
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,640
Christian Yordanov: Like you. I
think you like to say that we

1281
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:08,940
chose to be here. Yes. When we
do more, we chose Yes. I think

1282
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:11,520
Unknown: every human being on
this planet before they

1283
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:16,440
incarnated in spiritual reality,
they could see what we were

1284
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:19,380
getting into, they could see
what they were getting into, and

1285
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:23,660
they chose to be part of it. So
there are no victims here. There

1286
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:27,860
are just people, actors in a
place, so to speak, who made

1287
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:33,140
conscious choices to be on this
planet during this time when it

1288
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:36,980
is going through this
convulsion, convulsive period in

1289
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:41,380
the end, when we die, we don't
die. I mean, we die clearly, and

1290
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:45,160
there is mourning to be done.
But at a deeper level, the soul

1291
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:49,900
doesn't die. And in a deeper
level, we come back, we keep

1292
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:54,340
coming back, and we continue to
participate. And this is, this

1293
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:59,500
is how life works. I mean, we
are going through a process, and

1294
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:03,180
humanity will be here for
another, for millions of years,

1295
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:06,900
for billions of years. Yet, I
mean this, we are evolving in

1296
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:10,620
the life of the universe. We are
being taken somewhere extra

1297
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:14,640
ordinary. And even though my
personal Chris Bache won't live

1298
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:19,860
to see it, my soul will
participate it in sub in later

1299
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:25,400
reincarnations, as we all will.
It's a it's a deep and because

1300
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:31,580
we all chose to be here, I think
we can get we should get past

1301
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:36,440
quickly the anxiety of being
here. We can simply roll up our

1302
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:41,320
sleeves and get to work doing
the work that we chose to do

1303
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,660
before we incarnated,

1304
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:48,460
Christian Yordanov: and this is,
you know, perfect again, you set

1305
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:52,900
me up perfectly for what I
wanted to discuss next. I've

1306
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:57,580
been thinking about, you know,
death a lot lately, which for

1307
01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:00,960
many of my peers, it would be
like, what's wrong with you? Are

1308
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,440
you depressed? But I think this
is such a such an important

1309
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:10,440
thing to think about and even
more importantly, get over so

1310
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:16,500
you can get on with your
mission, your intent that you

1311
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:20,900
came with here. So I know you've
said this on in other places,

1312
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:27,500
but I would like to share this
with my audience. What I and you

1313
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:32,840
already kind of mentioned some
stuff. But how do you when you

1314
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,380
think about your own personal
death as Chris Bache? How do you

1315
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:37,220
think about that?

1316
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,720
Unknown: Well, one of the
consequences of doing this work

1317
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:48,100
is that I have no fear of death
whatsoever. In fact, death is

1318
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:51,760
something I'm looking forward
to. I'm not eager to push it.

1319
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:57,400
I'm not going to run off and
kill myself, but I have no fear

1320
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:01,080
of it because I have already
tasted the world that I'm going

1321
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:07,500
into when I die, and to be
afraid of death is to be trapped

1322
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:12,720
inside the physical world, and
to be trapped in the illusion

1323
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,500
that the physical world is the
only world that's real. When so

1324
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,320
many areas of research are
showing us that this is just

1325
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:25,280
simply not true. The physicists
have shown us that 96% of the of

1326
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:29,600
the universe is invisible, dark
matter and dark energy. So only

1327
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,200
4% of the universe is physical
matter is manifesting as

1328
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,040
physical matter near death.
Episode. Research is showing us

1329
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:41,200
again and again that when we
die, we enter an extra ordinary,

1330
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:46,180
beautiful dimension we enter, we
return home, so to speak, to the

1331
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:50,800
reality that we were in before
we incarnated. Reincarnation

1332
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,040
research is showing us that we
go back and forth over and over

1333
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:57,340
again between the spiritual
reality and the physical

1334
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:00,960
reality, not because we're being
punished, but because we are

1335
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,800
choosing to participate in the
conscious creation of this

1336
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,960
species, in this conscious
universe, I'm not afraid of

1337
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:13,500
dying. I look forward to it in
the sense that, of course, I

1338
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,560
look forward to graduating. I
look forward to returning to the

1339
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:24,740
domain of bliss. It's kind of
like when we're born. The hard

1340
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:32,540
work begins when we die, we
graduate into into returning to

1341
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:36,800
a deeper level of knowing, to a
deeper spiritual reality. Now,

1342
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:42,040
of course, if you go through a
deep enough spiritual death and

1343
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:47,440
rebirth in your physical life,
then you don't have to die in

1344
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:51,160
order die physically, in order
to die psychologically. There

1345
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:55,960
are beings, great beings, who
are in their physical body, but

1346
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:59,200
they are complete. They are
already living the bliss of

1347
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,720
spiritual. Reality inside their
physical existence. And I think

1348
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:06,660
this is where we're going. We
literally are creating heaven on

1349
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:12,540
earth in that by going through
our own developmental process,

1350
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:19,920
we are physically alive on
Earth, but inwardly,

1351
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:24,920
spiritually, psychologically and
even physically. In some ways,

1352
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:30,920
we become so transparent to the
infusion of the spiritual world

1353
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:35,300
that we are literally mingling
Heaven and Earth inside the

1354
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:39,440
vessel of our physical body. So
that when we speak about someone

1355
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:43,900
who is spiritually awakened or
spiritually liberated. Another

1356
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:46,900
way of thinking about that is
they have simply become

1357
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:52,000
transparent to the energies of
the spiritual universe. They

1358
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,280
don't have to die in order to
die spiritually. They are

1359
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:02,760
already living in the spiritual
world inside their physical

1360
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:07,320
body. And when you have enough
of these experiences, when you

1361
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:10,860
go through death and rebirth,
often enough, one of the things

1362
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:15,240
you learn is that you can't die.
You're the essence of what you

1363
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:18,600
are. Can't die. Chris Bache will
die. The shell, the shell of

1364
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,920
Chris Bache will die. The
physical form will die, but the

1365
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:26,240
essence of the individual does
not die. The essence of the

1366
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:30,860
individual continues to live in
an even greater and more

1367
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:35,900
luminous and more love soaked
reality. So if there were any

1368
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:41,020
one thing that I wish I could
bring from my work and and give

1369
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:45,880
it to people, it would be the
loss of the fear of death

1370
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:49,600
Christian Yordanov: that's so
important. I think, yeah, now,

1371
01:41:51,220 --> 01:42:02,040
when you enter the Bardo and you
see the light, what do you maybe

1372
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:06,420
this is an A question that you
cannot answer at the level of

1373
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:12,000
Chris Bache. But what do you
think you will do when you see

1374
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,280
the light, when you merge with
the light, when you become the

1375
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:18,120
light you think you will ever
come back in human form?

1376
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:28,400
Unknown: Well, I've decided to
put that decision in the hands

1377
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:35,060
of the being that I will be
after I die. I have spent so

1378
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:41,020
many days exploring the beauty
of that spiritual universe at so

1379
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:45,640
many levels that naturally,
there is, in me, a profound

1380
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:52,660
desire, even a need to explore
that universe more. And there is

1381
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:59,740
a longing to enter more deeply
into this magnificent universe.

1382
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:06,900
So naturally there is I would
rather be there than be here,

1383
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:13,740
but I basically trust that when
I'm there, I'll know better than

1384
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:19,380
I could know here. What would be
the best thing for me to do and

1385
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:23,420
how to support our collective
developmental process than I can

1386
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:30,440
know here. So I just have rolled
that decision into my into my

1387
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:34,760
soul, into the consciousness
that will hold Chris's life and

1388
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:38,120
merge it with all the other
lives that this soul stream has

1389
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:43,480
had. And I'll let that decision
be made then twice.

1390
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:50,740
Christian Yordanov: So just as
we wrap up, maybe let let the

1391
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:55,300
listeners know why you decided
to stop your sessions in 1999

1392
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:56,080
please.

1393
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:03,600
Unknown: Well, as I explained in
the book, I stopped for two

1394
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:12,720
reasons, one was pain and one
was heartache. Basically, as

1395
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:16,320
I've mentioned, these
experience, these states of

1396
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:19,740
consciousness are so intense,
they involve so much of a

1397
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:24,620
increase of our energy, I found
that my my physical system was

1398
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:28,940
was running very hot, my subtle
energy system was running very

1399
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:35,180
hot. I was having more and more
difficulty integrating the the

1400
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:40,480
sheer energy that it takes to
enter these states in my

1401
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:44,980
physical incarnation, and I did
lots of spiritual practice that

1402
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:48,340
helped. But in the end, I began
to understand that I was really

1403
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:54,100
running too hot, and I need to,
needed to stop and let my my

1404
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:58,240
body calm down, to let my subtle
energy system calm down. There

1405
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:01,140
was no pathology. I was not.
Having any flashbacks or

1406
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:06,600
anything like that, but I needed
to sort of cool down some, so to

1407
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:11,940
speak. But that's not the main
reason I stopped. The main

1408
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:18,300
reason I stopped was heartache.
Once you have known the joy of

1409
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:23,060
dissolving into light, of
becoming light once you've known

1410
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:27,740
the joy of dissolving so deeply
into the crystalline body of the

1411
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:32,360
Divine, coming back into time
space, at least into the

1412
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:36,740
incarnation that I have the
limitations of my present

1413
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:41,500
incarnation, coming back into
this time space, reality it's

1414
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:46,660
just painful. It's it's so
difficult to go from such

1415
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:54,400
exquisite intimacy with Infinite
Being back into private, finite

1416
01:45:54,400 --> 01:46:00,780
existence. The going out and
coming back was getting was

1417
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:04,920
becoming too hard, and
eventually I asked the universe,

1418
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:09,780
and I called my beloved, I asked
my beloved never to take me back

1419
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:15,540
this deeply until I could stay
with her forever. And that's

1420
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:21,748
when I stopped the sessions. I
was surprised by what happened

1421
01:46:21,748 --> 01:46:26,668
next. I found that it took
years. I thought I had had so

1422
01:46:26,668 --> 01:46:29,908
many I'd been given so many
gifts, I'd had so many blessings

1423
01:46:29,908 --> 01:46:34,288
given me, that I could simply
stop my session step back, and I

1424
01:46:34,288 --> 01:46:38,908
had a wealth just to digest for
the rest of my life. But what I

1425
01:46:38,908 --> 01:46:43,060
found instead, well, that's true
that that's part of it, but the

1426
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:48,820
other part of it was that I
found I had in me a deep and

1427
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:53,560
profound longing to return to
these states of diamond

1428
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:58,780
Luminosity, and I knew I I
couldn't return to them. I it

1429
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:01,440
wasn't good for me to return to
them anymore in this

1430
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:06,060
incarnation, I knew I would not
go back there again until I

1431
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:10,920
died, and I could, if I took a
massive dose of LSD today, I

1432
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:13,800
would not return to these
dimensions. It takes years and

1433
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,640
years and years of sustained
work to develop the energy and

1434
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,800
the momentum to enter these
states of being. So I knew I was

1435
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,000
waiting until I my physical life
died before I could really

1436
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,760
return. And there was a
tremendous unfulfilled kind of

1437
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,960
longing for more communion as
long as I was returning to these

1438
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:43,780
states periodically, once a year
or so, this imbalance had not

1439
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:48,580
manifested. But once I stopped,
I realized that I was there was

1440
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:53,200
an imbalance that I had created
between too much Transcendence

1441
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:57,220
and not enough imminence. Now,
the entire physical universe is

1442
01:47:57,220 --> 01:48:00,720
the body of the Divine. It's not
like I was going into the divine

1443
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,840
and coming out of the Divine,
but I was going into the

1444
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:08,340
transcendent divine and coming
back into the physical divine,

1445
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:14,580
into the imminent divine. And it
took me about 10 years to really

1446
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:19,740
make my peace with this and to
really get completely

1447
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:26,540
consolidated to being
comfortable and to be at peace

1448
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:30,920
living inside the physical
universe again in my physical

1449
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:35,240
condition. But I also discovered
that part of the sadness that I

1450
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:39,320
experienced in ending my
sessions was that my culture did

1451
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:42,880
not allow me to talk about these
things. I just, you know,

1452
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,940
because psychedelics are
illegal, I couldn't talk about

1453
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:49,300
it at the university. I'm a
philosopher, and I love to

1454
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:53,680
teach, but I wasn't allowed to
do philosophy drawing from these

1455
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:56,620
very important experiences. I
could not share them. I could

1456
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:59,920
not talk about them. And if
you're not allowed to talk about

1457
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:03,720
these deep and profoundly
important things, it tends to

1458
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:09,840
make you sick inside. So for me,
finally giving myself permission

1459
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,960
to tell the story of this
journey, to share it with other

1460
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,280
people, not because, not because
I'm special in any way, but

1461
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:21,260
simply that these experiences
might be useful to other people

1462
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:25,100
in their own spiritual journeys
and their own social journeys,

1463
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:30,200
that actually represented a
process of putting together the

1464
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:34,040
two halves of my life that I had
separated. I had separated my

1465
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:38,360
academic life from my spiritual
life, and now I was beginning to

1466
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:44,320
put them together and to and to
bring myself into wholeness

1467
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:52,060
again. So the heartache that I
experienced when I stopped my

1468
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:58,120
sessions has begun to be
soothed, and as this integration

1469
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:01,800
process has deepened in. Writing
of the book, and in the

1470
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,860
beginning to have conversations
like the one we're having,

1471
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:12,180
something interesting has been
set in motion. It is as if the

1472
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:17,400
Divine is not waiting for me to
come back to it when I die, but

1473
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:23,060
it is as if the Divine is
beginning to come for me here so

1474
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:28,580
there is a deepening sense of
peace, a deepening sense of

1475
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:40,240
permeability to the ever present
divine dimension of life, even

1476
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:45,100
inside the nuts and bolts of our
physical existence.

1477
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:53,200
Christian Yordanov: Beautifully,
said, Chris, I want to thank you

1478
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:53,980
for your work.

1479
01:50:55,480 --> 01:51:00,480
Just I was going over LSD and
the mind of the universe over

1480
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:05,580
the weekend, just I have almost
every third page in this book is

1481
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:09,240
dog eared and the top is double
dog eared in certain places

1482
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:12,840
where it's really important for
me to go back. I have a list of

1483
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:16,320
probably a couple of dozen
authors whose work I need to

1484
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:20,160
investigate that came out of
you. I want to thank you for

1485
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:23,780
bringing them all to our
attention, for synthesizing

1486
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:30,500
their work, for undertaking this
exploration of yours and

1487
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:34,040
bringing it to the world. I
really want to thank you for

1488
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:40,040
that, and I really appreciate
your time just before you can

1489
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:43,960
tell us where to find you and
your work. Can you tell us, do

1490
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:49,360
you what do you what in terms of
continuing your teaching? What

1491
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,820
is your plan for the future? Do
you want to plan to run more

1492
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:53,800
books, or you were saying
something about workshops?

1493
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,980
What's your kind of plan for
next, whatever, few years?

1494
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:06,360
Unknown: Well, I'll tell you
when I wrote LSD in the mind of

1495
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:09,420
the universe, or, as I prefer,
the title diamonds from heaven,

1496
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:17,040
I had a deep sense of closure. I
felt like I had finished my

1497
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:21,560
life's work. I had done what I
was came here to do in sharing

1498
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:25,400
this information, but I love to
teach. I love to be with the

1499
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:28,820
people. Covid 19, of course, has
interrupted all of those things,

1500
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:33,800
but I love to be with the
people, and I love to explore

1501
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:38,540
these topics and conversations.
So I hope opportunities will

1502
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:47,560
will occur. I look forward to
entering into retreats, to do

1503
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:51,160
retreats with people, just to
have to open up the thought of

1504
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:55,660
psychedelic conversations and
circle so that I can not only

1505
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:59,020
talk about the experiences that
I have, but that other people

1506
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:02,280
can have the opportunity to talk
about the experiences that there

1507
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:06,720
have had, because clearly, all
of our experiences together are

1508
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:09,780
more important than any one
person's experiences by

1509
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:14,820
themselves. So I hope that to be
doing retreats, you know,

1510
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:18,180
shorter retreats, longer
retreats, week long retreats.

1511
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:23,480
I'm not sure how this is going
to materialize, but I hope that

1512
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:28,220
after the pandemic kind of
eases, there will be

1513
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:34,460
opportunities. I mean, I've
been, I don't I'm not very good

1514
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:37,640
at self promotion, and I'm the
I'm kind of adverse to self

1515
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:41,440
promotion, so I don't even have
a website developed yet, but if

1516
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:46,840
people want to contact me, they
can contact me at the email

1517
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:51,280
address. It's on the back of my
book. It's cm Bache, my initials

1518
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:58,240
and my name@ysu.edu which is my
university email address, and

1519
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:03,180
within a couple of months, my
website should be up, and the

1520
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:08,340
name of that website will be
Chris bache.com so if someone

1521
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:11,880
wants to reach me, they'll be
able to reach me there, and

1522
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:15,300
they'll be able to keep in touch
with what teachings I'm doing,

1523
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:18,420
where or what talks I'm giving
at Chris bache.com

1524
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:25,580
Christian Yordanov: Awesome. And
your books can be found. Can you

1525
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:28,940
briefly just summarize your
books? I know we touched on a

1526
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:32,480
couple of them, but can you just
briefly see if we can pique

1527
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,340
people's interest to explore on
their own?

1528
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:41,260
Unknown: Well, there, there are
four books. Yeah, I hope there's

1529
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:47,080
not more books coming. You never
know. The first book is life

1530
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:51,820
cycles on reincarnation. The
second book is a book called

1531
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:56,200
dark, night, early dawn, which
was published by the State

1532
01:54:56,200 --> 01:55:00,600
University of New York Press and
Academic Press. And it's a. So,

1533
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:03,300
you know, it's a challenging
book. I mean, I'm really kind of

1534
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:07,440
using all my academic muscle,
but I'm also beginning to share

1535
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:10,680
my psychedelic experiences, and
I'm trying to integrate

1536
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:15,060
psychedelic research, near death
episode research, and out of

1537
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:17,760
body research, out of body
research, the work of Robert

1538
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:24,680
Monroe. So I'm really kind of,
it's a major kind of exploration

1539
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,980
of the implications of
Non-ordinary states of

1540
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:31,820
consciousness. And then I wrote
a book called The living

1541
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:35,300
classroom, because, as I
mentioned, my students were

1542
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:39,680
being impacted by my own
psychedelic work, and I began to

1543
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:43,900
understand that there are fields
of consciousness that grow up

1544
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:47,200
around groups, and that it
wasn't simply that they were

1545
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:50,680
having resonance experiences
with me, or that somehow I was

1546
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:54,400
triggering these experiences in
them, but the groups of

1547
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:57,520
learning, there were fields of
learning that were growing

1548
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:01,680
around my courses and that were
influencing the learning of new

1549
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:05,700
students as they entered these
courses. And so I wrote a book

1550
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:09,240
called The living classroom,
which was also published by SUNY

1551
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:14,280
press. And all these books are
available on Amazon. And then

1552
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:18,780
finally, I've written LSD in the
mind of the universe, which

1553
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:22,700
really is kind of coming out of
the psychedelic closet and

1554
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:27,740
really laying out what has
really been the driving source

1555
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:31,220
of inspiration behind all of my
work. Because even though I

1556
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:35,300
don't talk about psychedelics in
life cycles, and I don't talk

1557
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:39,980
about psychedelics in the living
classroom, once you know the

1558
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:44,740
full story of my psychedelic
work, you can understand how

1559
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:50,980
those books came out of that
work, and express that work, and

1560
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:54,940
even though I integrate it with
all of the scientific research

1561
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:58,720
and the philosophical research
that's present in those books,

1562
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:02,280
experientially, the driving
inspiration came out of my

1563
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:07,740
psychedelic work. There is an
academic work. Thank you.

1564
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:13,200
Academia.edu. Is basically where
all of my articles that I've

1565
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:18,000
published are can be found at
that website. It's so if you go

1566
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,540
to academia.edu and just punch
in. Chris embache, you'll get to

1567
01:57:23,540 --> 01:57:26,600
a page where you have access to
all of my research.

1568
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:29,240
Christian Yordanov: Yeah, we'll
have all the links in the

1569
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:34,760
episode show notes. Um, yeah,
actually, just to in terms of

1570
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:37,400
your, just to go back to your,
it's a great body of work,

1571
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:41,080
because, like I said already,
you've synthesized so much. And

1572
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:45,580
what we were saying before we
started is that bookcase behind

1573
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:49,660
you, you actually gave away more
than half, I think two thirds of

1574
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:53,560
your books after you retired. So
I said it to my girlfriend

1575
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:59,740
earlier today. Said this guy I'm
interviewing today, not only is

1576
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:03,240
he twice my age, but he's you
the books you and me have read.

1577
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:06,900
This guy's probably right, like
100 times more books, right? So

1578
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:12,000
it's, it's truly, truly an honor
to converse with you over the

1579
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,900
last couple of hours. Thank you
so much for spending the time

1580
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:20,660
with us, Chris and yeah, God
bless. Thank you.

1581
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:24,980
Unknown: Thank you, Christian.
It's a pleasure, a deep pleasure

1582
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:28,340
and an honor to be with be with
you and to be with your

1583
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:30,260

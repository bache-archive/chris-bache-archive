00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,520
Chris Bache: The idea that we
all have to get past the same

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,640
finish line at the same time in
order for things to work out

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,880
right, we all have to be saved
before we die, or something like

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,080
this. That doesn't make nearly
as much sense as we are we are

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,500
developing flower garden. We are
different types of flowers,

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,380
which are developing and
emerging over large periods of

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,860

great joy to be with you on new

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,140
thinking aloud today.

38
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,300
Chris Bache: Thank you, Emmy,
it's wonderful to be in

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,560
conversation with you.

40
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,559
Emmy Vadnais: This is our second
interview together, although we

41
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:51,879
also had a live stream. And in
that first conversation, we

42
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,839
talked about your great book,
LSD, in the mind of the

43
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:58,839
universe, diamonds from heaven.
And I'll link to that interview

44
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:02,699
in the upper right corner of the
screen in your book, and in that

45
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:08,159
conversation, you shared about
how through your 73 LSD

46
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,639
sessions, you experienced many
deaths and rebirths. And today

47
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,179
we're going to explore the
notion that it sounds like you

48
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:22,519
came to an understanding of that
we all have our own individual

49
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,019
or personal karma, and that we
do reincarnate for the

50
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,459
collective good or benefit of
all toward what you describe as

51
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,779
the future human. Yeah, to get
us started, how did you become

52
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:40,959
interested in this topic of
personal but also collective

53
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,499
karma and reincarnation. Well,
the first

54
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,100
Chris Bache: book I wrote as an
academic was life cycles,

55
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,940
reincarnation and the web of
life. So I was interested in

56
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,720
reincarnation. Early in my
career, I encountered Ian

57
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,020
Stevenson's Research at the
University of Virginia. At about

58
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,400
the same time, I encountered
Stan Grof research in his book,

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,840
realms of the human unconscious.
So I really, I took in

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,700
Stevenson's research, you know,
deeply, and I began to see the

61
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,820
world in a way that I had never
seen it before. I began to see

62
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,180
the world in terms of
reincarnation, through a lens of

63
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,600
reincarnation, understanding
that every life is continuation

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,780
of lives lived in the past and
is leading towards lives in the

65
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,720
future. So I began to study the
evidence for reincarnation, and

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,980
I studied a lot of past life
therapy cases, and I began to

67
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,700
sort of understand the deeper
mechanisms of how lives start

68
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,060
many things they don't get
finished, and they sometimes

69
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,900
experience injury and wounds
that don't get healed, or they

70
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,920
have hopes and expectations that
are not fulfilled, and those

71
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,760
transfer into subsequent former
lives, not in a simple or

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,260
simplistic way, but in a very
common. Complex and subtle way

73
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,240
that we are living, in a sense,
the continuation of projects

74
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,960
that began before our life and
our life will lead to a

75
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,480
continuation of projects after
we die, after our body dies. So

76
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,500
that was all kind of working
itself out my mind, and then

77
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,320
when I entered into my
psychedelic work that was all

78
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,980
affirmed, and that was
elaborated. I had numerous

79
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,900
experiences of former lives and
the reality of reincarnation is

80
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,700
just a fact of life, was
presented as kind of a natural

81
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
exposition of spiritual reality,
and how the physical world and

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,020
the spiritual world are deeply
intertwined in this evolutionary

83
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,120
process. But all of that thought
of so far is all on the level of

84
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,000
personal karma, you know,
personal cause and effect,

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,360
personal choice conditionings
transferred from lifetime to

86
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,760
lifetime, but in the process of
doing the psychedelic

87
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,640
exploration, I also dropped in,
began to drop into levels of

88
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,700
consciousness that were not
personal, but were collective.

89
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,780
Jung's concept of the Collective
Unconscious is an early

90
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,280
exploration of this idea, but I
dropped into levels of reality,

91
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,320
of conscious reality, where the
working unit was not an

92
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,520
individual human being, but the
working unit was an entire

93
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,220
species. And I began to have
experiences that were working

94
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,340
themselves out in my individual
psychedelic sessions that were

95
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,420
not personal. They were really
focused on collective dynamics,

96
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,680
so that I describe in a chapter
called the ocean of suffering,

97
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,380
entering into what I later came
to understand were memory

98
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:02,100
matrices held in the collective
psyche of all the suffering that

99
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,060
members of its species had
experienced, if it was

100
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,660
unresolved by the time they
died, memories of war, of

101
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,440
killing, of rape, of pain,
drought, incest, just lots and

102
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,660
lots of painful memories. And I
began to understand that just as

103
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,840
the individual can be burdened
by their past trauma, the psyche

104
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,080
of this of the collective
consciousness of our species is

105
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,520
likewise burdened by its
collective trauma. And then so

106
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,400
that led to a deepening of an
understanding about the

107
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,100
relationship of individual and
collective karma, individual

108
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,720
karma and collective karma, that
really is the fundamental theme

109
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,520
of my second book, dark night,
early dawn, that has to do with

110
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,420
examining that when you get
very, very deep, that boundary

111
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,260
between the individual and the
collective dissolves, and it

112
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:05,340
leads to a much, much more
dynamic relationship between

113
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,400
what's happening in our
individual lives and what's

114
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,760
happening in this life of the
species of which we are part.

115
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,580
And that, of course, is
contextualized within the life

116
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,940
of the planet, the life of the
galaxy, so on and so forth. And

117
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:25,880
so I just had many experiences
of being initiated into the life

118
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,800
of our species at a collective
level. So I would I dissolved,

119
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:37,280
not like into the mystical state
of oneness with God, but before

120
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,860
getting to that, I dissolved
into the consciousness of our

121
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,380
species, and I began to have
experiences of how the species

122
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,200
is evolving through collective
karma and collective

123
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,600
reincarnation, and individuals
within that matrix are evolving

124
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,140
through individual karma and
individual reincarnation.

125
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Emmy Vadnais: Before we go any
further. I know we mentioned

126
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,720
this in our previous interview.
You we are not suggesting that

127
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,140
people engage in LSD per se in
order to have these same

128
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,520
experiences. Yeah, it's not
necessary, right, for a person

129
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,560
to get in touch with these parts
of themselves, to use those

130
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,260
substance necessarily,
absolutely.

131
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,520
Chris Bache: I mean, what I did
was illegal. I did it because I

132
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,900
felt that it was wrong for these
important mind opening drugs to

133
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,960
be made illegal. But I would
never recommend that anyone else

134
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,940
break the law. And there are
other techniques that we can use

135
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,660
in order to get access to these
deep levels of consciousness.

136
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,620
This is simply just one of the
ways that I entered into this

137
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,120
domain. I also did three years
of hypnotherapy exploring my own

138
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,660
former lives. In that process
that nothing to do with any

139
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,800
psychedelics at all.

140
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,220
Emmy Vadnais: You have a whole
career as a professor of

141
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,660
philosophy of religion. What can
you share with us about the

142
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,520
spiritual evidence, if you will?
And then we can go to the

143
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,000
scientific evidence as well for
reincarnation.

144
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,180
Chris Bache: Well, I start on
the empirical side, I found Ian

145
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,840
Stevenson's work intellectually
and philosophically compelling.

146
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:33,020
He and his teams have done
research and contacted 1000s of

147
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,800
children around the world who
have spontaneous memories of

148
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,100
their most immediate previous
life, and he was able to

149
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,860
document those memories at
sufficient detail to be, I

150
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,720
think, intellectually credible
and overwhelmingly providing

151
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,480
overwhelming evidence that
reincarnation is just a fact of

152
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,900
life. Then later, when I began
to study in past life, therapy

153
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,480
literature, and I began to watch
and work with people who had

154
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,420
experience helping people
remember their deep past in

155
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,280
order to heal, but also in order
to bring forward, consciously

156
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,420
the many gifts that are stored
in their past. Because not all

157
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,380
you know, we have a tendency to
think that we inherit mostly

158
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,520
problems from our past. But
that's not true. We inherit all

159
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,140
the all the pluses, all the
benefits, all the the hard work

160
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:37,580
they've done in certain areas.
In my meditation, I began to

161
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,620
experience the boundaryless
nature of consciousness itself,

162
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,620
that so I knew that there were
dimensions of my mind, my

163
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,280
consciousness, that were
Transpersonal, that went beyond

164
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,240
my personal identity. And then
when I went into deeper

165
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,900
psychedelic work, I had many
experiences which showed me that

166
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,400
reincarnation is simply true.
It's just a fact of life. And

167
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,060
Stevenson's evidence is really,
really important, but it's the

168
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,860
tip of the iceberg, because it
by itself, his evidence does not

169
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,600
give us a comprehensive picture
of how reincarnation works, how

170
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,440
the universe is working in
reincarnation. And there's so

171
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,580
much we don't know. I mean, I
want to say up front, we don't

172
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,480
have any idea of what the
physics of the soul is. We don't

173
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,040
know how consciousness leaves at
death and brings all the

174
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,700
memories forward. We don't
really understand the physics of

175
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,000
how that consciousness
reintegrates with another

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,340
incarnation, how its store of
knowledge interacts with or

177
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,260
interfaces with genetic
conditions, genetic and social

178
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,800
conditions. We there's so much
that we don't know. There's a

179
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,080
lot to be learned with research
ahead. But experientially, when

180
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,000
you remember your previous
lives, and when you you run deep

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,380
into the fabric of life, so that
you begin to understand that our

182
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,780
entire species is reincarnation
generation by generation. It's

183
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,200
not just individuals who are
living and growing. The entire

184
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,140
species is living and growing
collectively in that process,

185
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,540
it's just there's theory and
then there's direct experience.

186
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,200
And in this case, theory and
direct experience reinforce each

187
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,560
other,

188
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,060
Emmy Vadnais: yes, in your
experiences, using LSD and other

189
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,680
forms of substances to take you
deeper, beyond your personal

190
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,060
self, you described how you
really felt a sense of oneness.

191
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,020
And can you kind of recap that a
little bit for us or for those

192
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,040
who might be new to your story?
Yeah,

193
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,640
Chris Bache: this is a deeper
theme than simply the theme of

194
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,420
reincarnation, so let's go
there, and then we can bring it

195
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,100
back into reincarnation, however
you would like. The truth of

196
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,480
reincarnation is a truth that we
are an evolving consciousness

197
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,760
over a large, large swath of
time. But there, there are many

198
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,300
other truths. And one of the
other truths is if we ask, where

199
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,520
did we come from, and what are
we? And in essence, underneath

200
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,640
all this social conditioning and
psychological conditioning, what

201
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,860
are we? And there, the spiritual
traditions are very clear, and

202
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,480
they speak with one voice that
the essence of the individual is

203
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,280
the essence of the totality that
we can we are, at core, the

204
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,140
essence our essence is the
essence of the Divine, or the

205
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,940
essence of God, if you use that
language. And so that's another

206
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,460
truth. And then you go deeper
into that, you you realize that

207
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,840
what your essence is is the same
as the essence of every living

208
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,740
thing in this world. World,
every inanim, so called

209
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,640
inanimate thing, so that when
that happens, when that opens,

210
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,680
there's a profound feeling of
oneness that you know, in a

211
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,560
sense self dissolves, in the
sense of there being a boundary,

212
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,660
a firm boundary between self and
other that disappears and one

213
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,820
experience is the marvelous
miracle of life, living and

214
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,140
breathing as one. You are just
part of life. It's surrounding

215
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,020
you. There's a profound feeling
of intimacy, kinship, those

216
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,860
graces of being touched by
oneness, they can change your

217
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,360
life forever, because it shows
you a truth that even if you

218
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,260
can't sustain that experience,
you've seen the truth. You know

219
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,860
the truth of it. You can use
that truth to guide your life.

220
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,700
It leads you to become more
compassionate with people. It

221
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,440
leads you to become more
compassionate with yourself. You

222
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,780
always are kind of spontaneously
looking out for the good of the

223
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,460
whole that's the natural and
natural outcome of experiencing

224
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,880
oneness is compassion. That's
why, in the mystical traditions,

225
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,080
wisdom, insight and compassion
move hand in hand. The deeper

226
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,440
you experience oneness, the more
compassionate you become.

227
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,920
Emmy Vadnais: Can you describe a
little bit about your own

228
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,940
personal experience of that
oneness and what that was like

229
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,720
for you?

230
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,360
Chris Bache: That's a
challenging question, because to

231
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,580
answer your question, I have to
remember, and to remember, I

232
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,940
have to sink into the memory.
Otherwise it's just a reading of

233
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:52,360
headlines of it and that that
takes a little time, but working

234
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,740
within the restrictions we have,
one of the things I learned is

235
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,800
there oneness is not like a
switch that goes on and off. But

236
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,220
there are many degrees of
oneness. There are many stages

237
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,120
of initiation into oneness. One
can have a perception of

238
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,720
oneness. One can touch the edges
of oneness and feel the truth of

239
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,120
oneness in the world. But then
you can go deeper into actually,

240
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,980
kind of dissolving into the
quantum structure, if you will.

241
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm using that metaphorically of
oneness. It's it's a deeper

242
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,140
immersion in the living totality
of life. It it's challenging,

243
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,360
because at least what I've
learned is that deeper states of

244
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,700
consciousness exist at higher
levels of energy. So the deeper

245
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,260
you're going into a reality in
the consciousness, you're going

246
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,340
into a higher and higher and
higher level of energy. So

247
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,900
oneness with the totality, or
oneness with the Divine, is an

248
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,360
extremely intense state of
consciousness and state of

249
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,820
energy to move into. And in my
case, I approached it through

250
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,280
going through years and years of
very intense purifications in my

251
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,440
psychedelic sessions, when that
oneness, when you're graced with

252
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,820
the an opening into oneness,
it's like the entire world comes

253
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,520
alive in a new way. And it's
like there's a song in the world

254
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,360
that you maybe hadn't heard
before, but it's always been

255
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:39,140
there. There is a joy and a
falling away of all forms of

256
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,740
loneliness and a and a birthing
into an exquisite spiritual

257
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,420
intimacy, I should say, as an
intimacy which is both spiritual

258
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,900
and physical, because it it it
overflows in compassion towards

259
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,260
the world, and It also overflows
in homecoming, a feeling of

260
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,500
Homecoming to one's essential
nature, one's essential being.

261
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,060
And it's like, finally I found
you, or finally I've been found

262
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:18,540
by you. And and then it's just,
how deep do you want to go? You

263
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,640
know, how deep into the oneness
of existence. Do you dare to go?

264
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,920
And I think if one goes too
fast, it becomes very

265
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,180
challenging and difficult. It
takes time to assimilate

266
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,500
oneness, and then it takes time
after you've had the experience

267
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,720
to know what to do with it, to
try to we talk about integrating

268
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,060
our psychedelic experiences, and
I'm thinking in many ways that

269
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,940
we don't really understand yet,
how these profound experiences

270
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,080
are impacting our psychological
development, our psycho

271
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,480
spiritual development, because
indigenous people. People have

272
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,940
been having these experiences
for millennia. Of course, we in

273
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,020
the West are relatively new to
cultivating these experiences,

274
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,300
and so we're taking all of our
learning and all of our

275
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,480
scientific knowledge and all of
our, you know, high academic

276
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,980
knowledge, into these states.
And in some ways, we're like the

277
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,200
first generation to combine
everything that we have learned

278
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,980
about the world, from science
and ridiculed critical analysis

279
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,960
and now entering into these
deep, deep states of

280
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,560
consciousness, and we're holding
memories that very few people in

281
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,360
history have tried to hold.
We're holding memories of a

282
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,140
profound Transcendence, profound
intimacy with the divine,

283
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,640
profound Transcendence of time,
moving into deep time,

284
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:59,320
permutations of time moving into
cosmic void, experiences and

285
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,040
those are living memories. I
mean, I can tell you what I was

286
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,280
doing on a particular day in a
particular year, 30 years ago.

287
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,240
They're very specific, and I
remember them the way that most

288
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,440
people remember their 50th
birthday party. You can just

289
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,000
remember it, but how those
experiences, which are so

290
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,260
transcendent, how they are
impacting us and infusing

291
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,180
themselves deeper into our
being. I think we're just

292
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,820
beginning to map some of those
processes

293
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,220
Emmy Vadnais: from those
experiences. It sounds like you

294
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:44,380
had a more personal insight into
how everything that each of us

295
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,440
perceivedly, individually, do,
think, feel, impacts the

296
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,040
oneness. Yes, think of it this

297
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,620
Chris Bache: way. Let's say any
of the list of negative

298
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,860
qualities that we have
personally, that we're bothered

299
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,520
by and we would like to get rid
of and we'd like to transform,

300
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,860
etc, etc, those. None of those
are private. All of these are

301
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,820
part of a social configuration.
Any problem we have personally

302
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,780
is part of a social problem.
It's part of a cultural problem.

303
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,940
So where is the line between
solving my personal issue and

304
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,500
the society solving its
collective issue. Now we in

305
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,020
classically in Western thought,
we have thought we're all

306
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,960
individual monads. We can't
communicate with each other.

307
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,820
We're all separate self
contained, egoic structures. So

308
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,580
we're kind of we may be one in
aggregate, but we're really just

309
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,040
a whole bunch of people shoved
up against each other, and we

310
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,060
used to have our own individual
experience. But I don't think

311
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,100
that's the way it works, at
least that's not what I was

312
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,480
shown. What I have experienced
is that each human being is a

313
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:03,600
cell in the tissue of humanity.
Every mind is a light, a cell of

314
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,520
light in the fabric of human
consciousness and even our

315
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,280
bodies, our cells within the
body of humanity as a whole, and

316
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,800
that just as we don't none of
our problems or issues or

317
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,020
virtues, we arrive at them
individually. We kind of arrive

318
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,900
at them together collectively.
They're part of an historical

319
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,120
landscape, part of a cultural
landscape. Also when we solve

320
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,240
our problems, when we have
spiritual breakthroughs, when we

321
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,640
have psychological
breakthroughs, those

322
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,220
breakthroughs radiate out into
the world, and they touch lives.

323
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,900
Now that's all spiritual
traditions have recognized this,

324
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,980
Christian, Jewish, Muslim,
Buddhist, Hindu traditions have

325
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,700
recognized this collective
nature. But one of the ways I

326
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,960
experienced it as kind of
empirically demonstrated, was in

327
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,060
my classroom. Because all the
years when I was working very

328
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,780
intensely with psychedelics, I
was working very privately, and

329
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,540
because they were illegal, I
couldn't talk about it, and I

330
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,000
never talked to my students
about my own personal

331
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,400
psychedelic practice. But what I
found over time was that my

332
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,580
psychedelic practice was
impacting my students and I

333
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:29,660
began to have experiences or
have access to their minds in a

334
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,300
way that was showing me that my
individual process of

335
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:41,200
transformation was radiating out
and influencing other people's

336
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,220
processes of self
transformation, and this, I was

337
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,360
completely I didn't expect this
at all, and it took me a while.

338
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,840
Took me years, really, to
understand what was happening,

339
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,320
until eventually I wrote my
book, The living classroom,

340
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,140
which is now just come out in a
new edition, where I. I can't

341
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,480
explicitly say that the
practices that I was doing,

342
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,020
which was driving this kind of
collective awakening in my

343
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,580
classroom, was a psychedelic
practice, primarily, but it was

344
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:22,220
showing me that truly, we are in
a boundaryless condition, not

345
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,840
just in high, subtle, mystical
states of awareness, but we are

346
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,640
in a boundaryless condition all
the time that we are always

347
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,500
there's always a porosity, an
interconnectedness between

348
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,380
what's going on in our life,
what's going on in the world

349
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,780
around us. So that I think we
have more and more reason to

350
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,540
believe that when we live our
life well, and when we rise to

351
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,820
the challenges that are
presented to us in life,

352
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,720
whatever they are, whether
they're, you know, surgical,

353
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,400
political, social activists,
meditative, psychological,

354
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,340
whatever those artistic whatever
those breakthroughs are, that

355
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,060
those breakthroughs have a
nourishing effect on everyone

356
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,960
around us.

357
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,860
Emmy Vadnais: Among the world's
spiritual traditions and

358
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,720
religions, some of them are
advocates or proponents of

359
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,800
reincarnation. They just take it
as a given, it's natural. And

360
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,080
then there are other religions
and practices where some have

361
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,980
suggested that has been removed
from those religious practices.

362
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,840
And I'm just wondering if you
can comment about that, because

363
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,200
there are people who might
adhere to a particular religion

364
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,820
where they have been taught sure
reincarnation just does not

365
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,200
exist. And in fact, you have one
shot to get it right, and that's

366
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,540
it. You're either going to go to
heaven or hell or maybe

367
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,240
purgatory. If you don't, if
you're really screw it up, you

368
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,940
could also go there. Yeah.

369
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:57,399
Chris Bache: Isn't that
interesting? It's interesting.

370
00:26:57,579 --> 00:27:00,179
You know, religions have many
levels to them. There's kind of

371
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,619
the exterior lay level of
religion. And then there's the

372
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:08,759
esoteric, mystical, high, deep,
spiritual practitioner level of

373
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,959
religion. And what we find is
that some religions, like the

374
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:17,519
religions of the East, Buddhism,
Hinduism, even Taoism, they they

375
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,159
naturally affirm reincarnation.
But even in the West, where

376
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,539
reincarnation is not absorbed
into the primary religions,

377
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:30,439
there is, it's often present in
the mystical branch of that

378
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:35,359
religion. So that in Judaism,
Judaism doesn't affirm

379
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,259
reincarnation. Rabbinic Judaism
doesn't at a collective level,

380
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:44,319
but Hasidism the mystical
tradition in Judaism, it does,

381
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:48,579
and likewise in Islam,
traditional mainstream Islam,

382
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:53,259
does not place any emphasis on
reincarnation, but mystical

383
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:58,659
Islam, the Sufi tradition, does
affirm reincarnation. With

384
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:01,979
Christianity, it's a little more
complicated, because

385
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,239
Christianity tended to execute
any of its mystics who were

386
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:09,179
affirming reincarnation. There
were, have been crusades, of

387
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,339
course, against the Cathars and
others. When we look back at the

388
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:18,479
history of Christianity, it
appears that reincarnation was

389
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:22,819
taught by certain early sex
within Christianity, it was

390
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:27,079
taught in what later came to be
called Gnostic sex, which were

391
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:30,919
then delivered decided to be
heretical and not accepted. But

392
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,639
it was, you know, was taught as
a standard kind of operating

393
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:38,659
interpretation of Christianity
for hundreds of years. But then

394
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:44,259
as as the ecclesiastical church
began to consolidate itself

395
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:48,039
under the remember the
background this around third,

396
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:52,359
fourth century, ad under the
falling of the collapse of the

397
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,199
Roman Empire and a really
disintegration of order at the

398
00:28:56,199 --> 00:29:01,079
social level. The church really
believed that it's its survival

399
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,699
depended upon a strong
ecclesiastical center, and

400
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:09,839
reincarnation gave too much
autonomy to individuals to work

401
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,279
out their own reincarnation. And
so a particular council was

402
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:17,879
held, and there was a decision
that reincarnation was not going

403
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:21,019
to be included as an acceptable
form of Christianity,

404
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:25,159
particularly for this particular
reason, I think, is it's it's

405
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,679
not that it's incompatible with
the teaching of Jesus. They

406
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,859
never said that it was
incompatible. It's that it gives

407
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:34,579
too much autonomy, it undermines
the the primacy of

408
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:39,679
ecclesiastical authority in the
church. Now, that may have been

409
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,399
helpful for Christianity at that
time, it may have helped

410
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,259
Christianity survive the Dark
Ages it followed. But now that

411
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:52,479
we have reincarnation evidence
coming forward from scholarly

412
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:56,079
sources, there is nothing in
Christianity that prohibits

413
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,139
Christians from reassessing that
old teaching. 18 and looking at

414
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:08,699
it anew, we know that from
several national surveys that

415
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,259
approximately 25% of American
Catholics believe in

416
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:16,559
reincarnation, and it's about
the same number for Protestants,

417
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:22,279
26% for Protestants, and so
clearly, 25% of Catholics aren't

418
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,299
waiting for a papal encyclical
saying that reincarnation is

419
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:30,019
okay to accept. In fact, the
largest chapter I have in my

420
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:34,279
book in life cycles is a chapter
on reincarnation and

421
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:39,019
Christianity, where I as most of
my students who I was teaching

422
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:41,499
at the State University, they
came out of Christian

423
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:45,399
backgrounds. They were also
trained to follow the evidence,

424
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:50,319
to believe, let your beliefs be
guided by the evidence. So they

425
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,319
were having evidence of
reincarnation presented to them,

426
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:56,619
and yet their religious
tradition said that evidence

427
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:00,839
can't be true, but they saw the
quality of the evidence, and in

428
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:04,739
this chapter, I'm basically
sharing my experiences with

429
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:07,979
students, helping them
understand how they can

430
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:12,059
reevaluate reincarnation and
what a reincarnation is

431
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:16,079
Christianity might look like.
And I outline a minimal option

432
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:19,979
and a maximal option, but trying
to show the way in which you can

433
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:25,819
affirm deep Christian values and
even dogma and incorporate a

434
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:29,959
reincarnation element. And it
makes me make more sense. You

435
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:35,179
know, because the real devilment
of Western theology, which

436
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:38,119
believes our Christian theology,
which believes in a one time

437
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:42,939
through metaphysics, is that it
it makes life radically

438
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:47,019
inexplicable. Why do some people
have so much and some people

439
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:50,319
have so little? Why are some
people so burdened with pain and

440
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,819
suffering, and some people just
have so much ease in their

441
00:31:54,819 --> 00:32:00,339
lifetime? And ultimately, this
gets thrown into an inscrutable

442
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:03,599
God, a God that makes no sense
whatsoever. We just can't

443
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,179
understand it. We just have to
live it and abide by its

444
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:10,079
jurisdiction, and hopefully
things will work out well. But

445
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,959
when you open up to a
reincarnational perspective,

446
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:17,999
suddenly certain possibilities
emerge and things begin to make

447
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:22,879
more sense, and suddenly the
inscrutability is not God's

448
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:25,879
inscrutability. It's an
inscrutability that is

449
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:29,059
introduced by believing
something which isn't true, and

450
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:34,159
that is that we live on in life,
on life only once. Now let's be

451
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,519
careful. We have to say these
things carefully. Chris Bache

452
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:43,119
only lives once, the soul which
Chris Bache is part of, that

453
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:49,419
soul lives more than once. So
you know, you just have to, you

454
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,959
know, say things carefully to
make your points clear. Yeah,

455
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:53,499
the

456
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,440
Emmy Vadnais: personality or the
or the identity of Chris Bache

457
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:03,660
or Emmy Vadnais lives once.
However, the soul that is our

458
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,320
consciousness, our energy or
animates us, or however you

459
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,480
term, that lives lives on,
perhaps forever

460
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,360
Chris Bache: lives on. That's
right, it's like each

461
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,060
personality, each incarnation,
is a facet of the diamond. The

462
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,260
diamond lives forever. The facet
doesn't necessarily live

463
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,500
forever. Well, it lives forever
in the diamond, but the diamond

464
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:27,740
lives

465
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:34,460
Emmy Vadnais: forever. Yeah, the
story of Jesus's death, where he

466
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,180
rises on the third day, some
have suggested that is really a

467
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,060
metaphor for reincarnation? It's

468
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,000
Chris Bache: an interesting
question, and I have an appendix

469
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:51,100
in in life cycles, where I
address interpretations, which

470
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,000
of certain interpretations of
certain biblical passages which

471
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,600
have been offered to suggest
that Jesus himself believed in

472
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,240
reincarnation. You know, we get
into a real Biblical studies,

473
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:09,000
you know, rabbit hole on that
one, yeah, yeah. And my sense is

474
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,300
that I don't think there's
compelling evidence that he did

475
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,600
teach reincarnation, but there
certainly is very strong

476
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,960
evidence that his teaching is
compatible with reincarnation.

477
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:22,639
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, I mention it
because it is a very significant

478
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:27,079
holiday, Easter for many
Christians and Catholics.

479
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,160
Chris Bache: My first love, my
first academic pursuit, was in

480
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,400
New Testament studies, and I
learned Greek and Hebrew, and I

481
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,520
really was going to become a New
Testament scholar, but I changed

482
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,380
and shifted later on, but up
through my master's I was doing

483
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,520
Biblical Studies work. We
learned that the oldest gospel,

484
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,460
Mark's gospel, does not have a
resurrection, does not have an

485
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:54,040
empty tomb seen in it. In fact,
it it ends with death and the

486
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,960
the power, the influence, of the
story of the resurrection was so

487
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,120
strong from the. Later gospels,
Matthew, Luke and John, that

488
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,780
there was an actual a new ending
added in the last chapter of

489
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,580
Mark's gospel to include that
kind of experience. I think that

490
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,420
when we ask historically, what
is the deepest level of

491
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,960
experience that may lie behind
the belief in the resurrection,

492
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,440
I think it is the the experience
that Jesus followers experienced

493
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,300
him as being alive, even though
he was dead, he was alive, and

494
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:35,060
therefore death is conquered.
Christian theology tended to

495
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,620
interpret that in unique terms
that made Jesus's survival of

496
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:45,040
death somehow unique, and he was
uniquely the Son of God and

497
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,820
uniquely sharing this gift with
humanity, who accepts it on

498
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,900
faith that would be that's one
way of interpreting, and another

499
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,020
way of interpreting is that what
he's showing us is a universal

500
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,780
truth, that when we die, we are
still alive. You know that

501
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,140
there's a larger dynamic
unfolding here.

502
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,960
Emmy Vadnais: Going back to the
oneness that physics shows seems

503
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,660
to be a reality with quantum
entanglement, some people really

504
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,440
embrace that. Find it beautiful,
such as yourself. I think it's

505
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,660
quite beautiful, although there
are probably people listening to

506
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,260
this thinking, Well, I don't
want to be a part of that other

507
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,460
individual or and I know it's
not just humans. There's also

508
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,980
creatures and animals and
bacteria that we're all a part

509
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,960
of as well. I'm wondering if you
want to comment on on on those

510
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,620
thoughts,

511
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:46,599
Chris Bache: I think when we
first begin to entertain

512
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,099
possibilities that we are larger
than we conventionally have

513
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:54,039
thought that we are, and that we
have these interconnections

514
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,999
which are larger than we thought
that we are, I understand the

515
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:02,759
kind of fear and reflex To draw
back and say, not me. You know

516
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:06,599
that that doesn't work, and
that's an understandable it's a

517
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,579
natural reflex. But if we let
that pass, and we sort of relax

518
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:15,239
and begin to look at the data,
if we begin to look at near

519
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,379
death episode research, people
who have get glimpses what's

520
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:23,419
going on behind the scenes, and
we look at not just a few of

521
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:26,719
them, but look at hundreds of
them, and begin to sort out the

522
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,039
kind universal threads that run
through their accounts. When we

523
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:36,859
look at past life, therapy
research, and look at, you know,

524
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:42,159
the demonstrated continuity
between lives and the richness

525
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:47,799
which emerges in a person's life
when they untangle some of those

526
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:53,379
knots from their past, and when
we just begin to look deeply

527
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:58,599
into where did this come from,
where did this body mind come

528
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,999
from? And we trace its long
evolutionary pedigree back

529
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:08,159
through its physical pedigree on
the emergence of our beautiful

530
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,599
body. It turns out that the mind
has a similar elegant,

531
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,459
magnificent pedigree, reaching
back through time, and the more

532
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:24,079
we absorb the fact that this
body is not ours privately, and

533
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,859
our mind is not ours privately.
It's always been a collective

534
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:31,699
summation, in a way, always from
the start, then I think that

535
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:37,939
feeling of anxiety or push back
softens and we begin to open to

536
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:41,439
a different world. And it's not
a world that dissolves the

537
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:46,299
individual or washes out the
individual. It's a world which

538
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:50,019
actually affirms the individual
very deeply, but it

539
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:54,939
contextualizes the individual
within a web work of

540
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:59,019
interconnections which is larger
than the individual, which we

541
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:03,719
draw from and we give back to
just as a leaf draws energy from

542
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,279
the tree and gives back energy
to the tree. And that just it

543
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:14,219
becomes a natural way of seeing
things. It's just a it's an easy

544
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,459
secondary way of seeing things.
And I'm glad the physicists have

545
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:20,539
jumped on with quantum physics
and unified systems theory and

546
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:23,539
all those good things, but
fundamentally this can be an

547
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:28,999
experiential thing, that when we
when we quiet our mind, when we

548
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:34,759
calm our heart, and we enter
into deeper states of self aware

549
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:40,119
stillness, Then there are
perceptions. There are

550
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,919
instincts, which are usually so
subtle that we don't notice

551
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:48,999
them, but in the space of a
quiet, meditative mind, these

552
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:53,919
things make themselves felt. And
when you when these arise, you

553
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:57,339
begin to realize that they're
it's like they're threads that

554
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:00,539
connect us to other people's
lives. Then you. There's no

555
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:04,799
breaking these threads. They're
part of the fabric of life, just

556
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:07,799
like there's no breaking the
threads between any one leaf on

557
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:11,999
a tree and other leaves on the
tree. They are connected into

558
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:13,199
the same organism,

559
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,220
Emmy Vadnais: yeah, and the
roots of the trees, the roots, I

560
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,220
like how you're describing it as
a collective mind, or collective

561
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,620
consciousness, that we are all a
part of, and and I agree with

562
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:28,040
you. I had the pleasure of
speaking with Jill Bolte Taylor,

563
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,660
who has written the book my
Stroke of Insight, and followed

564
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,980
up with a where she had a stroke
and the left side of her brain

565
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,180
went offline and she only had
the right side of her brain. And

566
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,560
she talked about how she felt
this merging of oneness, and

567
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,400
could even sense the energy that
people were bringing into her

568
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,180
space, even if they were just
visiting for less than, no less

569
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,440
than five minutes. And she wrote
a follow up book about whole

570
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,680
brain living, because she wanted
to share with people how they

571
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,160
can also have these experiences
as well. Yeah. What is the

572
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,600
significance of reincarnation?
How does karma play a role with

573
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,380
that, and how does it give
meaning to our lives, or even

574
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,040
change our lives if we engage
with that potential?

575
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,500
Chris Bache: Well, that's a
large question, so let me just

576
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,700
start with how it impacted me,
and share with you maybe some of

577
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,000
how it impacts the students that
I've shared these ideas with.

578
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,880
You know, decades first, I think
it changes everything. It makes

579
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,140
life more intelligible. It makes
the experience that all of us

580
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,140
have make more sense. All of us
have things that we know how to

581
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:48,220
do that no one ever taught us,
or we have aptitudes towards

582
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,000
certain types of activities that
are different from everyone else

583
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,540
in our family. Some people are
oriented towards private

584
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,160
intellectual chess, like games,
and other people like full

585
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,200
contact rugby, rugby, social,
things. There's all these

586
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,800
differences. Some people have
tremendous capacity to create an

587
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,740
art and music, and other people
are writers. Where do those come

588
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,460
from? Where do those qualities
and traits come from? And

589
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,960
classically, we think they come
through genetic mutation. It's

590
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,680
random, it's it's just
accidental. There's no logic to

591
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,160
it. You got a good luck, good
you good genes, good. They're

592
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,900
great. But when you actually
sink into them, it begins to

593
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,580
make more sense that everything
which is large in a life comes

594
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:42,520
from a line of choices, where at
some time in our past, they were

595
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:48,340
small. So an interest in music
begins small, but it's practice,

596
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,400
and it's develops until
eventually you have someone like

597
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,100
Mozart, who's writing concertos
when he's six years old. So

598
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,020
everything which is large, even
in one case, I'm remembering

599
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,520
from past life cases, an ability
with guns, an ability to be very

600
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,500
facile and very quick. Draw came
from a history of a former life

601
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,040
of a marshal on the frontier,
you know? And that makes sense,

602
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,500
and it also is grounds for hope,
because it means not that we are

603
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,520
prisoner of our past, but we
operate within a context which

604
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,300
has been shaped by our past.
Within that context, we make

605
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:34,280
choices which then begin they
feed into the to our future and

606
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:41,440
our future lives future. So it's
a very empowering position,

607
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,040
because even though you may be
temporarily burdened if you are

608
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,000
by something that's got a deeper
history, you have the power to

609
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,720
change your history. You have a
power to exert your will and

610
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,200
exert your choices, make better
choices or stronger different

611
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,740
choices and lead into a better,
better future. It begins when

612
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:06,300
you when you look at the world
through reincarnation of size,

613
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,660
you realize that everybody's
playing a different game.

614
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,080
They're not playing your game.
And if it's like, I think of it

615
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,020
like school. There are some
people who are in kindergarten

616
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,840
and first grade, some people who
are in high school, some people

617
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,940
are doing postgraduate work. And
that gives you tremendous

618
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,660
permission to let people be
themselves, just to let them be

619
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,380
because they're working on their
court, their rules that they're

620
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,840
working on. Somebody else is
working on a different court,

621
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,280
different rules. And the idea
that we all have to get past the

622
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,540
same finish line at the same
time in order for things to work

623
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,780
out right. We all have to be
saved before we die or something

624
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,740
like this. That doesn't make
nearly as much sense as we are

625
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,100
we are developing flower garden.
We are different types of

626
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,460
flowers which are developing and
emerging over large periods of

627
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,960
time. We have an open ended
amount of time with which to

628
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,580
develop ourselves. I tell my
students sometimes the only

629
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,060
important question you should be
asking yourself is, what do you

630
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,920
want to be doing in 10,000
years?

631
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,240
Emmy Vadnais: That's a simple
question,

632
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,220
Chris Bache: question, but
provoking,

633
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,320
Emmy Vadnais: isn't it? Oh,
well, I'm joking. It's it's

634
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,360
profound. It's like,

635
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,040
Chris Bache: take the large
perspective people, the creative

636
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,400
intelligence of the universe
thinks large. It doesn't think

637
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,200
small, right? And if we we have
this, the greatest thing about

638
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,860
reincarnation is, and it's the
Hindus thought this was a

639
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,680
burden. I mean that when they
discovered reincarnation, they

640
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,740
thought, Oh, my God, we go round
and round and round. We have to

641
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,640
go through puberty all these
times we have to go hardship of

642
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,060
life, over and over and over
again. They did not think it was

643
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,540
a joy. They thought it was a
burden. But I think we can

644
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,820
appreciate that the greatest
burden of in the psyche of the

645
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,260
modern man, modern humanity is
this idea that's terrible idea

646
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,060
that we are nothing more than
our biology, everything mental

647
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,140
condenses to physics, and that
when the body dies, our mind

648
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,380
disappears and dissolves. We're
nothing. There's no survival of

649
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,820
the of the body. Reincarnation
opens this puts the myth to

650
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,500
that. It shows us that we are
developing over vast tracks of

651
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,320
time, and that allows us to
elevate our assessment of what

652
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,780
the purpose of life might be. If
I give an in class test, a quiz,

653
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,040
I have a right to expect a
certain set of results. If I

654
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,260
give them an hour long test, I
expect more because I've given

655
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,580
in the more time. And if I give
them a research paper, I expect

656
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:47,080
more because they have more time
to develop it. If the universe

657
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,260
has a purpose, if it has a
purpose, it should be

658
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,320
proportionate to the amount of
time we have to realize that

659
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,980
purpose. If we only have one
lifetime. Remember, for some

660
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,060
people, that's just five minutes
before they're dead out of the

661
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:05,040
delivery room. Sometimes it's
five days. If life has a

662
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,540
purpose, it can't be greater
than the amount of time we have

663
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,800
to realize that purpose. Okay,
with reincarnation, we learn

664
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,700
that we have open ended infinite
amount of time. That doesn't

665
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,140
cause us to be lazy. Anybody who
wants to say, oh, I'll just deal

666
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,020
with it later. They're stupid,
you know, they haven't really

667
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,700
taken into how hard it is to be
working here. But when we have

668
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,800
open ended amount of time, it
lifts the ceiling and it allows

669
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,160
us to look at the beautiful
pictures that come from the

670
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,900
Hubble telescope, for example,
pictures of our galaxies and

671
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,880
nebulas and the infinite depth
of the universe, and to

672
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,680
recognize that we aren't just a
little bit short 100 year part

673
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:56,140
player in this drama. We are an
ancient player in this drama,

674
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,720
and it allows us to look at the
magnificent grandeur of a

675
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,420
galaxy, and recognize that we
have a meaningful part in this

676
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,880
magnificent galaxies unfolding
of intelligence on its planets,

677
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,340
around its suns. That's that
changes everything, doesn't it?

678
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,020
What do you

679
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,960
Emmy Vadnais: feel the purpose
of our individual karma is that

680
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,280
contributes to the collective
what are we reincarnating

681
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,000
toward?

682
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:35,480
Chris Bache: Well, let me kind
of start with a general

683
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,260
observation, then go to the more
specific observations. What are

684
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:45,760
we reincarnating toward? To me,
the boundary between individual

685
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:53,200
and collective has been made
poor so many times that I see it

686
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,240
as one living organism with
different kind of folks. Eye of

687
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,720
light the individual is an
individual, but it's

688
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,440
contextualized within an
individuality of a species. And

689
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,180
our species, as a single
consciousness, is an individual.

690
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,800
I mean, it's humanity on planet
Earth is different than some

691
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,980
other species on some other
planet, on some other galaxy,

692
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,660
the mind of our species, the
collective psyche, the memory of

693
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,700
our species, is unique in its
history and in its components.

694
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,020
In our mind, we are part of
that. So my understanding is we

695
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:38,060
live in a constant dialog, a
constant transmission back and

696
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,440
forth between the collective and
the individual to the

697
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,480
collective. So then we ask the
question, okay, what are we

698
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:52,480
evolving toward? Where is it
taking us? And that gets us into

699
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,000
very interesting territory,
probably the large majority of

700
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
the answers that we would give
that we. Are evolving to love or

701
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,940
to compassion or to knowledge or
something like this, inevitably

702
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,780
that probably is going to end up
being too small, because we're

703
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,500
going to formulate those goals
out of our particular moment in

704
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:23,480
history and take something good
and project it forward, but ask

705
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,340
the same question in 5000 years,
and would probably give a

706
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,260
different, richer answer. So I
think the safest answers are in

707
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:39,020
terms of process answers, not in
terms of goal answers. I tend to

708
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:45,100
think the essence of the whole
process is growth and

709
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,940
empowerment of the nature that
we have, the empowerment of the

710
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:53,920
form that we are, growth, growth
toward what that comes the

711
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,860
tricky part. I mean, I would
like to say growth towards

712
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:01,800
oneness, growth towards love,
growth towards wisdom, growth

713
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,060
towards I mean literally
intelligence, more intelligence,

714
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,960
more esthetic capacity, more
creative capacity, more

715
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,760
communion between human
intelligence and spiritual

716
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:20,540
intelligence. But those are just
limited intermediate baby steps,

717
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,080
I think, but that there is a
progression towards growth, I

718
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,580
think we can extract from the
evolutionary record, and also a

719
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:34,400
growth towards individuality. I
think of reincarnation as a

720
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,220
higher octave of evolution.
Evolution evolves whole groups

721
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,980
forward. It folds learning
forward of whole groups.

722
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:49,240
Reincarnation. Folds the
learning forward of individuals

723
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,740
within certain species. Nature
has somehow found a way of, kind

724
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:57,820
of letting individuals run
forward in time. Where is it

725
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:02,760
going to go? Well, we've been
doing it for hundreds of 1000s

726
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,660
of years, and a universe has
been evolving for 13 point 7

727
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,480
billion years, and it's going to
continue for hundreds of

728
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,380
billions of years. Yet, where
are we going? I mean, what? What

729
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,840
could we become if we had 10,000
years to work with? Yeah, we'll

730
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:26,240
become more, I think, better,
more in tune with reality, and I

731
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,840
deeply mean spiritual reality
will become stronger because

732
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,320
we'll be working together to
solve our problems. Instead of

733
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:39,440
fighting over a small plate of
food, we'll be lower.

734
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:44,919
Emmy Vadnais: How can people
engage in the karmic and

735
00:52:44,919 --> 00:52:48,519
reincarnation process more
consciously? Because I imagine

736
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:50,499
there are those listening
thinking, Well, I have a

737
00:52:50,499 --> 00:52:54,759
horrible lot in this lifetime. I
don't want to be here anymore.

738
00:52:54,879 --> 00:52:58,359
I'm never coming back here. In
fact, some people truly believe

739
00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:02,339
that this is a prison planet and
it's run by dark forces that are

740
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:05,039
trying to control us or that do
control us.

741
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,660
Chris Bache: Yeah, my heart goes
out to people who are suffering

742
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,500
that much pain. I mean, I know
people who are suffering that

743
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,540
much pain, and I think
inevitably, when we try to

744
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,880
understand what's going on,
inevitably, we kind of project

745
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:28,520
out of our own living
circumstance. So if we see

746
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,640
ourselves living on a planet
that's it's a prison planet

747
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,240
controlled by Dark Forces. I
mean, I can't help but think

748
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,720
that there is a projection of
one's own psychological

749
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,180
experience into metaphysical
parameters. But, and I can only

750
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:49,360
suggest that as you get clear,
as you go through deepening your

751
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,660
experience of your own life
through various spiritual

752
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:58,120
practices, and by living as good
a life as you can live as fair

753
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,220
and compassion, as just and
compassion and generous life as

754
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:08,520
we can live, your mind gets
clearer. The forces that

755
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:16,440
constrict your life loosen and
you begin to realize that all

756
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,700
along you in very subtle and
often mysterious ways, you are

757
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:27,980
controlling the flow of energy
that is your life. And if you've

758
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,620
made choices that have
constricted that flow in the

759
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,520
past, you can reverse those
choices in the present. If

760
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,180
you've had bad karma,
constrictive, tight karma in the

761
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:42,400
past, you can choose, begin to
choose different, generous

762
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,440
karma, clear karma. And all the
spiritual traditions have

763
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,880
procedures to help you move into
deeper clarity. The Buddhists

764
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,320
start with the five, the Four
Noble Truths. They start with

765
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,920
the fundamental truths of do no
harm, do no injury, right?

766
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,840
Speech, right conduct, so on, so
forth. Every religion has these

767
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,920
commandments, if you will, these
guidelines, how to clear your

768
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,900
mind, how to clear your heart.
As you clear your mind and clear

769
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,640
your heart, a different picture
of the universe emerges, one

770
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,420
which is not governed by Dark
Forces. Though, clearly, if you

771
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,200
look at if you look at certain
political movements and certain

772
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,780
social movements and movements
of war and whatnot, there's a

773
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,660
lot of darkness and there's a
lot of oppressive forces, and

774
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:37,100
there's a lot of greed and
negativity in there. But your

775
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:43,300
experience of the universe
itself changes. It opens into a

776
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,680
divine banquet, a wonderful
mystery, but a divine banquet.

777
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:57,700
And how do I connect with that?
I mean, how do I begin to change

778
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:02,160
my life so that I can begin to
have that kind of experience, or

779
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,480
I can feel that affinity with
the fellow human beings who are

780
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,960
traveling with me. This is, this
is kind of like basic

781
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:18,060
spirituality, 101, so anything
which you do which favors

782
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:21,800
yourself over someone else, stop
doing that. Everything you do

783
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,340
which hurts other people around
you, stop doing that. Every time

784
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,000
you injure someone with your
speech, stop doing that, and

785
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:32,780
just the whole system slowly
begins to calm down. And then

786
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:37,160
there are other techniques which
teach you how to bring your mind

787
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,020
underneath all the turbulence
that's on the surface. And we

788
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,500
can just start to live a
lifestyle which is calmer,

789
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,740
quieter, more peaceful. Doesn't
mean we're not in the world.

790
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,200
We're in the world. We're making
a living, we're doing our jobs.

791
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,160
We have to deal with everything
everybody else does, but you can

792
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,960
engage it in a different way,
and as you individually come

793
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,920
into greater clarity. I think
crystallizing around you will be

794
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:10,680
opportunities of greater growth
around you. We are not trapped

795
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,940
by our karma. Karma is simply a
platform we can reach beyond our

796
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,480
past and to create a future
which may still have its own

797
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:27,260
challenges, but it'll be clear,
it'll be gentler, more exciting.

798
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,100
Can

799
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:30,019
Emmy Vadnais: you share a little
bit more about your

800
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:32,959
understanding of karma? Because
some people listening might be

801
00:57:32,959 --> 00:57:37,099
thinking, well, it's simply
cause and effect, or maybe even

802
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:39,259
a form of punishment,

803
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,120
Chris Bache: not punishment, but
certainly cause and effect. The

804
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,880
in Hindi terms, is karma,
vipaka, cause and effect. And so

805
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,540
the basic idea is this, we live
in an entire universe of cause

806
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,780
and effect. Everything has
cause. Everything has effects.

807
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,140
Everything. There's not a single
part of this universe which

808
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,460
doesn't have cause and effect.
Except the fundamental ground

809
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,060
state, it's all cause and
effect. So we don't have any

810
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,580
problem with that. In the
scientific world, we recognize

811
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,700
molecules, atoms, you know, move
into things. They have cause and

812
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,980
effect, no problem. Yeah. Now we
get to the nub of it. The Hindus

813
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:21,380
would say, in ancient
traditions, would say, choice

814
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,640
has cause and effect the choices
we make, which is to say we are

815
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,960
learning systems. We are
constantly learning. And when we

816
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:35,780
make a choice, we are basically
setting in motion a trajectory

817
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,960
of learning when we make a
choice to push away something or

818
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,020
to include something to hurt or
to support. We are always making

819
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:49,840
choices. Those choices basically
echo back around and become part

820
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,220
of our subsequent experiences.
One of the easiest ways to

821
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,540
describe some of the logic of
this when the people talk about

822
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:03,360
good karma and bad karma
inheriting the consequences of

823
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:08,040
the VIPA. Technically, it's the
good vipaka That comes from good

824
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,760
action, the bad vipaka That
comes from bad action, bad

825
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,380
karma. When we are experiencing
these cycles, what's at the

826
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:22,640
center of it is giving the human
being incredible power to

827
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,060
control their destiny. They may
not be able to control it in the

828
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:30,260
short term because there's so
much momentum in the system, but

829
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,820
if you begin to systematically
engage the momentum of the

830
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:39,500
causal forces powering pushing
your life, you can begin making

831
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,240
clear and clear and clear
choices. And as you begin making

832
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,840
clear choices, your inner
environment becomes clear and

833
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:52,060
your outer environment begins to
become clear. For Hinduism, this

834
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:56,200
would be simple Dharma 101, this
is just kind of how life works.

835
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,032
We are here to grow. We are here
to learn and. An academic

836
01:00:01,032 --> 01:00:05,292
transcript is a history of
grades in various courses. You

837
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:09,192
could say it's karma. You make
choices. You make choices for

838
01:00:09,192 --> 01:00:11,532
what to pay attention, not to
pay attention, to apply

839
01:00:11,532 --> 01:00:15,672
yourself, not to apply yourself.
You make choices. The cumulative

840
01:00:15,672 --> 01:00:19,392
effect of all those choices is
your transcript at the end of

841
01:00:19,392 --> 01:00:23,660
college. Okay? It's like that in
life. We're making choices

842
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:28,520
constantly. There's nothing
magic, magical or infamous about

843
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,540
karma. It's just reminding us
that not only does the physical

844
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,740
world move according to cause
and effect, but our

845
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:40,540
psychological world also moves
according to cause and effect,

846
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,620
and our spiritual world does
too, except that there is a

847
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,580
there is a depth in the
spiritual level. There may be

848
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,600
also in the quantum level as
well, but there is a depth in

849
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:57,460
the physical level, which you
discover deep inside your center

850
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:02,580
that is not part of cause and
effect. It's outside of cause

851
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,660
and effect. And so that's the
spiritual traditions make a

852
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:11,580
great deal of emphasis of
reducing the turbulence of karma

853
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:16,380
cause and effect until one can
actually experience the aspect

854
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:21,800
of your own being which is free
of cause and effect. It's part

855
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,040
of it. There's that when they
describe the one's essential

856
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,720
nature, of one's de mind, divine
nature, it never begins, it

857
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,380
never ends. It doesn't have a
beginning and end. It's always

858
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:37,760
present. It's always stable.
Karma has beginning and end. It

859
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,620
runs around, does all sort like
a playground. But underneath

860
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,460
there is this reality which has
neither beginning nor end. And

861
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:50,200
so spiritual practice is about
living more in your more of your

862
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:54,760
life from that reality, rather
than living your life from that

863
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,880
turbulence, cause and effect.
What

864
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,460
Emmy Vadnais: role do historical
traumas and collective traumas

865
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,540
play and what we're experiencing
here on earth, of course, I know

866
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:10,260
you mentioned earlier, there's a
lot of pleasant attributes we

867
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,380
bring with us as well. All the

868
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,940
Chris Bache: virtues of history
are poured into us that surround

869
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:22,280
us, as well as all the burdens
of bad choices of history, all

870
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:27,260
the sins of history. We seem to
be in a very intense time now.

871
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:31,820
We're coming into a critical
time in human history. We've

872
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:37,940
never been here before. We've
had pieces of continents in

873
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:41,980
danger, but now we have an
entire planet that's in danger

874
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:47,140
of becoming unable to sustain
our population, and we're doing

875
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,080
it. It's man, it's human made.
We're making the choices. We're

876
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,560
causing the problem. Nature is
not causing the problem. We are

877
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:58,960
causing the problem. And so we
seem to be in a time of

878
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,440
increasing turbulence,
disruption, chaos. We're dealing

879
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,640
with a lot of social uncertainty
and social divisiveness because

880
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:13,800
many people are not clear how to
face the challenges that we're

881
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,980
coming into as a species. We
know that global climate change

882
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,900
is going to have enormous
impact. We're going to be losing

883
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,840
many, many, many lives in the
near future, in the future, and

884
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:35,000
this leads to uncertainty and a
lot of turbulence. And if we

885
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,780
look at this same situation from
within a deep spiritual

886
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:43,780
perspective, and we ask, what is
causing this inner turbulence?

887
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:48,220
Well, we might look at, in some
ways, I look towards the lives

888
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:52,000
of individual mystics. When we
look at the life of an

889
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,740
individual mystic, this is well,
kind of documented and testified

890
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,360
that before the breakthrough of
enlightenment, before the

891
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,620
breakthrough of the universal
one heart, we go through the

892
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:08,160
dark night of the soul. We go
through a period of deep, deep,

893
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,060
intense, personal cleansing. And
another way of thinking about

894
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,480
this, from a reincarnational
perspective, is that we're

895
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,200
cleaning the basement all the
things inside of us which are

896
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,120
incompatible with enlightenment,
all the history which has led us

897
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,360
to have convictions and urges
and whatnot which are

898
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,800
incompatible with universal love
are being forced out of the

899
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:36,680
system. And when and in your
meditation, they the spiritual

900
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:40,780
practitioners can experience
that. They experience upheavals

901
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,320
coming up from within them.
Sometimes they're they're crying

902
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,260
on the meditation cushion.
Sometimes they're feeling

903
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:51,460
unspeakable rage. But the advice
is always the same, keep

904
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:55,000
centered. Let it flow through
you. It will pass. It will move

905
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,180
through you. If we kind of think
of the entire species. As a

906
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:03,960
single meditating being, I think
something like this is

907
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:09,600
happening. I personally think we
are entering into a profoundly

908
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:17,100
important, very positive turning
point in human evolution, which

909
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:21,440
will take us into a higher level
of psycho spiritual functioning

910
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:28,040
at a across the board platform
for us to actualize this, for us

911
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,360
to realize this, we have to get
we have to clear ourselves of

912
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,360
everything which is keeping us
from experiencing this state

913
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,960
right here, right now, today,
and the things which are

914
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,000
experience keeping us from
experiencing this is all our

915
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,180
collective karma from collective
history and all our cultural

916
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,540
institutions and the history
that we, each of us, carry

917
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:53,800
individually, and we all carry
collectively together. So I

918
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,680
think that we are actually
experiencing a time of

919
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:01,980
tremendous purification,
tremendous kind of, you know,

920
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,880
it's kind of like you have to
expose the shadow before you can

921
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,960
heal the shadow. And we are
certainly exposing the shadow of

922
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:14,880
humanity right now in many of
the very destructive and self

923
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:20,840
absorbed and injurious policies
or practices that are arising in

924
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:24,380
our midst. I think of this as
kind of a collective

925
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:29,720
purification, which is part and
parcel of leading into a

926
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,860
spiritual awakening, a deep and
profound spiritual awakening.

927
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:38,839
Emmy Vadnais: Yes, Carl Jung and
the shadow, yeah, focusing on

928
01:06:38,839 --> 01:06:46,359
our own individual shadow cells
are letting ourselves maybe heal

929
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:53,319
from what ails us. Yeah, what
would you suggest people

930
01:06:53,319 --> 01:06:58,839
consider doing as far as, do
they primarily focus on their

931
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:05,159
own selves and or assisting the
collective. I mean, I understand

932
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:07,439
what you're saying, that as we
focus on ourselves, we're part

933
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:08,159
of the collective.

934
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,760
Chris Bache: Yeah, it's a both
end situation, isn't it? Yeah?

935
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,520
Because while an enlightened
individual in a monastery in a

936
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,100
mountain with no contact in the
world may have an uplifting

937
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:25,160
effect on the whole, and that
has that person, has that

938
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:30,800
reality. Most of us live
embodied in the world. And we

939
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:35,600
would like to do more than
heaven, a meditative effect,

940
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,560
uplifting the collective from
the ground. We would like to do

941
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:43,060
something practical. I mean,
we'd like to help the world be a

942
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:46,660
better place, leave it a better
place before we die. We'd like

943
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:50,380
to sort of help people in need,
or help to solve the problems

944
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:56,440
that are endemic to our culture.
If we do that, or try to do that

945
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:01,020
without deep inner clarity, we
may get some success, but will

946
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:06,300
also leave more damage behind
too. So I think it's a both and

947
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:11,580
becoming socially active to work
for social clarity, social

948
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:16,560
peace, and to be personally,
inwardly clear and at peace

949
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:22,340
oneself. I did this years and
years of psychedelic practice

950
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,940
and other spiritual practices
that time. But I was always

951
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:29,900
working as an academic. I was
working hard at an open

952
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:35,420
enrollment University and trying
to raise the corner. That corner

953
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,420
that was my garden, that was
where I worked, and where I was

954
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:41,200
trying to make things better.
And all of my colleagues, they

955
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,260
had their gardens. They were
working to make things better in

956
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:48,700
the world. And so I don't think
it's an either or. I think some

957
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:53,020
people are drawn more to the
this incarnation, to an

958
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:57,520
individual interior project.
Other people are drawn more to

959
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:03,000
an exterior, social project.
There's not a right or wrong

960
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,020
here. I think it's both.

961
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:07,259
Emmy Vadnais: And what would you
like to say to someone who may

962
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:12,239
be listening thinking, Well, I'm
doing my part, but that person

963
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:15,959
or that group or that
institution or that country is

964
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:19,439
really messing things up, and
they're the problem,

965
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,540
Chris Bache: yeah, and they may
be, and there are certainly

966
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:27,260
people, other players in the
world besides ourselves, and

967
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,680
they're, they're doing bad
things in the world. Any right

968
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,460
thinking person would want to
try to mitigate those bad

969
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,940
things. If we see someone
beating a child, naturally, we

970
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:41,620
try to intervene, to stop
without thinking. We just we do

971
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:47,560
it to protect the child. But at
a deeper level, a sort of a more

972
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:52,060
philosophical level, one of the
things that that comes with the

973
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:55,300
reincarnational worldview and
understanding the deep, deep

974
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:59,800
forces that guide people's lives
and set up circumstances is.

975
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,920
It's an absolute waste of time
to be envious of someone else's

976
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,480
good fortune. You should never
judge someone else's bad

977
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,860
fortune. We don't know what got
them there. We don't know

978
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:17,040
whether this is a saint or a
sinner. It could be a sinner

979
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,720
inheriting bad karma, or it
could be a saint who's taken on

980
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:26,180
hard somebody else's bad karma
we don't know. Best to take care

981
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:30,920
of your own shop. Best to do the
very, very best you can with the

982
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,100
circumstances in which you find
yourselves in, because there's

983
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:39,320
meaning and intention in those
circumstances, engage that part

984
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:44,260
of the outside world which is
yours to engage. A lot of it is

985
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,160
recognizing that people are at
different stages of their life,

986
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:54,340
their souls life, and we have to
take the we have to stand the

987
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:58,180
ground, that we need to stand
but most of our judgments aren't

988
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,440
about standing ground. It's just
being judgmental in the way that

989
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,680
creates more barriers that only
have to be taken down later.

990
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:09,600
Judgments are barriers. You
know, there's a way in which we

991
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:15,300
can draw conclusions, but
without living within the harsh

992
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,520
boundaries of judgments. You
know,

993
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,880
Emmy Vadnais: do you feel we're
going through a collective

994
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:28,160
Near-Death Experience, even
though we don't really die,

995
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,740
since our consciousness seems to
continue.

996
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,640
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think we
are going through something like

997
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,180
that. You know what happens when
people have a near fatal

998
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:43,240
accident, and we, we know that
when they they're in, their mind

999
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,980
speeds up. They become able to
do physical things that they

1000
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:51,280
would never have dreamed, that
they could do if they're falling

1001
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,460
off a mountain, they can take,
you know, action along the way.

1002
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,540
And the mind speeds up. And
often the heart opens, the mind

1003
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:03,120
opens, one begins, enters into
Transcendence spaces under the

1004
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:10,560
pressure of almost dying. Now,
it's not being alarmist to say

1005
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,760
that we are going into a near
extinction event on this planet.

1006
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:19,500
The crises, which have only now
just just beginning to start,

1007
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,880
are going to be getting worse,
and everything we're doing in

1008
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,120
this country, I'm afraid,
politically, is going to make

1009
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,440
that crisis, that confrontation
with the planet's limits, even

1010
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:38,420
harder and more severe. So
clearly, we're going into very,

1011
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,860
very difficult and challenging
times, and there are some very

1012
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:46,360
smart people, good, clear
thinking people, who basically

1013
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:50,620
have concluded that's it.
Humanity is toast. We're living

1014
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:54,220
on extended time. There's no
reversing this process. We're

1015
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:58,120
going to go extinct. We're going
to die. We just don't know it

1016
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,860
yet, but it's the if you look at
the statistics, you look at the

1017
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:07,020
information, you look at the
patterns, we're going extinct. I

1018
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:10,200
personally don't think we are
going extinct, but I don't

1019
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:14,040
believe that, like on rational
calculus grounds, I believe it

1020
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,160
because of my spiritual
experiences that we do make it

1021
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:21,800
through this crisis, but it
clearly is going to be a planet

1022
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,400
changing crisis. It's going to
be a civilization changing

1023
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,880
crisis. It's going to be a
Near-Death Experience of our

1024
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,900
culture, of our life on this
planet. And we might learn

1025
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:36,320
something about what might
happen during it, if we study

1026
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,360
people, individuals who have had
near death experiences. So I

1027
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,900
think we are I think things are
speeding up. I think things are

1028
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:48,160
becoming dire. I think there are
fewer and fewer innocent

1029
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:53,620
decisions. Every decision has
infinite ramifications. I think

1030
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,200
we're coming into a make or
break point. This is we're

1031
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:01,500
coming into a point of grow up
or die. And the threat of

1032
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:05,700
extinction is a tremendous
evolutionary accelerator, and I

1033
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:09,000
think we're coming into a time
where we're beginning to realize

1034
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,840
that if we don't change our
practices, we're going to lose

1035
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:20,180
our life on this planet. And
that core deep down inside this

1036
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:24,200
transformation that's required
is not simply a transformation

1037
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:29,120
of politics or economics or
industrial production or

1038
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,640
agricultural it's not that
primarily. It is fundamentally a

1039
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,320
crisis of consciousness. It is
the structure of human

1040
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,820
consciousness that has gotten us
into this mess. It's the

1041
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:46,540
limitations of ego, the
loneliness, the self

1042
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:52,240
centeredness of our so called
cut off ego that has led us into

1043
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:56,620
these dead end scenarios of just
consuming more and more and more

1044
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,780
but not experience any
satisfaction that really. It

1045
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:06,420
gives us any steep, true psycho
spiritual nourishment, we either

1046
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:10,800
make it through this crisis or
we go extinct. I personally,

1047
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,700
because that's the visions I've
been given. I think we make it

1048
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,760
through. My concern is how many
of our children and

1049
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,080
grandchildren and great
grandchildren are going to die

1050
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,860
before we make it through.
That's my major concern.

1051
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,440
Emmy Vadnais: There may be those
listening thinking, Well, if

1052
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:36,920
there is this oceanic wave of
love and oneness, why does it

1053
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:41,500
have to get so bad or hard? Why
do we have to get to this point,

1054
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:44,440
why do we have to suffer so
much? Why does there have to be

1055
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:52,900
pain and suffering and people
being treated poorly and dying a

1056
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,200
bodily death when maybe they
didn't otherwise have to?

1057
01:15:56,859 --> 01:16:00,719
Chris Bache: Yeah, boy, that's a
hard question. You're asking

1058
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:06,419
hard questions today. You're
basically asking the question,

1059
01:16:06,419 --> 01:16:10,439
why is there suffering, if there
is intelligence and wisdom and

1060
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:14,999
love as a starting point of
creation, why is it so damn

1061
01:16:14,999 --> 01:16:18,959
hard? Why do we suffer so much?
Why didn't somebody give us an

1062
01:16:18,959 --> 01:16:22,819
instruction manual, you know,
help us do better? Why is it so

1063
01:16:22,819 --> 01:16:28,099
hard? And we get angry at the
divine intelligence, and we say,

1064
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,859
we think we could do it better.
If I were doing this universe, I

1065
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:33,079
could design a better universe.
There wouldn't be as much

1066
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:36,139
suffering. You know, we do it
differently, but all of that

1067
01:16:36,139 --> 01:16:41,979
assumes that we know what is
being built. We judge from the

1068
01:16:41,979 --> 01:16:47,019
context of our own historical
position, and we make judgments

1069
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:51,939
about what a good humanity would
look like, or what a spiritually

1070
01:16:51,939 --> 01:16:54,699
realized humanity would look
like, or just what a peaceful

1071
01:16:54,699 --> 01:16:58,119
humanity would look like, and
this is how we could build

1072
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:01,319
toward that. But maybe we're not
building toward that. Maybe

1073
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:06,539
we're building through that.
Clearly, the creative

1074
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:10,379
intelligence thinks on a huge
landscape. When you really just

1075
01:17:10,379 --> 01:17:14,699
meditate on what astrophysics
has taught us and astronomy has

1076
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:18,359
taught us, the landscape of
creation is vast and

1077
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:23,959
magnificent. So we have to
genuinely ask ourselves, okay,

1078
01:17:24,499 --> 01:17:28,759
what is this intelligence
creating in this species? What

1079
01:17:28,759 --> 01:17:33,559
is the project? Where are we
going? What might we become? And

1080
01:17:33,559 --> 01:17:40,779
if we expand in even lightly,
100,000 years, which is a second

1081
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:45,219
in cosmic time, even if we
imagine what would be the best

1082
01:17:45,219 --> 01:17:49,839
that we could become in 100,000
years, could we might begin to

1083
01:17:49,839 --> 01:17:57,279
understand where suffering fits
into this larger agenda, which

1084
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:00,359
is larger than most of our
agenda. Most of us would think

1085
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:03,419
if we could just get comfortable
and be a happy human being as we

1086
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:08,099
are, and live, eat and die, we'd
be okay. But maybe that's not

1087
01:18:08,099 --> 01:18:12,059
the agenda of existence at all,
of the creative intelligence,

1088
01:18:12,839 --> 01:18:17,339
and I don't mean to treat people
suffering cavalierly. I truly do

1089
01:18:17,339 --> 01:18:21,379
not mean so I mean it's all
great respect to those who

1090
01:18:21,379 --> 01:18:28,699
suffer honestly, but suffering
in some ways in our time is like

1091
01:18:28,819 --> 01:18:32,539
when we're building a house, and
we have the walls up, the stud

1092
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:35,239
walls up, and we have the
trusses up, but we haven't put

1093
01:18:35,239 --> 01:18:39,619
on the roof. And if it rains,
rain comes in, it's because the

1094
01:18:39,619 --> 01:18:42,279
house is unfinished. It's not
because there's any structural

1095
01:18:42,279 --> 01:18:45,399
design flaw in the house. The
house is just not finished.

1096
01:18:45,939 --> 01:18:51,519
Humanity is an unfinished
species. Sri Aurobindo made a

1097
01:18:51,519 --> 01:18:55,239
large point of this. He talked
about how humanity is a

1098
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:59,799
transitional species. We are
transitioning from what we were

1099
01:18:59,799 --> 01:19:03,839
100,000 years ago into what we
are in the process of becoming

1100
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:08,639
deep. We are not the end of the
project. We are just in the

1101
01:19:08,639 --> 01:19:13,919
middle of the project. In that
context, if we take disease, for

1102
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:19,199
example, we are we are only at
the early stages of developing

1103
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:24,079
our consciousness so clearly and
strongly that we can heal

1104
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:27,799
diseases in our body with our
minds. We know

1105
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:32,659
psychoneuroimmunology has shown
us this, but I'm talking about

1106
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:36,259
the serious diseases that seem
so resistance to this subtle

1107
01:19:36,259 --> 01:19:41,499
manipulation. We are just
getting started in basically

1108
01:19:41,559 --> 01:19:46,419
exploring the potential of our
consciousness to keep this

1109
01:19:46,419 --> 01:19:51,399
system healthy and strong and
some of the suffering of

1110
01:19:51,399 --> 01:19:57,459
disease, it's just an unfinished
business. We haven't gotten to

1111
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:01,319
the point where we can control
ourselves. It much Our knowledge

1112
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:05,039
has not expanded yet to be able
to supplement what we can do

1113
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:09,719
with our mind. There's just so
much which is unfinished. So

1114
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:13,859
before we kind of take over
control and blame God for doing

1115
01:20:13,859 --> 01:20:18,479
such a mess up, we might examine
our own assumptions of what the

1116
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:21,859
what the purpose of the project
is what the goal of the project

1117
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:22,279
is.

1118
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:27,260
Emmy Vadnais: Because you're a
man of deep philosophy and

1119
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:31,100
religious and spiritual studies.
I know you mentioned this in

1120
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,860
your book in our previous
conversation, and since you

1121
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:39,200
brought up God, can you briefly
mention your relationship to

1122
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,460
that term?

1123
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:43,899
Chris Bache: I was raised in a
Catholic tradition. I was

1124
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:48,459
studying to be a priest in the
early years. For four years, I

1125
01:20:48,459 --> 01:20:53,199
have learned a lot in watching
religions coming to existence.

1126
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:58,539
And in some ways, dogma is kind
of like sausage. You never want

1127
01:20:58,539 --> 01:21:02,579
to see one being made, you know,
because it's it may look good on

1128
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:06,119
the outside, but boy, a whole
lot of personality gets involved

1129
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:10,619
in the forging of dogma in
history, you know. So it's a

1130
01:21:10,619 --> 01:21:14,399
sobering experience to truly
watch how religions come into

1131
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:18,599
existence. And so I've learned
just from the study of history

1132
01:21:18,599 --> 01:21:22,759
that one of the most dangerous
things that a human being is can

1133
01:21:22,759 --> 01:21:28,699
say is, I know what God wants
you to do. You should do this,

1134
01:21:29,059 --> 01:21:34,459
you know. And there's so many
limitations, cultural

1135
01:21:34,459 --> 01:21:37,459
limitations, historical
limitations, that are built into

1136
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:41,739
God vocabulary, to the god
language, that I prefer not to

1137
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:45,939
use that term, but, and I would
talk about the divine, but even

1138
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:52,239
the Divine is super loaded with
historical associations. And so

1139
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:56,559
the in the title of my book on
psychedelic work is LSD in the

1140
01:21:56,559 --> 01:22:04,379
mind of the universe. And I
chose not to kind of concretize

1141
01:22:04,379 --> 01:22:08,339
that with an image of divinity,
because I see those images of

1142
01:22:08,339 --> 01:22:12,599
divinity as so historically
conditioned that they weren't

1143
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:17,399
large enough to envision what I
was trying to describe. Now we

1144
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:21,439
have a sense of how vast the
universe is, so we count its

1145
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:24,739
distance in light years. And
each light year is 6 million

1146
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:29,299
million miles, and we count it
in terms of multiple 1000s of

1147
01:22:29,299 --> 01:22:34,999
light years. And then to imagine
that there is a mind which is as

1148
01:22:34,999 --> 01:22:40,359
large as this universe is large.
And then to try to fathom what

1149
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:44,679
that mind might be like, and
then to take a journey in which

1150
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:51,699
you, you self, initiate into the
edges of that vast, expensive

1151
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:57,459
mind, several things kind of
happen, or at least happen to

1152
01:22:57,459 --> 01:23:02,399
me. One is that I fell in love.
I fell in love with this

1153
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:07,859
reality. Once you experience it
in its clarity, it's so powerful

1154
01:23:07,859 --> 01:23:13,559
and so magnificent and so
beautiful that it I call it my

1155
01:23:13,559 --> 01:23:18,839
beloved. It's just it is a love
relationship with life, with

1156
01:23:18,839 --> 01:23:24,139
this deeper intelligence
embedded in life. Now I

1157
01:23:24,139 --> 01:23:27,739
sometimes talk about the divine,
as I have here, and sometimes

1158
01:23:27,739 --> 01:23:32,899
I'll even talk about God if I
feel that the context is clear

1159
01:23:32,899 --> 01:23:35,539
that I'm not using those terms
in their conventional

1160
01:23:35,539 --> 01:23:39,679
references, but I'm using to
point to what those terms point

1161
01:23:39,799 --> 01:23:43,959
to, ideally, this infinitely
large horizon, this expanse,

1162
01:23:43,959 --> 01:23:47,199
this beauty, this knowledge,
this genius. We're talking about

1163
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:54,339
cosmic genius in this universe.
The hardest thing that I found

1164
01:23:55,059 --> 01:23:59,259
in negotiating all of my
psychedelic work was not what

1165
01:23:59,259 --> 01:24:03,839
happened in that journey during
the sessions, the hardest part

1166
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:09,239
came when I ended that journey,
and everything was fine,

1167
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:13,199
everything was good. There was
no trauma. I was I had, had, had

1168
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:17,999
been given many, many gifts of
intimacy with the divine. But

1169
01:24:17,999 --> 01:24:21,139
then when I withdrew, and I
stepped out of it, and I was no

1170
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:24,979
longer making contact,
experiential contact, with that

1171
01:24:24,979 --> 01:24:30,559
deeper reality, for reasons that
I explained in the book, it was

1172
01:24:30,919 --> 01:24:35,359
the loss of contact with my
beloved. Even though I knew the

1173
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:40,659
beloved was always here, I knew
that it was only my own blinders

1174
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:43,659
which were keeping me from
experiencing it. I knew it was

1175
01:24:43,659 --> 01:24:47,859
always the warp and woof of
reality that I was embedded in,

1176
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:52,719
but the intensity of being
dissolved into the body of light

1177
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:59,199
that is the underlying light of
universe. It it caused such a

1178
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:05,219
deep sadness. Us a deep
withdrawal. It was very

1179
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:08,639
difficult, and it really took me
about 10 years after I stopped

1180
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:14,159
my sessions, to really get fully
grounded and committed to living

1181
01:25:14,339 --> 01:25:19,559
in this earth on its terms.
Again, I give you that anecdote

1182
01:25:19,559 --> 01:25:23,839
just to say that my journey into
the divine had many stages and

1183
01:25:23,839 --> 01:25:28,519
many layers over many years. I
would not trade any of those

1184
01:25:28,519 --> 01:25:36,559
days for any treasures on earth.
And learning how to live without

1185
01:25:36,559 --> 01:25:40,959
the constant immersion or the
repetitive immersion into those

1186
01:25:40,959 --> 01:25:44,319
treasures has been a real
learning exercise for me that it

1187
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:45,279
continues.

1188
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:50,920
Emmy Vadnais: Yeah, Chris, how
do you suggest? Or what do you

1189
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:58,540
recommend? Are ways that people
can explore themselves, get in

1190
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:04,560
touch with the deeper creative
intelligence inside of them to

1191
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:10,500
be able to move that karmic part
of them forward. Are there any

1192
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:14,760
particular practices that are
maybe outside or part of

1193
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,060
psychedelics that can assist
people listening?

1194
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,140
Chris Bache: There's so many
practices, because what we're

1195
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:25,040
talking about is spirituality.
And the Christians have an

1196
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,460
approach to spirituality, the
Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, they

1197
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:33,440
have an approach to spirituality
with a lot of common ground. But

1198
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,920
it's no secret. And now we live
in a time in history where these

1199
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:40,960
previously secret teachings are
now available on every street

1200
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:46,720
corner. You know, after China
invaded Tibet, lineage, holders

1201
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:49,960
of this tremendous, ancient
spiritual lineage have now

1202
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,140
flooded into the Western
countries, and we have centers

1203
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,020
throughout the United States and
Europe. We're talking about

1204
01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:00,360
basic spiritual practices. We're
also talking about maybe psycho

1205
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,360
therapeutic practices, we're
basically using a

1206
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:07,200
psychotherapeutic approach to
heal some of the surface wounds

1207
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:13,500
of this of the heart. My first
sitter was my wife, Carl, and

1208
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:17,460
she's clinical psychologist, and
she never did a psychedelic

1209
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:20,780
session. It wasn't her cup of
tea. She really found everything

1210
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:23,480
she needed on her meditation
cushion. And

1211
01:27:23,479 --> 01:27:25,639
Emmy Vadnais: just to clarify
you by sitter, you mean the

1212
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:28,699
person who was with you during
your LSD sessions.

1213
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,280
Chris Bache: Yeah, she was, she
was my sitter and holding the

1214
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:35,180
fort while I was in my LSD
sessions, and she was managing

1215
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:39,980
them with music and whatnot. She
never wanted to sit her setting

1216
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:44,380
that wanted to do a session
herself. She has subsequently

1217
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:48,280
gone on to complete her three
year, three month, three day

1218
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:53,680
solo retreat in the Vajrayana
tradition, she's been made and

1219
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:59,200
recognized as a lama within her
community, and she has a very,

1220
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:06,120
very rich interior life. We're
friends, and it didn't involve

1221
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:12,180
psychedelics at all. So there's
so many there's so many lineages

1222
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:15,960
of spiritual teachings. There's
Celtic lineages, so many Native

1223
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:20,040
American lineages, there's South
American lineages. There are the

1224
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,540
Ayahuasca traditions, there are
some psychedelic shamanic

1225
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:27,980
traditions that are entering our
country strongly now. There are

1226
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:32,240
everyday wisdom traditions that
are available in abundance at

1227
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:37,820
any bookstore at any airport.
Sounds true, and this program is

1228
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:41,500
an example of inner teachings
being made publicly available.

1229
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:46,720
Even if I started a list, it
would be just a fraction of

1230
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:51,340
what's really available. We can
find the practices that can help

1231
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:57,520
us live a calmer, quieter, more
centered, richer life. You know,

1232
01:28:57,820 --> 01:29:01,740
those are available and the
practices which are taught are

1233
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:06,540
pretty much the same. First,
kindness, non injury,

1234
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:11,100
simplicity, voluntary
simplicity, centering,

1235
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:18,780
stillness, social, kindness,
social being good to people. And

1236
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:22,160
it's a long road, and it's not a
road which is going to be

1237
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:26,900
traveled in any one lifetime. So
this is a road that's going to

1238
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:31,040
be traveled over many lifetimes,
but every lifetime can get

1239
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,320
better than the life before it.

1240
01:29:34,099 --> 01:29:36,799
Emmy Vadnais: We've also touched
on the shadow part, and in

1241
01:29:36,799 --> 01:29:40,599
addition and kind of building on
what you just shared, how much

1242
01:29:40,599 --> 01:29:47,799
of a role does having a good
time, joy, love, following your

1243
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:53,379
own bliss or creativity play a
role in a person's karma and

1244
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:54,879
reincarnation?

1245
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:58,780
Chris Bache: Yeah, it certainly
does. I mean, it's just part of

1246
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:03,540
the fabric. I. Think, because we
learn about reincarnation from

1247
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:07,320
reading the books from
therapists, we have a tendency

1248
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:11,040
to cast the thinking about
reincarnation in a negative

1249
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:15,840
light, because people go to
therapists who are in pain and

1250
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:22,280
but if you are exceptionally
brilliant, creative composer.

1251
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:27,140
You know you can explore that
dimension of your life and find

1252
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:30,920
and trace the roots of your love
of music, and you'll find that

1253
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:36,080
it goes deeper than this present
lifetime. All of our past gives

1254
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:41,500
us, all of our virtues and all
of our vices, and we honor

1255
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:46,600
existence by accepting the
virtues, building on them and

1256
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,260
then working to reduce the
vices, to unlock their unlock

1257
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:51,640
them and let them go.

1258
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:57,460
Emmy Vadnais: What role does
self love play in this process?

1259
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:02,039
Chris Bache: How can you be in
love? How can you love the world

1260
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:05,819
if you don't love yourself? It's
one of the things that came real

1261
01:31:05,819 --> 01:31:09,299
clear in some of my teachings,
that if you're going to become

1262
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:13,799
one with the God, if you're
going to become one with all of

1263
01:31:13,799 --> 01:31:19,739
life, you must become one with
yourself. And therefore, when

1264
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:23,779
you try to become one with God,
one with the universe.

1265
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:28,999
Everything which is incompatible
with becoming one with yourself

1266
01:31:28,999 --> 01:31:33,199
is forced to the surface. So all
of your injuries, all of your

1267
01:31:33,799 --> 01:31:38,359
trauma, all of your self
defeating habits and behaviors,

1268
01:31:38,539 --> 01:31:42,459
these are all shoved to the
surface right inside you, right

1269
01:31:42,459 --> 01:31:47,439
in front of you. So self love,
self acceptance is absolutely

1270
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:54,279
critical, but not superficial.
Self Love, real deep self love,

1271
01:31:54,459 --> 01:31:58,119
love that's willing to take on
the shadow, love which is

1272
01:31:58,119 --> 01:32:02,339
willing to love that shadow
until that shadow becomes a baby

1273
01:32:02,339 --> 01:32:06,359
in your arms, and you take care
of it and nurture it. You know

1274
01:32:06,359 --> 01:32:09,779
the deep love, really deep, the
type of love a mother has for

1275
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:13,079
her child. That love was the
type of love we have to have for

1276
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:17,459
ourselves and so we can handle
we can clean anything that needs

1277
01:32:17,459 --> 01:32:19,079
to be cleaned in it,

1278
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:24,320
Emmy Vadnais: unconditional love
and unconditional acceptance and

1279
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,680
love covers a multitude of sins.

1280
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,600
Chris Bache: Well, let's say it
compensates, doesn't it?

1281
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:38,120
Emmy Vadnais: Chris, you've
shared so much today about

1282
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,540
collective karma and
reincarnation, and I know we're

1283
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:44,620
going to have another
conversation about the birth of

1284
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:49,900
a future human that you
discovered in your LSD sessions.

1285
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:53,380
And I'm wondering if you want to
just touch on that a little bit

1286
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:57,400
to prime us for our next
conversation and what that's

1287
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,060
about,

1288
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:02,280
Chris Bache: I'd love to one of
the surprises for me in my

1289
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:07,440
psychedelic work, because I
began this work adopting a model

1290
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:11,340
of transformation, a model of
personal transformation, which

1291
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,340
is pretty widespread in the
Transpersonal community, that

1292
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:17,280
when you do these practices,
it's about personal

1293
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,980
transformation, Personal
awakening, personal healing,

1294
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:24,740
personal enlightenment, and one
of the surprises for me has been

1295
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:30,680
how much of my work didn't seem
to be about me personally at

1296
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:36,320
all. It was about collective and
it was collective dynamics, and

1297
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:41,200
my love for myself expanded to
embrace the love of my people,

1298
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,320
and the love of my planet, and
the love of all the beings on

1299
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:49,240
the planet. So it just wasn't
about me personally. As that

1300
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:55,240
deepened over the years, I began
to be initiated into a series of

1301
01:33:55,240 --> 01:34:01,200
visions where it was not about
my spiritual evolution, it was

1302
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:05,100
about the spiritual evolution of
humanity, where humanity was

1303
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:08,760
going. And this is, this is, I
just want to emphasize. This is

1304
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:14,580
an utterly natural phenomenon
our individual mind. When we

1305
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:17,460
relax the boundaries of our
individual mind, our

1306
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:21,020
consciousness opens and deep
into our personal unconscious.

1307
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:25,340
But as you keep clearing and you
keep relaxing, it opens up into

1308
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:29,000
this underlying field that Jung
called the collective psyche.

1309
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:34,220
And it's just natural that when
you go deeper into that

1310
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:37,760
collective psyche, and even
pushing through it to the matrix

1311
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,460
underneath that, that you
inherit insights into what's

1312
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:46,660
going on in the life of this
being. We count our lives in

1313
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:50,800
years. It counts its life in
millennia, right? So it's just

1314
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:56,200
it opens up naturally, and I
began to have insights of

1315
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:01,860
humanity poised on the edge of
a. Global death and rebirth

1316
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:05,040
process, that what I had
experienced is death and

1317
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,860
rebirth, and what every
meditator experiences in terms

1318
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:11,340
of death and rebirth on the
meditation cushion, that there

1319
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:15,420
was actually now fermenting
within history, a death and

1320
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:19,500
rebirth dynamic that was so
large, so powerful, it was

1321
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:26,120
carrying all of humanity in its
grip. This was a surprise, an

1322
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:30,560
absolute surprise to me, but it
leave led me to have a certain

1323
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,820
understanding that the project
of history at this point, I

1324
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:39,920
think, a way of summing up the a
project is to give birth to a

1325
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,480
new kind of human being, the
giving birth into what I call

1326
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:47,440
the future human. Some people
call it Homo spiritualis, Homo

1327
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:52,000
noeticus, the different words
for it, but a new form of human

1328
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,500
being who isn't simply the old
human being, polished up and

1329
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:01,740
cleaned up and, you know, doing
better, but truly a revolution

1330
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,540
that causes the plate tectonics
of the collective psyche to

1331
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:12,000
shift so that all children born
after this shift takes place.

1332
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,760
And I'm not talking about a
shift that takes place in 24

1333
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:19,020
hours, but takes place over
decades of work. All children

1334
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,820
born after this pivot are
literally functioning within a

1335
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:26,120
different collective psyche.
This is something that's taking

1336
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:30,800
place at a very, very deep
collective level. And I was

1337
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:35,960
given teachings to explain how
this is working out through

1338
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,680
reincarnation, what the project
of reincarnation is, how does it

1339
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:43,480
play into this? I introduce
concepts that will talk about

1340
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:47,140
the birth of the diamond soul,
this integration of all of our

1341
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:52,240
former lives, coming into a
unity synthesis and leading to

1342
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:57,520
an exponential explosion of
insight and compassion inside

1343
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:01,200
the human heart and human mind.
That's what we're going to be

1344
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:04,260
talking about. We're going to be
talking about where humanity is

1345
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:08,460
taking where reincarnation is
taking humanity, what some of

1346
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:13,800
the mechanisms are trying to
understand underneath the

1347
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:18,600
turmoil of our times, which are
getting more and more tumultuous

1348
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:23,840
almost year by year, and where,
where we might be going, what

1349
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,760
the larger project is. And I
must confess, I found what I was

1350
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:35,240
given deeply reassuring, because
I feel the growing waves of

1351
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:40,520
darkness. I feel the chaos, and
I see the social struggle that

1352
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:45,700
we don't know how to navigate
the falling apart process, but I

1353
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:51,880
take great strength in being
given an understanding of what's

1354
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:55,420
going on here at a deeper level,
and that's what I'd like to

1355
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:57,220
share with you in our next
conversation.

1356
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,740
Emmy Vadnais: Well, I'm very
much looking forward to the

1357
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:05,280
conversation about the birth of
the future human and Chris, is

1358
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:09,540
there anything else you want to
share about collective karma and

1359
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:10,980
reincarnation today?

1360
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:14,640
Chris Bache: Well, I'll just
share one visionary experience,

1361
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:19,620
which I share in LSD, in the
mind of the universe. It was

1362
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:23,540
late in my journey. It was, I
don't know, 15 years or so into

1363
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:29,480
my journey, and I had already
gone through multiple layers of

1364
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:34,280
death into deeper and deeper
levels, and I opened up into a

1365
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:40,400
very, very deep level in which I
experienced all of humanity as a

1366
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:46,120
single organism, reincarnation,
generation by generation, the

1367
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:51,640
entire the entire family of
humanity was going through this

1368
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:55,060
developmental process that all
of us individually are going

1369
01:38:55,060 --> 01:39:03,300
through and experiencing all of
humanity in this flow of

1370
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:08,100
learning and in this flow of
perpetual development, perpetual

1371
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:11,160
integration of more and more
spiritual reality into their

1372
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:18,540
lives, was, on the one hand, an
extremely uplifting experience,

1373
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:23,960
and It was also a devastating
experience, because I saw from

1374
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:28,460
the one perspective, you might
say, that whole generations will

1375
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:32,300
be sacrifice in this historical
transformation we're going

1376
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:35,720
through. And it had the
ruthlessness of Kali, the

1377
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:40,660
destroyer of, you know, of you
know, the gods which bring death

1378
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:45,220
and destruction in order to
liberate and at the same time,

1379
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:49,660
this was not something which is
being done to us. This is some a

1380
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:54,820
role that we voluntarily took on
as our offering to the creative

1381
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:58,780
intelligence in the evolution of
this species at this point in

1382
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:03,960
time. So it. Was hard teaching,
and it was a magnificent,

1383
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:09,360
ecstatic teaching, all at the
same time. And the key is just

1384
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,600
to realize that what is taking
place in the lives of

1385
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:17,820
individuals is also taking place
in the lives of the species. We

1386
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:22,040
are all in this together. We're
moving ultimately, we are all

1387
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:25,400
have to move together. Some
people may get a little ahead,

1388
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,280
some people may drag a little
behind, but ultimately, we are

1389
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:32,660
moving together as we move
through this, this transition

1390
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:40,240
and the magnitude of the beauty
of what we are becoming, I don't

1391
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:43,000
know how I'm going to talk about
that without crying when we talk

1392
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,860
next it's just so magnificent.

1393
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:49,480
Emmy Vadnais: Oh, I know I
teared up a few times in this

1394
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:52,900
conversation today, and also
when I read your fabulous book,

1395
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:56,260
LSD and the mind of the
universe, it is very deeply

1396
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:59,620
moving, and I look forward to
exploring more with you in the

1397
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:03,600
next conversation. Chris Bache,
thank you so much once again for

1398
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:08,880
this incredible conversation
that I hope many find insightful

1399
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:14,400
and hopefully uplifting in this
journey of life that we're all a

1400
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,100
part of together. Thank you for
being with me today.

1401
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,740

well, and for those of you

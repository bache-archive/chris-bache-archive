Um, I think Stevenson's evidence is really a strong evidence for some type of continuity of an awareness from lifetime to lifetime, especially his last two book, which is a two volume book on philosophy and on reincarnation in biology, in which he studied 170 87 cases of children who not only had psychological recall from their previous lifetime, but actually bore the marks in their body in the form of birthmarks, which replicated wounds of death in the previous incarnation. So somehow, it was as if consciousness had been traumatized in such a way that it not only imprinted on subsequent mind, but it imprinted on the body of subsequent mind. So after looking at this data a lot, I think what it tells us is we have information in our mind that predates this body.

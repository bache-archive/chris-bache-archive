1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,360
Chris Bache: What is? What is a
group mind, or collective

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,680
consciousness? The way I have
experienced patterns of

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,460
collective mind, the primary
ways in which context in which

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,540
I've experienced them in my work
has been working with students

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,820
in the classroom, and there i i
find that using Morphic, sheld

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,060
Rupert Sheldrake work in Morphic
field theory and the theory of

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,200
formative causation, to
understand some of the patterns

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,480
that were emerging in the
classroom were very helpful. Was

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,220
very helpful. So that when a
group of students come together,

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,880
and they come together with a
common intention, if you can

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,580
strengthen that common
intention, if you can strengthen

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,140
it and attend to the quality of
engagement, which injects our

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,280
common work with an emotional
intensity, not simply a passive

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,280
intellectual intensity, which
you often get in a, you know,

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,100
introductory course at a
university, Just a passive

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,880
engagement, but if you can
elicit active engagement and

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,520
focus that engagement in
meaningful exercises with in

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,340
which the students have freedom
of choice, and therefore the

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,720
choices they make freely have
greater power than the choices

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,340
which are pushed upon them with
time and with repetition,

21
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,540
meeting not just once or twice,
but meeting week after week,

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,140
month after month, and in some
cases, when students take

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,580
multiple courses with you, year
after year there, There seems to

24
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,900
form a certain porosity, a
certain transparency, so that

25
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,080
students sometimes find
themselves showing up in each

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,240
other's dreams and synchronistic
experiences begin to increase

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,060
among students in the class, or
often, as I described, in dark

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,720
night, early dawn, a certain
transparency would sometimes

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,940
open between my mind and their
and my students mind, so that

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,320
they would find sometimes when I
would just be reaching, you

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,640
know, in the in the void, so to
speak, reaching, for the

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,260
example, to illustrate a
particular point in the lecture,

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,420
I would end up using as a what
would be, to me, a randomly

34
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,420
chosen example, something which
would have drawn from the

35
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,960
immediate life experience of one
of the students in the

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,980
classroom, in a way which, when
they heard that woven into the

37
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,680
lecture, would hit a nerve in
their life that would trigger a

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,420
reaction and engagement, even
though I was not in any way

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,180
myself conscious of making any
paranormal or psychic contact.

40
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,740
Yet there seems to be this
process of flow, osmosis,

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,040
exchange of information that
takes place between the

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,820
different parties in the room.
At first, I thought of this in

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,060
terms of some kind of psychic
bridging taking place between my

44
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,200
mind and their mind, right? But
over time, I began to adopt a

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,480
more collective representational
model that this is, this is the

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,800
emergence into into conscious
expression of a literally, of an

47
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,400
entity you can get when you can
think of it as an entity, as a

48
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,100
standing wave within larger
currents of mind.

49
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,900
xcite83: Say more about that?
The standing wave? Yeah, we're

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,440
just, well, I realize you have
to use metaphor. Yeah, it's all

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,520
weird for this, I

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,000
Chris Bache: use metaphors sort
of drawn out of fluid dynamics

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,420
and chaos theory and non linear
mathematics and Jung Ian

54
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,340
psychology and Transpersonal
theory, just using this assembly

55
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,860
of metaphors to express a very
simple observation, and that is

56
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,920
that mind is an inherent quality
of life that that characterizes

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,100
every pattern of life. And if
the pattern in the physical

58
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,080
world is collective social,
there will be corresponding

59
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,640
patterns of mind in the domain
of spirit. So where people

60
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,900
gather regularly, repeatedly,
with common intentionality,

61
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,160
there is an accumulation of
energy in the world of

62
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,380
consciousness. So that I began
to understand that classes have

63
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,140
minds. Not only do classes have
minds, but a course has a mind.

64
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,220
And so the course is the
cumulative learning effect in

65
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,700
Rupert Sheldrake terms of all
the learning of all the students

66
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,220
who have ever taken this
particular course with this

67
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,780
particular professor the class.
Mind is the most recent layer of

68
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,520
the course mind, but the course
mind is, in a sense, a dynamic,

69
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,240
a truly psychically potent
dynamic force which influences

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,860
the patterns of learning of the
present class of students who

71
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,100
have just taken this course,
taking this course this

72
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,260
semester, that's the class. But
they are influenced in their

73
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,300
attempt to learn these ideas.
They they are influenced from

74
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,260
inside, so to speak, by the
cumulative effect of all the

75
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,440
students who have ever studied
this material with this

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,940
professor, which in my case,
would be about 25 years

77
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,100
xcite83: of students,
fascinating. Do they enter at a

78
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,500
higher level? Is that your
experience? Yeah, basically,

79
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,060
Chris Bache: find that every few
years, every so many years, I

80
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,980
have to redesign my entire
course, because the students are

81
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,840
starting at a higher level. They
kind of get it faster. You know,

82
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,540
when you develop a 15 week
course, you have a certain

83
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,080
agenda, and you you have two or
three weeks to get to a

84
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,600
particular point in the course,
and then two or three weeks to

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,200
get to another point. And
sometimes you get into class the

86
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,260
first week, and the students
will signal you that they're

87
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,720
already about three or four
weeks ahead in the syllabus,

88
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,700
just because they have a you
don't have to persuade them of

89
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,940
certain things that you used to
have to persuade students. It's

90
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,360
like they those ideas are more
easily available to them. You

91
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,180
can do it, give it to them in
shorthand, and then you have to

92
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,080
redesign the curriculum on the
spot in order to kind of keep up

93
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,980
with where they are. Now, there
could be several things

94
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,820
contributing to this. It could
be improved pedagogical

95
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,840
delivery. It could be cultural
shifts that are taking place in

96
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,920
the background, right? But I
think one of the things that's

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,580
happening is literally the
learning which previous students

98
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,100
have undertaken literally make
it easier for subsequent

99
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,560
students to pick up certain
concept, this, these same

100
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,100
concepts, and so they learn it
much faster, and you can move

101
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,400
through things much more
quickly. And that's what Morphic

102
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,720
field theory leads to

103
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:18,179
xcite83: expect, right? How
about individual mind? You know,

104
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:27,139
would you say individual mind is
a misnomer in some sense, that

105
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:33,439
whatever our individual mind is
is inherently an expression of

106
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,299
something collective. Or, you
know, because in our culture,

107
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:41,499
everybody, there's such a
particularly in America, there's

108
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:46,239
such a strong emphasis on
individualism, and I think

109
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,679
there's a kind of conviction
that, you know, I'm an

110
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,379
individual, and people hear a
word like group mind or

111
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,899
something, and they just what,
you know, it sounds terrifying,

112
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,659
like the worst possible thing,
because it sounds like the loss

113
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:01,619
of the of their individuality.
But I was, I mean, well, but

114
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:04,559
isn't everybody lost? It? Isn't
everybody in a group mind. And

115
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:08,159
actually some, some of it's more
pathological, you know, and some

116
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:11,399
are more awake, but in some
sense culture and, you know,

117
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,219
every thought that we think is
in some sense conditioned by

118
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,239
larger collective events and
forces. And you kind of get the

119
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:21,259
general sense. So I'm just, what
does that say about whatever we

120
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,239
think our individual mind
actually is?

121
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,360
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think, by
the way, you're absolutely right

122
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,480
about our cultural paranoia
about this group mind thing, and

123
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,020
we can see it in the Star Trek
series around the Borg, yeah,

124
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,700
which is, if there is a group
mind, then it has a de

125
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,440
humanizing, a de individualizing
effect, right? When actually

126
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,620
it's just the opposite, that
somehow the mystery is that what

127
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,880
that evolution has learned found
a way to evolve, not only whole

128
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,900
groups, whole species, but has
now found a way to evolve

129
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,460
individuals within the species.
That's how I connect

130
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,420
reincarnation to evolution, so
that this whole evolutionary

131
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,200
trust which evolves groups upon
groups upon groups now is

132
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,660
evolving individuals within
groups, and at the same time

133
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,260
that individuality, while
extremely precious and from an

134
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,460
evolutionary perspective, extra
ordinarily important. If you

135
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,000
really look carefully at what
that individuality is, you find

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,060
it is an open system which
reflects the entire cultural and

137
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,720
psychological history of the
species that we're talking

138
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:48,940
about. I think that we have for
several 1000 years, been on a

139
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,120
journey which has been
potentiating individuality.

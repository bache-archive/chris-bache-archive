1
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,440
Chris Bache: And eventually you
come out with a certain

2
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,820
understanding, at least, of the
large structure, the nature of

3
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,320
reality. We're not simply
creating a new society or a

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,400
better society or a new economy
or a new ecology. We are

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,840
actually giving birth to a new
form of the human species. I

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,900
never expected anything like
this to emerge in the work. I

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,920
didn't know that this was even
possible. At the subtle level of

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,420
consciousness, you open up to
different levels of collective

9
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,600
consciousness, and so when your
individual identity pops. I have

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,800
had the experience many times of
opening up to my species

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,660
identity, to the collective
psyche.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,300
Well, I'm always hesitant to
jump into this, because my

13
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:21,200
experiences are based upon
shamanic, you know, rigorous use

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,100
of LSD. And when everyone hears
LSD, they think, Oh, the 60s.

15
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,340
They think hallucinations. They
think, you know, and this is

16
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,760
very far from this. This is
really within a therapeutic

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,240
tradition. It's within Stan Grof
tradition. It's the systematic,

18
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,320
the systematic use of these very
hyper, intense states of

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,140
awareness. And when you engage
these states, there is cycles of

20
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,220
tremendous purification,
tremendous death and reborn, and

21
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,000
death and reborn. But if you go
through it often enough, deeply

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,300
enough, there is a progressive
initiation into deeper and

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:03,120
deeper levels of reality, and
eventually you come out with a

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,140
certain understanding, at least,
of the large structure, the

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:14,820
nature of reality. And it's not
easy to summarize, but I mean,

26
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,460
I've tried to do it in this
book. I'm just finishing

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,000
diamonds from heaven to describe
the progression one of the

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,640
qualities of that come out of
this vision of cosmology is that

29
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,260
there are many, many levels to
the cosmos. The physical world

30
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,260
is simply kind of like a dense
level. Of course, there are

31
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,660
layers and layers and layers
within the physical world, as we

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,520
get into the quantum level, but
as you build out into non

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,880
physical or extra physical
dimensions, there are levels,

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,640
layers and layers, and it's a
repeated experience that the

35
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,240
lower levels are sourced in the
higher levels, the higher

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,300
levels, or The deeper levels,
are more intelligent, more

37
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,340
intense, energetically, and they
are more conscious. So the

38
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,480
experience going out into them
is you're going into a more

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,280
conscious, more powerful, more
source dimension of existence,

40
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,420
until eventually, you know, you
leave behind time space. And

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,920
then there are dimensions which
echo time space, the bar what

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,040
the Tibetans call the Bardo, you
know, the intermediate

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,700
dimensions. And one can go
eventually even beyond all the

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,020
echoes of time and space, and
enter what some of the spiritual

45
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,440
traditions would call extra
samsaric reality, or reality

46
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,060
beyond all the cycles of death
and rebirth, and enter in the

47
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,860
domain of just pure light, just
just pure light. And the quantum

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,400
physicists say everything, all
molecules are ultimately really

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,660
rooted in light. You know,
photons are light. And I find

50
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,060
that's true when in the domain
of consciousness and the

51
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,200
universe that one perceives, is
that ultimately all physical

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,420
reality is sourced in an ocean
of light, an ocean of radiance.

53
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,580
You can't take your ego into
that reality and have an

54
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,660
experience of that reality. You
can only enter those realities

55
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,400
by surrendering what you were in
the lower realities. And it's

56
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,000
not that these lower realities
are inferior or bad or evil, or

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,900
anything like that. It's just
that they are more specific

58
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,580
manifestation of progressively
individualized manifestation of

59
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,320
this larger reality. So that you
reverse the process when you go

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,040
out into that reality, you have
to de couple, let go of, you

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,820
know, a deeper level, so that
you literally become, for hours

62
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,140
at a time, a citizen of that
level of reality. You have to

63
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,060
stop being Chris Bache. You have
to stop being a human being. You

64
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,800
have to stop being a time space
being at all you literally live

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,980
in. Breathe the nature of that
existence. There is a sense

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,460
always of profound homecoming,
of profound return. You know

67
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,240
that we came all existence comes
from this reality. So there's

68
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:25,820
that tremendous sense of of
stillness, calm, reunion, being

69
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:33,020
restored to your primal
wholeness. And one gets a sense

70
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,000
that these levels are constantly
infusing and informing this

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,440
reality. We have a theory of
evolution which our theories of

72
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,760
evolution are partly right and
partly deeply incomplete. We

73
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,880
think it's all happening by
chance, screened by necessity.

74
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,220
You know, it's all but my
experience is it's not being

75
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,080
driven by chance. I mean, chance
has a factor is, but there is a

76
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,620
tremendous intelligence
manifesting itself in the self

77
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,960
emergent quality of time and
space. So there is a there is an

78
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,760
intelligence manifesting. It's
not a god outside manipulating,

79
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,020
and it's not even like creative
design, kind of manipulating,

80
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,160
but it's a self arising
intelligence, a self emerging

81
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,180
intelligence that's manifesting
ever more complex forms of life,

82
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,300
and it's evolving and it's
changing. One of the other

83
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,360
things that comes when you move
into these deep dimensions. You

84
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,740
move beyond linear time as we
conventionally know it, into

85
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,860
deep dimensions of time, and
sometimes even beyond any time,

86
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,880
sense of time whatsoever. But
when you're coming in and out of

87
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,700
these different states, you get
a perspective of that this

88
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,660
reality is changing. We know
this it's changing, but you get

89
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,460
a sense of where it's changing
to what the next phase of human

90
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,000
evolution might be, where we
seem to be going, and we're

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,960
going somewhere, and there is an
intelligence expressing itself

92
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,580
in this process. And so the end
result, there's a sense in which

93
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,420
I trust you just learn to trust
where you are, that there isn't

94
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,020
a wisdom in where you are doing
what you're doing, and somehow

95
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,140
each one of our works contribute
to the larger pattern of the

96
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,500
creative intelligence
manifesting itself inside time

97
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:38,180
and space. I was totally,
completely surprised. I never

98
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,380
expected anything like this to
emerge in the work. I didn't

99
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,280
know that this was even
possible. I had never seen it

100
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,980
addressed in the psychedelic
literature. But when you, when

101
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,580
you pop, the ball, the bubble of
the ego, when when you pop, you

102
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,920
don't simply Drip, drop into
unit of consciousness, or

103
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,780
ONENESS consciousness. But you
open up into different at the

104
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,200
subtle level of consciousness.
You open up to different levels

105
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,800
of collective consciousness. And
so when your individual identity

106
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,120
pops you, I have had the
experience many times of opening

107
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,200
up to my species identity,
opening up to the collective

108
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,700
psyche, to and I found that that
species consciousness is

109
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,500
coherent. Carl Jung was right,
and there is a coherent species

110
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,520
mind. And as the shamanic
traditions that when you touch

111
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,380
the species mind in deep states
of consciousness, it's only

112
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,720
natural, but insights into what
the evolutionary progression of

113
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,260
the growth process of this
species is, and I over many

114
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,440
years, I had repeated
experiences doing taking me

115
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,080
deeper and deeper, and teaching
me there was a consciousness,

116
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,140
teaching me what's what, what's
happening, and showing me that

117
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,500
the visions that came just
report, the visions for whatever

118
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,820
was that humanity was coming
into a time of tremendous

119
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,960
fruition that we had been
developing for hundreds of 1000s

120
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,880
of years, and we were coming to
a pinnacle, a tremendous, great

121
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,940
Awakening, an opening of a new
level of consciousness in

122
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,080
humanity, and that this was a
pivot point. Everything we had

123
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,200
accomplished would kind of
quickly become passe as we

124
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:38,660
pivoted into this new platform
of consciousness. But for there

125
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,060
to be a great awakening, the
birth of a new consciousness.

126
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,540
There must first take place a
great death. As the mystics go

127
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,720
through a dark night of the soul
to awaken into divine

128
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,660
consciousness, humanity was
going to have to go through a

129
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,560
great, dark night of the soul,
of our collective soul, in order

130
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,860
to purge, purge. Change the
karmic residue of all of its

131
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,360
egoic driven competitions,
hostility, violence, the things

132
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,560
we do to each other, the things
we can't take that this world we

133
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,520
live in is a world built by ego.
We are moving into a larger

134
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,640
reality, and we have to, we have
to let go of all those old

135
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,320
restrictive poisons. And I think
we're coming into a time of

136
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,700
great crisis. The visions show
me that we're coming into a dark

137
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,680
night of purification. I don't
know the details of it. I just

138
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,780
have experienced it. I think
it's going to be starting in the

139
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,900
21st Century. I don't know how
long it will last. I don't know

140
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,260
how long we'll go through, but
it's a time of loss of control,

141
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,060
of breaking down, of
destructuring, of life as we

142
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,600
know it.

143
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:02,460
But coming out of it, we're not
simply creating a new society or

144
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,600
a better society, or a new
economy or a new ecology, we are

145
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,020
actually giving birth to a new
form of the human species. We're

146
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,760
we're the fundamental
architecture of the collective

147
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,020
psyche is pivoting, and as it
pivots, we will. We are giving

148
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,540
birth to a new blueprint for
humanity. And the way I've seen

149
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,760
it manifesting is in in the
visions and in my psychedelic

150
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,460
experience and other
experiences, reincarnation is

151
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,540
just accepted, as a matter of
fact. So we die, we going we're

152
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,940
born. We die, we're born. Keeps
going up, keep going on, and

153
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,380
lifetime by lifetime, we rewind.
We're collecting more and more

154
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,520
experiences. And in my sessions,
that reached a point where I was

155
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,060
reintegrating all my former
lives were coming together like

156
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,100
winding kite string around a
spool, and it hit a critical

157
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,340
mass, and it exploded into the
most brilliant, luminous diamond

158
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:13,620
light in my heart. It just
exploded in me. And I think what

159
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,120
I saw in this experience, what I
was being shown, was where

160
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,100
reincarnation is taking us.
We're not just going through

161
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,980
class from the first grade to
the second grade to the third

162
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,600
grade. We're not simply adding
incremental improvements in our

163
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,340
life, but sooner or later, we
come to a fusion point where all

164
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,940
of our souls, all of our lives,
all of our experiences, hit a

165
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,300
critical mass and are fused. And
when that happens, the soul

166
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,040
awakens inside the human body.
When we die, we return to the

167
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,580
soul, the mega consciousness
that holds us all. But this is

168
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,960
an awakening of the soul inside
time and space, and I think

169
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:03,120
that's the future human that
we're birthing. We've been

170
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,780
gestating this consciousness for
hundreds of 1000s of years.

171
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,440
We're giving birth to it now,
but most of the work has been

172
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,160
done. Most of the work has been
done in history, but now it's

173
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,500
time for all of this inner
development to manifest. And I

174
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,300
think when we awaken as souls,
when we when our deep

175
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,260
consciousness awakens, it will
change life on our planet,

176
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,820
because it will make our mind
safe, because our heart will be

177
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,240
open, and we will no longer
represent a danger to each other

178
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,480
and to other species on the
planet, and there'll be a much

179
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,820
easier communion with the deeper
creative consciousness of the

180
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,880
universe, so that a period a
time of tremendous creativity,

181
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:55,900
acceleration of creativity. And
in my very end of this long 20

182
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,260
year journey, the very last
sessions, I was put through a

183
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,160
tremendous strip down process
and thrown deep into the future,

184
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,900
I don't know how far, but deep
into the future, and allowed to

185
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,480
experience it felt like I tried.
I was allowed to try on that

186
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,720
form and the most beautiful,
beautiful being, just

187
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,200
extraordinary being. And it's
really important for us to

188
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,680
understand that we are giving
birth to something magnificent,

189
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,460
because if we don't have a
vision of what's happening in

190
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,020
history, we will get swallowed
by the pain of the purification

191
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,120
that's coming. And we must hold
firm. We must stand firm and not

192
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,100
get, not yield to despair. A
mother giving birth is in

193
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,820
terrible pain, but she knows
what she's doing. We are giving

194
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:58,900
birth. We have to understand
what we're doing. I mean, we

195
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,540
have a tendency. In our
theologies and in our stories

196
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,360
that we tell to explain our
existence, to think very

197
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,300
statically of human nature,
because it doesn't seem to be

198
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,380
changing too fast. So we think
of static human nature, static

199
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,240
human nature. But when you when
you expand the horizon, even

200
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,320
intellectually or with
imagination or experientially,

201
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,580
when you expand the time
horizon, at least, what I was

202
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,260
given to experience was that
humanity is built for speed, and

203
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,320
it has to do with each of our
learning cycles, or 100 years,

204
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,620
100 years, 100 years, 100 years.
But the universe does not think

205
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,500
in 100 year increments. The
Universe thinks in billions and

206
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,460
trillions of your increments.
And from that perspective,

207
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,660
humanity, it seems to be
designed for accelerated

208
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,420
evolution. So that, you know, in
the long scale, we're moving

209
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,860
very fast through time, so all
of our history, all of our all

210
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,140
the pains we've done, the
mistakes we've made, the things

211
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,020
we've done, we're carrying them
in our person, but we can shed

212
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,000
them if our concentration, if
our awareness is intensified, as

213
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,400
I think, they will be
intensified in the trials that

214
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,820
are coming. If we pay attention
and do our work well and live

215
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,320
very deeply, we can shed that
past very quickly. And as we

216
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,600
shed that past, we can enact the
soul in history. He had that. He

217
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,400
tells his story in four journeys
of being taken into the not

218
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,060
great distant future. He later
said it was about 1000 years out

219
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,800
where, when he was taken into
that future and looked back that

220
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,180
all of the Bardo was empty, all
of the all the souls in the

221
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,020
Bardo were emptied. And there
was a much cleaner and clearer

222
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,460
communion between physical
beings and consciousness,

223
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,540
spiritual consciousness. And
there was a it was easier to

224
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,160
kind of do a temporary visit, to
kind of come into share a

225
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,760
physical life form, leave it
alone, come back into spiritual

226
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,880
reality. And I think that's kind
of simple. That's another way of

227
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,420
describing what we're going to
because the Bardo is this

228
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,040
layered reality surrounding time
and space, where it's filled

229
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,560
with soul fragments,
unintegrated pieces of

230
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,760
experiences at different levels.
And as we become more

231
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,000
integrated, as we become more
coherent, we're emptying the

232
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,080
Bardo. And as we empty the
Bardo, the communion between

233
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,920
deep spiritual reality and
physical reality becomes easier,

234
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,520
becomes clearer. We've seen it
happen for individuals. There

235
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,280
are great saints who are
translucent to this reality, but

236
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,340
I think they are foreshadowing
what's happening for the whole

237
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,700
species, and we're going into
that direction as an entire

238
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:57,280
species. I think we have an
extraordinary future ahead. We

239
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,140
have to, we have to some hard
work. But underneath, yeah, and,

240
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,920
you know, the thing that has
come through my sessions is that

241
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,120
the Divine is very happy with us
and everything that everything

242
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,180
is right on time. I mean, we
have we make so many mistakes,

243
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,660
we do so many things badly. But
in the long view, the sense I

244
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:26,000
get is that we're working hard
and we're doing a pretty good

245
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,920
job, and it's going to be more
hard work, but overall, the

246
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,100
Divine is very pleased. And
again, I hate to use the word

247
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,020
the divine, but the creative
consciousness of the universe is

248
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,500
very happy with what's
happening.

249
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:12,900
Unknown: Space, oh,

250
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,420
Sarah clay,

251
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,240
you.

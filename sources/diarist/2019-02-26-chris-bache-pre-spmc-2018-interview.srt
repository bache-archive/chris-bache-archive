1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Marc Caron: Welcome the spirit
plant medicine community here in

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,160
Vancouver and around the world,
and to the Facebook live

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,620
audience who may be watching and

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,340
watching. Today, we have a very
special guest, Mr. Chris Bache

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,760
is joining us. Bache, sorry,
with Mr. Steven gray. Chris is

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,540
going to be one of our great
presenters at the spirit plant

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,300
medicine conference coming up
here in just about a month and a

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,920
half. And my name is Mark Carl.
Really happy to have Chris with

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,520
us. And of course, my co
producer and organizer, Steven

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,280
gray with the conference, I'm
going to pass it to Steven to

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,460
introduce Chris and his work and
what we'll be talking about.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,360
Stephen Gray: Sure, thank you.
Mark. This is going to be a very

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,780
brief introduction. There's bio
on the conference website,

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,320
spirit, plant medicine, calm. If
anyone wants to read more, I

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,480
will just say that Chris is a
retired University professor at

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,840
Youngstown, Ohio who was
teaching in religious

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,140
philosophy, I believe Chris
Philosophy and Religious Studies

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,320
Department, yeah, Philosophy and
Religious Studies Department,

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,580
more relevant to what we're
doing today, or more

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,720
specifically relevant anyway, is
that he became interested in the

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,440
work of Stanislav Grof, who did
a lot of remarkable pioneering

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,160
work in LSD therapy, and over a
period of 20 years, from 1979 to

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,540
1999 undertook a remarkable,
what Joseph Campbell would

24
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:36,140
probably truly call a hero's
journey of 20 years of 73 high

25
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:42,640
dose LSD sessions, privately
with a sitter with eye coverings

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,980
and headphones on, with a
carefully create a curated

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,920
playlist. And the results of
that are truly stunning. He

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,020
wrote about about it in a lot
about it in his 2000 book, Dark,

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,600
night, early dawn, and has a
forthcoming book called diamonds

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
from heaven, in which he
actually takes the reader

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,580
through a sequential journey
through those 73 sessions, if

32
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm correct. Chris, yeah, so
perhaps a good way to start, as

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,380
I've mentioned to you in some of
our email exchanges, I've got

34
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,960
about 1,000,005 questions,
because I delved back into your

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,900
work again. Watch the
Transpersonal conference

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,140
interview or presentation, an
interview with some guy named

37
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,980
Ian Campbell or something like
that as well. And been reading a

38
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,340
bunch of dark night, early dawn,
which actually has transcripts

39
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,140
from those journeys in it so but
perhaps for the viewers, maybe

40
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,120
just you could say a little bit
briefly about beyond what I said

41
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,680
about, you know, hearing about
Stan grofs work, what, what led

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,560
you into doing this? You know,
why you, why you?

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,560
Chris Bache: Well, let me just
frame this first date wise, and

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,620
that's maybe the most important
thing to start with. I came out

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,720
of graduate school in 78 and I
started this 20 year journey in

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,260
1979 and finished it 99 so you
have to take your mind back to

47
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,120
what was happening in 1978 Stan
Grof had just published his

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,180
first book, realms of the human
unconscious. I had come out of

49
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,600
graduate school in philosophy
religion. I was an agnostically

50
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,780
an atheistically inclined
agnostic. I read Stan's book,

51
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,360
and it just clicked something
deep inside me knew that I had

52
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,780
found my life's work, I was
convinced that the people

53
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,540
working in my field, which was
philosophy of religion, who

54
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,720
would be making the most
important contributions would be

55
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,260
people writing out of an
experiential basis, not simply

56
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,560
an intellectual basis. So I
began this process of

57
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,340
systematically undertaking the
inner journey to push the limits

58
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,940
of consciousness as far as I
could and to see what I could

59
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,960
use learn using this methodology
that Stan had pioneered. I

60
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,720
didn't like going outside the
law. I would have much rather

61
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,080
had done this legally, in a
legally sanctioned manner. But

62
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,160
this was after the control
Substances Act was passed in

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,620
1970 the only option I had to do
this work was to go underground,

64
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,100
to do it secretively. So I
learned the method. I studied

65
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,580
all the sources. I devoured
Stan's next book, LSD

66
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,420
psychotherapy always worked with
a sitter. Worked in a very

67
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,700
rigorous manner, and settle down
to the work. I worked for four

68
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,080
years, and then I stopped the
work for six years, and then I

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,700
resumed it for a very intense 10
years. So it was actually 14

70
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,500
years of active sessions,
averaging about five or six

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,920
sessions a year during that
time. Yeah.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,860
Stephen Gray: So you where you
went with this is, you know,

73
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,440
almost impossible to conceive of
for most of us. I kind of

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,920
jokingly said to a couple of
friends that it made Terence

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,460
McKenna's description seem like
a pleasant walk on a Sunday

76
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:26,540
afternoon. God bless Terence.
Minus the aliens, of course, the

77
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,280
self, self replicating
basketball aliens, yeah. But to

78
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,720
be more serious about it, maybe
the simplest way to get it going

79
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,780
further at this point is to just
ask you to say a little bit

80
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,180
about, I mean, I'm familiar more
or less with that, you know the

81
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,300
sort of sequence of that
journey, but essentially, you

82
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,900
just kept going deeper. You use
the word, by the way, universe,

83
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,040
which seems to be a kind of a
synonym for what other people

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,640
might call, you know, the
creator, or the creators, or the

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,120
Holy Spirit, or whatever. But in
any case, this, whatever that is

86
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,040
the universe which was
communicating to you, and take

87
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,920
taking you very aware of you,
doing this as an individual, and

88
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,740
meeting you in the same place
you left off the previous time,

89
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,920
and taking you farther each
time. Maybe you could talk a

90
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,760
little bit about how that went,
you know, yeah.

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Chris Bache: Well, first of all,
I worked at very high dose

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,300
levels. I made a conscious
choice after the first three

93
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,720
sessions to work at what I
considered to be the sort of the

94
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,740
maximum intensity, dose level. I
saw myself as simply doing an

95
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,840
extended course of LSD
psychotherapy. I mean, there's

96
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,960
psychedelic therapy, low dose
work, psychedelic therapy, high

97
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,100
dose work. And I saw myself
doing a series of that over

98
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,040
time, I realized that I was
encountering phenomena and

99
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,440
pushing boundaries that were not
showing up in classical LSD

100
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,780
psychotherapy, because that
method was limited to three

101
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,800
sessions maximum. And of course,
I was doing many more than that.

102
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,500
I don't recommend really having
done this work looking back on

103
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,320
it. I wouldn't if I were doing
it again, I would do it

104
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,380
differently. I wouldn't push the
system as hard as I push the

105
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,360
system. There's price to pay
along the way. So I just say

106
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,740
that as a preface, as a caveat,
before we get started where I

107
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,340
went might just be easiest, just
to ping through the chapters

108
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:35,240
where I tell the story in
diamonds from heaven. First two

109
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,940
years, I went through the
perinatal level of

110
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,320
consciousness, going through
reliving birth and going through

111
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,920
many experiences of birth and
death, culminating in the

112
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,620
complete shattering of my ego,
just being turned inside out as

113
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,480
I went into the next stage. Then
I went through two years. Well,

114
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,560
let me back up. Sessions always
divide between a cleansing

115
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,840
portion and a and an ecstatic
portion, a purifying portion,

116
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,760
and then the revelatory portion.
In the cleansing portion of the

117
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,920
next two years, I went into what
an ocean of suffering just vast.

118
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,800
You know, I'm thinking, I'm
jumping into the details too

119
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,160
quickly. Let me back up a little
bit

120
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,640
Stephen Gray: Sure, quick
interruption before you Yeah, do

121
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,420
you mind telling us what dosage
you were actually taking in

122
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,260
micrograms?

123
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,280
Chris Bache: I was working at
500 to 600 micrograms. Okay,

124
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,540
Marc Caron: and so my question
then is for our listeners, what

125
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,460
would be the you know, when
people are doing LSD in a

126
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,080
regular setting, if we can even
call it that, what's an average

127
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,220
dose of the average, you know,
hard to say,

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,720
Chris Bache: maybe 100
micrograms. It's really hard to

129
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,500
say, you know, a micro dot often
is 5075, micrograms of blotter.

130
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,200
It really depends, but it could
be 100 150 something like that.

131
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,600
Basically, low dose goes up to
300 micrograms, usually around

132
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,000
200 micrograms. I think many
people party at at 100

133
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,520
micrograms. I don't know. I
mean, I really don't, I don't

134
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,160
really have contacts in a
parting psychedelic world. It's

135
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,120
just not my world.

136
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,220
Marc Caron: You know, I
understand. I just wanted to

137
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,940
maybe kind of get a context for
what the average person would,

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,220
you know, the way they relate
to, yeah,

139
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,780
Chris Bache: this is an
extremely, very, very intense

140
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,400
regimen. I mean, it's very hard
on the body. It's very

141
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,520
challenging. It really requires
kind of an Explorer's

142
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,920
constitution to weather it well.
But I found that this dialog

143
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,920
opened up between me and the
universe, or me and the creative

144
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,400
intelligence of the universe, or
however you want to language it.

145
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,580
And I think that the. Caliber of
the conversation and the

146
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,300
continuity of conversation that
just went systematically layer

147
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,980
by layer by layer, is not simply
a result of the drug state or

148
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,640
and it's not simply a result of
the consciousness that I was

149
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,600
engaging, but I think it is in
partly a result of the

150
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,480
seriousness and the thoroughness
with which I tried to retain

151
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,440
complete consciousness at all
levels of the conversation, so

152
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,820
that I was methodical in
recording the conversation,

153
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,420
getting it written down within
24 hours after every session,

154
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,680
and I spent a lot of time in
between sessions thinking about

155
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,460
What had happened, trying to
internalize what had happened.

156
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,600
My experience is that the more
seriously and conscientiously we

157
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,260
engage these deeper states of
consciousness, the more

158
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,180
seriously and conscientiously
they engage us. And then this,

159
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,420
this spiral that I went through,
a series of Death-Rebirth

160
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,540
processes over these years,
taking the somewhat

161
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,660
systematically, rather
methodically, systematically

162
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,640
into deeper and deeper levels of
consciousness. As I said, the

163
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,580
first two years were kind of
spent in ego death, or

164
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:20,100
culminating in ego death. Next
two years took me into a realm

165
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,880
that I call the ocean of
suffering. It took me deep into

166
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,760
the collective psyche of our
species. It took me into, well,

167
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,760
what I write about in dark
night, Lord Dawn, is is a depth

168
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,380
of human suffering that I
eventually came to understand,

169
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,400
or came to believe, that what
was happening in these sessions

170
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,740
was not aimed at my personal
healing or transformation, but

171
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,980
it was aimed at the healing of
the collective psyche of

172
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,680
humanity itself, that somehow in
reliving 1000s and 1000s of

173
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,760
years of pain and brutality,
there was a healing taking place

174
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,892
In those sessions, during the
positive side of those sessions,

175
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:07,692
for one year, I went into a
state that I call deep time,

176
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:11,052
where I experienced the entirety
of my life, from start to

177
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:15,852
finish, beginning to end, as a
simultaneous present. And the

178
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:18,912
second year of the ocean of
suffering, which actually six

179
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:22,220
years later, I took my break.
Right then I had one year of the

180
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,700
ocean of suffering beforehand.
One year after, I went into this

181
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:32,660
series of experiences, deep
initiation into various cosmic

182
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,640
processes, initiations into the
universe. I was given teaching

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,680
an initiation systematically
into an understanding of

184
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,580
creation, into the processes of
creation. From there, I, after

185
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,240
that, culminated, and after two
years, I went into what I came

186
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,720
to view as archetypal reality. I
spent about a year and a half

187
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,680
exploring different dimensions
of archetypal reality, being

188
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,820
drawn into vast dimensions of
collective consciousness and

189
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,640
some of the workings of the
collective psyche, I began to

190
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,760
have experiences of
reincarnation, not as an

191
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,300
individual, but as a species,
the entire species,

192
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,600
reincarnation, generation by
generation, and what that was

193
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,560
about, and the intelligence
there. After those I went for

194
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,920
another year or so deep into
what Stan calls causal reality,

195
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,260
non dual consciousness,
Shunyata, emptiness began to

196
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:37,820
enter into the primal void. And
then that took me about 15 years

197
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:43,000
in and I still had five more
years on the journey, and in the

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,100
last five years of the journey,
I went into many levels of

199
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,700
experience, but basically an
encounter with what I call the

200
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,720
diamond Luminosity. My
understanding of this is, this

201
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,740
is what the Buddhists call
Dharmakaya. It is the domain of

202
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,200
light that lies outside Samsara.
It is the crystal and clear

203
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,820
light out of which all physical
existence emerges. And so I was

204
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,760
taken into that reality over 26
sessions, I entered that reality

205
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,160
only four times the years. In
between those four entries,

206
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,560
which came about once a year, I
went through a and this was

207
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,520
always happening, very, very
intense, rigorous purification

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,480
processes, because states of
consciousness, the deeper you

209
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,440
go, the pure the state of
consciousness. To stabilize

210
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,020
consciousness at these higher
levels, you have to purify your

211
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,920
entire physical psychological
system to be able to maintain

212
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,180
coherent consciousness at these
levels, if you just glance into

213
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,780
them, that's one thing. But if
you want to hold awareness for

214
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,040
hours at a time stably in these
states of consciousness, your

215
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,660
system has to be purified in
order to maintain. Incoherent

216
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,620
cognition there. I was

217
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,900
Stephen Gray: just going to ask
you about that. Actually, it's

218
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,060
one of the questions I had
written down for myself.

219
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,080
Actually took a quote out of
Dark Knight that says you have

220
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,140
to train yourself in order to
maintain coherent cognition in

221
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,600
these radical states of
consciousness. And then you also

222
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,360
use the term you have to learn
to learn. Learn how to learn. So

223
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,880
I'm always thinking about, you
know, the people who are

224
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,060
watching this, in case there is
any person brave enough and

225
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,120
perhaps foolhardy enough to and
take undertake a somewhat

226
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,560
similar process. Can, is there
something important you could

227
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,180
say to that person or those
people about, you know, how they

228
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,760
need to learn how to maintain
that coherent cognition and

229
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,000
learn to learn as they would go,
you know, into a continuing or

230
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,280
an ongoing process like this.

231
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,600
Chris Bache: I can and I will.
But first, some preliminaries.

232
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,460
One, okay, never work alone.
Always be working and, you know,

233
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,080
do your homework, do the
reading, read the books,

234
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,280
understand what you're getting
into. Never work alone. Always

235
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,400
have an experienced sitter, not
a guide, necessarily, but a

236
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,780
sitter, preferably one. Well, it
really has to be someone who

237
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,420
knows the ropes, who has entered
these states of consciousness,

238
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,260
because you're going into
territory that is so foreign,

239
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,940
that people who are not familiar
with this territory can get can

240
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,300
easily get frightened and
intimidated by what is coming at

241
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,680
them. You need someone who can
help you stay grounded and help

242
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,300
you find the courage to face
whatever darkness may arise in

243
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,940
those conditions. In terms of
me, once you take care of

244
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,760
safety, once you've curated the
playlist, once you have an

245
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,700
agreed upon arrangement with
your sitter, once you have

246
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,880
created all the conditions of
containment that allow for these

247
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,700
states to be engaged safely,
once you have the rules of

248
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,440
conduct established, so to
speak, then it's a matter of

249
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:08,640
finding within yourself the
trust and the capacity to go

250
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,320
wherever your consciousness or
wherever the session wants you

251
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,680
to go, wherever it wants to take
you and it'll take you into

252
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,600
excruciating pain, and one at
different times, and one of The

253
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,980
things I I learned from Stan
Grof and I he, I absorbed from

254
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,000
his writing, is a trust in the
process, that if you surrender

255
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,720
completely and let the process
take you wherever it wants to

256
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,040
go, it will take you through
potentially excruciating

257
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,200
dynamics, and it may break you,
but in that breaking, in that

258
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,960
surrender and dying process, it
will also heal you, and it will

259
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,780
bring you alive in new ways that
you ways you had not been alive

260
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,360
before. So it's trust, it's
courage, it's seeing things

261
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,080
through all the way down to the
bottom every session. It's

262
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,340
really important that every
session be taken as far as it

263
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,660
can possibly go, so that you
don't leave unfinished business

264
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,340
behind you. Usually, when you
reach a peak and you go through

265
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,780
a Death-Rebirth process, you go
through the remainder of the

266
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,580
session into some positive,
ecstatic state, and then the

267
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,380
system will calm down. The next
session, you'll resume into the

268
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,640
wherever you stop the cleansing,
if you hold it long enough,

269
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,540
eventually this will reach a
peak, and then you'll go through

270
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,960
into the ecstatic state again.
So one

271
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,900
Stephen Gray: of the things you
Oh, sorry, well, one of the

272
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,720
things you've spoken about in
dark night is that, you know, I

273
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,600
think the universal Primal Fear
for human beings is the fear of

274
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,360
what Buddhists would call non
existence of the individual

275
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,080
self, right? So I found it to be
quite instructive in in dark

276
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,360
night that you pointed out that
while whatever that illusory

277
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,400
self is dies, individuality
doesn't. There's a different

278
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,240
kind of individuality somehow
that arises out of that, you

279
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
know, I'm always thinking of
like the people that are

280
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,980
watching this, the kind of
people who will come to the

281
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,840
conference, what they what they
can learn about this, because I

282
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,320
think perhaps some reassurance
about that might be helpful, you

283
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,500
know, especially for medicine
people, right? Yeah,

284
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,800
Chris Bache: well, you know, in
the Vedanta tradition, the

285
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,660
individual is illusion. So the
goal is you destroy the

286
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,280
individual, you destroy ego, you
die, and then you dissolve into

287
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,080
the infinite. And that's not a
while. That's a, you know, a

288
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,240
widespread and deeply held set
of convictions that I don't

289
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,600
share. That conviction, my
experience, is that the. Of our

290
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,260
life can die. Everything that we
know ourselves to be and

291
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,340
everything we've ever known may
die when may completely be

292
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,780
shattered and just completely
die. But in that process, you

293
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,680
then are reborn. You wake up in
a new world and a new context

294
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,020
and as a new being. And if you
go through this process multiple

295
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,360
times, you begin to realize that
the form of your life is

296
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,620
repeatedly dying at deeper and
deeper levels, but the essence

297
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,760
of your life is indestructible.
The ego Chris Bache is

298
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,220
destructible. You know, that's a
temporary form, but the essence

299
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,200
underneath that is
indestructible. And there is as

300
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,400
the superficial layers of our
being perish and fall away.

301
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,920
There is a there is a liberation
and a freeing of a deeper form

302
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,200
of individuality. And I think
this is a developmental process

303
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,440
is taking place in
reincarnation. Just as we die

304
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,460
and then we're reborn. We die,
we're reborn, there is emerging

305
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:19,020
in that process, a a germinal
seed that is individual, but not

306
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,780
isolated, individual, but open
to life on all sides.

307
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Stephen Gray: Maybe I can. It
just begs so many questions,

308
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,900
Chris, maybe I can get about six
questions into one. Somehow, it

309
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,980
all has to do with a central
element of your work. Perhaps

310
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,180
the central element in terms of
other people that you're

311
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,460
speaking to is that on several
levels, there's this individual

312
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,600
ego death and rebirth process.
There's the collective ego death

313
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,820
and rebirth process. And in that
vein, there's you've been shown

314
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,900
by this creative intelligence
the universe, that several

315
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,300
things, one that we're probably,
maybe even certainly, you could

316
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,700
correct me on this approaching
an imminent economic and

317
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,520
environmental collapse and and
secondly, that that actually has

318
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,220
to happen because of the need
for the great death, as you've

319
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,180
called it before, the Great
Awakening. And then the the one

320
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,640
that they want to kind of
squeeze into that question, as

321
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,600
well as given that I don't think
very many people are going to do

322
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,580
the kind of deep, deep, extended
work that you did for this

323
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,420
essential consciousness
revolution to actually manifest,

324
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,920
I'm wondering if there's things
that you could you can think of,

325
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,160
or guidance that You could think
of for people that are

326
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,120
interested in working with
psychedelics, but not at that

327
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,840
level. I mean, you know, ways
that others can approach this?

328
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,200
Yeah,

329
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,300
Chris Bache: I hope not many
people would choose to work in

330
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,780
the way that I did or at the
level that I did, and I wouldn't

331
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,540
do it that way again myself, if
I were doing it from scratch. I

332
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,160
think we are continuously in
dialog with an infinite

333
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,680
intelligence right now, you and
I are existing in our bodies,

334
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,460
but our consciousness is in
intimate rapport with an

335
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:32,900
infinite consciousness. When we
take a psychedelic of any form

336
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,220
and we take a medicine, we hyper
sensitize our system, and a

337
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,160
system begins to go through a
spontaneous purification

338
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,620
process, and we begin to have to
face things that we'd rather not

339
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,440
face. We begin to have to look
at things that often would

340
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,800
rather not look at, and we have
to remember things that many of

341
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,460
us would rather not remember.
This is the universe healing us.

342
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,480
This is how the universe helps
us become whole, helps us heal

343
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,980
the fissures which have gotten
embedded in our particular

344
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,360
system, in that process of
healing the body and healing

345
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,780
consciousness and healing the
soul, healing the former life

346
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,240
trauma that we all carry in that
process, we not only remove

347
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,780
negativity from the system and
heal the system, but we also

348
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,400
open the system to new levels of
intimacy with the universe

349
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,160
itself. So we awaken capacities.
We awaken emotional capacities.

350
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,640
We awaken intellectual and
spiritual capacities within the

351
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:40,780
organism. Everybody has to find
their own modulation of this

352
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,620
dialog, of this stance, whether
or not I think this is happening

353
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,800
continuously, even if you never
take a psychedelic, we're

354
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,220
constantly living we're making
choices. We're living in dialog

355
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,700
with the universe. It's just
it's a process that's moving

356
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,920
very slowly. Reincarnation is a
very finely tuned system.

357
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,540
System, but it moves very
slowly. When we begin a

358
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,020
spiritual practice, whether it's
meditation or yoga or trans

359
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,580
dancing or psychedelics, we
accelerate that process. As we

360
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,760
accelerate the process, it not
only gets deeper, but it gets

361
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,480
larger, so that we enter into
deeper rapport with the

362
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,560
universe, and we also enter into
larger rapport with the

363
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,960
universe. So people often begin
to be touched by our so called

364
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,900
Private work. One of the things
I learned in this process is

365
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,780
there is no such thing as
private spiritual practice.

366
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,880
There is no such thing as
private healing. Whenever we

367
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,500
heal deeply the individual, we
always touch the lives of people

368
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,140
that we karma connect,
karmaically connected to whether

369
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,100
we ever meet them in the
physical body or not. And then

370
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,200
if you, if you have a, I think,
if you have a deep heart, if you

371
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,300
have a deep, felt commitment to
other people and to animals and

372
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,300
just to the planet, when given
the opportunity to do something

373
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,700
constructive on behalf of other
people, I think most people

374
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,240
would say, Yes, I'll help. I'll,
you know, I'll, I'll undertake

375
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,160
that. Show me what I can do.
This is what happened with me in

376
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,140
the ocean of suffering, what
happened in all the work when

377
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,980
your individual consciousness
shatters, you don't

378
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,380
spontaneously pop into oneness.
I mean, some people do and but

379
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:37,160
you pop into a larger field of
consciousness. You move into the

380
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,860
consciousness of your species.
You move into, perhaps the

381
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,920
consciousness of Earth, you move
into the consciousness of other

382
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:51,760
life forms. When I moved into
the consciousness of my species,

383
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,480
I experienced my species as a
living organism, and I

384
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,620
experienced my species on a
developmental trajectory, and I

385
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,660
experienced over and over again
in a way that I was completely

386
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,080
unprepared for. Caught
completely by surprise. I was

387
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,420
not at all really well versed in
the global systems crisis, but

388
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,680
over and over again, I was shown
that humanity is coming into a

389
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:22,700
critical hour in its destiny, a
critical bifurcation point in

390
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,880
its evolutionary process, and
that we were poised on the edge

391
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:34,040
of a profound cycle, spiritual
awakening, just a profound

392
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,000
before and after point in human
history, something that would be

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,880
marked by, well, it would be
used as a marker in history for

394
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,840
the turning point in humanity.
The proportions of this are hard

395
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,300
to estimate, but and so there
was a particular session called

396
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,980
the Great Awakening, which took
me deep into this awakening of

397
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,380
the entire human species. And I
don't know when. I don't know

398
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:08,040
how. You know, it's not like I'm
getting details on those. But

399
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,800
the the certainty of the
conviction that humanity is

400
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,620
moving in this direction, that
we're going there was very, very

401
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,360
strong and for their justice and
mystical traditions, for a

402
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,520
person to achieve spiritual
awakening, oneness with God, or

403
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,240
there must first take place, the
dark night of the soul, the

404
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,780
tremendous purification, the
emptying of all the old habits,

405
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,500
the emptying of everything that
keeps us small in order to allow

406
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,180
us to open into that which is
large. Likewise for humanity, if

407
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,800
humanity is going to go through
a profound spiritual awakening.

408
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,020
There must take place a a dark
night of the soul for the entire

409
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,040
species, what I call the Great
death. There must be a cleansing

410
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,360
of all of the choices that
humanity has made, which have

411
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,600
kept it fragmented, which have
kept it small. You know, the

412
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,420
choices against race, the
choices against religion, the

413
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,620
choices of class, all the ways
we've divided and carved up the

414
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,800
planet. What?

415
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,980
Stephen Gray: Lots of questions
about that. But here's one of

416
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,800
them. Excuse me, you know this
in terms of this great, great

417
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,580
death and great, you know,
rebirth or reawakening of the

418
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:29,780
species. You know, you know. We
know that as people lose their

419
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,240
ground, of their sort of known
world becomes unstable. And I'm

420
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,300
not talking about the seekers
now. I'm just talking about, you

421
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:44,500
know, the you the regular folk
in a country or whatever. Yes,

422
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,940
there's a crack that could open
up for a potential rebirth. But

423
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,120
it seems to me, also that is a
recipe potentially for a very

424
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,960
dystopian scenario, you know,
with the sort of, you know, I

425
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,460
guess Adolf Hitler. Would be a
classic example where his, you

426
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,400
know, his people got, got
treated like shit. After World

427
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,080
War One, Mark went nuts, there
was all kinds of stability, and

428
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,200
Hitler, you know, as a
psychopath or whatever, a

429
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,940
fascist took advantage of that.
So I'm wondering, like you know,

430
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,600
if we are increasingly, you
know, falling into economic and

431
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,560
environmental collapse, the
instability and fear that that

432
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,680
could generate, could they not
go the opposite way? I mean,

433
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,980
what? What is the universe
telling you about that it

434
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,240
Chris Bache: can go the opposite
way? We are coming entering

435
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,900
frightening times and hard
times. I think the global I

436
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,220
think there's a global systems
crisis that is fermenting, which

437
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,060
is being driven first by
ecological forces and then by a

438
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:58,120
series of historical and
economic forces. I think if what

439
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,200
I'm seeing is correct, we're
entering a time of

440
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,440
deconstruction, a time when the
normal assumptions of life are

441
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,560
going to be stripped from us.
We're going to lose control of

442
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,400
more and more of our lives. And
when that happened, when that

443
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,100
has happened historically, and
when it happens in the lives of

444
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,940
individual, it doesn't always
produce a beautiful being at the

445
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,500
end, it often produces, it
sometimes can produces very ugly

446
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,080
results and very destructive,
regressive us against them. At

447
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,800
this point, I think we're going
to have to choose, as a people,

448
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,600
individually and as a people and
as a species, as we get into

449
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,320
this crisis, we're going to have
to make a choice over and over

450
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,120
again. We're going to have to
make a series of choices. We're

451
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,900
going to have to choose on the
basis of ego, meaning, on the

452
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,340
basis of our individual private
experience, of what serves our

453
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:56,140
individual private good, or what
serves a larger collective good,

454
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,560
what serves the good of the
commons. If we choose inclusive

455
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,060
solutions to the crises that are
coming, then I think we will

456
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:10,620
make an accelerated pivot into
an unbelievable positive future.

457
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,240
If we make regressive, silly
choices, if we choose a narrow

458
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,860
option, if we choose only what's
good for us and our kind and us

459
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,200
in a narrow sense, I think we'll
probably go extinct, because you

460
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,520
basically can't run this planet
on the basis of the ego and have

461
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,200
nuclear weapons and biological
weapons destructive capacity

462
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,480
without there being catastrophic
consequences. I think it's the

463
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,360
pressure of extinction which is
actually an extraordinarily

464
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,860
powerful evolutionary driver,
which is will be pushing us, I

465
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,980
think, to make better choices in
the future than we've made in

466
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,520
the past. I don't think this is
like any a magical process

467
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,280
where, you know, Spirit is going
to take over and the Holy Spirit

468
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,980
is going to occur, and
something's going to happen to

469
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,900
save us from ourselves. It's not
about saving us from ourselves.

470
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,060
It's about growing up. It's
about taking responsibility for

471
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,840
ourselves in history. And one
way of thinking about it is it's

472
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,920
about living from our soul,
because the soul knows that we

473
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,040
are more than this body. The
soul knows that we have web of

474
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,780
relationships. The soul knows
that the Earth that we leave is

475
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,380
the earth we're coming back to.
The soul has a depth and a

476
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,600
perspective. But we, we, we have
built a civilization based

477
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,960
largely upon the ego's
perspective, private self,

478
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,260
private me and mine. We are in
the process of outgrowing that.

479
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:45,760
I think we're in the process of
growing into the experience of

480
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,580
the soul on earth, our soul
consciousness, which most people

481
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,840
only experience when they're in
between lives in the Bardo, is

482
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,980
actually waking up inside
historical existence. But that's

483
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,140
not an easy process. That's a
birth process. But what my

484
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,180
sessions show me, what they tell
me, is that we will make it.

485
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,200
There's no guarantee. You know,
it's an evolutionary process,

486
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,700
and there are no guarantees in
evolution. But where I have

487
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,040
been, what I have seen in my
journeys through deep time is

488
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,540
that we do make it. And what's
emerging on our planet is an

489
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,100
extraordinary being, just the
next generation, or the next

490
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:40,160
form of humanity, what I call
the future human, is just, it's

491
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,960
it's just an extraordinary
being. We are in the process of

492
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,160
birthing this being into
history. It's like as a species,

493
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,940
we are a woman going into labor.
We're beginning to get into the

494
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,000
real thick of it, where things
really begin to fall apart.

495
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,420
Imagine if we didn't know we
were pregnant. Imagine if we

496
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,320
didn't know what we were doing,
if we were. Giving birth. We are

497
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,160
in the process of giving birth.
I don't think we You can't stay

498
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,520
in labor too long. It's
dangerous for the mother and

499
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,760
child. Likewise, the planet is
not going to be able to stay in

500
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,560
labor too long. It's going to
drive us to to precipitous and

501
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,640
rapid choices, critical choices,
if we make those choices, well,

502
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:28,700
if we do a good job with this
process, I think it will usher a

503
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,120
completely different era in
human history

504
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,480
Stephen Gray: that's beautifully
said and and in spite of the

505
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,440
terrifying possibilities,
incredibly positive, because it

506
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,360
shows us that there is, you
know, something you know, that's

507
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,260
available to the species and to
all human beings. So from there,

508
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,380
that almost seems like hard to
come back to, you know, somewhat

509
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,860
more prosaic or specifics.
However, you've made reference

510
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:58,420
to reincarnation and versions.
There of a little in this, in

511
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,380
this conversation, and I know
you made a study of it, you

512
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,160
wrote a book about it, and
you've had some very interesting

513
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,360
thoughts about it. I'm curious.
I'm curious about a couple

514
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,400
things here. One of them kind of
hits a little trigger point in

515
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,200
me and but so sort of, sort of a
two or three part question here.

516
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,400
One is, I, you know, I think it
would be really instructive for

517
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,280
people to hear you talk a little
about your understanding of

518
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,640
incarnation, because you also
talk about beyond incarnation

519
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,480
and stuff, but within that, I
have something kind of specific

520
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,060
that I've sort of wondered
about, and I'm going to read you

521
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:40,360
a quote from your book. Okay, if
our experience in this life is

522
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,140
convoluted and torn by
conflicting forces. It was

523
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,220
transparently obvious. It was,
in other words, it was shown to

524
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,960
you that this is caused by the
carryover of exercises from

525
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,400
other space time, encounters,
dot, dot, dot. What we are is

526
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,440
the result of everything we have
ever thought. So. The thing that

527
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,100
I'm wondering that you could
clarify a little on that one is,

528
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,520
I think a lot of people would
hear that as somehow they're

529
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,320
guilty or at fault or to blame
for everything that they're

530
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,800
experiencing now. And what I
wonder about, I understand the

531
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,480
principle of what you're saying.
But if you're right now living

532
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,320
in, I don't know, say
Bangladesh, and you know,

533
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,840
there's just been another one of
those floods, or something like

534
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,780
that, you're a good hearted
person. You're trying to make a

535
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,980
good life for your family. Do
you have some culpability or

536
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,780
responsibility for being in that
situation in the external as

537
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,320
well.

538
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:53,980
Chris Bache: Yeah, do no, no,
no, okay, yeah, you know, I want

539
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,240
to step back just for a moment.
I feel guilty. You know, we kind

540
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,880
of we're jumping into really,
really heavy topics, or jumping

541
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,080
into, you know, psychedelics and
deep states of consciousness and

542
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,620
the future of humanity, and, you
know, really, and we're about to

543
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:17,520
jump into reincarnation. These
are all very substantive and

544
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,840
deserving issues that need to be
taken time. They need to be

545
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:26,060
unfolded carefully and
gradually. When I when I teach a

546
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,080
taught a course in my university
called Transpersonal studies. I

547
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,460
spent a third of the semester,
five weeks just looking at the

548
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,920
evidence for rebirth. Okay, it
says it takes time to really

549
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,500
unpack all the components and
all the nuances. And I think

550
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,820
likewise for reincarnation to
bring it here. Reincarnation is

551
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,080
one of the oldest philosophies
on the planet, and it has kept

552
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,840
company with many primitive
beliefs, which I don't think are

553
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,940
really deserving. There are
different theories of

554
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,940
reincarnation, different
sophistications around our

555
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:12,600
understanding of reincarnation,
but the key is simply this, we

556
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,840
are a learning system. We learn
by challenging ourselves. We

557
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,520
enter conditions, we make
choices. We inherit the

558
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,540
consequences of those choices.
We internalize those and

559
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,680
eventually we die. And this
learning continues. The soul

560
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,400
gathers its knowledge. The
species gathers its knowledge,

561
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,480
generation by generation, we
plunge back into the process. We

562
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,520
keep this process going. We keep
trying, we keep exploring, we

563
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,720
keep pushing ourselves. And as
we go through this process, we

564
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,440
activate potentials that are
latent within us, classically in

565
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,220
the Hindu system, we activate
the chakras we move through from

566
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,040
the first all the way up to the
seventh chakra of oneness. I.

567
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,520
When we when we incarnate,
classically, our story of

568
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,900
reincarnation has been a story
that's focused on individual

569
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,380
karma, the end of evolution of
the individual. I think we've

570
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,220
overly personalized karma. We've
overly personalized

571
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,660
reincarnation. It's not that
that's not a true story. That is

572
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,920
a true story. The soul is making
choices. The soul is growing.

573
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,280
But there's another dynamic
that's taking place, and that

574
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,820
is, there's a collective dynamic
of reincarnation. There's an

575
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,300
evolutionary dynamic of
reincarnation, and what the

576
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,720
individual can accomplish is
always tempered by or influenced

577
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,620
what the species is able to
accomplish, what is going on in

578
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:50,800
the species. There's one of the
hardest things for all of us in

579
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,580
any philosophical system or any
religious or spiritual system to

580
00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:00,160
address or to understand, is
suffering, just seemingly

581
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,000
gratuitous, painful suffering of
natural causes and diseases and

582
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,680
the things, the terrible things
we do to each other. I don't

583
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,120
think there's a simple formula
for understanding any of these

584
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,880
things. They're they're
different perspectives that give

585
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,260
us different perspectives on how
things on what levels we want to

586
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:35,120
address this question at. I
think we choose generally. The

587
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,720
evidence from a number of
sources suggests that we choose

588
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,540
where we incarnate. We choose
who we incarnate with. We choose

589
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,140
incarnating in conditions that
can be debilitatingly painful.

590
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,480
And if there is an intelligence
to the system, if there is a

591
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,560
fundamental intelligence to the
reincarnational process, there

592
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,540
is an intelligence expressing
itself even circumstances of

593
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,800
such such profound suffering
that we can't make sense of it.

594
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,980
We can't understand why anyone
would choose to submit

595
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:14,640
themselves to that kind of
ordeal. And yet, if we can find

596
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,600
meaning in certain context, if
we can take people into deep

597
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,080
states of consciousness and
uncover their individual history

598
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,280
and find meaningful connection
between their former lives, then

599
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,220
I think we have grounds for
thinking that there is meaning

600
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,400
taking place even in those
circumstances where we can't

601
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,960
necessarily understand it. When
we're trying to understand

602
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,300
individual suffering, there's a
set of issues and dynamics that

603
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,260
we look at. But if we're trying
to understand collective

604
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,140
suffering, we're trying to
understand the suffering that

605
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,680
touches hundreds of 1000s,
millions of people's lives, all

606
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,180
at the same time, generational
suffering, we have to bring in a

607
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,500
different a larger picture, a
larger apparatus.

608
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,360
To me, reincarnation is the
higher octave of evolution. In

609
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,900
evolution, the creative
intelligence of the universe is

610
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,960
folding collective learning
forward through the evolving of

611
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,500
the whole species through
reincarnation, the creative

612
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,620
intelligence of the universe is
folding individual learning

613
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,360
forward, but individual learning
and collective learning are all

614
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,020
intertwined because the
individual is a human being, and

615
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,660
the human being is a species at
a certain stage of its

616
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,340
Evolution. So as the individual
grows, the species is growing.

617
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:56,260
I think our entire species is
going to a point, or this is

618
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,960
what's hard, because it is such
a long discussion. There are so

619
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,400
many stages. I feel really
guilty trying to take the

620
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,660
shortcuts that I'm trying to
get, to extract an answer in a

621
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,400
matter of five minutes. When
it's a really it's it's a long

622
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,180
process.

623
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,360
Stephen Gray: People are going
to have to dive into your work

624
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,720
more. And one of those ways, of
course, is going to come to the

625
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,780
conference and post conference
talk you're going to give called

626
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,020
The Birth of the future human.
So maybe I can throw

627
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,000
Chris Bache: it I'll mention
that's this is going to be the

628
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,860
first time I've given a public
lecture completely dedicated to

629
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,920
that topic, the birth of the
future human. I've written about

630
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,980
it. I wrote about it in dark
night, early dawn. I write about

631
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,300
it in diamonds from heaven. But
I've not really tried to

632
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,740
publicly speak about this a lot,
so that's I'm really working

633
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,480
hard to prepare that
presentation.

634
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,560
Marc Caron: One thing I'd like
to say, Chris is, I think it's

635
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,280
great material, just based on
your experience that a lot of

636
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,920
people haven't experienced, and
the questions really come.

637
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,080
Around. And I really respect,
you know, the you know, what you

638
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,720
want to bring to your answers,
because I understand that

639
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,980
they're not, you know, quick and
something that can just be

640
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:19,080
answered in a sentence or two.
What I do really appreciate is,

641
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,980
you know, the curiosity and the
inspiration and the questions

642
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,860
that even come through my mind
just listening, because I'm in

643
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,440
on what you're talking about.
And as Steven says, a million

644
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,380
questions. So, you know, I've
got a million too, and I'm sure

645
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,700
the same, but it's, you know,
what I love about this

646
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:44,020
conversation is that it gets
people curious to ask more

647
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,920
questions, to look deeper into
their own consciousness, and you

648
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,000
know how they choose to then
expand that as well, because you

649
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,240
know your experience is just one
of many different ways people,

650
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,100
sure, use plant medicines and
different attributes to enhance

651
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,380
and expand their consciousness.
Yeah, and it's obvious that the

652
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,060
work you've done, you certainly
went on a hero's journey, like

653
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,820
73 times. I just admire, I
admire that work, because, like

654
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,540
we said before, we just got on,
you know, very, very brave and

655
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,160
courageous for the work that you
did to find the answers and the

656
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,920
insights that you did. So I
thank you for that, and I also

657
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,060
want to thank you just for
wanting to give the answers to

658
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:34,280
the questions. You know, that
level of intellectual meat

659
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,060
potatoes, I guess, yeah, the
answer, you know,

660
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,740
Stephen Gray: that almost sounds
like an ending. Let's not stop

661
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,100
there.

662
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,380
Unknown: I just wanted to
clarify, because I could see we

663
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,900
could be here for hours, right?
What?

664
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,500
Chris Bache: What I've learned
is in studying all the

665
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,740
literature that I studied in
order to write life cycles, the

666
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,740
book on reincarnation and out of
the session says the

667
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,140
circumstances in which we find
ourselves have significance.

668
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,200
They have meaning. They're not
accidental, they're not random.

669
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,740
They have meaning. Some of that
meaning is individual, some of

670
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:14,040
that meaning is collective. But
how we respond to the

671
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:20,780
circumstances in which we find
ourselves, how we allow it to

672
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:26,000
change us, how we allow us, how
we make ourselves better human

673
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,620
beings in responding to those
circumstances, how we learn

674
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:35,480
that's the vital thing. We may
not understand why things are

675
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,740
the way they are, but as we
respond completely in heart and

676
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:45,640
mind to our circumstances. We
change as we change. We grow.

677
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,380
When we look at our lives
through multiple iterations and

678
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,600
even generations, we're growing
we're changing. The species is

679
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,660
growing and changing. The planet
is growing and changing, and

680
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,100
we're all hard wired into each
other in so

681
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,480
Stephen Gray: amazing, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah. So I got a few more

682
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,660
questions I'd like to fire at
you another some more. These are

683
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,560
like, like, oh god. How do I
get, you know, all my curiosity

684
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,620
into one or two simple kind of
things. And this one has to do

685
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:22,160
with, no, it's impossible. So
this one has more to do with

686
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,620
what you what you might call, or
has been called, you know, non

687
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:31,220
embodied intelligences. You've
talked about the universe in the

688
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,640
general sense. You never, I
don't recall you ever saying

689
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,060
that you'd encountered anything
in particular that presented

690
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,500
itself in some sort of visual
form as an entity or a being or

691
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,960
anything like that. But
certainly, lots of people

692
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,840
working with the medicines these
days talk about that, with

693
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,800
Ayahuasca and so on that. And so
that's part of the question.

694
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,040
What you would say about that?
And another component of that

695
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,660
sort of same area of curiosity
for me is I was involved in the

696
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,740
Native American church Peyote
ceremonies for about a dozen

697
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:08,760
years, those people very
passionately, not only believe

698
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,680
but claim that there's a there's
a power in prayer, in especially

699
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,360
a group, intention all being
focused together. But they claim

700
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,860
that, that you know, when you
put out a prayer that sincere

701
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,460
comes from the heart and perhaps
amplified by a medicine like

702
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:31,580
that, that you are indeed, that
prayer is indeed capable of

703
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,720
change in the material realm. So
I'm wondering, you know, if you

704
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,360
thought much about that, and
then just this general sense of,

705
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,060
you know, how intelligence, you
know, can manifest or present

706
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:47,380
itself, you know, outside of our
human even to the point of like,

707
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,500
is the earth a being? Is the
earth an intelligent being?

708
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,620
Anyway, whatever you can do with
that, yeah, please, please do

709
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,700
Yeah, well,

710
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,580
Chris Bache: I'd say yes and
yes. I mean,

711
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,900
Unknown: okay, thanks. Charles,

712
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,600
those are some easy answers.

713
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,540
Chris Bache: I think intention
is powerful. A collective.

714
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,040
Intention is powerful, focused.
Intention amplified. Intention

715
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:18,000
is powerful. It influences our
body. It influences

716
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,440
circumstances around us. It
influences other people. So I'm

717
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:27,020
really comfortable with that. I
think David Nichols had written

718
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,260
a book called subtle activism,
where he's talking about these

719
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,000
you know, he's one of people who
organizes global meditations

720
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,800
focused. So we're gathering
hundreds of 1000s of people in

721
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,480
meditational exercises,
basically integrating their

722
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,220
consciousness into prayerful
exercise. Guru Yoga in the

723
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:51,820
Buddhist and other traditions,
where they are focusing all the

724
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,520
disciples from all over the
world, all the students of a

725
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,160
particular teacher doing a
particular practice on a

726
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,740
particular day at a particular
time. I think these have, these

727
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:06,900
are very, very powerful and
focused exercises. My sense is

728
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,880
that the spiritual universe is a
highly populated world. I mean,

729
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,200
it's just we tend to like to
see. I mean, imagine if for

730
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,860
every physical life form, there
were spiritual life forms. For

731
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,860
every level of physical life
form, there were levels of

732
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,880
spiritual life forms. Certainly
the sacred medicine tradition is

733
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,800
when we take these various herbs
and substances and Peyote and

734
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,460
mushrooms that we encounter
these living life forms at

735
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,360
different levels, we encounter
them and we find, much to our

736
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,420
surprise, they're interested in
us, and they're willing to help

737
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:48,160
us, and they're willing to work
with us. I'm really comfortable

738
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,040
with that. I mean, I've
experienced enough Ayahuasca and

739
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,700
enough Psilocybin mushroom
sessions that have encountered,

740
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,600
you know, the living some of the
living entities of the universe

741
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,120
in my LSD work. This is a
particular medicine that has

742
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,920
particular characteristics, so I
want to be careful that that's

743
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,140
my primary medicine work. I've
done other work, but my primary

744
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,560
philosophical work has been the
LSD work. And LSD tends to be,

745
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,660
first of all, it doesn't have
many historical fields

746
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,140
associated with it. You know,
Peyote has been being used for

747
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:28,100
1000s of years. Ayahuasca has
been used for 1000s of years. So

748
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,360
there are fields associated with
these medicines. LSD is a new

749
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,420
medicine. Doesn't have a lot of
fields associated with it. It

750
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,900
also tends to be a high altitude
medicine, so it tends to blow

751
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,180
into the cosmic, logical
ceiling. It's not a it's not

752
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,440
like my mushrooms or Ayahuasca,
which tends to work at a certain

753
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,780
level of spiritual reality. It
tends to push into kind of the

754
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:58,900
cosmic, logical level. So it
also tends to just grind the ego

755
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:07,260
up fine as dust. And my sense is
that it's kind of like you have

756
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,520
to be a being to encounter
beings, and if you're not a

757
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,960
being, you don't tend to
encounter as many beings. It's

758
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,120
not that those beings aren't
there, but you kind of our

759
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:25,160
presence evokes the conversation
or evokes the experiences that

760
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:31,040
we have from the infinite
potential of consciousness. In

761
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,380
my experience, in working with
LSD, when I die at lower levels,

762
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,140
I don't simply become a
conscious Chris Bache, having

763
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,640
interesting Transpersonal
experiences, I cease to be Chris

764
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,000
Bache, except with continuity of
memory. I have continuity of

765
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,040
memory with Chris, but I become
different kinds of being. And in

766
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,260
my case, I enter different
strata of consciousness. So it's

767
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,400
kind of like if you were looking
at atmosphere. You enter

768
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,480
different layers of the
atmosphere of a planet, I just

769
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,920
dissolve into patterns of
consciousness which are not

770
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,800
individual, but they tend to be
very large and very wide, not

771
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,800
all different medicines tune us
to the infinite potential of

772
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,700
consciousness in different ways.
Peyote tunes us in a certain

773
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,020
way. Mushrooms tune us in a
certain way. We have it's not

774
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,680
like it's all covering the same
highway. We have different roads

775
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,380
into the landscape and different
experiences. But my I'm

776
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,780
convinced that the entire
spiritual landscape is hyper

777
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:48,700
consciousness, hyper aware, and
is populated with beings.

778
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,180
Stephen Gray: You know that what
you were talking about with, you

779
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,240
know, LSD having its particular
characteristic of kind of

780
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,840
blasting you out into the Cosmo,
so to speak, high altitude and

781
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,160
all that. It. Your talk at that
Transpersonal conference. This

782
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,440
is something that I've been
quite curious about, and I'll

783
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:10,020
try to explain and turn it into
a question. Is that you said

784
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,560
that it was at some point became
very difficult to come back

785
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,280
after the end of this 20 year
journey, that you really missed

786
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,840
that, and that a certain point
you were quite confessional

787
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,360
about it. Said you actually felt
like you were waiting to die,

788
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,080
that, you know, the kind of a, I
don't know, maybe a flatness or

789
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,680
something about existence here.
So, so the where I'm going with

790
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,360
this as a question is, you know,
I guess I'd have to confess at a

791
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,440
much more kindergarten level of
experience in these realms, my

792
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,560
assumption, or, you know, I
guess predilection is been quite

793
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,680
influenced by a Buddhist teacher
that I worked with for quite a

794
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,060
long time. You might have heard
of chugyam, Trungpa, yeah. Well,

795
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:59,020
a lot of Trungpa Rinpoche
teachings were focused on, you

796
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,400
know, this precious human birth
and how we, in a sense, revel in

797
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,000
it. You know that, you know, he
would use things like learning

798
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,980
how to appreciate the redness of
red and the blueness of blue,

799
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,100
you know. And he said that
enlightenment, or, I don't know,

800
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,760
I'm not quoting him word by word
here, but something effective,

801
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,680
you know, wisdom or
enlightenment is as much about

802
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,160
learning how to make a proper
cup of tea as anything else you

803
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,440
know that, that you know we're
given this an amazing gift of

804
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,200
this particular you know,
constellation of, you know,

805
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,820
energies or whatever densities
and all that, with this amazing

806
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,500
ability to appreciate this, you
know, through our senses and our

807
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,820
you know, our music and you know
our everything, right? So I'm

808
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:51,100
wondering, you know why that
seems so flat to you when you

809
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,900
came back from this process?

810
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:57,160
Chris Bache: Yeah, good
question. Well formulated. You

811
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,840
know, I got into this work for a
number of reasons, but

812
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,480
certainly, you know, I was
interested in enlightenment.

813
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,180
I've been meditating for a
number of years. I'd encountered

814
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,060
the kind of blocks that usually
show up in the first years of

815
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:13,140
practice, and I thought that if
I did some LSD sessions, I could

816
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:17,220
break through these blocks and
expose my own foibles and and I

817
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,840
would wake up sooner. I would
kind of accelerate my own

818
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:26,660
enlightenment. What I found was
that working in the particular

819
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:33,440
modality that I did, very high
doses, it took me so far that I

820
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,200
began to realize that a lot of
my experiences that were

821
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:41,140
happening, first of all, were
not concerning me personally,

822
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:44,320
but they were larger than me.
And they were there was

823
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,860
something deeper going on than
enlightenment. Enlightenment is

824
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:53,020
a perfectly acceptable and
wonderful focus for one's life,

825
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,540
but what was happening in my
sessions was something

826
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,720
different. At the end, it curved
back around toward the

827
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,800
Enlightenment tradition. But it
was something different. It was

828
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,520
it was a process of exploring
the cosmos. So there's the

829
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,880
Enlightenment project, or
spiritual development, and then

830
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,840
simply exploring the calm the
cosmos, going deeper and deeper

831
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:18,240
into the cosmos itself. What
happened for me is that in the

832
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,320
last five years of this work,
when I went into the diamond

833
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:26,000
Luminosity work, when I went I
dissolved so deeply into that

834
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,620
light, into that into the body
of God, you might say, into the

835
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:38,780
in the Dharmakaya. After doing
that, that particular phase of

836
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,280
the work for five years, I came
to a point where I knew I had to

837
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:48,880
stop. And I had to stop for a
couple of reasons. One is

838
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,240
because my system was running so
hot. It was just running so hot.

839
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,300
It was always uncomfortable. I
was having some subtle energy

840
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:00,360
issues. I was overheating my
system, essentially. But the

841
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:05,040
main reason I stopped was that I
could not bear the heartache of

842
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:12,180
coming back. So I had dissolved
so intimately into the divine

843
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:17,100
that when I came back there was
such a sense of withdrawal and

844
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:23,480
such a sense of loss that I just
couldn't keep going out into it

845
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:29,660
and coming back. Now, ideally,
of course, one wants to open up

846
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,960
to that kind of intimacy in a
way that you don't have to come

847
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,920
back from. You want to open up
into oneness with the Divine, or

848
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,660
experiencing the divine
Luminosity in a way that you can

849
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,700
sustain in your physical
consciousness. That is the

850
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:50,020
spiritual ideal, in a way,
working with psychedelic

851
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,960
particularly the way that I work
with them, this is a path of

852
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,020
temporary immersion. It
temporarily opens you to the

853
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,740
universe, and then you come
back, and temporarily opens you

854
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:04,740
come. Back, and I drove myself
so deep into the universe that

855
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:11,460
eventually, when I stopped my
work, when I stopped my work, I

856
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,420
thought I was just going to be
able to stop and process and

857
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:19,440
enjoy the many gifts that I had
been given. But after I stopped,

858
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,940
I found myself entering a deep
and profound sadness, and that's

859
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:27,140
why it's not just a hero's
journey. It is I understand

860
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:31,340
that, but it's also the story of
the Wounded Hero. It's someone

861
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:36,380
who was wounded deeply by the
sheer beauty of what he she

862
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:42,760
discovered. So I found it when I
did come back, when I began to

863
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:48,640
stop my sessions, when I did
stop my sessions, I found that I

864
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,480
was so I was missing the
communion with the divine so

865
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,900
deeply that I really was just
waiting to die. I was waiting to

866
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,800
wrap up my life. I was taking
care of my children, my family,

867
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,900
and I was teaching and doing
things, but this life had become

868
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:08,640
flat, and it's I knew that the
physical world was the body of

869
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,140
the Divine. I knew that the that
that it was the manifestation of

870
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,140
the creative intelligence of the
universe. It was the divine and

871
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:22,220
manifest form. I knew that the
limitations were all mine, what

872
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:26,720
I had done in all this, the way
I did the work, I lost the

873
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,500
balance. There's a balance
between Transcendence and

874
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,740
eminence. There's the
transcendent divine and the

875
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:39,140
imminent divine. I had pushed
myself so deeply in the path of

876
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:44,380
Transcendence that I had lost my
foothold in the imminent divine

877
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,500
so it was. It's a balancing act
between opening up to the

878
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,700
totality of all that is in all
of its dimensions and all of its

879
01:01:54,700 --> 01:02:00,900
levels, and then grounding in
the present body, in the present

880
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:05,520
day, in the present life, in
your present form. I got those

881
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,300
out of balance, and it took
years of work to sort of commit

882
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:16,620
myself, to regrounding myself in
the here and now as I was, as I

883
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:23,000
am for the remainder of my life.
That's why, for among other

884
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,100
reasons, that's one of the
reasons I wouldn't encourage

885
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,640
people to do what I did. It's
funny. It's a tricky thing. A

886
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,240
little bit of Transcendence is a
very good thing. It can heal us.

887
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,420
It can show us who we are. It
can help us understand what's

888
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:40,280
going on in life. It can
activate very positive

889
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:46,540
dimensions of our being. But if
you plunge yourself too deeply

890
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:50,500
into Transcendence, you can lose
your footing in the here and now

891
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,540
and the the blessings of the
here and now are equally

892
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:59,260
important blessings to the
blessings of Transcendence this

893
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:05,280
physical world is a sacred
special place. And I think

894
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:12,420
enlightenment is an attempt to
awaken into to become

895
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:15,840
transparent to the totality, but
in a way that keeps your feet

896
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,700
solidly planted on the earth.

897
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,500
Stephen Gray: Do you think you
would have been able to come

898
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:26,540
back with the same kind of
incontrovertible understandings

899
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:30,260
and insights. Had you not, you
know, done it that intensively?

900
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,960
You know, the

901
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,740
Chris Bache: path not taken?
Yeah.

902
01:03:37,339 --> 01:03:41,379
Marc Caron: So my question then
is, you know, one thing we see a

903
01:03:41,379 --> 01:03:44,259
real need for within our
community is the need for the

904
01:03:44,259 --> 01:03:48,159
integration after doing this
kind of work. Yeah, and then,

905
01:03:48,459 --> 01:03:54,459
which leads me to the question
is, how did you then adjust to

906
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:57,519
transform yourself so that you
weren't just kind of waiting to

907
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:00,359
die? How did you get that joy
for this life

908
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,620
Chris Bache: back. I think
integration is the emerging, one

909
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,320
of the very powerful emerging
themes in the psychedelic

910
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,440
community, and it's really,
really important. It's been

911
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:16,020
under, undervalued and
understated. I mean, as long as

912
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:20,420
we're staying close to
conventional reality and we're

913
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,380
healing the personal psyche, I
think we we have medical models

914
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:27,740
for what integration, healthy
integration, looks like, and if

915
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:31,220
we go deeper to experience the
intelligence that runs through

916
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,880
all things and the continuity of
life after death, we still have

917
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,080
spiritual models that help us
Understand and integrate those

918
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:47,380
experiences into a into a well
lived life. But when you go

919
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,100
farther than that, when you go
deeper than that, when you go

920
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,060
beyond physical space, time,
reality, when you plunge deep

921
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,480
into the universe, then I think
integration becomes a more

922
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,800
fundamental question. And.
Frankly, I've spent a year

923
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,420
writing just the last chapter of
diamonds from heaven, which is

924
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:09,900
the chapter of coming off the
mountain. Is the chapter on

925
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,620
integration.

926
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:21,800
In order to kind of regroup
myself, I grabbed my my life,

927
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:27,320
and I recommitted myself to
being on this earth. I renewed

928
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:31,040
my contemplative practice. I
deepened my contemplative

929
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,520
practice. I renewed my
commitment to the body. I

930
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,080
renewed my commitment to
relationships. But the other

931
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:44,980
thing I found was the sad
sadness of leaving the communion

932
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:50,860
with the divine was exacerbated
by the silence that my society

933
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:54,280
forced upon me because of its
prohibitions around

934
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,480
psychedelics. I wasn't allowed
to talk about my experiences.

935
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,220
I'm a teacher. I want to
discover and I want to share. I

936
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,800
wasn't allowed to share my
experiences. I had to keep

937
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,860
quiet. I wasn't allowed to talk
to my students. I wasn't allowed

938
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:11,760
to talk to my colleagues about
this work. I wasn't I did this

939
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,000
work as a philosopher, but I was
not being allowed to function as

940
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,500
a philosopher, and what I found
was this section in the chapter

941
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:24,620
I call the sickness of silence.
Integration is not simply a

942
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:28,760
psychological process. It's a
social process, and socially, I

943
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,840
was not allowed to integrate my
experiences into my life. I had

944
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:37,460
split myself in half, and it was
really writing diamonds from

945
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,800
heaven, first writing dark
night, early dawn, and then

946
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,700
writing diamonds from heaven,
where I began to put together

947
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:45,280
the two halves of my life. I
began to put together my

948
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,900
psychedelic half and my
professorial, you know, physical

949
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:55,360
half. And it really begin to
speaking clearly and powerfully

950
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:59,860
about my experiences and writing
about them that I've begun to

951
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:06,120
feel myself more grounded on the
earth in a way that I have not

952
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:11,880
felt in years prior. So part of
it is integration, means

953
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,640
bringing the experiences back
and being willing to share them

954
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,940
and talk about them and engage
people around them. Excellent.

955
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:25,700
Marc Caron: Yeah, ourselves. And
one other question was then, oh,

956
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,400
slip my mind, Steven. Go ahead.
That's great.

957
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,760
Stephen Gray: Well, I think, you
know, people have taken in so

958
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,680
much if they're watching this,
that at this point they're

959
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,140
probably going to go have to
pour themselves a whiskey

960
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:41,980
anyway, just to calm down a
little, you know, you know

961
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:46,420
they're not in Kansas anymore
now. So perhaps, just to kind of

962
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:50,380
end on a, you know, an uplifting
note, so to speak. You know, you

963
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:54,760
talked about how, you know, we
can do it. We will do it in a

964
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,060
sense, and you know that we have
choices. But, you know, let's

965
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:01,560
assume that that the process
works out in the best way that

966
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,800
can the journey for the species
over the next, whatever it is,

967
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,580
several decades or so, and we
are able to, you know, go

968
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:13,920
through that consciousness
revolution and so on. Maybe just

969
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,160
you could sum up with a little
bit what does the future human

970
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:17,940
look like?

971
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:36,860
Unknown: I first

972
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:39,619
Chris Bache: we've been building
the future human for 10s of

973
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:42,279
1000s of years. We've been
building it with every

974
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:45,519
incarnation, every repetitive
cycle. We've been building it.

975
01:08:45,519 --> 01:08:50,619
We've been activating the form
that this human being is. We've

976
01:08:50,619 --> 01:08:53,619
been learning it, stretching it,
teaching it, growing it,

977
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:58,359
lifetime by lifetime, lifetime
by lifetime. I think where we're

978
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:03,359
going, what's going to be
happening is all of our former

979
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,299
lives are coming together as we
become more coherent, as we

980
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:13,199
become more integrated, all of
these lives come together. The

981
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,839
way I experienced it in the
session was I experienced one

982
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,839
session where all my former
lives began to come together,

983
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:23,299
like wrapping string around a
kite spool, and at a certain

984
01:09:23,299 --> 01:09:27,679
point they fuse. There was an
explosion of energy, and they

985
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,459
fused. And when they fused, this
diamond light broke out of my

986
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:34,699
chest and threw me into a
completely different state of

987
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:42,399
consciousness. It was
individual, but it was a form of

988
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:45,579
individual consciousness that
was beyond anything that I had

989
01:09:45,579 --> 01:09:49,659
ever experienced before. And it
wasn't simply the sum of the

990
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:53,739
individual lives that all of
those lives had been actualized

991
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:58,779
in a higher form of evolutionary
expression. I think the future

992
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:04,679
human was. I touched there was
my own personal version of the

993
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:09,899
future human that is evolving.
In evolution, we have to picture

994
01:10:10,799 --> 01:10:16,079
a species where we have healed
all the pains of history, where

995
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:19,319
we've healed all the divisions
against each other and against

996
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:23,599
our own body and against our own
soul, where we have opened our

997
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:30,379
heart to all, not only all human
beings, but all life forms,

998
01:10:30,679 --> 01:10:35,539
where our mind is in conscious
communion, more conscious and

999
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:40,119
open communion with the
intelligence of the universe, as

1000
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:44,559
I in one of the very last
sessions. It was one of the most

1001
01:10:44,559 --> 01:10:47,799
difficult sessions I ever went
through. I went through a huge

1002
01:10:47,799 --> 01:10:51,639
trip down was taken far into the
future, deeper into deep time

1003
01:10:51,639 --> 01:10:56,439
than I'd ever been. And one of
the gems of that session was to

1004
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:01,499
actually experience the
archetypal form of the future,

1005
01:11:01,499 --> 01:11:05,399
human, what we are in the
process of becoming. And truly,

1006
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:12,299
I mean, it's like a you hear it
said, we're becoming a planet of

1007
01:11:12,299 --> 01:11:15,599
Buddhas, a planet of Christ, a
planet of Prophets. We're

1008
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:18,959
becoming the picture, the
highest levels of spiritual

1009
01:11:18,959 --> 01:11:23,299
realization that we have known
in history, individuals have

1010
01:11:23,299 --> 01:11:27,259
accomplished, and picture the
entire species operating at that

1011
01:11:27,259 --> 01:11:31,339
level. What kind of species
would we be when the entire

1012
01:11:31,339 --> 01:11:36,799
species is is enlightened, when
the entire species is uplifted,

1013
01:11:36,799 --> 01:11:39,979
spiritually and emotionally and
psychologically? That's what

1014
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:45,579
we're in the process of becoming
once we have once we have

1015
01:11:45,819 --> 01:11:54,459
activated that deep level of our
own being collectively, then we

1016
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:58,359
can really begin to cook. Then
we can really begin to do

1017
01:11:58,359 --> 01:12:03,359
something exciting on the
planet, off the planet, into the

1018
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:07,379
galaxy. I mean, intelligence
that created this universe

1019
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,639
thinks on a scale that just
still boggles our mind. And I

1020
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:15,359
think our planet is one of many
hot houses where consciousness

1021
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,139
is being incubated. But it's not
going to stay on this planet.

1022
01:12:19,139 --> 01:12:22,039
It's going to migrate. It's
going to move. It's going to go

1023
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:26,539
forward. But in order to make
this jump, we first have to grow

1024
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:31,279
up. We first have to come to
terms with what we are. We have

1025
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:36,019
to stop thinking in terms of
this body, this life, and open

1026
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:39,019
ourselves to the full depth and
splendor of the being that lies

1027
01:12:39,019 --> 01:12:40,479
within and we

1028
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:43,600
Stephen Gray: are full. I think
we are Thank you, beautiful.

1029
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,940
Does that sound like a good
place to end?

1030
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:49,960
Marc Caron: Mark, it could have
been a better segue in this

1031
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,860
whole conversation to you know,
tail off such a deep and

1032
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:58,240
inspiring and thought provoking
conversation, for sure. So I

1033
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,320
thank you very much for that,
Chris. I look forward to meeting

1034
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,960
you in person. I look forward to
hearing your talk at the

1035
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,740
conference,

1036
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,860
Chris Bache: and I'm looking
forward to it very much. I'm

1037
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,200
looking forward to that that
weekend, it's going to

1038
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,080
marvelous. I can't believe the
wonderful people that you've

1039
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,780
gathered for that weekend. It's
just, I'm really looking

1040
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:16,200
forward.

1041
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,140
Marc Caron: It's growing, and
it's just getting more and more

1042
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:22,280
popular every day. We're really
excited to what, what's going to

1043
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,700
transform here for for this
year's conference, and, you

1044
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:29,780
know, it's just exciting to be
part of it, yeah, and, you know,

1045
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,240
Chris, I Oh, love to reach out.
The invitation at some point

1046
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,580
too, is, you know, if you're
interested in doing more of

1047
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:38,480
these kind of conversations, to
share some of your your insights

1048
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,560
with people, you know, I'm sure
Steven and I would be happy to

1049
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,280
facilitate, to do some things of
that nature as well, because I

1050
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,940
sure there's, you know, we
barely even scratch the surface.

1051
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:51,760
There's so much to talk about
here with you that, you know,

1052
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,640
I've got tons of questions
myself, but I'm also kind of

1053
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,700
left here just a little shell
shocked.

1054
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,000
Chris Bache: Well, when we
gather in Vancouver, then maybe

1055
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
we can sit down and have some
conversations about where we

1056
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,680
might take the future
conversation.

1057
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,820
Stephen Gray: Excellent. Do you
have any projected publication

1058
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:15,060
date for diamonds from heaven?
The the forthcoming book, it'll

1059
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:18,900
Chris Bache: be out in the
second half of 2019 that's all

1060
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,160
I've been able to get from the
publisher. So it's in the

1061
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:27,560
process, so hopefully, within a
year from now, it'll be out.

1062
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,380
Stephen Gray: All right, thank
you very much. And no, just, oh

1063
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:37,040
no, just, thank you. It's, you
know, it's amazing, you know,

1064
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,860
I'm really amazed at the work
you've done, and really grateful

1065
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:44,380
actually, you know, I mean, it
was very difficult for you to go

1066
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,560
through that process, as you've
made clear, and you know, you've

1067
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,340
kind of done the work that not a
lot of people are going to do at

1068
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:54,520
that level. So you've brought
back gems to share. And, you

1069
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,980
know, it's, it's wonderful.
Thank

1070
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,920
Chris Bache: you. It's been an
honor. It's a privilege. And.

1071
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,780
I'm really looking forward to
meeting both of you in person,

1072
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:05,760
likewise.

1073
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:10,920
Marc Caron: Okay, well, until,
uh, until we see you in November

1074
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,320
2. Okay, live your life.

1075
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,540
Chris Bache: Awesome. Yep.
Blessings,

1076
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:18,900
Stephen Gray: awesome. Good day.
All right, bye, bye, thanks

1077
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:22,680
again, gentlemen. Until next,
bye, I'm stopping my camera.

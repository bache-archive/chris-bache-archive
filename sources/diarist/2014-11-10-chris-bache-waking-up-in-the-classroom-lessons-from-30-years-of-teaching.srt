1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,600
Unknown: Imminent experiences in
class yet, of when mind and body

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,420
and heart and spirit come
together, and I, on a personal

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,660
level, feel really lucky and
happy that he's with us this

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,260
week. I only know a little bit
about your history of your

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,660
life's work. So I'll just let
you speak. Okay?

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,200
Come on, people, let it

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,940
Chris Bache: rip. Feel how that
changed the energy. Just that

8
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,660
little bit I

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,740
don't have time to fuck around
anymore. We don't have time to

10
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,460
fuck around anymore. There's
just not time. There's just only

11
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,660
time to get down to the serious
stuff. So let's get down to it.

12
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,280
Rick asked me to talk about
teaching, like I've picked up

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,720
some incalculable secret
knowledge from teaching in Ohio

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,140
for 30 years, I don't know, so
I'll just tell you what I got,

15
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,640
and then you can decide whether
it was a good thing. But we're

16
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,760
going to have fun tonight, no
matter what. And you know, I

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,660
don't think you wouldn't mind if
we kind of finished before 10

18
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,020
o'clock would you? It's been a
long day. You people have been

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,580
working hard. And for me, a talk
is simply an excuse to get to

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,880
the discussion, right? Because
that's where the juice is.

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,820
That's really where the where
the good stuff is. So I'm just

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,660
going to kind of lay out some
bullets, throw out some

23
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,100
material, to sort of focus our
discussion, but I'm really

24
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,200
hoping we can move quickly
enough into some discussion, and

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,320
if that goes really well, we'll
still be out of here before 10

26
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,620
o'clock. All right. Yeah, okay.

27
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:26,059
Is Robert here yet? He's coming.
Here he is fly away among his

28
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:32,359
many illustrious publications he
did he one of the ones that you

29
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:37,219
may not come across too often is
his beautiful introduction, his

30
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:41,319
Prolog preface to the living
classroom, which is a great

31
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:47,139
honor. And he, he really made me
look pretty good, very good. It

32
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,639
was just an honor. So this is
kind of PCC certified, you know.

33
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:55,539
And how many people have read
this? Okay, all right, well, I'm

34
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:58,419
going to hit some bullet points
on it, but I'm going to put it

35
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,119
in a larger context. I'm going
to give you some of the back

36
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:03,779
story to it, alright, and I'm
just going to talk a little bit

37
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:08,579
about how I came to write this,
and kind of what happened during

38
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,299
it and what's it about. But this
is like my second Saturn Return

39
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:16,439
book. I mean, I started teaching
in 79 and this was published in

40
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:23,959
2008 that's pretty much exactly
29 years and before I was coming

41
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,599
up on sabbatical, because the
only time I can this is a little

42
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,779
loud, doesn't it sound a little
loud? Maybe, no, okay, all

43
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:35,599
right, the only time I can write
books is when I'm on sabbatical.

44
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:38,299
I can write essays before, but
takes a lot of time to get in

45
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,339
deep so before I came up on my
last sabbatical. There were two

46
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:45,039
books that I was thinking about,
a book on psychedelics and the

47
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:49,179
living classroom. And so I went
into session space, what I

48
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:52,299
usually do when I have an
important question. And after I

49
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,179
was done with the various
things, I said, What should I

50
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,119
write? And it said, definitely
the living classroom. Because by

51
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,759
the time you write the
psychedelic book, you're going

52
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,479
to be so far out in left field
that you know you're going to be

53
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,039
beyond the mainstream pale. And
now where you are the living

54
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,859
classroom, you can do it in a
mainstream fashion. So I said,

55
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:17,819
Okay, and as soon as I said
okay, and soon as I agreed to

56
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,319
that, and kind of made the
mental intention, all sorts of

57
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,019
wonderful things began to
happen. I got some grant money

58
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:27,019
that allowed me to spend more
time writing the book, and just

59
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:31,579
a lot of wonderful things
happened. And the living

60
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:38,059
classroom has been published, or
there have been six excerpts, or

61
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:41,499
excerpts or chapters that have
been published in five different

62
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:45,339
anthologies. It's gotten more
AirPlay than any other single

63
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,399
thing that I've written, and I
think it's because of Robert

64
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,499
McDermott's Preface. I think
it's because consciousness,

65
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:56,079
collective fields of
consciousness, is an idea that's

66
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,739
kind of it's bubbling up. Its
time has come. We're ripe for

67
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:05,999
it. So as the second Saturn
Return, this is a book that the

68
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:11,099
universe wanted to be written,
and it's basically a summation

69
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:14,519
of the most important things I
learned about teaching from my

70
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,619
30 years of teaching at young
sound. Now another little

71
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,659
background, when I had my second
Saturn Return and I came to

72
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:29,419
Youngstown, it broke my heart. I
really didn't want to be here. I

73
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,239
mean, I didn't go to seven years
of graduate school in order to

74
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:36,799
teach at an open enrollment
undergraduate college about

75
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:43,179
12,000 13,000 students in a rust
belt town in Ohio, no graduate

76
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:47,979
students. It wasn't my ideal,
and I tried, like anyone with a

77
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,159
grain of sense, tried
desperately to leave for several

78
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,439
years. Because you know, when
you get out of graduate school

79
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,719
and you come to good graduate
school, you have a few years

80
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,739
when you might jump out into
something. And I tried jumping.

81
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,919
Problem was I had also
encountered Stan's work, and I

82
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,819
started my own psychedelic work
in 79 a year after I started

83
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,319
teaching, my mind got very
quickly radicalized. I mean, one

84
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,679
year I was writing essays on
towards a unified theory of

85
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:20,479
metaphor. Two years later, I'm
writing essays on the emergence

86
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,179
of perinatal symptoms and
Buddhist meditations like, what

87
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:26,059
happened? You know, my
department was wondering what

88
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:30,199
the hell happened to him? They
hired a traditional analytic

89
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,679
philosopher of religion and
linguistic discourse, and

90
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:36,379
suddenly I'm really saying, Hey,
this guy is onto something

91
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:43,239
seriously good. Well, it wasn't
happening. You know, Religious

92
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,999
Studies is a very conservative
discipline, and by the way, did

93
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:49,479
you appreciate our just up for
you. This is just for you. Yeah,

94
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,139
it wasn't happening. And so this
came to a head four years after

95
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,999
I was there four years and there
was a the only job that it had

96
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:06,779
opened in five years, opened
that year, and they decided to

97
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,199
go with the very traditional
philosophical, theological type.

98
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:16,079
And I thought, and you know,
when you teach at a teaching

99
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,899
university where you really in
the classroom a lot, you're

100
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,939
teaching three courses a
quarter, nine courses a year,

101
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:26,359
plus teaching in the summer.
This just pounding, ly difficult

102
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:33,259
teaching. And I just said, Okay,
I give up. This is not what I

103
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:38,719
wanted, but it seems to be what
life wants. So I surrendered,

104
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:42,039
and I said, I'm going to become
the best teacher I can possibly

105
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,279
become. I'm not going to fight
it. I want to work with it.

106
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:50,319
Let's see what happens. Let's
see where it goes. And it went

107
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,979
in some very interesting places.
And the result of what happened,

108
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:57,579
basically, I was able to put
down in this book. And 1/3 of

109
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:01,199
this book is my students, 1/3 of
it, the back third of it, really

110
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,319
it's a second book, are essays
that my students have written

111
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,499
over the years, and just
beautiful, beautiful essays. And

112
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,899
there were hidden reasons I
learned later for why I was in

113
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,719
Youngstown, and I'll get to
those in a bit. And there were

114
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,839
some benefits of being there,
because if you don't have a lot

115
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,119
of graduate students, and you
don't have a lot of

116
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:25,039
responsibility for that level.
You can do a lot of exploration.

117
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,619
You can do a lot of things. So
if I ever wanted to learn

118
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:30,439
something, I just said, I'll
teach a seminar on it. And I was

119
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,899
teaching a lot of courses and
things that lay outside my

120
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,419
discipline. I just kind of
learned. I learned a lot of

121
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,839
things, and as I went through
and I was able to do a lot of

122
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,219
innovation in the in our
curriculum, I taught a lot of

123
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:45,759
what I call Transpersonal
studies. You know, near death

124
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,359
episode research, reincarnation
research, out of body research.

125
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:52,359
I taught Transpersonal
psychology of religion. I taught

126
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:55,899
lots of seminars and Stan grofs
work. So, you know, there's a

127
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,939
certain there were some
benefits, there were some trade

128
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:00,899
offs. And one of the great
benefits was non traditionally

129
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,679
aged students. About 40% of our
students are non traditionally

130
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,499
aged, and that was a nice
compensation for not having

131
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:10,559
graduate students, because they
were, you know, they were much

132
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,339
more seriously engaging in their
studies than the 1819, year old

133
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:20,599
kind of might be. But the other
thing that Youngstown gave me

134
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:24,799
was an opportunity for deep,
spiritual practice. It's

135
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,979
something, you know, there's not
much to do in Ohio. It's kind of

136
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:32,839
boring, you know, it, you know,
watch the corn and watch the

137
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,379
corn, you know. So it's just
kind of a nice, contemplative,

138
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,979
smooth environment if you want
to do deep, serious work. And so

139
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,959
I wanted, I found out I wanted
to do deep, serious work. So I

140
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,339
started my psychedelic work
right when I started my career.

141
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:51,999
And I did four intense years,
and then I stopped for six

142
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:59,919
years, and then I did another in
10 years after that. Now I.

143
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,279
Loved teaching. I've always
loved teaching. I've always

144
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,059
liked to gab, but I'll tell you,
teaching open enrollment

145
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,419
University, it's front line
teaching. I mean, it's the kids

146
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:12,119
who didn't this first time that
anyone in their family has gone

147
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,579
to college, lot of people
pulling them down, telling what

148
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:17,159
do you want to go to college
for? You know, just get a job at

149
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,879
GM Lordstown, make cars. You
know, it's what I you have to do

150
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,939
what I call full contact
teaching. This is take no

151
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:29,119
prisoners. Full Contact
teaching. You have to provide

152
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,939
the motivation. You have to kick
them in the butt. You have to

153
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:39,139
slap them around. It is like
when I come here to teach them,

154
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,639
and you guys are so easy, you're
so motivated you're already, you

155
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,819
know, it's like you want to
learn these things. You're there

156
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:51,999
in Ohio. It's a different game.
And so they make you work for

157
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,999
it, and I work for it. I'm
willing to work for it. And

158
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:57,879
eventually my classroom became,
I began to think of it like a

159
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:03,059
dojo. You know, it's like,
you're on my mat. No one's going

160
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,599
to get hurt, but you're going to
hit the floor a few times, and

161
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:13,439
it's like, I don't have time to
fuck around. Let's get down to

162
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,979
it. So 30% of my students who
sign up the first day, they drop

163
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:20,599
out by the end of the first
week. And I make it real clear,

164
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,839
just to get credits in the
humanities is a perfectly good

165
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,079
reason to be here the first day.
It's not a good reason to be

166
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:30,259
here the second day, because
it's easier place ways to get

167
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,799
the credit. But I also then try
to show them what we can do,

168
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,979
show them a sense of where we
can go if you're willing to

169
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:40,359
work, and I find that they're
willing to work, if you give

170
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:44,319
them a quality product, they're
willing to work with you because

171
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:48,699
they're they really they've been
damaged often in their high

172
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,339
school. They've been hurt.
They've been crimped. They don't

173
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:53,859
have high expectations. They,
you know, they're not at

174
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:56,679
Oberlin, they're not at Yale.
They have kind of low

175
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,859
expectations. If you give them
the promise of something

176
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:03,779
substantive, they'll work their
ass off for you, and they'll

177
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:11,339
open their heart if you allow
them to and go there. But when

178
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,939
you start to psychedelics, and
you make the choice to work with

179
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:17,879
psychedelics, you kind of have
to make some adjustments in your

180
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,539
professional life. I had to
split my life in two. I had a

181
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:26,419
professional life where I did
the things that you had do as a

182
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,059
professor, and you do all the
traditional things. You serve on

183
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,359
the committees, you do this, you
do that, you publish. And then I

184
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:36,919
had my personal life where I was
doing the Grof Ian deep

185
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:41,799
psychotherapeutic work. And you
can't let those two blend in the

186
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,179
classroom. This is not cis All
right, the good people of Ohio

187
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,479
do not like to hear that their
professors are dropping massive

188
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:55,839
quantities of acid. So you keep
those two separate so I didn't

189
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,299
talk about my work in front of
my to my classes. I mean, my own

190
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:03,599
faculty members, it was like 10
years before they really got a

191
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:07,319
an idea of what was going on. I
mean, every when I would do a

192
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,019
session, I was kind of so poor
as a beginning faculty member, I

193
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,599
had to borrow the tape player
from one of my colleagues. He

194
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:15,659
began to get a sense of what was
going on. But you don't talk

195
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,179
about it. You just I didn't talk
about it for years. I it,

196
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:29,419
because these were kept separate
in the physical world, it ended

197
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:32,719
up producing some very
interesting complications or

198
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:36,139
consequences that taught me a
great deal about the nature of

199
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:39,019
consciousness, because, as we're
going to see, consciousness did

200
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:44,079
not split itself, even though I
split my world, the world of

201
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,799
mind is not dividable in that
way. And there were some things

202
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:51,639
that happened that began to make
those things be connected, but

203
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,219
there are also some personal
consequences. I'll come back

204
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:58,479
around later about when you
split yourself like this and you

205
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:02,759
won't you cannot be your whole
and complete self in every

206
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,059
circumstance, and you kind of
know what you're doing going in,

207
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,199
but I didn't really understand
what the some of the long term

208
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:18,239
ramifications of that would be
down the way. So this is what

209
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:25,039
began to happen early in my
teaching, student asked me a

210
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,939
question. You know, after you've
taught a course three or four

211
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:31,639
years, you pretty much have
heard most of the questions that

212
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,999
undergraduates are going to ask.
So soon as they ask a question,

213
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:41,619
your mind starts running with an
answer. This time, I just

214
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:48,339
stopped, and I thought among all
the possible answers that I

215
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,779
could give, which what could I
say that would be most in tune

216
00:14:52,839 --> 00:15:02,579
to this student, and my mind
kind of stopped. I. It, and

217
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,239
suddenly I had an image of a
door in the back of my mind, and

218
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,719
a piece of paper passed through
it, and I read the piece of

219
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:13,499
paper, and it was an idea. It
was an idea, an answer that I'd

220
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:17,399
never given to that particular
question. So I just Okay, let's

221
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,919
try this. I ran with it, and it
had the magic happened. Teaching

222
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,959
happened. The student's eyes lit
up. Other people's eyes lit up.

223
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,759
The energy went up in the room.
Something good happened. So I

224
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,519
thought, okay, and I really
prepare. I mean, I bring it

225
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:38,119
look. I even brought notes to
esslyn. I prepare my classes. I

226
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,759
have a lot of notes. I really
work them through, and I keep on

227
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,879
track with my syllabus. I know
where I'm going to be in the

228
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,439
12th week in a course, you know,
because I otherwise anyway, I

229
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:51,459
really prepare for it, but that
little door in the back of my

230
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:57,699
mind gave me a teaching about
integrating improvisational

231
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,479
intuition with data with my
prepared work. So I began to pay

232
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,359
attention to that door in the
back of my mind and to work with

233
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:10,019
it. And when I did, you know,
something happened in the room

234
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,739
that didn't happen when I just
kind of stayed in my prepared

235
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:22,459
script. And then time passed, I
kept on doing my psychedelic

236
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,639
work. And if you've read, those
of you have read dark net, early

237
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,119
dawn, you kind of know it. You
know, I dropped into some pretty

238
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:33,679
deep stuff pretty quickly. And
really was engaging deep, deep

239
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,980
collective dynamics and entering
hell realms and the ocean of

240
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,840
suffering I'd talk about. So it
was pretty intense. But wherever

241
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,480
I was on Saturday, Monday
morning, I was back in the

242
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,860
classroom, doing my job. It was
really that was a commitment. I

243
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,540
would not let my personal work
get in the way of my

244
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,600
professional work. I had a major
commitment for my students. And

245
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,320
then one day, when it was just
an ordinary day, I'd been doing

246
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,620
my ordinary thing, teaching
intro Eastern intro world,

247
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,580
teaching psychology, religion or
Transpersonal studies. This was

248
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,260
actually an intro Eastern
course. A student came up after

249
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,740
class, after he was sure that
the room was empty and no one

250
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,920
would hear what he had to say.
And he said, It's funny that you

251
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,220
would use that example that you
used in class today, because

252
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,320
that's exactly what happened to
me this week. And he told me a

253
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,360
story, and it was right, it's
like I quoted his life story. So

254
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,620
that's interesting, you know.
Okay, little synchronistic, you

255
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,280
know, but I never thought of
myself as being psychically

256
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,040
sensitive. I always sort of
think of myself as being kind of

257
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,820
brick ish in that way, I'm a
psychic brick. I don't have

258
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,940
those type of things some people
do. Always envy those people who

259
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,180
have like I was 12 years old
when I had my first mystical

260
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,360
experience, I said, Oh, lucky
you, but it's not me. So I kind

261
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,120
of, you know, I was trained to
brush this stuff off. But then a

262
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,660
few weeks later, it happened
again. Somebody came up and

263
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,320
said, you know, that's exactly
what happened to my mother. And

264
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,260
to make a long story short, the
deeper my psychedelic work

265
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,020
progressed, the more frequently
this began to happen. People

266
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,560
were finding pieces of their
personal life showing up in my

267
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,560
lectures, and I wasn't intending
it, and I wasn't conscious of

268
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,880
doing it. I would just be
reaching for an example to

269
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,220
illustrate a point, and
something was connecting me to

270
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,380
them, and I was like reaching
into their life and putting it

271
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,960
forward. Now, if you're in a
room just looking for three

272
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,480
credits or four credits in the
humanities, and you're in the

273
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,940
back of the room with your
baseball cap on backwards, and

274
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,360
you're just kind of passing
time, and all of a sudden the

275
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,220
professor is using your life to
illustrate a point being made.

276
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,060
How could you not take that as a
personal invitation? How could

277
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,580
you not have yourself snapped to
attention? This began to happen,

278
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,300
not a lot, but often enough that
it kind of became a pretty semi

279
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:29,600
regular thing in my classroom.
And then the plot deepened when

280
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,460
I began to go into deeper and
deeper territory, when I got

281
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,840
into the deep ocean of
suffering, Death-Rebirth at the

282
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,920
collective level, where you're
just dealing with massive

283
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,860
currents. It's like you're not
dealing with the near shore

284
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,280
currents. You're dealing with
the big tidal flows in the

285
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,640
collective psyche, and you're
getting into deep, deep

286
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:57,460
collective Death-Rebirth
meltdowns. I found that my

287
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,440
students were being drawn deep.
Deeper and deeper into deep

288
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,300
existential crises in their own
lives. It was like we were all

289
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,720
part of one giant, massive co X
meltdown system. Addictions were

290
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,140
bottoming out bad marriages or
weak marriages were being forced

291
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:25,700
into, you know, grow or die
situations people were having

292
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,580
suddenly unearthing sexual
abuse, and I don't talk about

293
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,640
sexual abuse, but something was
bringing to the surface deep

294
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,920
pains in their life. I so I
can't emphasize enough that this

295
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,780
was not my intention. In fact,
as this thing began to happen, I

296
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,760
began to even try to slow it
down, because it did not feel

297
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,960
like I didn't understand it. So
I couldn't control it. It was

298
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,500
happening. How do you ensure
informed consent in a process

299
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,060
which is so involuntary? I even
put on my syllabus one time. I

300
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,080
even put caution taking this
course may be dangerous to your

301
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,780
psychological equilibrium. The
students thought I was being

302
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,200
cute.

303
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:22,979
Unknown: You.

304
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:30,860
Chris Bache: This thing, I
called it the magic, you know,

305
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,360
the magic happened. I'd come
home and I'd say to my wife, the

306
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,420
magic happened today. You know,
I was just doing my stuff, and

307
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,620
bam, all of a sudden, this
lightning bolt came out of

308
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,940
nowhere and blasted somebody
apart, and all of a sudden,

309
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,760
we're having this intense
conversation after class, and

310
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,820
they're like, they're moving.
Something's moving in their

311
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,680
life, I began to sort of
function like a lightning rod,

312
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,140
you know, there was something
sparking, and at that time, I

313
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,600
didn't understand really what
was going on. I knew it had

314
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,120
something to do with my
psychedelic work, but I really

315
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,720
wasn't prepared for the enormity
of the implications of the

316
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,560
paradigm shift that I was going
to have to make, and eventually

317
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,620
did make, to understand how this
happened. And by the way,

318
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,080
everything that's in the living
classroom, I mean, I had been

319
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,840
thinking about it and wrestling
with it some, but it all dropped

320
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,760
in, intact, complete, in one
psychedelic session, all the

321
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,660
fundamental structure, and it's
what gave me seeing it clearly

322
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,080
in that space, is what gave me
the courage of my convictions to

323
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,380
articulate it, so that it
because if it's happening to me,

324
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,320
I knew it had to be happening to
other people. And it's not

325
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,480
really about psychedelics. If I
were using any type of spiritual

326
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,180
practice that had the capacity
or any that to drop you deep

327
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,860
into the collective psyche and
into that territory. If you open

328
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,580
up at that level, then you're
naturally going to generate a

329
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,320
kind of an energetic shock wave,
which is going to touch the

330
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,580
lives of people that you have
karmic connection to. And I'm a

331
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,240
teacher, so I have a lot of
karmic connections to my

332
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,420
students, this is just if you're
a business person, if you're a

333
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,800
researcher, if you're a
choreographer, if you're working

334
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,860
in the world and you're embedded
in a network of relationships,

335
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,600
and you go deep into that level,
the mind, the universe doesn't

336
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,560
necessarily from one
perspective. It doesn't

337
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,240
recognize individuals. It's like
the weather, it doesn't really

338
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,260
recognize individual atoms or
molecules of, you know, oxygen

339
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,320
and whatnot. It's like, there's
that side of it going, it just

340
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:04,560
goes. So I began to realize that
I was teaching on two levels at

341
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,220
campus, there was something that
began to happen at one level,

342
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,000
and for the most of the
students, I was just an ordinary

343
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
professor. I was teaching the
stuff, and they came and our

344
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,700
relationship was about
information exchange, and they

345
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,740
mostly left pretty happy. But
there was a second group of

346
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,880
students who began to take
pretty much all the courses I

347
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:32,600
would teach. And they were here
because just being in my classes

348
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,080
began to be a source of
transformation in their lives.

349
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,160
They were here for the energy or
something. They knew that

350
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,040
something was positively moving
in their life. When we came

351
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:54,100
together to work and again, it
wasn't my intention. Eventually

352
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,600
I this, I began to realize that
there is an energetic resonance.

353
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,380
This is just, it's nothing.
Anything supernatural or

354
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,100
paranormal, it's just normal.
It's just natural. Life is like

355
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,340
that. Consciousness is like
that. Minds are like that. We

356
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,400
it's just an illusion of the
physical senses that our minds

357
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,700
are fundamentally separate.
Well, they are. But there's that

358
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,740
other side, where the, you know,
individual minds emerge out of a

359
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,800
unified field of mind. And when
you come together and you focus

360
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,900
intention, there is a natural
sharing that takes place. And if

361
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:36,500
one of you is working at a very
deep level, then the universe

362
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,280
seizes that opportunity to
awaken and to heal other beings.

363
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
It's not something I was doing.
It was something that the

364
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,460
universe was doing, almost in
spite of me.

365
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,800
Teaching is information transfer
and all that magic that you do,

366
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,240
you know, in the dance of the
dance, but underneath that,

367
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:11,100
teaching involves the direct
engagement of mind and mind in

368
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,940
the unified field of mind.
Clarified states of

369
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,900
consciousness are contagious.
You cannot help it. It cannot

370
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,600
help it. It just happens.
Negative states are also

371
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,360
contagious, but clarified states
of consciousness are contagious.

372
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,740
Our spiritual ecology simply
does not allow private

373
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,620
realization. If you're beginning
to wake up, there's an energetic

374
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,500
quality component of waking up.
People around you begin to wake

375
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,860
up. And if you're a teacher, or
you're in anything that works,

376
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,340
people where you're working with
groups, you have to be prepared

377
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,420
for that consequence, for that
implication. In fact, you cannot

378
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,840
stop it. There may be a reason
why people do this work in

379
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,040
monasteries, on mountains far
away, because it kind of

380
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,280
buffers, you know, but if you're
going to do this work in the

381
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,080
world, you have to be prepared
to handle the implications of

382
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,140
the consequences of this natural
process. And here's the thing,

383
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,180
by the way, the better teacher
you are, the more powerful this

384
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,220
will, this will happen, because
teaching is that magical

385
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,520
mystery. You know, it's that
resonance. I mean, you're really

386
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,520
you're working communication,
you're trying to organize

387
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,420
intention, you're in the dance.
And if you're good at that, well

388
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,000
then that just makes it easier
for this stuff to happen. You

389
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,480
Yes, so eventually I had no
recourse, but I had to learn

390
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,420
what was happening. I had to
understand what it means to

391
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:59,440
teach at this level. What time
is it? Okay? Wow, okay. What

392
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,600
does it mean to teach when your
person has kind of become the

393
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,140
ADD, some kind of added catalyst
into the room. It's not just the

394
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,220
ideas that are the catalyst, but
your person has become the

395
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:19,920
catalyst. I had to learn how to
manage, not control, but to

396
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,060
manage the energies that were
involved, how to make it more

397
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,120
efficient, how to protect the
students, how to how to just how

398
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,180
to choreography, how to
choreograph. It a little bit.

399
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,960
Then I began to realize it
wasn't just what was happening

400
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,620
in the room was really too big
to be understood simply in terms

401
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,640
of an energetic resonance
between my spiritual practice

402
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,120
and my students. That was part
of what was going on. But then I

403
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,580
began to realize there was
something else going on.

404
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,680
Students were beginning to show
up in each other's dreams. There

405
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,740
was something happening socially
in the room. What what was

406
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,000
happening was simply I began to
understand what it was, too big

407
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,420
and too powerful, simply to be
explainable in terms of some

408
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,140
just a one on one, resonance
between me and them. There was a

409
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,180
second dynamic that was moving
on, moving in the room. Now I

410
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,080
had read Rupert Sheldrake, you
know, his books, a new science

411
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,480
of life and the presence of the
past and the rebirth of nature.

412
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,540
I'd read his books. I understood
the concept of morphogenetic

413
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,440
resonance and Morphic fields,
but Rupert is working in very,

414
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,820
very big fields, long, you know,
historical evolutionary fields.

415
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,800
And I didn't see the relevance
of those giant fields to what

416
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,120
was happening in my classroom,
because we were together for 15

417
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,980
weeks at a time. That's not a
whole lot of time. But then I

418
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,320
again in this one particular
psychedelic session, suddenly I

419
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,920
saw, Oh, you mean short term
groups have generate, feel.

420
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,620
Fields feels are generated
whenever people gather together,

421
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,240
and the more focused they are in
intention. And if they're

422
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,740
together long enough and deeply
engaged enough, and it's very

423
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,540
important if the if the group is
repeated, if it's a repetition

424
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:26,240
that goes on, these fields
emerge now. They emerge out of

425
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,700
the Unified nature of
consciousness, that

426
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,960
consciousness is a inherently
unified field. So it's not like

427
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,720
an erector set where you're
connecting, you're putting two

428
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,080
pieces that are really separate,
linking them together. It's kind

429
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,940
of like that, but, but at a
deeper level, what's happening

430
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:49,180
is an underlying potential is
being is being brought, is being

431
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:58,780
sparked into form, group feels,
group mind. Phil Jackson, not a

432
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,740
very mystical guy, as far as I
know, but Coach of the Los

433
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,300
Angeles Lakers, right? He sees
it. He says we see this a lot in

434
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,840
critical situations, when
players are totally focused on

435
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,280
the team goal, their effort can
create chain reactions. It's as

436
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,180
if they become totally connected
to one another, in sync with one

437
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:24,440
another, like five fingers on
one hand. Now Howard Bloom,

438
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,020
great author, wonderful book,
the global brain. He wrote, In

439
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:36,380
other words, without knowing it,
individuals form a team. Even in

440
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:42,160
our most casual moments, we
pulse in synchrony. Isn't that a

441
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:50,080
wonderful phrase, repulse and
synchrony, other symptoms of

442
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,000
this being a field phenomenon. I
began to realize that there was,

443
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,540
just like Rupert Sheldrake
theory predicts, there was a

444
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,820
change in the learning curve
taking place in my classes. It's

445
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,840
kind of like it. This is too
simple, but it's almost as if

446
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,520
one class was starting where the
last class stopped. It wasn't

447
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,500
quite like that. But, you know,
you got a course scripted, you

448
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,660
have it kind of worked out. You
know, it's a winner. You've

449
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,680
refined it. You spent several
years polishing it. You know,

450
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,760
you're taking them A to B to C
to D. You walk in the class the

451
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,640
first day, and all of a sudden
they're giving you the cues that

452
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,300
they're already in B, they're
already in C. And you've got to

453
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,360
rearrange your entire syllabus,
or you've got to make you've got

454
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,260
to step up, because something
has shifted. They've moved. I

455
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,640
began to realize there was a
learning that was taking place

456
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,100
in one class between semesters,
there was some kind of

457
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,600
developmental process, and you
go through certain turning

458
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,840
points, all of a sudden, things
are stable, and then something

459
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,680
triggers, and every class in
that subject after that, you're

460
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,600
working in a different context,
and that's a pain in the ass to

461
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,720
have to rearrange your syllabus.
So once in a while it's like,

462
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,880
I'm not going to do that. I'm
going to we're going to stay

463
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,620
with the tried and true. That's
bad news. That doesn't work,

464
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,040
because the students get bored
and the energy in the room, and

465
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,800
then you spend so much time
trying to lift up the energy,

466
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,840
and it's like, no, it's better
to go with it. Find where they

467
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,700
are, because if you find them,
it's not just that you'll do a

468
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,000
better job teaching, but
there's, there's something that

469
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,660
they're giving you in where they
are, they're going to take you

470
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:42,640
places that you haven't been
before yourself. I began to

471
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,060
differentiate two different
levels of these fields. So

472
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,200
there's the class field I call
and then the course field. The

473
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,740
class field is created by the
energy of the people who are in

474
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,480
the room today. All right, it's
kind of like in a tree. If there

475
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,600
are many, many rings of a tree,
the the outer ring. What did the

476
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
not the cambium ring? What's the
outer ring of the of the tree

477
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:11,940
called, I'm blanking on it,
sorry, having a brain fart. You

478
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,420
know, the living outer edge of
the tree, not the bark, right

479
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:22,940
underneath the bark, pardon?
Cambium? Okay, that's the class

480
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:30,620
field, right? The course field
is a much older, bigger field.

481
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,020
It's the energy. It's a kind of
a residual arc in the learning

482
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,040
of the field, which has been
contributed to by every student

483
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,120
who has ever taken this course
with this particular professor?

484
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,780
Now I'm going to kind of
restrict it to that with this

485
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:54,100
particular professor. I think
it's more than that. But in the

486
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,260
beginning, the class field may
be the stronger field, but over

487
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,180
time. The course field. When
you've been teaching 2030, more

488
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,440
years, the course field gets
very strong. So here you've got

489
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,580
three systems, the individual
student, whose consciousness is

490
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,540
being affected by the class
field, whose consciousness is

491
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,680
being affected by the course
field. So here you've got the

492
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,580
universal mind, the individual.
And what we're suggesting is

493
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,420
that this organic relationship
between universal mind and

494
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,440
individual mind has these
intermediate fields, which, when

495
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,280
those fields are get strong, and
when they are skillfully

496
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,580
focused, as you can then it
triggers, it animates, it

497
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,020
empowers, it makes more
creative, more adventuresome,

498
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,120
the learning of the individual
mind. If you were a coach, we'd

499
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,900
be talking about performance
feels. If we were physicians,

500
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,500
we'd be talking about healing
fields. I'm a teacher, so we're

501
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,920
talking about learning feels but
feels is, feels okay, old, feels

502
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:13,800
young, feels present, feels
past, feels I learned that you

503
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,840
could work with these fields. I
learned some tricks. I start

504
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,040
working with the fields of a
class before the class begins.

505
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,020
There are certain practices that
I do because to me, the field is

506
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,940
the unregistered student in the
room, right? It's a tangible

507
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,960
thing. I even will so far go so
far as when I'm looking at which

508
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,780
books to assign a semester from
now, I sometimes try to tune

509
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,340
into the field that's emerging
around this course to determine

510
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:53,020
whether I should you go to a or
go with B. I do certain kinds of

511
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,320
practices, spiritual practices,
because I don't want a lot of

512
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,180
old karma screwing things up in
the classroom. I don't want a

513
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,160
bad vibe from you me, because,
you know, I'm a

514
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,800
reincarnationist. I believe in
reincarnation. You we I think

515
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,220
you know

516
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,320
life being what it is. I'm
assuming I've got former lives

517
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,640
with some of my students. I'm
assuming that sometimes it

518
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,080
worked out well and we got
something good that came out of

519
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,320
it. Sometimes maybe it didn't
work out too well. We got some

520
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,760
bruises or some pain that's
going to come up. We I don't

521
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,080
have any time for the bad stuff,
so I do these practices. It's

522
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,680
like, I'm sorry if I hurt you,
without the students knowing

523
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,680
this is something you don't do
to them. I'm sorry if I hurt

524
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,800
you. Please forgive me. If you
hurt me, I forgive you. Let's

525
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,100
just go. Let's just get on with
it. And there are practices you

526
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,820
can do. Every spiritual
tradition has practices for

527
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:57,640
cutting the cords of karma,
karma. I used to use a Hawaiian

528
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,540
Kuhn, a practice called
hooponopono, which means

529
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,280
cutting. And then later, when I
learned Chud, which is a Tibetan

530
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,080
practice, which also means
cutting, I would do that

531
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:17,160
practice. So before class
begins, when I get a roster,

532
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,520
which usually comes in about a
month before the class begins,

533
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,200
I'm doing Chud with this roster
with the students in front of

534
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,340
me. I've often wondered what my
faculty colleagues would think

535
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:33,800
if they came in and I'm doing a
bell and ringing and I'm singing

536
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,880
a Tibetan prayer for students in
a class that hasn't even begun

537
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:44,380
yet. But once you understand
fields, this is simply just

538
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,280
being efficient. It's just being
efficient. You're working with

539
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,080
the energy before there are
physical beings present. Once

540
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,020
the class begins, then you get
to see the beings that are

541
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,380
physically the embodiment of the
energy that you've been picking

542
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:04,980
up on. And you can work with
fields during the class. You can

543
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,860
do it behind the scenes, and
there are ways in which you can

544
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,300
do it in the class.
Visualization exercises can

545
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,280
empower fields. Various types of
Cafe conversations can cross

546
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,320
fertilize fields. One of the
other things that's important to

547
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:29,060
do is to close the field at the
end of the semester. Now, by

548
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,060
closing the field, I don't mean
like you dissolve the field, but

549
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,840
there's a sense in which every
class has a beginning, a middle

550
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,380
and an end. It's important if
you're going to empower fields.

551
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,200
And if you're going to work with
fields, and you're you're going

552
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,280
to invite that type of dynamic
into the room, it's important at

553
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,180
the end of the semester to close
the field and help students

554
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,140
detach from the field, to re
empower them as individual

555
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,420
learners, and then send them on
their way where they will. On to

556
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,480
new fields and connect with new
groups, and then go on to new

557
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,300
fields and connect to new you
don't want to encourage an

558
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,520
attachment to the field, but if
you don't close the field,

559
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,120
sometimes students get stuck.
They'll show up at your office

560
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,140
two weeks after a course is
over, kind of wanting to talk

561
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,420
and what's I began to realize
there was something wrong here.

562
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,940
Wasn't just that they liked the
course, but they were still

563
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,480
psychically attached to the
energy of the class, but they

564
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,880
didn't have a place to take it,
and so you have to do things

565
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,500
both shamanically and
strategically pedagogically to

566
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,520
close the field so that, like a
final exam, is a good way to

567
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,040
help close the field, let them
demonstrate their learning.

568
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,280
Whenever you have a kind of a
beer or pizza that the local

569
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,860
student union at the end of a
course, you're always are

570
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,740
asking, what's what are you
going to do next? Where are you

571
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,160
going next? What's next on the
agenda? You're you're focusing.

572
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,440
You collect information on the
course, you get student feedback

573
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,260
in the course, and you tell
them, I'm going to use your

574
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,680
feedback to make this better for
the next class. You're

575
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,800
reinforcing the sense that they
are part of a lineage of

576
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:20,280
learning and their time is over,
and that's okay, everybody. Our

577
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,620
time together is finite,

578
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:33,560
waking up in the classroom,
waking up, right? We're talking

579
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:39,440
about, you know, some type of
spiritual awakening. What do we

580
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,300
mean? What is that? Waking up
simply is in one perspective,

581
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,260
it's simply waking up to the
simple fact that nobody holds

582
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,140
their own being in and of
itself, the beginnings and

583
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,700
ending of our being lie outside
of ourselves. There's just,

584
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:04,620
there is no it's It's waking up
to the tangible fact that we our

585
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,840
lives, are deeply intertwined
and woven together. And if you

586
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:15,720
can stand in a certain way, you
can feel that weave. And when

587
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,400
you feel that weave strongly,
that chronic sense of tightness

588
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,000
of the self relaxes, and the
wind blows through the trees and

589
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,200
the leaves dance. It's just
waking up, waking up to

590
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,540
something that has always been
there. It didn't start. It

591
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,800
doesn't stop. You don't make it
happen. It's just the natural

592
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:50,740
condition of being, the bubble
pops Shunyata, right? Emptiness,

593
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,940
emptiness of self, but the
translation of Shunyata that I

594
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:01,200
like the best is transparency.
Transparency. It's like I am

595
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,620
here, but everyone is here, but
we become transparent to the

596
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,100
ground condition. We become
transparent to the true

597
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,100
condition of things. People wake
up in all sorts of

598
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,600
circumstances, in all sorts of
activities with all sorts of

599
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:27,320
context and what outside of my
own psychedelic work, one of the

600
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,120
places where I've experienced
this simple, simple truth very

601
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:38,420
deeply is in the classroom. You
know, when something uses my

602
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,300
mind or uses me, and there is
this wind that blows invisibly

603
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,560
between the students and myself,
or between us together, and that

604
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,520
and that delicious feeling of
being used, where you just kind

605
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:58,660
of relax, and something happens
which is bigger than you. Oh,

606
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,980
there's no self here. There's no
self in bit in it. This is

607
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,060
something which is inherently
trans self phenomena. And when

608
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:14,640
you when you just appreciate the
trans self nature of this

609
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,600
exchange,

610
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,820
the joy of discovering that the
life that is alive in you, the

611
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,120
life that's moving in this room,
is actually the life of all

612
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,040
things. It is the life of all
things, your life and their

613
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:40,100
life, your life. It's the life
of all things relaxing into that

614
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:49,240
you it, even when we forget,
even when I forget, life doesn't

615
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,220
forget. Life is still one the
transparency is still there,

616
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,160
whether or not I'm remembering
it or not, whether I'm paying

617
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,800
attention to or not, it's always
there. It. Just there waking up.

618
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,420
You can wake up in any
circumstance, in any condition,

619
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,780
and it's lovely to wake up when
you're working, as in the

620
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,880
classroom, it's just, why not?

621
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,460
The Circle of Learning. I had
the had the experience many

622
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,400
times. I'm sure you have to. You
go through an exercise, you go

623
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,560
through an experience. You read
a book, you learn something very

624
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,740
quickly. A few days later, a
week later, somebody asks you a

625
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,920
question in class. If they had
asked you two weeks before, you

626
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,280
wouldn't have anything to say
because you don't didn't know

627
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,600
that, but because they asked
you. Now you have something to

628
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,160
say, and you you give it to them
and that it's important to them,

629
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,960
and you think, Wow, isn't that
cool? Something is alive in the

630
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,780
universe. It's able to use
something that I learned in

631
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,160
order to help somebody, somebody
else that is just got to be damn

632
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:09,120
cool. That's neat. But then I
began to realize, you know, I

633
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,240
don't quite I hadn't seen this
all work out yet. It's much more

634
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,620
complicated than that. It's not
simply that something that I

635
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,560
learned is being used by the
universe to facilitate a

636
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:25,160
learning in somebody else. It's
actually often the reason I

637
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,180
learned this in the first place,
the reason I had this experience

638
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,620
in the first place is because
there was a need to know coming

639
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:40,840
at me, and my system picked up
the need to know, and I had the

640
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,640
ability to learn, so that when
this happened, when this need

641
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,800
came forward, the exchange took
place, the Circle of Learning.

642
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,180
And when I began to realize that
this was happening all the time,

643
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,660
it was all it had been happening
for decades before I even

644
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,660
understood it. That's when you
really have to let go big time,

645
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:17,160
because you don't even own your
career. You don't even own your

646
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,980
own academic ideas, your own
academic passions, your passion

647
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,520
and your student's passion are
intertwined right from the very

648
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,980
beginning, and that's when you
either clutch and get real tight

649
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,860
on it and try to get back in
control of it, or you let go

650
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:39,200
very, very deeply and you begin
to just this. The beginnings and

651
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,320
endings of your life did not
start and stop with you. The

652
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,620
reason you want, the things you
want, the reasons you love the

653
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,980
things you love, the reasons
that you just have, the hungers

654
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,360
that you have, are not
independent of the loves and

655
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,660
hungers and the wishes that
other people have. We're just

656
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,220
constantly processing these
things at multiple levels all at

657
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:07,680
the same time. Now that's a
dance, isn't that? It's just a

658
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,340
dance?

659
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:20,240
Well, I kept doing the
psychedelic work. I kept going

660
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,580
deeper and deeper I began to get
into, you know, things I haven't

661
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,400
written about publicly yet. You
know, dark night, early dawn,

662
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,760
takes the first 10 years, but
there's a second 10 years,

663
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,560
deep stuff, stuff that many of
you have touched and worked in

664
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,620
to experience reincarnation, not
as an in, not at the soul level,

665
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,040
not at the individual level, but
at the aggregate level, to

666
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,420
experience what it's like to be
In a species that's

667
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,720
reincarnating so that every
individual is like sloughing

668
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,960
cells off of skin this massive,
magnificent, beautiful organism,

669
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,740
learning, the learning of the
species mind, generation by

670
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:24,080
generation, billions of people
beginning to be drawn into the

671
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,760
larger story of humanity's
evolutionary pivot, going into

672
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:35,240
vast tracks of time, being drawn
into the crisis as fermenting

673
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,780
underneath history, bringing us
into this boiling point, going

674
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,820
beyond The boiling point to see
what's what's being generated,

675
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:50,080
what has been being in the works
for 100,000 years from and this

676
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:58,120
crescendo that we're moving to,
in some ways, can you imagine

677
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,720
what it would be like to go
through pregnant. See in labor

678
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,520
and not know what what a child
was, in some ways, what we're

679
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,420
going through. Only really for
me, began to make sense when I

680
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:15,360
began to get a taste of the
human that's coming, the human

681
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,220
that we're all in the process of
gestating through history. I

682
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:26,000
degree, and then to be enter
into some of the domains that

683
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,140
I've called the domain of
diamond Luminosity, or the

684
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,680
Buddhists call it sambhogakaya,
as best as I can determine, this

685
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,660
deep, deep intimacies with the
divine intimacy so deep they

686
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,820
eventually become, became, for
me, too painful to leave. Just

687
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:53,740
too painful. I couldn't keep
going back into them. I could

688
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:59,140
not share this knowledge with my
students. I didn't talk about my

689
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,180
work, but I was always teaching
Stan stuff, so there was a sense

690
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:09,960
in which I could teach through
Stan. But eventually my work

691
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,160
reached and tapped into
territory. I could not bring

692
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,660
that to them, even though they
were willing, they just didn't

693
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,980
have sufficient preparation.
They were undergraduate students

694
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,280
in Ohio. They were not graduate
students in California. You I

695
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,600
could not bring that to them.
And something began to happen

696
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,640
inside my body, because my
natural being is to share, but I

697
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,520
could not share these things
that meant so deep to me. I had

698
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,560
knowledge that I could not bring
forward. I had to stop myself

699
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:46,060
from bringing it forward. I
began to lose control of my

700
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,540
voice. I began to there was so
much tension in my voice,

701
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,180
because someone would ask a
question, and inside me, there

702
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,960
would come this knowing that
would naturally want to reach

703
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,360
out and share, but I couldn't,
so I'd clutch, and I'd lose

704
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,940
control of my voice, and there'd
be kind of a bark. It's kind of

705
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:10,920
embarrassing. It's kind of a
bark, and I'd stop. It was

706
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,920
getting pretty intense. This was
one of my work was really

707
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:21,020
getting to the peak stages in
9798 99 I stopped it in 99 I

708
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:28,520
really didn't know how to where
this was going to go. And then a

709
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,320
number of things happened in my
personal life. My marriage

710
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,600
ended, dark night, early dawn
was published, and then I was

711
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,060
given an opportunity to come to
be the Director of Education at

712
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:50,080
ions. And so I thought, okay,
took care of my family. I mean,

713
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,220
the worst experience of my life
was going through that divorce,

714
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,820
taking care of my former wife,
taking care of my children,

715
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:02,280
moving them, getting everything
situated, working that beginning

716
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,180
of that healing process. But
then I went to California, and I

717
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,780
thought, Ah, this will be the
new platform. This will give me

718
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,140
out. I'm out of Ohio, I'm out of
teaching undergraduates. I'm

719
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:18,420
going to be able to work with
more people who are already

720
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,800
through class, A, B and C. We
can start at D. You know, this

721
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,780
is going to be a new platform
for me. And it was kind of

722
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:33,380
initially, but two years later,
it didn't work out for a variety

723
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,160
of reasons. Don't need to go
into really did not want to stay

724
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,960
there. And I came back to Ohio
and I resumed my teaching

725
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:48,460
career, which is a hard
transition to go through.

726
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,560
I knew I didn't belong at YSU
anymore, in Youngstown anymore,

727
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,940
but this is where I had to be,
because I had to get my kids

728
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,940
through college. I had college
tuitions to go. I really

729
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,480
couldn't step away until my
youngest graduated from college,

730
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,040
and that was still a number of
years off. So I kind of, you

731
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,180
know, adjusted. I had stopped
the intense psychedelic work. My

732
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,560
system was beginning to slow
down, but I knew that something

733
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,460
wasn't right. I mean, I was
really ungrounded. I was really

734
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,860
I had developed an over
attachment to marijuana, you

735
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:37,100
know, I just, I began to realize
part of me just was not willing

736
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,840
to come down off the mountain,
and my smoking was keeping me

737
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,200
from coming all the way down,
all the way down off the

738
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,160
mountain, and I realized I had
to come completely down off the

739
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,580
mountain. And that took that
took some time.

740
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,780
It took. So five to 10 years
after I stopped my work, before

741
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:09,420
my whole system kind of
recalibrated down to the new

742
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:17,820
baseline. Soon as my daughter
graduated from college, I

743
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:23,000
resigned from YSU, and then the
question becomes, how do not?

744
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,260
How do I share what I know now?
And so I it's by writing. You

745
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:30,620
know, it's by writing and
wonderful opportunity to spend

746
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,620
some time with you. I mean, it's
just, well, you are such a

747
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:38,660
blessing to me. Really, such a
blessing. Your hearts and your

748
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:46,240
minds are so beautiful. Damn.
How do I contribute to the

749
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,840
resurgence, the renewal of the
psychedelic Renaissance? How do

750
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,500
I personally contribute to my
discipline? How do I help them

751
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,160
realize the potential of
psychedelics, for philosophy,

752
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:02,340
for my original discipline? How
do I bring that forward? How can

753
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:07,320
I help others tap into the
cosmology, the cosmological

754
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:13,320
depths that they are already
deeply part of without exposing

755
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,560
themselves to some of the risk
and making some of the mistakes

756
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,000
that I made along the way? I

757
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,680
Yeah, knowing when to pull back,
knowing when to stop, knowing

758
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,860
when the students whom you love,
and I love being with the

759
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:34,160
students, I love being in the
classroom, but knowing when

760
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,940
those are not my students
anymore. I can't keep doing

761
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:43,840
this, pulling back and then
writing, you know, writing, and

762
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,000
then seeing what happens, seeing
what comes from there. So the

763
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,360
book now I'm working on is
stealing diamonds from heaven,

764
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,280
which is this whole story. And
then I have another one I want

765
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,960
to work on, called The Birth of
the diamond soul, which is

766
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,980
really about my sense of what's
happening in history and in

767
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,400
nature.

768
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:10,740
Unknown: Okay,

769
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:19,559
not bad. Nine o'clock right on,
pretty damn good, huh? Okay, I'm

770
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:24,739
done. Let's stand up, un kink
your ankles and Your knees.

771
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:48,880
Okay, do reference here, Chris,

772
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:10,380
Robert McDermott: you I'll say
something okay. I think you can

773
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:15,840
see why I was so delighted to
write the forward to Chris's

774
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:21,800
book and how easy it was. So
thank you for those, any of you

775
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,400
who are interested in continuing
this conversation with Chris,

776
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,660
with me, with various parts of
what, what you're doing, and

777
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:34,100
it's important to see us, I
would be happy to participate,

778
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,160
maybe even while we're here, if
we could figure that out. Okay,

779
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,840
that's good. Okay, that's
possible. Pull up a cushion.

780
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,640
Okay. I don't know if any of you
gonna be leaving. I have a

781
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,840
really be breaking the mood,
wouldn't it? We'll save it for

782
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,180
later. Okay, I do have an
announcement for later, but

783
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:58,060
let's save it till the
discussion. Okay, okay, anybody

784
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:03,780
who wants to leave at any time?
Yeah, please do Yeah. But I

785
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:09,000
mean, I'm very moved by first,
as you can tell. And if you read

786
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:14,220
the forward, you'll see that it
was, it was an easy affirmation

787
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,060
to make.

788
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,480
Chris Bache: Now, what most of
you don't know is that I was

789
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:23,420
Robert sitter in a Holotropic
Breathwork session right down at

790
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,920
the big house when we and he was
my sitter, we got down together.

791
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,140
Okay, floor is open. Let's talk.

792
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,260
Robert McDermott: So maybe I'll
begin with a little explanation

793
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:47,200
why I jumped up here. Okay, so
you said you did young for 30

794
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:53,140
years, 3333 Yeah, I had a very
similar experience for 20 years

795
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,920
at Baruch College. Yeah, right.
Taught all my students were

796
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:04,020
first generation. Yeah. I. So I
taught for I never had fewer

797
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:08,820
than 40 students. I never taught
the same student twice. I taught

798
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:14,280
40 students three times a year,
three times a day, each semester

799
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,740
for 20 years. Yeah, so it's a
little something. Then I come to

800
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:25,460
Paradise, not as a faculty
member initially, but I've been

801
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:30,920
out with a faculty member for 14
years, all the time, looking for

802
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:37,460
the kind of experience that you
described. And either i Well,

803
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:43,840
I'm the brick that you said you
were to have. All those things.

804
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,160
I also didn't have a whole
psychedelic practice. We can fix

805
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:48,460
that.

806
01:00:53,800 --> 01:01:00,300
There's no shortage of people in
this room to get me. To get

807
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:12,540
me that said, I want to say that
in this psychedelic inspired

808
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,220
community, neither Has it ever
happened that a person pressured

809
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:17,280
me,

810
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,720
Unknown: not at once. Yeah,
that's the way it's

811
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,220
Robert McDermott: supposed to be
always in life, yeah. But it is

812
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:32,780
the case. Yeah. Okay, so, so I'm
always looking for the kind of,

813
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,460
what I call the etheric body,
yeah, to be experienced and

814
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,560
shared with language and
examples and whatever. And I'm

815
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,740
not saying it doesn't happen or
it hasn't happened. It certainly

816
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:49,420
has not happened at the level
that you described in the living

817
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,900
classroom, which I think is
quite an amazing document. If

818
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,340
you haven't read it, it's an
amazing document. So I just

819
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:03,000
wanted to take I jumped up here
very spontaneously, or you feel

820
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:13,860
right. So I actually had a
pretty hard trip, if you

821
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,160
remember. Yeah, in fact,
everybody was out of the room. I

822
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,720
don't know why I'm talking about
this. Everybody was out of the

823
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:29,120
room, and Stan relieved you.
Yeah, and when I came out of

824
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:33,260
this experience, I assisted to
insisted to Chris that it was

825
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:38,120
about 10 minutes. It was
actually three hours, and there

826
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,680
was a hand that I recall
experiencing, something like a

827
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,840
baseball glove, which was Stan's
hand on my face, that went from

828
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:55,480
this giant of a mountain of a
man with exquisite, gentle,

829
01:02:55,540 --> 01:03:01,980
compassionate quality, Right? I
almost I had this opportunity to

830
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,100
talk at the conference. I almost
said that, but I said, No, it's

831
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,160
not really what it's about, but
it's in my mind, because we just

832
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,180
had this great experience of, of
Chris, of sorry, Stan, so

833
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:15,540
anyway, we had that together. I
sat with you. So it's a very

834
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:20,660
bonding experience to have this.
The other dive I did, it was in

835
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,780
my house and Ashbery street with
will keep it

836
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,400
Unknown: well, he's good. You're
in Cherry hands. Good hands.

837
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,760
Robert McDermott: I went to the
mountain twice, yeah. But

838
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,180
anyway, getting back to you and
your work and your relationship

839
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,740
to our students, which is quite
intense, considering that you

840
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,800
don't teach that often, yeah,
right. It's quite intense. I

841
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:49,060
hear, get him here, keep him
here, that kind of thing, which

842
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:52,840
I listen to and remember and try
to be, you know, do what we can,

843
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,900
but keep it up. Keep it up.

844
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,020
Chris Bache: Let me mention
something about the etheric

845
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,900
field. Yeah, this comes at the
very end of the living

846
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,180
classroom, because the living
classroom was written in,

847
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,580
published in 2008 written in
2006 seven and I stopped the

848
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:19,620
heavy duty psychedelic work in
99 over time, this energetic

849
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:25,520
resonance calmed down. It didn't
go away entirely. But instead of

850
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,980
kind of being like a lightning
rod, where it was happening

851
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:32,300
around me without my being, you
know, now, I had to kind of

852
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:37,340
cooperate with it. I had to kind
of let it happen, not like I

853
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,140
could control it. But there was
a sense of it's a it was a

854
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,260
subtler thing, and that kind of
teaches us something about the

855
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:49,480
etheric level, that the practice
empowers the system. You open

856
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,620
up, you bringing in heavy duty
energy. You move from 110 volts

857
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:57,340
to 240 volts, naturally you're
going to activate these inherent

858
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:02,580
circuits. But then, if you. If
the system calms down, it's not

859
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:06,480
like the circuits, the network
is there, but you're not.

860
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:12,180
There's not as much energy
driving it. And that's there's a

861
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:17,760
wisdom in the kind of the pace
of evolution. There is a

862
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,900
certain, not a risk, I think. I
mean potentially. But there is a

863
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,980
certain if you over, if you
drive the system hard, things

864
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:31,820
are going to happen. Then you
calm down. Things calm down, you

865
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:36,140
know. So I don't have that
transparency today that I did at

866
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,800
the peak in the living
classroom, and now it's kind of

867
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,060
a subtler thing than it was
then.

868
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,540
Unknown: Rules are rules. You
know, the period of the greatest

869
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:02,280
transparency, as you described
it was that whole period of the

870
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:06,360
iranis Neptune conjunction,
which was indeed a field, a

871
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:10,140
collective field, that did
exactly that, you know,

872
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,740
dissolving of boundaries, the
creation of transparent fields.

873
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:18,660
It's perfect expression of it in
a very creative way. And it was,

874
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,880
you know, it basically, you
know, started coming in in the

875
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:26,600
mid to late 80s, and then was
just totally cooking all through

876
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:32,120
the 90s. And then, you know,
once it got to 2001 it reached

877
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:37,340
the 15 degree mark and and, you
know, that pulse that, you know,

878
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:41,500
PCC was born under, and many
other, I mean, now we've got the

879
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,160
Uranus Pluto and a whole nother
kind of driving intensity is

880
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,960
here. But what you are
describing of the living

881
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,560
classroom and the Morphic field
that was taken in, and these,

882
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:57,160
these fields, these course
fields, these class fields, etc,

883
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,780
it's, it's larger, both the
perception and the capacity to

884
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:08,460
cultivate it and the capacity to
name it and articulate it, very

885
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:12,840
much, I think, is an expression
of that, that larger Uranus

886
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,760
Neptune very the privilege that
we all had come to have had That

887
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,380
going all during those years.

888
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,840
Robert McDermott: Yeah, yeah.
Thank you. Where are we going?

889
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,200
Chris, Richard.

890
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,860
Unknown: Chris, I just want to
express my deepest gratitude for

891
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:43,600
some of us that have experienced
you in the classroom and see the

892
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,380
living embodiment of your
written word in person, it is

893
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,800
unbelievable to be in the
presence, and I feel every time

894
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,680
I leave the classroom, I feel
I'm just a little bit more

895
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:59,200
dignified and connected to a
larger purpose in life. And on a

896
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,700
personal note, like five or six
weeks ago, I started teaching

897
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:06,060
poetry to sixth and seventh
graders, and I was terrified in

898
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:10,080
front of those kids. I felt like
I didn't even know how to speak

899
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:15,540
to kids. And if it wasn't for
for your book, I think I would

900
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:19,740
have fallen apart, because I had
this distinct feeling, with the

901
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:23,960
help of your book that not all
responsibility laid on my, my

902
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:28,400
shoulders, and I could actually
just allow the field to create

903
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,240
the class. And sure enough, it
happened, and I saw it in in

904
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,320
living action. Yeah, so I do, I
do have a question that I want

905
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:43,120
to add to this little note, and
that is what, cosmological

906
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:49,060
implications do you see from the
field experience that you have

907
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:54,460
made in your life, that the
whole universe seems to relate

908
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:59,980
in that potential to create
fields everywhere we look, As a

909
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:03,120
galaxy, a kind of field like,
yeah, and

910
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:07,139
Chris Bache: any thoughts. Well,
the nice thing about it is it

911
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:12,299
was working just fine for 100
it's been working this way for

912
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:15,779
billions of years before we even
began to understand what was

913
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:19,139
going on. So whatever is going
on, it's been going on for a

914
01:09:19,139 --> 01:09:21,799
hell of a long time. The fact
that we're beginning to

915
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:24,619
understand some of these
dynamics and maybe can

916
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:28,519
participate in them more
consciously. Some people,

917
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:30,919
actually, some of my colleagues,
have said, you know, well, this

918
01:09:30,919 --> 01:09:34,519
is kind of like, it undermines
your individuality, you know,

919
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:39,139
all this kind of ego, fear kind
of stuff. But it's like, look,

920
01:09:39,139 --> 01:09:41,679
we're just beginning to play
with something that's been

921
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,059
playing with us for a long time.
So I don't know. I don't know

922
01:09:46,059 --> 01:09:48,759
how it all works, you know, I
don't know the full

923
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:52,659
ramifications of all these
dynamics. It's just that look,

924
01:09:53,019 --> 01:09:56,559
when we just kind of work
together, we synchronize

925
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,919
ourselves, we work with guided
intention. We want focus to.

926
01:09:59,999 --> 01:10:02,879
Intention. We do these exercise
together. What do you know?

927
01:10:02,879 --> 01:10:05,699
There's a little bit of bleed
through that comes together, a

928
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:10,439
little reinforcement that takes
place. Hey, then it gets scary.

929
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,719
You think about, well, there's a
field around the Pentagon,

930
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:17,579
there's a field around shopping
malls, there's a field around

931
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:20,299
the New York Times. There's a
field around all you know,

932
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:23,899
there's so fields are
everywhere. There's they're not

933
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:27,439
good or bad, they're not moral,
just moral things. There's

934
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:31,279
negative. There's a field around
the Ku Klux Klan. There's in the

935
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:34,759
field around the NRA and all the
chapters of the NRA. But it's

936
01:10:34,759 --> 01:10:38,899
been going on for a long time.
It's just the connective tissue

937
01:10:38,899 --> 01:10:41,559
of consciousness. Meant you're
reaching sort of threshold

938
01:10:41,559 --> 01:10:45,879
proportion. But once you
understand that, then you kind

939
01:10:45,879 --> 01:10:49,119
of begin to be a little bit more
sensitive to your own psychic

940
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:53,439
hygiene. You don't want to put
yourself in certain psychic

941
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:58,179
fields, because, yeah, you know,
it's like, I used to take my

942
01:10:58,179 --> 01:11:04,319
kids to karate matches and
little Lance like, Ooh, you

943
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:07,739
know, it's kind of, you know,
but going to an art museums

944
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:10,559
that's kind of a nice field, you
know. So it's,

945
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:14,879
Robert McDermott: why did you
say, as I think you did, that

946
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:20,039
they're not good or bad, but you
just, you just indicated that

947
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:23,659
some fields really are pretty
negative and difficult.

948
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:28,639
Chris Bache: By good or bad, I
mean, nature isn't making is

949
01:11:28,639 --> 01:11:33,499
doesn't seem to be. At least, I
don't think of nature as re in

950
01:11:33,739 --> 01:11:39,499
as in this particular respect,
reinforcing morally good fields

951
01:11:39,559 --> 01:11:44,379
and undermining morally
injurious fields or negative

952
01:11:44,379 --> 01:11:51,339
fields. Now I, as an evolving
consciousness, want, I choose to

953
01:11:51,339 --> 01:11:55,719
cultivate certain energy in my
life. And by choosing, if I want

954
01:11:55,719 --> 01:12:00,039
to cultivate that energy, then I
kind of want to detach from this

955
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:04,319
energy so I may make moral
distinctions, and I may want to

956
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:07,799
associate myself with fields of
compassion, intelligence,

957
01:12:07,799 --> 01:12:13,199
creativity and and not put
myself in in the context of

958
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:19,979
intense competition, You know,
corrosive, vitriolic fields. But

959
01:12:19,979 --> 01:12:26,899
it's kind of like, you know, the
ocean has currents, the ocean

960
01:12:26,899 --> 01:12:30,679
has riptides, the ocean moves
one way or the other. We drowned

961
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,739
or we float, but they're not
moral.

962
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,260
Robert McDermott: So we have two
differences in our worldview.

963
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,040
Okay, I've surfaced in the last
few minutes. Okay, you might be

964
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:53,860
interested. One is for me, this
entire discussion takes place in

965
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:59,800
a comprehensive evolution of
consciousness. Yes, if we, since

966
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:04,740
we all here, mostly all here for
Rick's talk. Just remember what

967
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:09,960
he was saying about the
uniqueness of the modern Western

968
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:17,460
consciousness. Well, that what
that fact that Rick is so good

969
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,260
at articulating, but he and I
both influenced by Owen

970
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:26,720
Barfield, saving the appearances
and many books like that, leads

971
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:35,060
me to say that to you for Your
comment that something like the

972
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:47,200
etheric was immediately evident
without the separation came

973
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:51,940
about in the modern West, and so
now we are in a situation where

974
01:13:51,940 --> 01:14:01,500
we have to learn, I think, by
Love, to reconnect with our our

975
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:07,740
etheric and the etheric that
surrounds us in a way that we we

976
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:15,120
do try to discern etheric
fields, which may be synonymous,

977
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:22,160
tautological, okay, that are
working against love, and we

978
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:26,540
have to know that they are and
do what we can to transform

979
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:26,780
them.

980
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,160
Chris Bache: I'll go even
further than that. I agree with

981
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:38,060
you, right? I think, I think the
universe, you know, Jung said

982
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,580
the universe tilts towards
growth, right, right? So I think

983
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,700
there are ways and levels of the
universe that's actually

984
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:52,600
encouraging the forces of
compassion and tilting it

985
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,400
towards growth. But when I say
that the fields themselves are a

986
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,220
natural phenomena that are not
in. Themselves, good or bad,

987
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,420
they just are. That doesn't mean
that there aren't other dynamics

988
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:10,860
that are at play, which are
encouraging the emergence or

989
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:14,640
strengthening in subtle ways,
perhaps fields of compassion,

990
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,660
which are fields of oneness,
which are fields of growth and

991
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,500
kind of not giving as much
support to fields which are

992
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,200
inherently divisive and
inherently destructive of the

993
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,700
Unified Fabric of life.

994
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:34,340
Robert McDermott: I think I, I
think I would want to revise

995
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:38,540
your language just a little bit
okay, because I'm not. I don't

996
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:44,200
often talk about anything
inherently without adding it's

997
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:48,220
really it's multiple
relationships, yes. So I don't

998
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:52,600
think that fields are negative
all by themselves. They're

999
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,780
negative in relation to
something that the universe

1000
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:57,280
needs to accomplish.

1001
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,340
Chris Bache: That's interesting
language. I have to sit with

1002
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,180
that for a bit.

1003
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:08,579
Unknown: Okay, let me sit with
that for a bit. In relationship

1004
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:10,979
that they have to accomplish
something. Let me

1005
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:13,740
Robert McDermott: sit with that
for a bit Jung sense growth or

1006
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,520
talks about the universe, to try
and evolve towards love and

1007
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,780
freedom. Actually think it's
towards love and freedom is only

1008
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:26,120
the only is the condition which
makes love possible.

1009
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,860
Chris Bache: Yeah, to me, love
is, is an expression of the

1010
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:35,900
inherent oneness of life. And it
is, it is it fosters it. It

1011
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:40,160
expresses it. And that's why
it's so powerful. It's, it is

1012
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:44,320
the experience of the inherent
unified nature of reality, you

1013
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:44,560
know,

1014
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:49,000
Robert McDermott: yeah, and
therefore those fields that are

1015
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:56,860
emphasizing and militating on
behalf of disunity and fear,

1016
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:05,160
hatred and delusion, I consider
to be negative and to be and

1017
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:13,140
that it's part of my life to try
to transform those fields which

1018
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:18,480
I also advance against what I
think of myself.

1019
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,280
Chris Bache: Yeah, I certainly
agree with you on that. I mean,

1020
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:26,420
you know, just a little side
note, Youngstown, one of the

1021
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:32,180
reasons I learned that I was in
Youngstown, particularly short,

1022
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:39,020
very quick bullet. My it was my
soul's choice to do the work

1023
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,100
with the ocean of suffering that
I ended up doing for all those

1024
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:48,640
years in the psychedelic work.
San Francisco is not a very good

1025
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,700
environment in which to deal
with those kind of negative

1026
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:55,060
fields. Youngstown is a very,
very good environment to deal

1027
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,400
with those kind of negative
fields. Youngstown has made the

1028
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:02,220
cut the cover of Time magazine
twice as Mobtown, USA had the

1029
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:06,480
highest murder per capita rate
in the country for a number of

1030
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,740
years. And it goes the mafia
dominated Youngstown politics

1031
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:14,280
for many years. Lots of gangland
executions. And it goes all the

1032
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,980
way back the Native Americans,
where some terrible massacres

1033
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:21,620
took place there. So there's a
field, a huge kind of psychic

1034
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,200
feel, a lot of Eastern European
immigration, a lot of

1035
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,380
patriarchy, a lot of abuse of
women. It's really kind of,

1036
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:31,040
it's, it's a place where bad
karma comes to work itself out.

1037
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:37,700
And so I, I believe in working
to lift those fields, lift those

1038
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:42,700
energies out of the collective
psyche. And I, you know, so I

1039
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:47,200
affirm that very, very deeply.
But when I So, when I say that

1040
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:52,900
the fields themselves mean the
aggregation of that negativity

1041
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,920
is a natural phenomenon, I don't
mean it's a I don't mean to

1042
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,020
affirm it as a natural therefore
good. It's it's an aggregation

1043
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:01,980
of energy, which is

1044
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,800
Robert McDermott: natural. How
about intelligible?

1045
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:07,439
Unknown: Intelligible, okay,

1046
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:14,400
Robert McDermott: how'd you like
a job? Oh, yeah,

1047
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:20,120
Unknown: to be into somersault
from now on. Yeah. I Yeah.

1048
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:26,360
Thank you, Chris, for coming and
sharing with us. It was

1049
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:31,880
beautiful to see you speak so
freely and express everything

1050
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:35,360
you want to express and
articulate. It very well. Thank

1051
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:42,160
you. My question, my curiosity
in working with fields is comes

1052
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:48,580
with the idea of, I, I think
about the the form of an atom

1053
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:55,360
and how the electron jumps from
ring to ring with no time taken,

1054
01:19:55,420 --> 01:20:02,220
yeah, and, and with that idea as
kind of a. Model for how the

1055
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:05,400
universe is structured? Yeah, I
was curious to hear what you

1056
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:10,560
would have to say about
conscious the evolution of

1057
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,940
consciousness in a relational
field and quantum leaps in that

1058
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,360
field.

1059
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:24,500
Chris Bache: I don't know. I
mean, we know about emergence.

1060
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:30,440
We know that, you know, things
happen, things jump. We hit

1061
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,160
tipping points. We think we're
coming to a tipping point, an

1062
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:41,380
evolutionary tipping point. When
people have near death

1063
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:44,920
experiences, they go through
these exponential increases in

1064
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,040
awareness in a very short period
of time. And more than one

1065
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,560
author has suggested that the
human race is coming to a

1066
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,620
collective Near-Death
Experience, a potential jumping

1067
01:20:53,620 --> 01:21:02,760
point. If fields come to tipping
points in small groups, you

1068
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:08,700
know, in dark net, early dawn. I
suggest that we have a long way

1069
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:13,380
to go and very little time to
get there. And I suggest that

1070
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:17,280
the only way we could possibly
make it as far evolutionary wise

1071
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:23,000
as we have to go, is if we
understand field dynamics,

1072
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,260
because from field dynamics,
we're not trying to change 7

1073
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:32,360
billion minds. We're only trying
to change one mind, and the 7

1074
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,660
billion experiences are being
processed at an integral level.

1075
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:42,100
And so if we understand non
linear systems. And if we

1076
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:45,340
hypothesize that the human
collective unconscious is a

1077
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:50,140
system and it can be thrown into
non linear dynamics or far from

1078
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:53,260
equilibrium conditions, perhaps
non linear conditions can

1079
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:56,440
emerge. And Brian help me out
here. But you know, when a

1080
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,540
system goes into beyond far or
far from equilibrium conditions,

1081
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:06,780
things happen fast, and things
can jump. And I really think

1082
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:11,400
that some dynamic like that is
underlies the potential that

1083
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,920
human beings have to make a
quantum step change. It's not

1084
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:21,200
simply an aggregate of a lot of
individuals, but there is a kind

1085
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:25,520
of a deeper summation coming
forward in all those

1086
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,500
individuals. Does that

1087
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:31,220
Robert McDermott: following on
Brian again, okay, I'll let

1088
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:34,160
other people talk, but I
remember what I was thinking.

1089
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,780
Sama, your job. Yeah? Thank

1090
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:45,760
Unknown: you. I was just saying,
Sami, that it'd be really cool

1091
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:51,280
if you somersaulted, and I could
tell you didn't understand. Man,

1092
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,620
I felt so bad. I thought he
thinks I didn't like his

1093
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:59,380
somersaulting. I loved it.
That's fantastic. Good. Okay,

1094
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,980
great, great. So I actually
didn't want the microphone,

1095
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,920
yeah, but Robert does, and so
here we are,

1096
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:18,119
Robert McDermott: Jesse's all
the way back and Aaron Lydia,

1097
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:20,099
thanks.

1098
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,860
Unknown: I have a question about
working with fields. Yeah.

1099
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,019
I have two questions, but they
might have this some very

1100
01:23:30,019 --> 01:23:35,719
similar answer, okay, one is
that I could see how working

1101
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:40,039
with fields goes can be almost
applicable in kind of any

1102
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:44,859
relational situation? Yes, so
I'm I'm inquiring if you could

1103
01:23:44,859 --> 01:23:52,059
share something specific about a
practice in working with fields.

1104
01:23:52,059 --> 01:23:59,559
And I guess my second question
is about a lot of us do work in

1105
01:23:59,559 --> 01:24:03,719
relationship to being aware of
the crisis that's happening in

1106
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:09,479
the world and the level of
destruction and chaos that a lot

1107
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:16,559
of people are experiencing. And
I guess whether it's a person

1108
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:21,079
we're trying to sort through
something with or or being

1109
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:28,039
present with and wanting to be
strong and and good and and

1110
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:33,859
used, in the face of also
knowing that we're going to live

1111
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:38,959
our lives being very aware and
maybe really Close to levels of

1112
01:24:39,499 --> 01:24:46,719
destruction that are scary and
and processing and being with

1113
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:51,159
lots of fear and anger and
delusion. So do you have

1114
01:24:52,779 --> 01:24:57,099
specific practice that you'd
like to share, or does that what

1115
01:24:57,159 --> 01:25:00,959
make you think of that we
something? For us to maybe

1116
01:25:00,959 --> 01:25:01,979
digest on I

1117
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:27,560
Chris Bache: uh, compassion
practices. That's what comes to

1118
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:31,580
mind. First of all, you're
already doing what you're

1119
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:37,880
describing. You're already doing
it. You, each one of you has

1120
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:43,840
made a choice to radically
insert yourself into an

1121
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:49,720
evolutionary process to bring
about a fundamental shift and an

1122
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:54,580
improvement in the condition of
the planet. You really you have

1123
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:58,360
traveled across the country, you
have aligned yourself with a

1124
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:02,520
very, very distinctive
institution, and many of you are

1125
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:07,860
just like following pure gut
instinct somewhere that you

1126
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:13,140
can't see because it's not a
traditional track. You're

1127
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:18,420
already doing it. You're already
plugged into the dynamics that

1128
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:21,680
are building. Pressure wise,
you're already taking in massive

1129
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,100
quantities of information.
You're already watching a

1130
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:29,960
Cooking taking place. You're
already reaching for becoming

1131
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:34,220
the embodiment of the solution.
So everything you're doing,

1132
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:39,200
you're that you're talking
about, you're already doing. So

1133
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:45,040
how can you do that better, is
what you're really asking, just

1134
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:49,840
a little bit, just a little bit
better. And I think it's really

1135
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,620
important to take care of
yourself, because there's a lot

1136
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:56,080
of wear and tear and burn out,
because this is not over. This

1137
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,380
is not going to be fixed soon.
This is you're going to die and

1138
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:03,780
still be in process. Your
children will die and will still

1139
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:07,980
be in process. So it's, it's a
long it's a marathon type of

1140
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:14,460
thing. How do you keep yourself
perpetually replenished in a

1141
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:18,420
long term like that? How do you,
how do you kind of stay attuned

1142
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:21,080
to the opportunities? There's
several things that come to

1143
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:24,380
mind, but I guess the one that
comes most deeply are compassion

1144
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:27,740
practices. And every tradition
has compassion practices where

1145
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,480
whether it's exchanging self for
other, or some type of practice

1146
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:39,200
where you just voluntarily
expand your heart into deep

1147
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:45,580
beauty, into deep pain into
broad horizons, and just hold

1148
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:51,100
that and then bring it back down
again, and then take up your

1149
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:56,080
individual day's work. Every
tradition has practices like

1150
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:01,800
that, because compassion is the
is the recognition of the

1151
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,420
inherent oneness of life. And so
if we're talking about a

1152
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:11,280
revitalized contact between the
individual, the highly refined,

1153
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:16,740
highly evolved, historically
beautiful individuality, but

1154
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:21,680
reconnecting into the larger
context of the larger field of

1155
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:27,680
life, compassion is that
expression of that celebration

1156
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:34,280
of that oneness. It's
encouraging that oneness. There

1157
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:40,420
is clarity practices. If you
need clarity, there are clarity

1158
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:43,600
practices. There are all sorts
of different they're antidote

1159
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,980
practices, but compassion
practices seem to me to really

1160
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:51,760
most deeply address what you're
what you're talking about.

1161
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:54,100
Thanks.

1162
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:05,400
Unknown: Thank you so much for
this. Chris, yeah, so my

1163
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:10,320
question is about coming down
off the mountain. I was really

1164
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,680
struck by that part. And I'm
curious if you could speak a

1165
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:17,940
little bit more towards it, both
your decision. I mean, you had

1166
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:22,340
your own natural waves and
evolution in terms of your use

1167
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:26,600
with sacred medicine. And then
also, something I personally

1168
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:30,080
wrestled with was an over
attachment to marijuana. And I

1169
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,800
also felt like it was really for
many years, in a very beautiful

1170
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:38,420
way, keeping me connected to the
mountain, to the Numinous, to

1171
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:42,940
the archetypal realm. And I had
to find an am still finding my

1172
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:46,780
own relationship to it, in order
to live my truth in this world,

1173
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:50,320
in the way that I want to and
how I want to bring do my work.

1174
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,660
And it's very alive and true for
me and also for a lot of my

1175
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:59,920
friends in different
communities. Yeah. So I'm just.

1176
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,940
Curious if you could, you know,
speak a little more to that, and

1177
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,480
also something around the
intimacy with the Divine and how

1178
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,500
you feel. You said that the veil
or something shifted, slowed

1179
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,620
down or calmed down, yeah, and
I'm wondering where you are with

1180
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:18,360
that now, and why it's felt
important for you to move in

1181
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,860
that direction at this point. I

1182
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:26,540
Chris Bache: you. Thank you for
the very heartfelt question that

1183
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:31,340
you're asking. I'll do my best
to speak to the same depth from

1184
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:32,240
which it comes.

1185
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:45,879
I'm Neptune, first house square
sun in the 10th house. Addiction

1186
01:30:45,999 --> 01:30:51,279
is the shadow of Neptune, right?
And Neptune is what allows me to

1187
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,959
open up into deep fields with
kind of relatively ease. But

1188
01:30:55,959 --> 01:31:00,719
this the shadow, and it's what
gives me kind of a sensitivity

1189
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:08,279
to collective dynamics. But the
downside is, you know, there the

1190
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:13,679
shadow side of it is taking the
lower form of unity rather than

1191
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:17,999
the higher form of unity, and
that's been an issue for me,

1192
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:22,879
addiction of that not alcohol,
death, but marijuana has been an

1193
01:31:22,879 --> 01:31:26,479
issue for me, and I really had
to learn and grow it and and

1194
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:27,739
know when to let it go. I

1195
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,480
i stopped the high dose work for
two reasons, one because I was

1196
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,360
running into a lot of physical
and subtle energy system

1197
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,520
complications, and I kept
thinking that these

1198
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,520
complications would stop if I
kind of went through another

1199
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,820
enough dying experiences. And
then eventually I realized no,

1200
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:14,280
they were actually happening,
because I had gone through so

1201
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,400
many dying experiences, and they
were only going to get worse if

1202
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:22,520
I kept on plunging myself into
these huge fires. And I just, I

1203
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:26,540
had to let the system. And I was
doing a lot of purification

1204
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:29,240
practice, I was doing a lot of
yoga, I was doing a lot of

1205
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:33,860
Tibetan deity practices. So I
was really getting a lot of

1206
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:38,900
support, but I was still running
so much energy that I just, my

1207
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:42,820
body was telling me, you you
just got to let that energy calm

1208
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:48,520
down. You've got to let it
soothe out. But the main on top

1209
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:51,460
of that, there was another
reason, and so there's a

1210
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:56,200
cautionary note I'm saying, you
know, you normal. I speak deeply

1211
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,320
and positively about
psychedelics, but it's a tricky

1212
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:02,340
path, and even when you do it
really well, and I tried to do

1213
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:10,380
it really carefully and really
well, it's still tricky. And the

1214
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:16,860
main reason I stopped is because
I literally, I just could not

1215
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:25,580
take coming back anymore. The
intimacy with the divine. The

1216
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:32,180
places that I eventually learned
how to move into were so

1217
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:40,420
beautiful and so extraordinary,
and so home and so light that

1218
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:48,160
coming back was so painful. Now,
there are beings who can live in

1219
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:53,200
those places. I know they are. I
read them. You know, all honor

1220
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:58,120
to the Great mahasiddhas. I'm
not one of those beings who can

1221
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:03,420
sustain that yet, and going in
and out of that condition, and

1222
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:06,240
we're not talking about
enlightenment. This is something

1223
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,060
different. This is kind of more
like the mahasiddha, something

1224
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:13,980
that in that lineage, coming
back out of it was just becoming

1225
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:21,860
too painful. And eventually, I
asked the universe never to

1226
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:27,260
bring me back into this reality
until I wouldn't have to leave.

1227
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:32,420
I couldn't take it anymore. I
learned that it's possible to

1228
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:37,760
have too much God, and that's
not I didn't even you know, but

1229
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,820
it is. You can just take on more
than is healthy to if you're

1230
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:46,780
going to stay with your feet on
the earth, you can open yourself

1231
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:56,860
too deeply for it. When I
stopped that deep work, I went

1232
01:34:56,860 --> 01:35:00,960
into a sadness that was just
excruciating. Them, because I

1233
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,780
knew when I left, I was never in
my lifetime, I would never be

1234
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,620
able to go back into that
territory again, because it

1235
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:14,160
takes, it's like Olympic
training. You can't get I can't

1236
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:17,880
get back to it by dropping a
huge amount of acid today, I

1237
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:21,020
would take years of work to be
able to get back into this

1238
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:26,180
territory. It's a momentum
thing. I knew I was leaving this

1239
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:34,160
forever until I died. And I
believe when I die, I'm there. I

1240
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:38,840
you know, the universe would not
be so cruel to not allow me to

1241
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:47,980
go back. And if I can get to
there. It's an even deal. Coming

1242
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:52,780
back down. Marijuana allowed me
to, not to, sought to, not

1243
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:58,120
because of all this work. When I
would smoke, I would open up

1244
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,800
pretty big, none of the
intermediate kind of stuff. It

1245
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:07,860
was just like opening up to the
sun. And it was a way of not

1246
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:12,660
getting really back down with my
feet completely on the ground.

1247
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:18,960
It was just and it was a
deepening of my commitment to

1248
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:24,260
the mother, to give up this
particular because marijuana is

1249
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:27,080
a tricky thing. It's a mild
psychedelic, but it's also a

1250
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:32,300
euphoric, right? And so it gets
that little positive glow, you

1251
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:36,260
know? And if you're, if you're
receptive to it and comfortable

1252
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:43,300
with it, it's but it was keeping
me literally off the ground. It

1253
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:51,280
was keeping me just little off
and I began to realize that I

1254
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,360
couldn't finish my life's work
in that condition. That was just

1255
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,840
not good enough. I had to get
all the way down into the

1256
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:05,100
ground. I had to get all the way
down in my body. So I continue

1257
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:09,660
to do practice. I, you know, I
do Vajrayana practice, I do

1258
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:16,020
Dzogchen practice. I do my
thing, and I take teachings, and

1259
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:20,400
I sit with the beings who, you
know, can give the teachings I

1260
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:28,340
beings, but the diamond
Luminosity domain is it's not

1261
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:32,060
the same as the state of
transparency, the state of

1262
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:36,620
Shunyata. It's a different
reality. There are beings who

1263
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:43,600
can live there. I know there
are. I'm just not one of them

1264
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,400
yet. Thank you.

1265
01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:00,900
Unknown: Thanks, Chris. I have
two questions. One, I'd love to

1266
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:05,160
hear more about the human that
we're moving towards as a

1267
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:06,540
species, or as you know,

1268
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:13,020
and the diamond soul and and
also, I'm, I'm just curious

1269
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,160
about you mentioned

1270
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:19,619
the moment that you reach when
your students are no longer your

1271
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:24,139
students, and that doesn't seem
to happen here. And so I'm

1272
01:38:24,139 --> 01:38:29,839
curious what how we might relate
to that in a place where we are

1273
01:38:29,839 --> 01:38:36,739
always invited back in as
continuing the learning fields.

1274
01:38:36,739 --> 01:38:39,319
And I don't know whether we're
not closing the fields or

1275
01:38:39,319 --> 01:38:42,339
whether we're closing them in
certain ways, but leaving parts

1276
01:38:42,339 --> 01:38:45,519
open, or what? How that's
working? But, yeah,

1277
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:48,759
okay, that's an interesting
question.

1278
01:38:56,199 --> 01:39:00,239
Chris Bache: I think your own,
your your I'm okay, your full

1279
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:03,479
time faculty probably have a
better answer to them than I'm

1280
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:08,159
going to suggest, but I don't
what I'm seeing is not a failure

1281
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:11,219
to close the field. That doesn't
mean maybe we could close the

1282
01:39:11,219 --> 01:39:16,319
field better. But you know, from
what I see from a distance and

1283
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:19,979
what I've seen from Christina,
who was the program coordinator

1284
01:39:19,979 --> 01:39:22,039
for a while, and she used to
write these poems for

1285
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:25,819
graduation. Graduation is a
tremendous celebration of

1286
01:39:25,819 --> 01:39:30,379
accomplishment. And you seem to
graduate well. You seem to

1287
01:39:30,379 --> 01:39:33,979
celebrate accomplishments. Well.
You celebrate your

1288
01:39:33,979 --> 01:39:38,419
dissertations, well, and you
celebrate your master's thesis.

1289
01:39:38,419 --> 01:39:43,899
Well. It seems to me that you
you do have closure built into

1290
01:39:43,899 --> 01:39:48,459
your community. You honor your
graduates, and bringing

1291
01:39:48,459 --> 01:39:53,019
graduates back in doesn't mean
that the fields haven't been

1292
01:39:53,019 --> 01:39:56,859
well closed. Now, if there's any
fine tuning to do well, that's

1293
01:39:56,859 --> 01:40:00,659
you know, but I don't think just
having an extended Q. Community,

1294
01:40:00,839 --> 01:40:06,659
because, again, you're an
unusual community. Really, you

1295
01:40:06,659 --> 01:40:10,799
see much more than most people
see. No wonder you get lonely

1296
01:40:10,799 --> 01:40:13,679
out there. You know, there's not
too many people who see what you

1297
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:16,859
see, and they're not too many
people who are willing to put

1298
01:40:16,919 --> 01:40:19,859
their lives on the line the way
you have put your lives on the

1299
01:40:19,859 --> 01:40:23,959
line. So naturally. What would
be more natural than to have a

1300
01:40:23,959 --> 01:40:29,779
community that nourishes itself
through your various levels of

1301
01:40:29,959 --> 01:40:33,619
re entering the world? Kind of
you know, and engaging?

1302
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,020
Robert McDermott: Extremely good
answer, Chris and thanks for the

1303
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:45,820
question. Great question.

1304
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:57,820
The way, the way I tend to think
about us, us PCC, faculty and

1305
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:06,780
students and alumni, not so much
in terms of field. So it's

1306
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:14,520
helpful. It's a good concept. I
think of it much more in terms

1307
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:24,560
of individual and somewhat
temporary, karmic joining of

1308
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:36,260
will and mind and affect. And
for some people that joining has

1309
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,520
great longevity,

1310
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:44,620
and for some people it doesn't
that seems to me

1311
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:53,200
perfectly fine, that some people
really come into this community

1312
01:41:53,200 --> 01:42:02,100
with heart and mind and will In
a way that is transformative of

1313
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:08,700
for those persons and for the
community and other people are

1314
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:15,600
in more lightly and thereafter,
are held in a way that's

1315
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:21,980
proportionate to that
commitment. And so some of our

1316
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:27,500
alums, in a certain sense,
haven't left the community, no

1317
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:32,660
matter where they are. And
others, I think I want to say

1318
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:37,940
will hardly hear there is that
huge range that seems to me

1319
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:46,900
right. It's perfectly fine for
each person to be as in in many

1320
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:51,040
different ways as he or she
wishes for that time in their

1321
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:58,660
life, given their karmic task
and opportunity. And so I don't

1322
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:02,160
think of a single field. I think

1323
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:04,800
Unknown: it's a

1324
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:13,320
Robert McDermott: it's a
community of many levels, and

1325
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:18,420
some of us are trying to operate
on all the levels. Some of us

1326
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:26,960
are doing just have other
commitments, and it will be

1327
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:32,000
influential in some respect, and
not others and not all. And for

1328
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,200
some people, no, it's really
major, comprehensively

1329
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:41,440
transformative. And I think we
sort of know who we are, the way

1330
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:47,320
we talk to each other. And so
when, when Chris comes in with

1331
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:52,660
his very profound and
fascinating and to my mind, very

1332
01:43:53,140 --> 01:44:01,620
mysterious, as well as inspiring
biography, it seems to me that

1333
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:10,320
he touches very deep places in
our community psyche. But I

1334
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:16,860
don't for a moment think expect
that Chris touches all of the

1335
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:21,980
members of our community, many
of whom are working on a

1336
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:26,060
different problem and have
different different tasks,

1337
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:31,220
different opportunities, or just
blocked from something that

1338
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:39,680
Chris could give or they already
have moved on to something else.

1339
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:44,680
So I'm very impressed by the
when I think of all the reasons

1340
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:50,080
I'm impressed by PCC and I'm
very impressed by our the

1341
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:57,460
capacity of the entire community
to sustain and encourage very

1342
01:44:57,460 --> 01:45:07,620
impressive plurality. A variety
of ways of participation. And so

1343
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:13,740
for me, field is a little too
singular. Yes, it is. For who we

1344
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:18,060
are as we just look around,
we're really different from each

1345
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:23,300
other, and it's great that we
can come together as deeply and

1346
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:27,980
as creatively as we do, given
how different we are and will

1347
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:32,720
continue to be. This is not a
psychological philosophical boot

1348
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:38,060
camp. This is a place where you
come through and go out and

1349
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:42,400
something very deep or not so
deep, will have happened, and I

1350
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,480
hope you have gratitude and ways
of continuing to participate.

1351
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:53,800
But the field, I'm not even
going to use the word, the

1352
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:59,740
community, is constantly
evolving thanks to the many,

1353
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:06,180
entirely different, highly
unique individuals who come and

1354
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:15,000
and stir it up and lift it up to
new possibilities the way I

1355
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:15,720
think about it.

1356
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:24,740
At some point we probably
should, and Huh, okay, I'm not

1357
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:25,760
in charge. I was only

1358
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,280
Chris Bache: asking, how about
if I ask you answer your second

1359
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:30,860
question, because I suspect to
me, and maybe that's, maybe

1360
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:35,120
that's a good place to stop. No.
I mean, the hot tubs are waiting

1361
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:36,800
for you, not for us.

1362
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,440
Robert McDermott: Unfortunately,
I have a really low level Toby

1363
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:47,380
one day gone from I think about
Plato, who wrote the fabulous

1364
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:51,340
symposium and the Republic, and
then he had it write the laws

1365
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:56,560
three times as long as the
Republic. And so what I'm about

1366
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,860
to say has to do with law. Has
to do it. I'm glad we live in a

1367
01:47:00,340 --> 01:47:06,120
country of law, but it's also
sometimes, okay, sometimes sort

1368
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:11,580
of a low, a low, a minimal
level. So you heard the night

1369
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:15,900
that Rick said, Where, because
we're in a we're not only here

1370
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:19,320
in this culture, but we're part
of a larger legal culture,

1371
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:25,280
institutional, CIS, et cetera,
we have to observe expectations

1372
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:30,980
that institutions and our whole
legal system requires us to

1373
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:36,500
observe. And so there are three
groups here. There's faculty,

1374
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:41,200
including two adjunct faculty.
There are students and alums. We

1375
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:44,980
could make three different
suggestions, but I'd like to

1376
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:50,800
suggest that we make two faculty
time and student time. Try to

1377
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:59,380
remember this faculty time in
the lower tubs is only 815, to

1378
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:03,540
915, in the morning, and
students, therefore, and

1379
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:07,320
students and alumni are not
invited in the tubs at that

1380
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:10,800
time. On the upper tub, which
some of you perhaps don't even

1381
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:14,280
know about. It's actually a
square handicap tub. It's not

1382
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:19,980
quite as beautiful, but it's
sometimes very, very quiet, not

1383
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:25,340
always that tub. There are two
times when you can't go. One is

1384
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:31,100
the same as the other, 815, to
915 in the morning, and also 10

1385
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:36,260
to 11 at night. In other words,
right now, but if I could get

1386
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:39,560
there, shouldn't go to the upper
cup. Should go to one of the

1387
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,040
threads. But

1388
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:49,420
already there. Did you say,
Sean, yeah, I hope, I hope

1389
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:54,940
Robert doesn't change this rule.
Is it clear? And can you

1390
01:48:54,940 --> 01:49:01,380
remember? It Clear and
remembered? Thank you very much,

1391
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:04,020
because you don't want to keep
talking about it, and we and I'm

1392
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:07,440
really glad you have 23 hours,
All right? One hour.

1393
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:20,600
Unknown: Yeah, that's true.

1394
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:24,440
Robert McDermott: The others
have we've all been here 25

1395
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:27,140
years, 30 years. Don't worry,
you're here. It's a special

1396
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:31,460
thing for you. It's we want you
to have as much as possible. We

1397
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:34,460
also want to thank Chris first
to his wonderful Well, his

1398
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:38,420
wonderful work, his inspiring,
deep, profound, transformative

1399
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:44,620
work, his wonderful writings.
And for this extra conversation,

1400
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:49,480
which I thought was even more
disclosing. So we do thank you

1401
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,080
and applaud you.

1402
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:10,200
Chris Bache: You are wonderful.
Really, I can't tell you how

1403
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:14,280
wonderful it is when I get to
come here and spend time with

1404
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:18,360
you and to mix it up with you,
and to listen to what you have

1405
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:22,520
to say and what you do. Really,
you're just an extraordinary

1406
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:27,020
group of people. My heart is
really deeply touched

1407
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:35,000
Unknown: about the question,
okay, this has been something,

1408
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,080
it's it's been a

1409
01:50:37,819 --> 01:50:40,419
Chris Bache: reoccurring and
deepening theme of my

1410
01:50:40,419 --> 01:50:46,479
psychedelic work went on for
many, many years, and a big hunk

1411
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:51,519
of it was, I put it down in the
chapter in the in dark night,

1412
01:50:51,519 --> 01:50:55,779
early dawn on the Great
Awakening chapter. But it kept

1413
01:50:55,779 --> 01:51:05,039
on going after that and the in
the last three sessions of the C

1414
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:08,639
I didn't know it was ending, but
it was about to end. The

1415
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:15,119
universe gave me three last
installments, three last pieces,

1416
01:51:15,959 --> 01:51:24,379
and one of them was the capstone
of a series of installments

1417
01:51:24,379 --> 01:51:31,099
around the evolutionary project
and the future human. And it'll

1418
01:51:31,099 --> 01:51:38,239
be in, you know, this book, and
maybe I'll make this particular

1419
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:44,979
session available to the the PCC
group, and I'll give it to Rick

1420
01:51:45,099 --> 01:51:54,399
or Robert and let it go out. It
was the most Absolutely,

1421
01:51:54,399 --> 01:52:01,859
profoundly disorienting death
dismember not just reality

1422
01:52:01,859 --> 01:52:06,479
ripped apart. I mean, really, 70
sessions in, you wouldn't think

1423
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:09,179
that you could go through
something like this. I mean, you

1424
01:52:09,179 --> 01:52:13,499
would think it would be used up,
you know. But it was just an

1425
01:52:13,559 --> 01:52:19,439
absolute ripped down, total
shattering of reality. In order

1426
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:25,999
to give me one last piece in
order to finish this installment

1427
01:52:25,999 --> 01:52:32,539
on what's coming forward. And
this is something that's taking

1428
01:52:32,539 --> 01:52:36,439
place at the at the deep level
of the collective psyche. This.

1429
01:52:36,499 --> 01:52:40,539
This is, you know, we all live
our lives, and we die and

1430
01:52:40,539 --> 01:52:44,079
reborn. We die and reborn, and
we do it within a certain

1431
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:49,659
cradle, and that cradle is the
archetype of the human species

1432
01:52:49,659 --> 01:52:54,099
that we are at this point in
history. And what's happening is

1433
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:58,839
that cradle is about to shift.
The fundamental under lying

1434
01:52:58,839 --> 01:53:04,019
structure of the human psyche is
about to shift, and so the

1435
01:53:04,019 --> 01:53:08,819
entire baseline of what we're
dying and being reborn into is

1436
01:53:08,879 --> 01:53:10,019
about to change. You.

1437
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:29,960
When we make this transition,
and we will all be there in some

1438
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:33,680
way, shape or form, we will we
will feel it will be part of it.

1439
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:37,640
It's going to be multiple
generations, but we will all be

1440
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:43,120
part of it. And when it happens,
and as it happens, and as this

1441
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:51,460
exquisite creature comes out of
our historical womb and walks

1442
01:53:51,460 --> 01:54:02,160
the earth, we will look back on
all the pain from Homo erectus,

1443
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,460
all the terrible suffering, all
the things we've done to each

1444
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:09,900
other, all the horrendous things
we've done to each other, all

1445
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:13,920
the loneliness and all the
terrible things, we will look

1446
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:21,080
back on it and say, it was worth
it. It was worth it, because

1447
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:26,240
this being is the most
exquisite, beautiful being.

1448
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:33,260
Picture humanity with its heart
completely healed of all the

1449
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:40,840
wars and of all the rapes and of
all the just completely whole

1450
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:53,140
again in a new way. Picture the
mind just radiantly strong, not

1451
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:59,380
fragmented, not torn apart and
no conflict within the psyche.

1452
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:01,500
No. Push, pull, chest,

1453
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:17,280
completely transparent on the
earth of the earth green to its

1454
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,180
roots, and yet at the same time,

1455
01:55:30,859 --> 01:55:34,999
in easy communion with the
surrounding intelligence of the

1456
01:55:34,999 --> 01:55:45,579
universe. Heaven on Earth, for
such a species as this. It was

1457
01:55:45,579 --> 01:55:49,959
one of the greatest blessings of
all the work, just to be able to

1458
01:55:49,959 --> 01:55:54,399
see what history is making, what
is in the process of emerging

1459
01:55:55,299 --> 01:55:59,559
and and the sessions told me you
have to start writing more about

1460
01:55:59,559 --> 01:56:03,419
the future human, because when
it's it gets dark, and we're

1461
01:56:03,419 --> 01:56:06,899
going into the darkness. If you
don't have a vision of what's

1462
01:56:06,899 --> 01:56:10,319
coming, if you don't understand
what's being birthed by the pain

1463
01:56:10,559 --> 01:56:13,439
it's you're going to get lost in
the pain. The humans will get

1464
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:19,379
lost, and it'll but if you have
a vision again, and you all

1465
01:56:19,379 --> 01:56:23,239
know, you all have the intuition
you were you had it before you

1466
01:56:23,239 --> 01:56:29,419
were born. You took it into this
incarnation. You feel it, and

1467
01:56:29,419 --> 01:56:32,539
it's important to hold on to
that. It's important to really,

1468
01:56:32,539 --> 01:56:35,899
really deeply in your bones,
know that everything that you're

1469
01:56:35,899 --> 01:56:40,719
investing in, you are working
with the universe to bring this

1470
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:45,879
forward, and it will come
forward. It's taking us right up

1471
01:56:45,879 --> 01:56:52,599
to the edge of extinction.
Really, the old has to die in

1472
01:56:52,599 --> 01:56:58,599
order to give birth to this
magnificent creature. This is,

1473
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:05,759
this is a, you know, a species
of Buddhas, a species of Christ,

1474
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:12,839
a species of Prophets. This is
when the feminine is completely

1475
01:57:13,559 --> 01:57:18,839
healed and reconciled with the
masculine, giving complete

1476
01:57:18,839 --> 01:57:26,419
unprecedented access to the
blessings of cosmic

1477
01:57:26,419 --> 01:57:34,039
intelligence, and it is
absolutely embodied. No up and

1478
01:57:34,039 --> 01:57:40,599
out cosmology, no escapist
theologies anymore, and no

1479
01:57:40,599 --> 01:57:46,779
Bardo. The Bardo is in the
process of emptying itself. In

1480
01:57:46,779 --> 01:57:50,319
this process, the Bardo is a
fragment of is a condition of a

1481
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:54,159
temporary condition in the
evolutionary saga. We are in the

1482
01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:57,519
process, by becoming more
integrated. We are in the

1483
01:57:57,519 --> 01:58:02,579
process of emptying the Bardo.
This species will not need that

1484
01:58:02,579 --> 01:58:10,079
type of buffer. This is what
we're working this is one

1485
01:58:10,079 --> 01:58:17,759
person's poor grasp at what we
are working for. But I think we

1486
01:58:17,879 --> 01:58:22,339
all feel it. We know it. I mean,
this is not this is just a piece

1487
01:58:22,339 --> 01:58:28,099
of one person seeing something.
What it is is much bigger than

1488
01:58:28,099 --> 01:58:33,799
any one person can see. Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.

1489
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:40,060
Unknown: I.

1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:19,752
Chris Bache: You. Well, hello,
Richard. It's good to continue

2
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:24,560
our discussion. You know, in our
previous discussion, we sort of

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,620
started the discussion of
reincarnation. We looked at the

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,560
evidence for reincarnation,
these extraordinary children

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,640
from around the world. We began
to unpack that evidence into a

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,660
deeper understanding of the
rhythms of life and the stages

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,760
of human evolution that
reincarnation makes possible the

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,140
restoration of the theme of the
meaningfulness of the challenges

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,860
that we find embedded in our
life, and the opportunity to

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,720
actually deepen our therapeutic
interventions in the places

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,260
where we are stuck, the places
where we're Holding pain that

12
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,100
are rooted in our deeper
history. So now, today, we take

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,180
it farther. We begin to look
deeper into the significance of

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,300
what are we? What's the
significance of the fact that we

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,520
are reincarnating beings in a
universe that obviously supports

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,760
and nurtures and created this
reincarnation dynamic.

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,020
Richard Rudd: That's a huge
difference, isn't it like to to

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,340
be in a to be in a living in a
universe that is nurturing us,

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,660
you know, that has a kind of
paternal maternal energy, you

20
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,660
know, surrounding it, that has
such a different, such a

21
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,640
different framework to be born
into

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,240
Chris Bache: Yeah, yes. And, you
know, I want to mention at the

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,380
outset that sometimes
reincarnation thinkers go in a

24
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,220
direction of of thinking that
every little bitty thing in our

25
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,180
life has a determined quality, a
deterministic quality. But I

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,460
don't think we necessarily need
to go there, because chance is

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,320
one of the powerful elements of
this universe. And so we can

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,400
affirm meaning, and we can
affirm intentionality without

29
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,260
putting every detail of our life
into that press and ask, well,

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,080
what's the meaning of this and
what's the meaning of that? To

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,140
affirm a larger scope of
meaning. Still, in a world where

32
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,780
there are chance and there are
variables and there are

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,220
uncertainties, what's important,
I think, is understanding that

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,060
the universe pays attention to
how we respond to chance events

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,260
as well as intentional events,
that our learning and the

36
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,380
quality of our response is
carried forward, and does this

37
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,520
credit, regardless of the origin
of the challenges that we're

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,060
facing.

39
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,000
Richard Rudd: Yeah, absolutely,
I just, funnily enough, today,

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,500
recorded a short meditation and
and in it, I I asked people to

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,700
kind of imagine the universe
with its with it, with

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,360
crisscrossed by its fields of
karma, you know, of like, you

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,600
know this, like, almost these,
these ley lines through time and

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,640
space that kind of have this
karmic energy. They're rippling.

45
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,360
And the whole of the cosmos is
rippling with these fields. And

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,300
then I asked each person, well,
whoever's meditating to send out

47
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,680
one really beautiful thought,
like just just from the depth of

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,000
their souls, send out a really
beautiful thought into that, and

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,280
see the universe respond to
that, and see how it enters the

50
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,620
field, and how the universe
maybe kind of sighs and expands

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,760
and, and how it reaches every
single tiny area and almost like

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,860
it opens up synapses, yes, in
some way, and, and just the the

53
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,920
power of the incalculable power
of something like that, you

54
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,800
know, dropped into the into the
ocean of, you know, time, space,

55
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,760
yeah, and, and, you know, I
found that, like a really

56
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,520
powerful contemplation to do,

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,540
Chris Bache: yeah, absolutely. I
agree that's been very much my

58
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,360
experience in my own work with
psychedelics, that there were,

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,900
there was nothing that I did
working at deep levels that was

60
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,640
mine alone, that was private,
and that the pain came from a

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,600
larger collective web, and the
healing spread out into a larger

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,400
collective web. And that really,
those exercises, the meditations

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,580
that you're describing, I think,
really are important for

64
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,360
changing the sort of a tilt and
how we live in the universe,

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,280
because according to just our
physical senses, we have this

66
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,240
feeling often that life happens
to us. Life is something

67
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,600
independent to of us, and then
it just happens to us, and then

68
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,740
we're victims of it, and we
respond. But when you begin to

69
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,700
send out energy into the
universe, when you begin to send

70
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,564
out healing and love into the
universe. You watch the universe

71
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:06,244
respond in immediate and then
indirect ways. Then you begin to

72
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:10,324
shift into the sense that you
are living in a dynamic field.

73
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:14,224
You are part of a dynamic field,
living in a field and at a very

74
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:18,484
deep level, on the subtle level,
you are creating your universe

75
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:25,400
as you go once you begin to
understand that still it doesn't

76
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,980
mean you're free of all the
karma that's coming at you from

77
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,520
the past. It's still working its
way through the system, but

78
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,140
increasingly, the balance of
your life tilts from being kind

79
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,200
of the passive recipient of
things that you personally

80
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,280
didn't start to being the
generator of the life that you

81
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,420
are inheriting now.

82
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,600
Richard Rudd: Yeah, you're no
longer a victim. You're, you're,

83
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:53,500
you're a creator. Yeah, yes, we
got this great question. We

84
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,120
thought we kind of inject into
this talk, which is what happens

85
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,840
to us when we die. So shall we?
Let's explore that. I mean, you

86
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,020
know, other, many other cultures
we, I think we wanted to mention

87
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,560
the Tibetans, because they seem
to really have a handle on some

88
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,800
of these things, Egyptians as
well. But you know, Tibetans

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,740
perhaps a little bit more
contemporary, because they're

90
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,680
still here, practicing very much
those, those teachings, the

91
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,540
Bardo teachings and

92
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,580
Chris Bache: psychotherapists
are now exploring this

93
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,080
territory. Joel whittens first
book, Life between life explored

94
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,220
this and Michael Newton's work.
In his books, journey of souls

95
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,020
and destiny of souls are very
systematic attempts to explore

96
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,160
through deep states of
regression, of spiritual

97
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,100
regression, what happens to
people when they go through the

98
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,240
death process? So really, we've
got two halves of life. We've

99
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,040
got birth to death, and then
we've got birth a death to birth

100
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,120
and missing this side. But
really, you have to understand

101
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,460
the whole circle to really
understand what happens. So,

102
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,560
yeah, let's jump into it. Yeah.

103
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Richard Rudd: So obviously, the,
you know, the Tibetans, have

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,040
coined this phrase, the Bardo.
The Bardo, which is this in

105
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,900
between state or but it can also
be used to describe a

106
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,740
transformational experience, you
know, because that's life is

107
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,360
filled with transformational
experiences, but particularly

108
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,260
when you're moving through a
threshold, across a threshold,

109
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,760
you know, like death or birth,
are classic thresholds and and

110
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,200
they sit there as kind of almost
an allegory of all

111
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,160
transformation, don't they?
Death and birth? So, you know,

112
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,180
because we have so many deaths
and births even within one

113
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,840
lifetime. So it seems like a
kind of obvious logic to expand

114
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,860
that allegory out beyond
individual births, and you know,

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,580
and and and see it everywhere,
throughout the entire cosmos.

116
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,080
And I know you've experienced
this very profoundly in your in

117
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,620
your psychedelic journeys, like
this constant you've described,

118
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,060
like those constant states of
transformation that, or you've

119
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,980
been through them in those, I
mean, you know what? I'm this

120
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,420
constant rebirth.

121
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,560
Chris Bache: Yeah, the yes. I
mean, when I started the work, I

122
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,880
thought there was just one
death, ego death, that would

123
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,580
then launch you into the
spiritual universe. But what I

124
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,180
found is, course, the spiritual
universe has many, many layers

125
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,660
to it, and just because you're
operational at certain layers

126
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,420
doesn't mean you're operational
yet at deeper layers, and you

127
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,360
actually have to go through
another metamorphosis of death

128
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,100
and surrender to be reborn into
that another layer, and so on

129
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,480
and so forth. And that reflects
the Tibetan idea of Bardo. Bardo

130
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,740
really means a discrete layer of
consciousness, and so when

131
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,800
they're describing the after
death journey, there are

132
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,880
multiple Bardos that manifest
themselves. Now we in the West

133
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,280
have tended to use the term
Bardo to expand on that, and

134
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,880
basically let the Bardo
represent the sum total of all

135
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,240
things that happen to us when we
die on the other side. And

136
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,980
that's a perfectly acceptable
use of the term, but their use

137
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,880
of it is in terms of stages of
that progression. So there's one

138
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,960
Bardo you pass through. Another
Bardo you pass through. There's

139
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,020
the Bardo of the hungry ghost to
the Bardo, the heavenly spirits

140
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,260
and things like this. But the
basic pattern, I think, that

141
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,200
they identified is the same
pattern that the

142
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,060
psychotherapists are identifying
too, that when we die, we go

143
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,080
through a period of reunion with
our soul, with our and our soul

144
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,740
lineage, and the first thing
that takes place is that we

145
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,740
debrief from our most recent
life. We basically process the

146
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,560
life that we just lived in the
context of absolute love, and a

147
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,420
love so deep is not even a
matter of forgiveness, but. We

148
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,100
experience the totality of our
life, all of our shortcomings,

149
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,960
all of our good deeds, in the
context of infinite love, and we

150
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,800
have the opportunity to look at
our life and see what we did

151
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,260
well and see what we didn't do
well.

152
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,600
Richard Rudd: And we had the
whole notion, don't we have,

153
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,420
like the life flashing before
you as you die, like this kind

154
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,940
of replay in tight in the
timeless dimension. No, because

155
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,260
there's so it makes perfect
sense, like for us to go through

156
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,440
that deep reflection at the end
of something, and it's what we

157
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,500
do in life, right? Yeah. So,
yeah,

158
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,040
Chris Bache: I think the
Near-Death Experience of the

159
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,980
life review is a snapshot of
what happens, kind of in a full

160
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,140
death experience of just a
detailed reliving of every

161
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,160
detail, every nuance, far more
details than we can keep track

162
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,100
of inside time and space, and we
See how our life rippled out and

163
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,060
touched other people. We
experience how our evil deeds

164
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,320
hurt and how our good deeds
helped. And so we experience the

165
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,560
totality of our life in the
seamless fabric,

166
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,979
Richard Rudd: and we experience
them without a physical body. So

167
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:20,479
we experience them in a subtle
body, which is much more

168
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:24,499
intense, yeah, like the astral
body, or, as it's so called, or

169
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,799
the mental body, the subtle
layers, the causal body, you

170
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,779
know, the without the
physicality, the intensity of

171
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:39,259
those emotions that we probably
feel, or we review, yeah, have

172
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,819
given rise to this notion of,
like, eternal damnation from,

173
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,319
you know, the Christians, for
example, or or even, like the

174
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:51,939
eternal bliss realms of the
Buddhas, Buddhists, or heaven

175
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:56,859
and hell. And, you know, because
there's this sense of eternity,

176
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:59,979
I think it's a correct
intuition. You know that,

177
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:02,699
because when there's no time
when that when you're out of

178
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:06,719
time and space, in that sense,
you're in that place of grace,

179
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:13,379
then then an experience of, you
know, of the harm you've caused,

180
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,799
or the hurt you've caused, could
feel like it, you know, in that

181
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,619
moment, in that timeless space,
could feel like it's infinite.

182
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:23,419
You know, I've caused, like, an
intense pain, and then seeing

183
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,319
the ripple of that pain into a
life, and how it, how it carries

184
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:31,099
on through that being, yeah, and
then finally gets worked out. I

185
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:35,299
mean, I don't know what level we
experience, but I imagine we

186
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:39,679
experience a lot of the of the
subtler dimensions of our

187
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:46,539
karmic, you know the passions of
our karma, but pretty, very

188
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:47,319
intense,

189
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,220
Chris Bache: yeah. But then what
locks in this experience, this

190
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,780
phenomenology of eternity, what
locks it in as a metaphysical

191
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,540
principle, is the mistaken view
that we only live once, so we've

192
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,960
had our chance, and there's
absolutely no chance to correct

193
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,680
it. So if you're going to be
accountable, and if you're going

194
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,900
to, you know, be accountable to
good and you've screwed up, then

195
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,780
you're punished forever and ever
and ever and of course,

196
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,500
fortunately, no one finds that
when they actually get into the

197
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,000
the deep, the depth of it, the
past life therapists don't find

198
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,840
that. The Buddhists don't find
that that we do, we are

199
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,500
accountable, we are responsible.
We do experience the pain we

200
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,640
cause others, but that's so that
we can learn, and that's so that

201
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,180
we can come back and do better
next time and better next time

202
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,740
and grow and grow. Yeah.

203
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,700
Richard Rudd: I mean, I'm from a
lineage of of of distillers in

204
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,840
my family, and so I like the,
you know, I look at it

205
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,100
intuitive. This is my intuitive
reading of, perhaps, you know, a

206
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,460
colorful way of maybe what, how
this happens is that there's a,

207
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,060
there's a distilling process and
in and in that or a fermentation

208
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,360
of some form, so that the
grosser matter starts to fall

209
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,320
down back to Earth in a way like
this. Is the notion of having

210
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,800
these subtle bodies, where the
lower bodies, the astral, you

211
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,940
know, those lower en energies
that we've created, fall back

212
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,900
into the lower planes, and then
something higher gets

213
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,220
crystallized, the distillation
of our life. All that was good

214
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,520
about it, all that we've
learned, is being distilled into

215
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:35,360
this pure, kind of Quintessence
that then stays as a and adds to

216
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,960
us, our soul's trajectory. But
then, but then the lower, all

217
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,560
that kind of elemental energy
that sinks back into those lower

218
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,480
planes of being. They, they also
carry our karma, you know. So

219
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,320
those, those droplets, if you
like, of karma, sink back down

220
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,920
and they, they, you know, we
still have to redress them, you

221
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,620
know, although they, they, my
understanding is that they move

222
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,260
into the. Collective field as
well. So every act that we or

223
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,000
every word we speak, let's say,
or every thought we have, goes

224
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,620
into the collective so the you
know, it's we are all co

225
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,300
creating the the karma of
humanity, the collective karma

226
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,300
of humanity. Yeah. And then we
have to return to, to pick up

227
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,640
where we left off. But we have
this enhanced soul, you know,

228
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,320
this, this, this, you know, that
we've learned from. So when we

229
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,700
return, there's more awareness
present. So there is this

230
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,760
continuity, you know, and and
and we and we know, the other

231
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,180
way I see it is that there's,
you know, our lives are

232
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,900
trajectories. They're like arcs
that I see there's an arc, it's

233
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,020
like an arc. It's curving. It's
always moving, if you looked at

234
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,900
it. But it might be a spiral, or
it might have one of these

235
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:02,220
Kundalini shapes underneath it,
not a straight line, and that,

236
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,420
that is what we that's what
never ends that arc. We follow

237
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,020
that arc, and it goes through
this portal and it continues.

238
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,040
And that's the lineage, that is
what if you're able to trace

239
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,900
that arc in your inner being,
then you can trace your lineage,

240
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,560
where you've come from and where
you're going, and your memory

241
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,280
can travel down that arc. Your
awareness can travel down that

242
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,480
arc, which enables you to
remember or to predict, in the

243
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,620
case of Tibetans, you know, to
predict where you'll return.

244
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,120
Yeah, because, because the
awareness is aware of the of the

245
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,440
arc, not just in its own life.
Because if you, if you look at

246
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,880
an arc like in within one life,
it may do that. But then if you

247
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,600
can see it, if you can project
it beyond this life, you can

248
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,100
then you know, your awareness
can predict intuitively where

249
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,360
you're coming back. Can even,
maybe even further than predict.

250
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,340
Maybe you can even create, you
know, where you would are going

251
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,180
to return in some respect. So
anyway, that's those are ideas.

252
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,320
Chris Bache: Yeah, you know,
I've never been very interested

253
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,580
in tracing my genealogy, but I
have been interested in tracing

254
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,360
the genealogy of my soul, yeah,
which is what you're describing,

255
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,860
just reaching back, and
basically what you might think

256
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,460
of as deep remembering,
remembering who you are, who you

257
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,060
have been and there. And when
you do that, you do have a

258
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,560
certain sense of trajectory, of
kind of developmental process.

259
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,620
And you're pointing to the
collective, I think, is

260
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,440
absolutely right. What we're
what we're learning is the

261
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,780
individual and the collective
are evolving together. They are

262
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,200
functionally separate systems,
but they are deeply intertwined.

263
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,360
So everything we are doing as an
individual seeds the growth of

264
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,540
the collective, and everything
the collective is doing seeds

265
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,200
the growth of the individual, so
that when I leave, I really do

266
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,820
believe that when I leave space
time when I die, and even if I

267
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,060
were to leave the entire system
altogether, all of my

268
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,720
experiences, all of your
experiences, will be held in

269
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,480
perfect and perfect, I won't say
duplication, because we are

270
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,080
human beings, and everything we
experience, the human species

271
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,880
gets to hold on to, and
therefore our life experience

272
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,300
becomes part of its life
experience. Our love and

273
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,900
understanding becomes part of
its love and understanding, and

274
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,200
it is part of its generative
matrix, out of which it gives

275
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,920
birth to the next generation of
human beings. So it's a it's a

276
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,360
both hand situation

277
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,840
Richard Rudd: here. It's
beautiful, like the notion of

278
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,160
the Akashic field that is just
the red that is constantly

279
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,680
remembering and growing. I love
that idea, yeah. And you know

280
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,240
that the another idea I really
like is the notion that comes

281
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,660
from the Tibetans as well, this
notion they call Tarma, yeah,

282
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,660
which my interpretation of it is
a word I might use is

283
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:12,180
transmission. It means treasure.
And term are like teachings in a

284
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:19,680
way or wisdom, teachings that
are kind of waiting for specific

285
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,520
teachers in time and space. And
the story that is through the

286
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,180
Tibetans is that they would a
lot of the tama would were that

287
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,940
their lineage Tama were dropped
by their great teacher,

288
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,540
Padmasambhava, who was the
second Buddha. And he kind of

289
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,680
emanated these Tamas into the
future. And like dropping them

290
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,300
like, kind of a bit like depth
charges, you know, at different

291
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,900
levels of depths of time, and
that they would go off at

292
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,520
certain points where, where,
where further emanations or

293
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,240
disciples of his or teachers, or
really, they're kind of aspects

294
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,320
of his greater consciousness, or
of that being, that lineage, you

295
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,340
could say. But. So to say. And
then they would pick up, and

296
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,760
they would, they would go off
and be, be discovered at certain

297
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,860
times, in certain places and
periods. And this was a great, a

298
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,760
big under it was a big shift in
my understanding when I really

299
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,540
understood about these tema
because that's sort of what

300
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,860
happened to me. I had this kind
of opening up, that was just

301
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,540
hanging there in time and space,
and then this wisdom memory came

302
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,140
rushing through me, and then I
had to spend the rest of my

303
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,740
life, and I still am figuring
out what I'd received and and

304
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,800
living according to it. And I
think that's an, it's I

305
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,320
mentioned it not just because
it's part of my my story, but

306
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,340
because it's a, it's a lovely
little sort of idea of how, how

307
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,440
subtle and rich are the layers
that that survive time and

308
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,680
space, that kind of, you know
that. And it brings us, perhaps,

309
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,300
to that notion of involution
that we that we've been thinking

310
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,940
about, yeah, which maybe we
could dive into that. But what

311
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,680
is involution? Chris, tell us?

312
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,540
Chris Bache: Well, first of all,
I want to, I want to stop for a

313
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,280
moment, and first to celebrate
your receiving of the terma, of

314
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,940
the gene keys. You didn't make
those. You receive those, and

315
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,960
you unpack them. You take your
responsibility for your half,

316
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,680
but you only have half. The
other half is like the seed that

317
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,660
comes from above. And once you
understand that reincarnation is

318
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,380
a cycle that has a bottom half,
an incarnational half, and a top

319
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,980
half, and just as there are a
community of beings in the

320
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,120
bottom half of the cycle,
there's also a community of

321
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,300
beings in the top half that
there's layers and layers and

322
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,840
layers of spiritual beings. It's
not just reincarnating human

323
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,260
beings, but there's angelic
presences and enlightened

324
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,220
beings, presences and all sorts
of beings who are here to help

325
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,720
us gestate in our gestational
cycle. And so just as there are

326
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,820
human beings above to help us.
There are the teachings above to

327
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,160
help and infuse our teaching so
that there are these gems of

328
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,800
ideas, gems of empowerment, that
and so once we have the

329
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,840
understanding that a human being
who becomes aware of the

330
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,820
dynamics of reincarnation, aware
of the deep evolutionary

331
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,360
trajectory of the soul and soul
communities, the way the

332
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,700
Tibetans have. Then they
naturally begin to track their

333
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,540
great beings through time, and
they track the great teachings

334
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,980
through time, and they become
sensitive to these diamonds

335
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,380
dropping in to our minds. It's
specific. And the deep, the

336
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:53,020
deep, significant patterns to
this process. So for me, in

337
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,520
addition to the detail of the of
these ideas, of that there are

338
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,620
term as teachings, and that
there are tulkus, you know,

339
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,940
read, self consciously
reincarnating beings. The deeper

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,680
fabric is to understand, begin
to understand the depth and the

341
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,780
grandeur at which reincarnation
is operating. It's not simply a

342
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,440
matter of who we were in the
17th century, and it's really a

343
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,560
matter of it changes the
parameters of our dialog with

344
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,100
the universe, and therefore it
changes our sense of what we

345
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,200
are, because we are a being that
travels through time. We are a

346
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,040
being that has absorbed has been
in the spiritual world many

347
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,820
times, and we are incarnating
more and more of these diamond

348
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,880
teachings into our body, into
our heart, into our mind. And

349
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,200
that opens up the that opens up
the playing field of human

350
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,120
experience. I think it just
opens up and, you know, we I

351
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,800
teach at a university where the
religion of secular

352
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,000
enlightenment is that the
universe appeared by chance.

353
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,360
It's been driven by random
mutation. There's no meaning to

354
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,780
your life. It's all accidental.
And when you die, you're dead.

355
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,540
That's it. When your brain
stops, you're dead. And that

356
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,920
just completely it just is such
a crushing philosophy. But this

357
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,700
which starts on an empirical
basis but then expands through a

358
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,520
deeper appreciation of the
dynamics of spiritual

359
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,980
traditions. It restores meaning
back to our lives. It allows us

360
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,900
to play in a meaningful
landscape of engaging the wisdom

361
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,120
of our life with the wisdom of
the universe entering. And the

362
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,640
involution is that downward flow
of meaning and purpose and

363
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,920
beauty and truth into our life.
And then evolution is our taking

364
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,000
it and seeding it and growing it
as best we can into the

365
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,620
circumstances of our life.

366
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,940
Richard Rudd: We. Yeah,
beautiful. I mean, I sometimes

367
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,580
look at evolution as the future
burrowing into the past, and

368
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,140
evolution as the past spiraling
towards the future like so

369
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,100
you've got these two forces, but
you might also look at it as you

370
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,480
know, like Aurobindo. You know
who I know. You also love Sri

371
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,880
Aurobindo, amazing kind of mind,
and how he, you know, he

372
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:32,420
describes involution as as
seeds, kind of sown deep within

373
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,740
matter. So within matter, the
spirit is there asleep, like,

374
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,300
take a rock, like a piece of
lump of granite, or a volcano or

375
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,920
a mountain, you know, inside
that mountain is, is a sleeping

376
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,780
kind of consciousness of such
beauty. But it's, it's just

377
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,720
waiting. It's waiting for its
time, you know. And everything,

378
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,240
like a plant, has it, and you
can see a little bit more of it

379
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,700
in a plant, and in a bird, you
can see it more clearly, like

380
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,080
it's, it's taking animation. And
then a mammal, it's like even

381
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,200
more, because it looks at you in
the eyes, and it has, even some

382
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,480
of them have, you know, have
that emotional flavor that

383
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,320
humans have, like dogs and
horses. And then in the human

384
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,560
it's, it's much more like
obvious, because you can, you

385
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,880
know, we can do this. So the
spirit is, you know, there's

386
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,500
that notion that it's in like,
like this, the this, the gems

387
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,640
that you speak of, like
everything is a gem in matter.

388
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,000
Every tiny atom contains the
seed of a spiritual truth, yeah,

389
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,540
and it's just everything is
waiting its time. Everything is

390
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,420
on this evolutionary ladder and
and where evolution meets,

391
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:45,940
evolution is kind of the eternal
Now, yes, just constantly, as

392
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:51,700
you said, constantly creating
and just recreating itself, and

393
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,180
also from the notion of
involution and evolution, you

394
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,440
can, you can solve at some way.
I don't know if that's the right

395
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,540
word, but you can, you can
penetrate the the old chestnut

396
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,900
of free will and determinism.
Because if you look at it from

397
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,860
the involution perspective, you
might say, well, it's all

398
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,500
predetermined, because it's all
just sitting there waiting for

399
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,040
its moment to come alive. But
from the view of evolution,

400
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,400
nothing is predetermined.
Everything is like being created

401
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,220
on you know, from this view. So
the two of them together, like a

402
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,500
funnel meeting, are like this.
That's the paradox for me, of

403
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,360
you know, that's divine science
that Aurobindo, by the way,

404
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,140
just, you know, really nailed. I
mean, if, if you're able to read

405
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:45,580
him, which, which, not the
challenges. Like the layers of

406
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:51,160
subtle nuance in that man's mind
stream in terms of how he

407
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,660
penetrated this information is
extraordinary. Yes, I know he's

408
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,740
inspired both of us.

409
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,980
Chris Bache: And yes he has, yes
he has, yeah, and I think you're

410
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,200
right. I think in some ways,
it's our everyday experience

411
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
that there are aspects of our
life which are highly

412
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,380
conditioned, and it's our
everyday experience that we are

413
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,220
not completely subservient to
those conditions. We have a

414
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,100
cubic centimeter of free will,
which we can expand into a cubic

415
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,700
meter of free will. We choose
how we choose to meet the

416
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,200
circumstances of our life,
whether we incubate choice,

417
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,600
incubate a space where we look
at the options and really

418
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,780
examine deeply what we want to
do, what we want to be and enact

419
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,160
out of that choice, and that's
something we can expand on. I

420
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,920
mean, that's that's how I sort
of see what you're doing in gene

421
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,420
T's and correct me if I'm wrong,
you're helping people make more

422
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,920
informed choices by giving them
an opportunity to sit deeply

423
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,560
with the core, the karmic core,
the swirl of their being. So

424
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:08,460
they make choices on how to
engage and define the outcome of

425
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,000
that

426
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,780
Richard Rudd: exactly because
you have in jinkies is very

427
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,260
simple, actually, because you
have these three layers that,

428
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,220
you know, Shadow gift and city
and city is, that is the is the

429
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,040
involving seed, you know, or the
way I describe it often actually

430
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:30,020
is, it's the shadow is the seed,
the gift is in the center, is

431
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,580
the fruit, is the is the flower,
and then the city is the fruit,

432
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,020
and the fruit also contains the
seed. Yeah, so there's this

433
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,360
whole process of awakening
inside us, where the shadow

434
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,320
suddenly you know our what we
learn from our karma, what we

435
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,700
learn from our mistakes, what we
learn from our challenges,

436
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,400
becomes this incredible treasure
that you know, and as we unlock

437
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,400
it and forgive ourselves and
you. Learn and evolve. Then, you

438
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,820
know, we begin to, we begin to
kind of access those heightened

439
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,960
states of consciousness. They're
actually buried in the in those

440
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,280
very dense places in creation.
And that's our role as humans,

441
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,960
to kind of find those dense
places and be an intermediary to

442
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,800
help unlock them, you know, so
that you know that's an

443
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,360
incredible responsibility.

444
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,460
Chris Bache: Yeah, my sense is,
over the course of long time,

445
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:35,060
the shadow the shadow seeds
become less. They get

446
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,780
evaporated, yeah, in the process
of reflective awareness and so

447
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,220
the creative seeds become more
and the opportunity to become

448
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,680
increasingly transparent to the
intelligence of the universe

449
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,820
increase. And if we extrapolate
that, if that's true, not only

450
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,120
for us individually, but
collectively, I mean, and

451
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,760
clearly the human race has a
long way to go before it makes

452
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,720
all of its shadow seeds, because
it seems like we have so many

453
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,440
shadow seeds that are driving us
now. But if we just step back

454
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,200
and give the benefit of the
doubt and assume that what

455
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,400
happens for the individual,
which we've seen, can happen for

456
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,800
the collective, and that
humanity as a whole is in the

457
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,640
process through these
magnificent, deep collective

458
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,400
dynamics of cooking its past
seeds and transcending its the

459
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,960
limitations of its past and
moving forward in time, then we

460
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,560
have reasons to hope that What
the greatness of beings that we

461
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:47,740
see in tulkus into intimate
dialog with Termas is something

462
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,600
that all of humanity is aspiring
to, and all of humanity can

463
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,100
become, that, that we can
become. We are in the process of

464
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,960
becoming a truly a species of
enlightened beings, a species

465
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,960
where we live in the light more
than living in the shadows. I

466
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,020
think we're coming out of the
shadows of history into a

467
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,020
deeper, deeper, better tomorrow,

468
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,260
Richard Rudd: particularly as we
start to understand the universe

469
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,180
a little bit more or or, or the
parameters of the universe, and

470
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,600
we look out, you know, I know
you've got some wonderful slides

471
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,180
you want to share, but which I
think would be a great backdrop

472
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,620
if you want to share them.

473
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,040
Chris Bache: When I when I think
about the topics that we're

474
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,960
talking about today, like, where
is reincarnation taking us? What

475
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,680
is the larger scope and purpose
of rebirth. I turn I just

476
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,500
collect these pictures from the
NASA. They send them around

477
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,420
every day, and I collect them,
and I meditate on these

478
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:58,240
pictures. I try to envision the
enormous distances involved and

479
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,840
the millions and billions of
stars that are involved, and the

480
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,660
life that's burgeoning on so
many of these planets in so many

481
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:16,680
of these systems, so that the
sheer fertility, the profligate

482
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,400
fertility of the universe, and
the scale that the universe is

483
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,280
thinking of in order to create
and to manifest orders and

484
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:37,400
orders and orders of evolving
life on this magnitude, and then

485
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,160
to appreciate that We are part
of this, this has been the

486
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,540
great, great burden of a one
time through metaphysics, the

487
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,860
belief that we that this genius
and beauty that we're seeing in

488
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,300
these pictures, if our life is
meaningless and if it's all

489
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,680
random chance, we don't get to
participate in this greatness.

490
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,980
But if reincarnation is true,
and if we are really not limited

491
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,240
by the time that this little
body lives, and if our mind is

492
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,900
going to grow for countless,
countless, countless

493
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:20,220
incarnations, then we become
intimately part of the

494
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:26,120
generative creativity that we
see around us in these vast,

495
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,140
magnificent images

496
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,740
Richard Rudd: of the universe,
and this then becomes our

497
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,540
playground. You know, you know,
without the physical body, this

498
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,340
is surely where we live. This is
our playground, and it could be

499
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,980
even within the physical body,
you know, at some deep level,

500
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,160
and as a hologram, you know that
could be a deep truth that we

501
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:58,900
come to. You know that, as
above, so below truth, yeah, and

502
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,680
I know you've experienced. Some
of that yourself and your

503
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,760
experience, your you know,
journeys, and so have I. That's

504
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,780
a fundamental truth I hold at
the core of my being, that you

505
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,100
know and and in my teachings,
also I we have this profile

506
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,720
called a hologenetic profile.
And I name it that because it

507
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,600
is, it is a map of the, you
know, of the inner workings of

508
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:30,560
our being. But it, it kind of
it. It has a fractal reality

509
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,860
that corresponds way beyond, you
know, this microorganism here,

510
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:42,100
of of one body. It is replicated
throughout the cosmos. Yeah. So,

511
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,380
yeah, a lot of the great
alchemical teachings of, you

512
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,280
know, the Taoists, for example,
have explored this in their

513
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:56,800
deep, you know, studies of and
meditations, where you go within

514
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,840
and you find the galaxies and
the stars and where they exist,

515
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,200
in the in the glands of the
body, and how everything has a

516
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,320
correspondence, ya know, and
and, and therefore knowing those

517
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,880
correspondences allows your
awareness to travel into that

518
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,260
reality and outside your
physical body. You know that

519
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,460
that's you know, as many people
have well experienced that in

520
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,600
dreams or in astral projection
or deep meditation or

521
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,560
psychedelic journeying. I mean,
feel free to share some of your

522
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,580
experiences in that.

523
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,300
Chris Bache: Well, you know,
I've done that as carefully as I

524
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,520
can in my book, LSD, in the mind
of the universe. But I think the

525
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:48,460
invitation is to appreciate, I
mean, look, we only became

526
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,780
conscious of the mother universe
about 5000 years ago. We began

527
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,760
to have be sufficient discipline
to drop beneath the conditioning

528
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:02,760
of our of our individual egoic
mind and to tap into that stream

529
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,080
of consciousness that we share
with all life. We've been

530
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,880
walking upright for 5.8 million
years. We've only we've been

531
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,300
operating with our larger brain
about 200,000 years. Writing

532
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,820
came in about 5000 years ago,
the Upanishadic breakthroughs

533
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,520
came in about three, 4000 years
ago. But these are nothing

534
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,300
compared to the billions and
billions of years that lie ahead

535
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,860
of us. We're just waking up.
We're just waking up to who we

536
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,920
are, and so naturally, we kind
of get confused given the

537
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,000
enormity of what we're growing
into. But I think the meditation

538
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,020
exercises that you're describing
and those philosophical and

539
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,840
spiritual traditions which have
begun to recognize the

540
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,040
correspondence between the above
and the below, naturally we

541
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,960
begin to enter into exercises
where we intentionally sort of

542
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:09,540
reinforce the hybrid nature of
our life, that we are a

543
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,280
spiritual being and we are
physical being. We are both pure

544
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,440
light and we are pure green, and
there are correspondences in our

545
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,120
body which correspond to the
correspondence that the

546
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,020
realities out there, and the
more we can internalize and

547
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,780
reinforce them and strengthen
them in our meditational

548
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:36,320
exercises, then we become a more
conscious mixing pot, a more

549
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,720
conscious kind of Mortal and
pestle, integrating the above

550
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,420
and the below. And if we keep
this up for a few 10s of 1000s

551
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,400
of years and a few millions of
years, I mean, I sometimes would

552
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,340
tell my students, only serious
question we should be asking

553
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,460
ourselves is, what do you want
to be in a million years?

554
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,360
Because you're going to be here
in a million years. So let's get

555
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,980
down to it. What is our deepest
hearts desire? What can we

556
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,700
Richard Rudd: do? The
fundamental question I heard a

557
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,700
couple of weeks ago, I heard a
really interesting talk by Roger

558
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:24,680
Penrose. You know him? Yeah,
really imaginative, top level

559
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,760
physicist in the world today.
And he was saying how, because

560
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,700
there was this this, there's
this notion that universe is as

561
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,400
it's expanding in physics, it's
getting further and further

562
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,180
apart and slowing down. It's
going to reach steady state, and

563
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,480
then we're all going to end up
in this kind of slightly

564
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:50,680
distant, dead, lonely kind of
stopping point. And and he, that

565
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,480
wasn't his, that's not his
intuition, or at least the way

566
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,440
he describes it, is that when
you reach that stopping point,

567
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,300
it. It's, it's the same as if
you've gone incredibly fast, as

568
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,260
if you everything's come
together again, because one end

569
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,900
of the spectrum meets the other
end of the spectrum. So you

570
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,960
wouldn't be able to tell if
things are slowing down. It

571
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,300
actually might be that they
speak, they look like they're

572
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:20,480
speeding up. And anyway, so he,
this is my paraphrasing what he

573
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,500
said. But the thing that really
blew me away from from a

574
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:30,980
physicist to say was that he
said the way he would understand

575
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:36,680
it is that the logic of the and
the and the kind of elegance of

576
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,260
the universe would be such that
that, but that, that kind of

577
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,400
condensing point would then give
birth to another universe out of

578
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,040
itself, like which seems to be
the elegant logic that the

579
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,400
universe already does. As we
started by saying rebirth, and

580
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,880
then leads to another birth and
another eon. But then he even

581
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,120
went further, and he said the
background radiation that we see

582
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,960
with through our furthest
telescopes that can now see like

583
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,700
these, the very, very beginnings
of the universe. He said, there

584
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,460
are certain objects that we're
seeing, and then I can't quite

585
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,000
remember what he called them,
but there are certain shapes and

586
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,780
patterns and things that you're
seeing, and you see them over

587
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:26,600
and over again. And his, his
assumption was that those were

588
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,820
the leftovers from the previous
eon, from the previous universe

589
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,720
that we're seeing and and it
that really blew me away. I was

590
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:40,420
like, wow, that's for a
physicist who's willing to kind

591
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,620
of who's who's kind of reached
the top of his game. He's able

592
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:50,920
to kind of take a few leaps. But
that really seemed

593
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,780
Chris Bache: to me to be I've
heard Irvin Laszlo describe the

594
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,220
once you reflect on the
extraordinary precision of the

595
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,020
unfolding of our universe in the
Big Bang that just you know, the

596
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,900
magnitude of the perfection of
the balance of elements that had

597
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,500
to be present in the first
picoseconds for it to unfold as

598
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:21,080
it has. Then. His hypothesis
was, well, do we think that this

599
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,580
is the first time the universe
has tried this? There have been

600
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,120
expansions and contractions and
expansions and contraction, and

601
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,760
the universe is learning. And
perhaps this isn't the first big

602
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,980
bang. Perhaps this is the 1000s
Big Bang, and it's gotten, it's

603
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,920
learned from its previous
experiences. And that's that

604
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,740
background radiation, the traces
which are there,

605
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,620
Richard Rudd: and it's
constantly ironing out flaws and

606
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,920
perfecting and perfecting and
perfecting itself, yeah.

607
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,260
Chris Bache: But of course, this
this wide view. I think it's

608
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,180
rich to take the wide view, to
take the deep view and to look

609
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,080
at very special, developed
beings who are kind of pushing

610
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,540
the edge of this large view. But
I want to bring it back down to

611
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,820
Okay. How does this impact me
here today? How does this help

612
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,860
me live with the immediate
problems that I'm dealing with,

613
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,340
or the with the immediate
choices that I'm living with,

614
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,900
you know, and I think it does in
the sense that, by it, it's an

615
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:38,720
invitation to look at our life
as An intentional, intelligent

616
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:44,140
convocation of circumstances,
not as a meaningless and not as

617
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:50,320
an blind, deterministic
combination of circumstances,

618
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:55,840
and if we engage our life
circumstances as a an

619
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,860
intentional challenge, chosen
us, chosen for Us, By Us, at a

620
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,240
time when we knew more, and we
start to make choices in terms

621
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,920
of out of a deeper sense of
engagement, that our choice does

622
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,240
matter, even if we don't see how
it changes things immediately,

623
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,860
we can trust that it does change
things in the Long term, then I

624
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:25,340
think we will find that life
changes the circumstances of our

625
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,000
life changes things that were
hard become soft, things that

626
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,900
were bare, and becomes richer.
That's your experience, I'm

627
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,640
sure. With with Gene

628
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,420
Richard Rudd: keys, yeah, and it
gives us like, for me, it gives

629
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:45,692
us like, a different kind of
backdrop with which to tackle

630
00:44:45,692 --> 00:44:49,292
the problems of the world, you
know, so the problems that we

631
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:55,232
see today around us that worry
us so much, it gives us an

632
00:44:55,232 --> 00:44:59,372
empowered view from a much wider
view, like to look we've just

633
00:44:59,372 --> 00:45:03,360
been looking at. Those cosmic
background images. And then you

634
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,940
come to the world today, and you
look at this tiny, little blue

635
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,740
planet with its problems, and,
you know? And they're very real,

636
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,500
and and they and they, and
they're causing a great deal of

637
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,780
suffering. They always have
done, you know, but they're now

638
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,180
more they're more easily seen
than ever before, yeah, and

639
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,440
we've enacted them globally
because of our technology. So we

640
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:30,020
are, you know, it means that for
me, I'm constantly reminding

641
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:36,560
people that, you know, action
that comes from a state of trust

642
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:40,720
is very different from action
that comes from fear. Yeah. So

643
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,920
if you can, if we can dive into
that field of wider trust, and

644
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,400
we begin to make friends with
our own death, you know, instead

645
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,480
of being, it being something
that's kind of, you know, like

646
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,500
it's coming, you know, I'm
running out of time. Instead of

647
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,140
like that view, having this long
term view as an individual and

648
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:06,180
and even, like, what I'm doing
is as a community, like, as a

649
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,480
com, how about if a whole
community of people on the same

650
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,020
wavelength play with this
together, like, we're all going

651
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,600
to come back, you know, we're
going to return, and we're going

652
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,540
to return into this same I mean,
that's why I've created these

653
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,380
teachings. It's I haven't
created. They've appeared

654
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,860
because we can come back into
them and we can begin to like

655
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,460
and the teachings are just the
teachings. They're just enable

656
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:35,120
us to kind of give a focal point
so that we can do our work, our

657
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,620
continuous, progressive,
evolutionary work as

658
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,360
communities, rather than like,
okay, you've done this great

659
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,480
work, and then you've gone and,
yeah, I might be reborn, but

660
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,920
where? Yeah, but if you're
reborn into the same community

661
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,740
of beings, of souls who are all
committed to transmuting karma

662
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,780
of the planet, and come in with
different gifts and genius and

663
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,140
skills in different locations
around the world, but we're

664
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,980
interconnected through the
internet and through a body of

665
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,060
teachings that kind of have a
resonance in our soul, so we

666
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,840
recognize them again, even as a
child, you know, and

667
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,320
synchronicity helps us to find
them. Suddenly we are. It's a

668
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,900
different playground again. You
know it's like, you don't have

669
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,480
to say goodbye to all your loved
ones forever. You're you're

670
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,180
going to remember them in
different way. You're going to

671
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:36,020
bring more of that awareness
that through the transitionary

672
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,720
Bardo, and bring and the more of
us that do that, that incarnate

673
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:46,120
the memory through the Bardos
forwards in time. The more it

674
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,980
kind of i, this is my my
intuition, the more it will open

675
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,300
up the Bardos themselves, you
know, so that more and more

676
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,740
people can remember. And it's
all a game of memory. I think

677
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:05,400
that you know, like the more
awareness we we the more we play

678
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,420
and participate, the more that
memory opens up. Because memory

679
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,140
is a strange thing, isn't it?
Like even individual memory, you

680
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,580
can, there are memory tricks you
can do to you know, and you can

681
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,960
and therapeutically, you can
take someone back into their

682
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,260
memories, you know. So there are
things that you can do to

683
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:28,460
enhance memory, and there are
things you can do forwards in

684
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,820
time to ensure that you don't
forget. You know, there are

685
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,660
triggers, you know that you can
you know? I mean, there are lots

686
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,500
of ways of playing with this,
but there are things you can do,

687
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,200
as the lamas, do you know the
tulkus? You know they they

688
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,360
sometimes leave objects that
they retrieve in the next life.

689
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,800
Yeah, you know. And, and there's
lots of tricks within once you

690
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,400
know the time that you know,
once you kind of found the way

691
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,880
through the wormholes. I think
you can play more as and then we

692
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,780
can bring more and more
awakening, you know, into the

693
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,340
collective you know. And I think
that that changes everything it

694
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:11,820
does.

695
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:15,119
Chris Bache: I think we're
shifting slowly from living an

696
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,739
ego based life which is grounded
in this incarnation to living a

697
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:24,559
soul life which is grounded into
this much, much deeper life in

698
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,699
the universe. It always struck
me as significant that in the

699
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:32,719
classical story of the Buddha's
enlightenment, and when he went

700
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,199
through the four watches of the
night in one of the watches of

701
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:40,719
the night, he saw all of his
former lives. They all became

702
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:46,119
living part of his awareness now
to see your former lives, to

703
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:50,979
remember your former lives, is
not simply to remember who you

704
00:49:50,979 --> 00:49:55,299
were, but you bring all of that
life experience into who you

705
00:49:55,299 --> 00:49:59,919
are. So for me to see, to
remember your former lives is.

706
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:05,879
To become the soul which which
gathers all that knowledge and

707
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:10,919
all that experience into one
place. And when he did that, he

708
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:15,299
became transparent and
shattered. He stopped the

709
00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:19,439
suffering. And the suffering is
fundamentally living, small,

710
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,979
living as if this body is the
only thing that is you. And I

711
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:28,279
think this is happening
historically. We are, as you

712
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:32,059
say, the more we bring that
memory forward, the more we live

713
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:35,359
that memory, the more we see
that memory into the future.

714
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:40,099
Another way of saying this is to
say we are practicing the skills

715
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:45,339
of soul inside time and space.
And as our soul gets stronger,

716
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:49,299
we begin to remember and have an
intuitive feeling for

717
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:53,619
relationships that we have a
deeper history with. And if, if

718
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:57,339
people come at us as enemies,
well, let's heal them. Listen,

719
00:50:57,459 --> 00:51:00,599
I'm sorry what I did to you,
whatever it was, let's get let

720
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,399
me make it up to you, but more
and more allies come and because

721
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:10,619
there's a waking up is a social
process. It's a generative

722
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,759
process which has never, ever
been private at any time in

723
00:51:14,759 --> 00:51:18,539
history. And I think this is
what's happening. I think the

724
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:25,519
soul is waking up inside time
and space that the human species

725
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:32,959
is basically growing up on a on
a scale the likes of which is

726
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:37,219
really comparable about like
200,000 years ago, when we made

727
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:41,919
the jump to our bigger brain,
except now the physical plant

728
00:51:41,919 --> 00:51:45,399
isn't changing, but the
awareness that is supported by

729
00:51:45,399 --> 00:51:51,039
the physical plant seems to be
changing exponentially. So I

730
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:53,859
know that you and I share a
vision of history that we're

731
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:58,479
entering into a very, very
challenging time of a time of

732
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:03,719
darkening shadows. So I hope in
our next conversation, we can

733
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:07,979
begin to put together our
understanding of the dynamics of

734
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:11,819
this period of history that
we're venturing and the dynamics

735
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:13,619
of soul growth that

736
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,460
Richard Rudd: we both affirm so
deeply. Yeah, and how those two

737
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,260
fit perfectly together, what
you've called The Birth of the

738
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,500
diamond soul. And I also happen
to call it the diamond

739
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,720
awareness, yeah, and it is that
memory that transcends the

740
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:36,800
lifetimes and and, yeah, that
maintaining that memory between

741
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:44,080
lives. It shows, I mean, for one
thing, you know, suddenly, many

742
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,400
people who I, I'm engaged with,
like they're suddenly excited by

743
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,140
being here and by returning, as
opposed to, I want to get out of

744
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:58,060
here, yeah, which has been the
prevalent kind of feeling among

745
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,980
spiritual communities. I want to
get out of here. You know, I,

746
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:08,700
this is my last incarnation. I'm
off, and that's, you know, I

747
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,180
think there's a more
compassionate view, and I think

748
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:17,520
a more exciting view that, you
know, we can actually bring, you

749
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,200
know, and you know, it's like a
warriors view as well. Spiritual

750
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,120
warrior like this place needs
us. It needs us here to do this

751
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,380
work. So yeah, I think that's
why we're having these

752
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,640
conversations. For me,

753
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,480
Chris Bache: I don't think the
creative genius that gave birth

754
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,380
to the galaxies and planets
inside the galaxies and solar

755
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:44,440
systems would inculcate and it
created reincarnation. We didn't

756
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,380
create it. The religions didn't
create it. Nature created it.

757
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,920
And I don't think it would
create reincarnation to grow us

758
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:55,600
to an awareness of our first
inkling of our deep, deep

759
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,980
spiritual essence, with the
purpose being, okay, then you

760
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,900
can go, then you can go. I think
we missed it. We don't

761
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,460
understand that awakening is
part of is a process which

762
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:12,600
really is part of the
transformation of time and space

763
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,380
itself that we are here to
change. We are changing the

764
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:21,260
world. It really is heaven on
earth. Is what, the process is

765
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,120
about, yeah,

766
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,720
Richard Rudd: and the prophecy
on the prophecy, let's leave

767
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,780
that as a seed for next time.
And it sounds good. Yeah,

768
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,600
wonderful. Thank you, Chris.
What a fantastic

769
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,440
Chris Bache: and I'll just leave
with this thought. I wonder what

770
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,560
our personal farmer life history
is that we meet in such ease and

771
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,600
fruitful dialog you and I, so I
honor the history between us,

772
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,380
whatever it is

773
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,540
Richard Rudd: I will contemplate
that. Yeah. Much. Love. Great.

774
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,140
Thank you.

775
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,120
Unknown: You.

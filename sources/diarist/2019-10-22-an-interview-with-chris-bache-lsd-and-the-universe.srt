1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,080
Marc Caron: Mark, Hello and good
afternoon. My name is Mark Kron.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,080
I'm here with my co host for the
spirit plant medicine

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,920
conference, Steve, Mr. Steven
Gray, good friend. Glad to be

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,160
here. And today we have a very
special guest on our little talk

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,660
about our speakers for the
upcoming conference. We have Mr.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,980
Chris Bache. Now. Chris is a
professor emeritus in the

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,400
Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at Youngstown

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,420
State University, where he
taught for 33 years. He is also

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,240
a junked faculty at the
California Institute of integral

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,960
studies and a fellow at the
Institute of Noetic Sciences.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,200
He's an award winning teacher,
and Chris's work explores the

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,800
philosophical implications of
Non-ordinary states of

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,280
consciousness, especially
psychedelic states. Chris has

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,080
also written three books. One is
called lifestyles. Another dark

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,480
night, sorry, life cycles, dark
night, early dawn and the living

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,160
classroom. And his new book is
LSD in the mind of the universe,

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,380
which is actually the title of
his talk as well for the

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,880
conference. Coming up in
actually a month tomorrow. We

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,660
start in four weeks. So welcome
Chris, pleasure to see you

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,500
again. Have a conversation. It's
always great to hear what you

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,080
have to say, and we look forward
to having you at the conference

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,080
again. But as we get started,
maybe you can introduce yourself

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,040
and let our viewers you know,
know a little bit about your

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,500
story and the work that you've
done in terms of, I think we're

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,840
just talking about, you know, 73
high dosage LSD journeys to as a

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,260
mind in the mind of a
psychologist or philosopher, if

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,940
I remember correctly, from last

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,280
Chris Bache: year. Yeah, well, I
was actually a professor of

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,040
religious studies, and I taught
in a philosophy of Religious

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,960
Studies program at the
University, which is part of the

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,860
Ohio State system, up in the
northeast corner of the state.

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,700
And I'm really excited about the
conference. I'm very, very

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,120
pleased that the book is
actually being released for the

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,620
first time anywhere at the
conference, and after all the

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,660
years of research and all the
years of writing, finally, it's

36
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,800
coming out and allowing me to
have a conversation that I've

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,880
been waiting to have for a long
time. Because basically, in

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,840
order to do psychedelic work
myself, to explore the

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,980
philosophical potential of
psychedelic states, I had to do

40
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,480
all this work underground, so it
was hidden from my colleagues. I

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,600
couldn't really talk about it.
I'm on my day job. I was a

42
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,780
conventional, you know, maybe
not so conventional, but I was a

43
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,680
religious studies professor.
None of my students knew about

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,380
my work. So this is a
conversation that I've been

45
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,980
waiting for a long time. I had
to wait until after I retired to

46
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,180
have it. I had to wait until
after I was passed the statute

47
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,740
of limitations for my
psychedelic crimes, and I've

48
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,300
been I'm just delighted to begin
this conversation here at the

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,380
conference and in the workshop
we'll do following The weekend

50
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,700
after the conference.

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:05,040
Stephen Gray: Great. Wow. Yeah.
So, oh gosh, you know, we could

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,660
all ask all kinds of questions.

53
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
Marc Caron: Just that
introduction gave me about 10 of

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,200
them right now,

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,920
Stephen Gray: why don't you fire
one out then mark, oh, I

56
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,280
Marc Caron: just, you know,
might not even be a question now

57
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,860
that I think about it. But the
big part that struck me there,

58
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,200
Chris was talking about how you
had to hide the work from your

59
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,400
colleagues, doing it
underground, and even the

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,500
consideration of the statue of
limitations running out before

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,440
you can talk about these things,
you know, it's a really

62
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,740
profoundly thought out process
in terms of What you had to deal

63
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,300
with, even to do your research,
so I wanted to acknowledge that.

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,660
And I guess the question is,
what was the biggest challenge

65
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,480
in terms of keeping it all kind
of contained into yourself?

66
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,740
Chris Bache: Well, I knew that
silence was going to be the

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,300
prerequisite that would allow me
to do this work, so I took that

68
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,800
responsibility when I did the
work, but over the long term, I

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,060
did not appreciate that. First
of all, the loneliness would

70
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,840
become the issue that it became
the kind of the inability to

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,540
share your experiences, the
inability to engage in

72
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,780
conversations like that. If I
lived in San Francisco, where

73
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,260
there's you know are in
Vancouver, where there's an

74
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,200
active psychedelic community. It
would have been different, but I

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,740
lived in Ohio, and so there
really wasn't an active

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,360
psychedelic community here to
share my experiences with and to

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,060
have the conversation. But I
found actually that in the long

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,100
term, after that, I'd finished
the work. I did this work. I did

79
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:49,240
73 high dose sessions between
1979 and 1999 and so I waited 20

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,060
years, you know, to write the
book, to tell the full story

81
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,360
I've written about, you know, my
story in dark night, early dawn,

82
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,840
but I really didn't tell the
full story until now. What I

83
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,880
found was that. So not being
able to talk about your

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,660
experiences actually inhibits or
compromises your ability to

85
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,800
fully integrate your experiences
into your life. So I was able to

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,620
integrate them at one level, at
a sort of a personal

87
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,920
psychological level, but I
wasn't able to integrate them

88
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,140
into my full person. I'm a
teacher. I love to learn

89
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,080
knowledge and to share that
knowledge with students. I could

90
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,320
not teach from these
experiences. I could not draw

91
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440
upon the things I had learned,
and I found that that

92
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,040
cumulatively made me sick. It
literally kind of made me

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,660
psychologically sick, like
living in a closet is just

94
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,440
sickness making for anybody
whether keeping them in the

95
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,240
closet. So being in a
psychedelic closet was really

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,680
burden. And now that the first
level of the burden is off by

97
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,300
writing the book and going
public, and the second level has

98
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,860
been lifting, as I have begun to
talk about this material, and I

99
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,220
hope this will continue to
deepen in the years ahead, as I

100
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,800
have the give and take of
conversation.

101
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,520
Stephen Gray: Well, that's quite
understandable. Thank you for

102
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,520
sharing that with us. That was a
good question, I think, Mark.

103
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,160
But now let's talk about the
material itself.

104
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,320
Marc Caron: Even, can I make one
comment about that, because I

105
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,920
think it's a really important
part of what we're seeing in our

106
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,920
community here now as well,
especially in the past year

107
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,900
since the last conference, is
integration being the biggest,

108
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,400
you know, kind of buzzword now,
and you talked about that in

109
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,260
terms of your isolation and
being alone in that and how

110
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,280
important that is, and that's
what we're seeing in terms of

111
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,340
the community that we're
creating, and not even really

112
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,280
creating we're bringing people
together because, you know,

113
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,800
we're all out there. We're just
kind of, you know, pulling it

114
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,120
together, like hub. And so I
think it was really important

115
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,020
that you talk about that, and
that's the big part, is so

116
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,500
people can talk about their
experiences, which is a big part

117
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,900
of what our conference is.
Because it's not just for, you

118
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,680
know, doctors and practitioners,
naturopaths and things. It's for

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,500
people who are looking to, you
know, connect with people, so

120
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,680
they can actually share, talk
about their experiences and go

121
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,620
even deeper with their own work.
So thank you really for touching

122
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,340
on that, and I think it's really
important, especially

123
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,660
considering you know that 20
years of doing it in the closet,

124
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,900
Chris Bache: I think that I'm
really, really pleased to see

125
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,140
integration being discussed
more. There's an anthology

126
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,100
that's going to be coming out in
London within a year, all about

127
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,080
integration finding, of course,
with the technology that we have

128
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,440
with this, with the session
material and the sacred

129
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,380
medicines we have, we can blow
out the system, you know,

130
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,180
increasingly easy, but
integrating those experiences

131
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,880
and integrating, you know, we
can't stay in these states,

132
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,600
that's clear. But learning how
to live with the memories of

133
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,820
deep immersion in the universe,
using those memories skillfully

134
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,500
as part of your daily meditation
practice and your social

135
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,000
integration. That's really
important. And another aspect

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,960
for me has been I wrote the
living classroom because I found

137
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,140
that while my students never
learned about never knew about

138
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,660
my psychedelic work, they were
actually being activated by my

139
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,320
private work. You know, because
consciousness is not private,

140
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,920
it's an open field. And the
deeper I went, the more deeply

141
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,760
my students are being drawn
implicitly into my work. And

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,580
that's what really led me to
address this in dark and early

143
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,840
dawn, and then to write this
small book the living classroom

144
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,240
about fields of consciousness in
groups.

145
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,740
Stephen Gray: Well, I was going
to try to lead you into some of

146
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,680
the content of the material that
you learned. But as long as

147
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,440
we're on integration, maybe we
should follow up a little bit

148
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,540
more on that. So with this
question, what do you think are

149
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,760
the most important aspects of
integration for, you know,

150
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,500
typical person who's doing, say,
you know, couple of Ayahuasca,

151
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,100
two, three Ayahuasca session, or
weekends a year, or something

152
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,460
like that. Maybe working with
Psilocybin mushrooms a bit, and

153
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,940
then they're living in, you
know, Vancouver, you know, or

154
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,320
some urban center you know,
what. What do you think are the

155
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,280
most helpful things that those
people can do to make sure that

156
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,220
they try to keep that they keep
those channels open and keep

157
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,900
themselves grounded properly?

158
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Chris Bache: Yeah, good
question. I mean, I don't think

159
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,820
I have a pat answer for that.
I'd like me more dialog around

160
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,560
it. But basically, the things
that spring to mind is, first in

161
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,880
your sessions, emphasizing clean
contact, controlling the

162
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,700
variables, controlling the
isolation, so that you have

163
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,940
clean contact with these
realities, not smudgy contract,

164
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,900
any confusion, clean contact,
and then first step is

165
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,200
remembering your session, so
writing up a detailed

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,360
description. Question within 24
hours, because these memories

167
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,740
fade over time. And then once,
personally, once I write up a

168
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,460
session, I never change it. I've
learned that trying to edit it,

169
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,420
clean it up, you can lose some
things. Yeah, and I actually

170
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,320
when I'm course, this is more
relevant, perhaps when you're

171
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,460
pushing way, way deep beyond
conventional reality. Just to

172
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,120
write a good session up, I
listen to the music that I

173
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,600
played during the session while
I'm writing up my account,

174
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,080
because it allows me to get
deeper into my memories and get

175
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,480
them down on paper. So I think
the other thing I think is

176
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,100
important is a daily spiritual
practice, whatever form, yoga,

177
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,600
meditation, rule of thumb is,
the deeper you're going into

178
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,420
Non-ordinary states, the
stronger should be your daily

179
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,520
practice. Well, that's a good
one. And then just, you know,

180
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,500
people use art to to bring their
sessions, hold on to their

181
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,360
sessions. For me, I've been
given lots of teachings in my

182
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,760
sessions, and I've been giving
meditation. I've been given

183
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,320
practices, so my responsibility
is to try to live by that

184
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,920
teaching as best I can, and to
cultivate those practices, to

185
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,840
actually do the assignments that
I was given. And then I think

186
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,860
sharing with other people is
really critical to to listen to

187
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,580
their experiences and to share
your experiences. That's is this

188
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,960
nothing that can replace that

189
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,860
Stephen Gray: wonderful so now,
can we get into some

190
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,500
Marc Caron: of the Steve, it's
your turn.

191
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,920
Stephen Gray: No, it's not that
wise. I'm not looking for my

192
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,180
turn. I'm looking for the
material. You know, it's

193
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,420
actually not about, it's not
about any of us, really.

194
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,100
Marc Caron: And that's I just
like having fun

195
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,440
Stephen Gray: with you, my
friend. That's all indeed, yeah.

196
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,980
So it's all good. Well, okay, so
from my point of view, you know,

197
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,500
you know, I've read this book,
and I've also read dark night,

198
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,300
early dawn, and what stands out
to me there's, there's so many

199
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,120
amazing things that that have
happened, that happened to you

200
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,660
during that 20 year period that
people would find stunning, like

201
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,320
the whole time when you, you
know, experienced all your past

202
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,540
lives, the time when they where
they grabbed you by the Ball, so

203
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,020
to speak, and made you become
like just about every different

204
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,220
kind of woman on the planet. But
the ultimate for from my point

205
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,940
of view, is is what most affects
everybody on this planet, which

206
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,600
is what you've called the Great
death and the Great Awakening.

207
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,900
And I wonder if you could
elaborate on that somewhat.

208
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,980
Chris Bache: Well, let me back
up just a little bit to give a

209
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,220
context, and then you bring me
back. If I don't get back to it

210
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,340
in time, you bring me back to
this, the birth of the future

211
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,740
human. Okay, yes, I found that
in when I was working with these

212
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,940
very high levels of LSD. And
again, this is a protocol that I

213
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,440
honestly, sincerely do not
recommend that people follow

214
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,920
doing individual high dose LSD
sessions is fine, but doing such

215
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:15,000
a relentless, long, really,
completely rigorous, nothing but

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,940
high dose LSD sessions is not
something that I would

217
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,780
recommend. I would balance high
dose, low dose. That balance

218
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,240
Psilocybin in Ayahuasca with
LSD, but I did this work

219
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,740
starting 40 years ago, so I
didn't understand it as well as

220
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:37,160
I understand now. Basically,
when by working with these very

221
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,860
high doses, you can blow open
consciousness and enter into a

222
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,240
deeper level of reality, go
through a Death-Rebirth process.

223
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,420
And what I found was that by
going back again and again and

224
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,560
again, not only does your
experience stabilize at this

225
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,280
deeper level of reality, but if
you keep going back and if you

226
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,960
keep pushing your own limits,
you will go through a

227
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,860
Death-Rebirth cycle again and
enter a deeper level of reality.

228
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,800
And if you keep pushing, you'll
go through another Death-Rebirth

229
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,000
and go through a deeper level of
reality. And it's not ego that

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,780
is simply dying over and over
again, but it does really become

231
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,200
a question, what is dying in
these advanced deaths and

232
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,700
rebirth? And I actually have an
appendix, which is in the book,

233
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,640
which is asking the question,
what dies? What's actually

234
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,980
dying? But when I was charting
the overall levels of the

235
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,280
development in my journey, I
identified five core fundamental

236
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,600
cycles of death and rebirth, and
this is something I'll be

237
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,860
talking about at the conference.
First was going beyond physical

238
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,240
identity, the death of self,
ego, death. The second was going

239
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,740
into collective mind, the ocean
of suffering and some of the

240
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,040
lower levels of subtle level
reality. The third level going

241
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,320
into archetypal mind, really
moving deep into archetype of

242
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,400
reality, both in terms of this
collective unconscious, the

243
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,420
species mind, and also into
cosmic, logical archetype of

244
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:22,820
reality. Fourth Level was going
into oneness, the fundamental

245
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:28,040
condition of oneness. And the
fifth level is what I call

246
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,280
diamond Luminosity. Going into
the diamond Luminosity, what

247
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,840
Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, or
the clear light of absolute

248
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:42,040
reality. So all of my sessions
kind of can fall into these

249
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,200
categories. And but then, while
there's this deepening process

250
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,720
and going into collective
dimensions, archetypal

251
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,580
dimensions, causal oneness, and
going into diamond Luminosity, I

252
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,440
began to have rhythmic,
systematic initiations into a

253
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,540
series of ideas that had to do
with the entire human species.

254
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,320
In fact, the entire trajectory
of my experiences were was not

255
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,160
personal. It really wasn't
primarily about my personal

256
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,740
healing or my personal
development or my personal

257
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,020
enlightenment. Everything seemed
to be converging around the

258
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,520
theme of humanity's collective
transformation, that seemed to

259
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,220
be the work of the hour. That's
what we're here for. That's what

260
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,820
we're about. We're at a life and
death moment for the species.

261
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,240
And my work and all of our work
seem to be part of this

262
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,440
convergence that's taking place
in history, taking us through

263
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,960
this transition that we're going
through. And this is what I came

264
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,560
to call the birth of the future
human, leaving it open ended,

265
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,120
what the form of this future
human will take. I have my own

266
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,540
experience of it and my own
theory of it, in a way. And I

267
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,900
think it is a combination of the
reincarnation project process it

268
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:07,320
will take us into a different
level of our species evolution.

269
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,160
It's a shift that takes place, I
think, at the fundamental

270
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:17,100
archetype of level of the core
blueprint of the human species,

271
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,480
we're really work doing some
work that's going to influence

272
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,960
and trigger a pivot in the
blueprint of the human psyche.

273
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,600
And I don't think we're going to
make this jump into this new

274
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,620
psychological awareness of the
heart and mind without going

275
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,900
through a tremendously painful
transformation process, the dark

276
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,460
night of our collective soul,
and which is essentially time of

277
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,480
purification, a time of letting
go of the past, a time of

278
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,740
basically coming to terms with
the choices we've been making

279
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,440
historically in the past, making
new choices, choices that do not

280
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,660
re force reinforce the stories
of Hate or stories of class

281
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,260
division, racial division,
religious division, the

282
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,700
nationalisms which tear our
planet apart, the economic

283
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,660
divisions which have done, which
cause so much damage, literally,

284
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,260
I think we have to consume the
karma that those choices have

285
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,200
brought us, and we've been
making those choices. I mean,

286
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,120
you know, we reincarnate
generation by generation. So

287
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,840
we're carrying the entire
history of the human planet, in

288
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,160
our history, in our souls, in
our stories. And as we change

289
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,360
those stories, we contribute to
a change in the in the playing

290
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,660
field of humanity. And so in my
work, I've been taken into that

291
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:48,640
process, gone through tremendous
exercises of purification and

292
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,360
healing, of the collective
psyche, of the war is that we've

293
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,820
fought and all the things,
terrible things we've done to

294
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,600
each other and have been taken
into what I Call deep time, into

295
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,680
dimensions of time where the
future becomes available,

296
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,460
becomes as available as the
present, and been given glimpses

297
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,780
into the culmination of this
death and rebirth process

298
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,620
experienced at a collective
level, and then the

299
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,560
transformation of our species
into this higher order of

300
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,040
humanity that's coming forward
that, to me, is the most

301
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,840
important theme of the

302
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,900
Stephen Gray: work, because,
yeah, all of us are involved,

303
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,260
all of our children, all of our
grandchildren. I think where

304
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,860
we're going with this is that
it's, you know, it's, I don't

305
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,220
know what the timeline is, but
you know, in some relatively

306
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,380
near future, it is going to be
clear to the whole planet that

307
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:51,880
this is job number one, as Ford.
Ford used to call it. So how

308
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,940
about this question related to
that? Then you know, you listed

309
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,960
off the kind of ways in which
the sort of human enterprises,

310
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,940
you know, off track. Work like
nationalism, racism, religion,

311
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,140
divisions, and perhaps, you
know, right up there at the top,

312
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,320
you know, materialist illusion
of that promotes 50 families

313
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,380
having half the the wealth on
the planet, or whatever that is.

314
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,700
So given that it appears that we
are as a species so far away,

315
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,460
you know, I mean, lots of people
are making inroads into the

316
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,280
transformation, of course, but
it's, you know, in total

317
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,820
numbers, out of 878, billion
people, it's a minuscule number

318
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,920
of people. So that, given that,
you know, 98 or 9% of the planet

319
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,500
is not getting, not even aware
of this possibility, let alone

320
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,760
doing anything to move in that
direction. What's what is it

321
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,520
going to take? It seems to me,
it's going to take terrible

322
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,580
disasters of some kind to open
up a crack. What do you think?

323
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Chris Bache: How can we get as
far as we need to get in as

324
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:01,320
little time as we have, as the
global crisis triggers a cascade

325
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,800
of a series of economic,
political, social crises that

326
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,400
we're seeing.

327
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,120
Marc Caron: Not even mentioned
environmental, oh, yeah, yes,

328
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,540
yeah,

329
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,200
Chris Bache: I sort of, I don't
have any, any secret, any inside

330
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,400
information of the how, when and
why, of what's happening. You

331
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,620
know, just that we're going into
a global systems crisis, which

332
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,400
is being driven by global
ecological crisis and other

333
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,500
imbalances in the world. But
then, after years of being shown

334
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,820
this very, very positive,
optimistic fulfilling our

335
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,860
evolutionary destiny, it didn't.
It had never shown me how, how

336
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,940
could we possibly make this
transition? And you're asking

337
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,660
that question, Steven, exactly.
And then one particular session,

338
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,160
what I call the Great Awakening
session, session 55 took me into

339
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,840
that process and into this
trauma, and it also gave me a

340
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,900
set of teachings around how we
could actually how we will make

341
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,380
this transition, and it has to
do with understanding the

342
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,920
dynamics of the collective
psyche that all of our

343
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,360
individual psyches feed into and
are part of. We are fractal

344
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,720
embodiments of our collective
psyche and all of our

345
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,380
experience, as Rupert Sheldrake
talks about in Morphic field

346
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,940
theory, all of our experience is
being processed, collected and

347
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:29,240
processed at a collective level.
And we know something well. The

348
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,860
basic formula is this, our
collective psyche is a field.

349
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,840
Fields have behaved in certain
predictable ways. There's a

350
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,160
correlation between the way the
collective psychic field of

351
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,500
humanity will behave as it
enters into extreme crisis, and

352
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,160
the way in the future, and the
way that other physical systems

353
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,880
behave when they go into what
are called non linear systems

354
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,980
are far from equilibrium state.
The basic vision is this, when

355
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,620
we are go deeper into this
century. We are going to go into

356
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,820
a period of tremendous pain. I
mean, just, I don't see any way

357
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,060
around it. We're going to suffer
terribly. And in contrast to

358
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,800
anything that's happened before,
this pain will not be restricted

359
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,040
to one continent or one part.
It's going to be global. It's

360
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,380
going to be massive, and all of
this pain that we are going to

361
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,800
experience individually is going
to be feeding into the

362
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,460
collective psyche, so that the
collective psyche itself will be

363
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,500
moving into increasingly non
linear conditions when a field,

364
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,560
when the psychic field of
humanity, moves into these non

365
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,300
linear conditions, several if we
can extrapolate lessons from

366
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,840
physical fields, we can
hypothesize that several things

367
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,820
will be begin to happen. First,
small perturbations can produce

368
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,020
very large effects. So the
impact, or the effects of

369
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,480
individuals on the outcome of
history will increase good one

370
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,960
individual people can have a
larger trigger on the future.

371
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,420
Stephen Gray: Yeah, I could I
interrupt for a sec. I think I

372
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,480
understand what you mean by non
linear conditions, but perhaps

373
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,480
it needs a little more clear
clarification. Can you go into

374
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,380
that a wee bit more

375
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,860
Chris Bache: basically? And
here, I'm not a scientist, so my

376
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,180
apologies to those who really
could answer this question much

377
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,900
better. But basically, when you
have a system, it develops a

378
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,620
balance between energy in and
energy out. And if you keep

379
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,460
pouring more and more energy
into that system, it becomes

380
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,440
increasingly unstable. And when
it becomes unstable, it shows

381
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,360
characteristics which are not
like it was when it was a stable

382
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,780
system. When it becomes so
unstable, we find that in

383
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,720
nature, it can respond to this
instability to draw out new

384
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,280
levels of creativity out of
nature itself. So non linear

385
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,880
systems are highly creative
systems. They produce things

386
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,280
which we wouldn't have predicted
pre. Obviously, and it's fast.

387
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,460
Things changes can take place
very fast when they're in non

388
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,560
linear conditions. So it's just
and individuals can have

389
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,860
disproportionate effects on the
outcome in non linear

390
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,880
conditions. So technically, the
term would be in systems that

391
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,360
are in the far from equilibrium
state. Yeah. So creativity,

392
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:31,520
spontaneity, fast speed and
individuals having larger

393
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,840
influence, right?

394
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,080
Stephen Gray: So obviously,
that's a pretty scary, you know,

395
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,680
prognostication for the for the
decades coming. But it also

396
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,300
suggests that when you know
that, you know, as Leonard Cohen

397
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,760
said, there's a crack in
everything, that's how the light

398
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,360
gets. And so what might that
look like? You know? And I think

399
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,680
it might be useful for people
watching this to to imagine what

400
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,140
conditions or what the new human
might be like, so that we can

401
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,120
recognize the the inklings of
that awakening in ourselves. Can

402
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,200
you elaborate on that?

403
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:13,079
Chris Bache: Yeah, let's remind
ourselves that the human beings

404
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:19,139
that this will be happening to
are 1000s and 10s of 1000s of

405
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:22,879
years old, because we're it will
be happening to souls in human

406
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:27,079
bodies, not simply 200 year
beings, but 100,000 year old

407
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:31,399
beings who have this very
complex psychic history of their

408
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:36,379
former lives, all kind of
flowing within them as they as

409
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:41,319
they enter into time. So my
understanding of what has come

410
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:45,819
through my sessions repeatedly
is that, as without, so within,

411
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:49,059
so what is happening on the
planet, at the geopolitical

412
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:52,239
level, at the geophysical level,
as we are trying to become an

413
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:56,259
integrated planet and get past
this stage of evolution where we

414
00:26:56,259 --> 00:27:01,259
are so fractured and divided, as
we are confronting our history

415
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,299
geopolitically, we are also
confronting our history inside

416
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,659
the history of the soul, and the
fragmentations within the soul.

417
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:14,579
And the sessions have shown me,
taught me that there seems to be

418
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:18,599
a synergistic relationship
between engaging a changing

419
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:22,099
world outside of us as we work
to create a future that is

420
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:26,779
fundamentally different than the
past, and a maturation which is

421
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:31,819
taking place where we kind of
integrate our former lives in a

422
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:36,139
way that leads to an arising of
an awareness that is an

423
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:40,279
intuitive and immediately
experienced awareness that my

424
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:44,619
mind And my heart are not the
age of my body. My mind and my

425
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:48,159
heart are much older than my
body and my relationships are

426
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,879
much older than my present
body's relationships. I am

427
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:56,439
living in time as time as a
manifestation of creative

428
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:59,979
energy. Everyone around me is
doing this. We've been doing it

429
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:05,459
for generations. I think that
what we're witnessing the only

430
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:10,499
way put it a different way, the
ego created this global crisis.

431
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,119
The ego cannot solve it. Soul is
the only thing that can solve

432
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,459
it. I think we're making a
transition from ego

433
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:21,559
consciousness, individual body
mind consciousness, to soul

434
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,259
consciousness. And by soul
consciousness, I don't mean

435
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:29,719
simply a disembodied ego. I mean
what I call the diamond soul all

436
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:34,759
of our history integrated in a
way that generates a higher

437
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:40,219
level of functioning, so that we
begin to live out of a larger

438
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:44,259
platform. And I think we can see
this happening around us when

439
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:47,439
people take up projects that
they know they won't finish in

440
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:51,459
their lifetime, when they are
willing to die so that others

441
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:55,899
can live when they when they
just when their commitments are

442
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:59,499
not to their own individual
private enhancement, but to the

443
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:03,599
enhancement of larger numbers of
people. I think what we're

444
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,539
seeing is the soul. Those are
the symptoms of the soul

445
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,959
emerging in our psychological
awareness. We just don't know

446
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:12,539
what to call it. We just think,
Oh, this is a great being. This

447
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,659
is a Gandhi. This is a Martin
Luther King. But really, what

448
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:18,839
we're seeing is the maturation
of the soul within our

449
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,159
individual lives.

450
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,420
Stephen Gray: And do you think,
go ahead? Do you see a lot of

451
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,140
that happening?

452
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,200
Chris Bache: Well, just look
around us, because there are a

453
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,080
lot of people doing a lot of
injurious things, but there are

454
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,320
a lot of people doing some
magnificent things. You know,

455
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,920
they are committing themselves
to projects that they'll never

456
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,300
see realized in their lifetime.
And I think we're going to see

457
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,880
more and more of that as we
really come to terms with the

458
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,300
fact that the way we're living
just isn't working. You know,

459
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,020
the way we've organized our
culture isn't working. We need

460
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,320
to be experimenting with new and
different ways of creating an

461
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,040
economy, creating social,
family, so on, so forth. I think

462
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,540
now, here's the thing. It. It's
there's no guarantees in

463
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,240
evolution, right? There's no
guarantee that we're going to

464
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,420
come through this. There's no
guarantee that the next form of

465
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,880
the human being will be born
successfully. But the more we

466
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,260
experience the intelligence of
the universe when we work in our

467
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,300
sessions, the more we experience
the profound wisdom that's

468
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,600
behind the formation of galaxies
and the formation of solar

469
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,340
systems and the emergence of
light, that intelligence seems

470
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:36,920
to think that humanity is ready
for this transition. Gestation

471
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,840
is a long process, right? But
birth is very short, very fast

472
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,520
and convulsive. I think we have
been maturing through 1000s and

473
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,720
1000s of years. The soul has
been now Nature says it's time

474
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,160
to give birth to the to the soul
inside history, not just when we

475
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,900
die inside history. This is hard
work. This is what we're coming

476
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,440
into. I think

477
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,280
Stephen Gray: what a beautiful
vision. It's, you know, you

478
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,160
know, it's this idea of, you
know, having a vision and having

479
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,680
hope that's going to kind of
keep people going. I think, as

480
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,460
things collapse that way, I'm
just curious. It may not even be

481
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,800
all that relevant to the
discussion at hand, but I want

482
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,220
to ask you anyway, I, you know,
I gather from reading, you know,

483
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,920
the books that the teachings you
are receiving are about humanity

484
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:27,200
and about our journey. But you
know, just what you can see with

485
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,840
the naked eye, there are many,
many 1000s of bodies that are

486
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,940
much like our Sun, produce heat
and light. Did you ever get a

487
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,360
sense that there are other
planets, other species that have

488
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,480
that are going through similar
things, or have been through

489
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,180
them and have successfully come
through them, or any of that

490
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,900
sort of thing.

491
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,140
Chris Bache: You know, I've
never explored that particular

492
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,660
aspect of things, or it was
never put in front of me. I

493
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,960
mean, I never directed my
sessions. I've I tried to set

494
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,900
intentions, but a deeper
intelligence did all the lay all

495
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,360
the groundwork for what
happened? And essentially, it

496
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,920
never took me there, but it was
just the very nature of the

497
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,600
experiences that it took me
into. It was just assumed that

498
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,160
we are one speck in a much
larger, cosmic, logical process

499
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,140
with life emerging, life and
life and life and galaxies all

500
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,440
over the place that we are
incubating something taking

501
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,640
place on this planet, but it
parallels things which are

502
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,780
taking place elsewhere, because
nature is just vast, and it

503
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,680
works. It works in groups. You
know, it's evolved. You know,

504
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,340
these are the dynamics of
evolution. So to me, I just

505
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,640
assume, when I look up in the
night, tie in the sky and I see

506
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,500
all those stars, I just assume
that somewhere there, there is

507
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,620
life percolating and struggling
at all sorts of different levels

508
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,820
around the universe,

509
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,200
Stephen Gray: switching tax a
little. There's a segment of the

510
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,380
psychedelic community that's
very devoted to natural plants.

511
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,400
You know, the core of your work
was with a semi synthetic

512
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,780
substance. LSD, what? What's
your take on that? What do you

513
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,960
say to those people that say,
you know nature knows best?

514
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,680
Chris Bache: Somehow, I think
nature does know best in many

515
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,800
ways. I mean, I think natural
plants are very good plants to

516
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,980
work with, good ways to work.
Most of human history has taken

517
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:36,140
it been in dialog with natural,
sacred medicines. I don't think

518
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:43,060
to me to make too much of the
difference between a synthetic,

519
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,260
meaning a man made human, made
medicine and an organic

520
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,800
medicine. I don't know that I
would put quite the emphasis on

521
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,880
that that some people do. I do
think that around any work with

522
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,480
a medicine with any regularly
induced state of consciousness,

523
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,460
fields develop, so that there
are fields around Psilocybin

524
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,460
mushrooms, you know, psychic
fields that reflect humanity's

525
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,360
history with them. There are
fields around Ayahuasca. I think

526
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,840
maybe that's why people who have
never lived in the Amazon and

527
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,320
are doing Ayahuasca and Texas,
they encounter these giant

528
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,540
snakes in their first session.
It's somehow, there's a field

529
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,500
around these medicines. And so
when we open our mind, we don't

530
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,920
simply open our mind. We open up
through these fields, into these

531
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,900
fields, and they speak to us.
Now, LSD has a it doesn't have a

532
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,440
historical field associated with
it. You know, a few years in the

533
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,620
60s, it's nothing compared to
the fields associated with

534
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:46,300
Ayahuasca or or Mescaline, or
Peyote, so it's relatively Feel

535
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,800
free, and I think it has, of
course, it also tends to be a

536
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,340
high altitude psychedelic. So
many of the organic psychedelics

537
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:59,560
are much more sensitively tuned
to the nearby psychedelic world,

538
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,380
which. It's a very helpful and
relevant psychedelic world, the

539
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:11,040
world of spirit guides, the
world of Animal Collective

540
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,860
psyches of angelic figures, so
on and so forth. LSD tends to be

541
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:21,140
somewhat neutral. It doesn't
have a lot of history, and it

542
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,860
tends to drive into the high at
high levels. It tends to drive

543
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,580
into high cosmic, logical
territory. So I think it's good

544
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,180
for giving at least for me, I
think I I drilled a deep

545
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,480
borehole in the universe, and it
gave me a lot of overview, but

546
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,380
it didn't give me a lot of
experience up close with the

547
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,480
nearby territory that is
explored, and I've experienced

548
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,840
in Ayahuasca sessions or in
Psilocybin sessions that I did

549
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,420
after I completed my LSD work.

550
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,020
Stephen Gray: So you found those
to be a good adjunct. For you,

551
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,200
Chris Bache: they have been a
good adjunct. And I wish that I

552
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,920
hadn't been smart enough to be
using those adjuncts all the way

553
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,040
along during those 20 years. And

554
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,160
Marc Caron: that was my question
for you, Chris, is, what was it

555
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,920
that made to choose LSD in 1979
when you did, versus, say, the

556
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,300
magic mushroom back then?

557
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,700
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, it's I
read Stan Grof work. You know

558
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,620
Stan Grof published realms of
the human unconscious in 1976 I

559
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,480
came out of graduate school in
78 I read that book, and very

560
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,000
quickly, LSD psychotherapy,
which came out in 1980 and this

561
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,780
is what Stan had done his early
research work on this was the

562
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:41,920
material. And in my case, I was
able to find a way to get high

563
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,440
quality, you know, laboratory
grade, LSD. And so it was a

564
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,940
combination of, I trusted Stan
grofs work his methodology was

565
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:57,460
really around LSD in the early
years, and it was only because

566
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,020
of his research that I trusted
my own mind into going through

567
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,740
this process, and it was the
substance that was available to

568
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:04,800
me.

569
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,680
Stephen Gray: What about what's
your take on five Meo, DMT, it's

570
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,200
becoming more and more popular,
and I think it needs to be

571
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,420
discussed more. Let me just put
it this way. I was on a panel

572
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,880
discussion on psychedelics and
their role in the future. Last

573
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,200
weekend at a small conference
here, and they we broke up into

574
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,320
groups, and the panelists were
asked to sit in with some of

575
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,020
these groups. And one of the
people in the little group I was

576
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,520
in said, You know her, her view
of psychedelic she'd, I think

577
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,340
she'd had a couple of
experiences with them, was she

578
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:45,340
thought they were a door that
shouldn't be opened. So I say

579
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:49,000
that in the context of five Meo
DMT, because I've had one full

580
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,840
on experience with it. And I
mean, it was absolutely stunning

581
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,620
at the moment, where I just
went, oh my god, this is what

582
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,660
I've been waiting to realize at
the gut level my whole life, but

583
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,140
since then, that's like three
months ago. I really have no

584
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,560
idea how that it's informing my
ongoing spiritual awakening

585
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,920
journey. So I don't know where
that fits into the Pantheon, as

586
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,620
it were, I don't do you have any
feelings thoughts about that?

587
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,580
Chris Bache: First of all, I
don't have a lot of experience

588
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:23,120
with five Meo DMT. I've only
done a couple of sessions. They

589
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,520
were ecstatically wonderful
sessions. They were luminous

590
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,620
sessions. I did this years after
doing the LSD work. So the mind

591
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,040
I brought to the to the five Meo
DMT experience, it's not the

592
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,780
mind that I had in the beginning
of my LSD work. It was the mind

593
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,140
that had been polished and
curated over all the years of

594
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,940
that work. So I yield, really,
to people who have more

595
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,560
experience with this substance
in the discussion, it is

596
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,520
striking how fast it can drop
you deep, deep into the

597
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,520
universe, but the speed within
it dropped within the speed with

598
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,140
which it drops you in, deep into
the universe, and your time

599
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,860
there is so short, and then
you're back, it makes

600
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:16,980
integration or healing, or it's
better for opening doors than it

601
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,780
is for really deeply
internalizing the experiences

602
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,140
that you've you've opened into,
which doesn't mean it's a bad

603
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,480
thing. I mean opening doors and
letting in the brush of fresh

604
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,140
air can be very helpful. But
there's something. One thing I

605
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,700
have learned about LSD, of
course, it's a long day, it's a

606
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,180
big commitment. It commits you
to a day before, at least all

607
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,640
day session, and a day after,
and on the day of a session,

608
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,260
it's an eight hour commitment.
And you know, usually about five

609
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,600
or six or seven hours you'd
like, Oh, come on. Now, let's

610
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,860
get this over. I'm ready to come
back. But one of the things that

611
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,820
it does is, by keeping you in
these states for long periods of

612
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,760
time, it allows the mind. Mind
that you are exploring to polish

613
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,300
the mind that is doing the
exploring. Because in this work,

614
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:11,700
you're always using the mind to
explore mind. So the length of

615
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,260
time that you expend gives the
universe more time to heal you.

616
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,120
It gives the universe more time
to show you things, to teach you

617
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,140
things, and it teaches me things
over and over and over again. It

618
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,140
really repeatedly will teach me
something until it's sure that

619
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,200
I've got it, and it'll keep this
up for several sessions in a

620
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,160
row. So I think there is a
certain polishing that takes

621
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,140
place in long sacred medicines
that doesn't take place in short

622
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,340
acting sacred medicines. Again,
that doesn't mean the short

623
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,340
acting sacred medicines are not
useful and they're not good.

624
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,240
It's just that it's different,
the Native American traditions,

625
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,140
the Brazilian traditions, they
have preferred, in many cases,

626
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,040
the longer acting sessions.
Peyote is longer acting.

627
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,020
Ayahuasca is longer acting. The
Psilocybin mushroom is not as

628
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,980
long as LSD, but it's a longer
acting substance. They consider

629
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,000
the length of time that we spend
in these conditions to be

630
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,300
special and sacred, you know.
And also, Rick Strassman, when

631
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,860
he was doing his work on five on
DMT, not five Meo DMT, but on

632
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,020
DMT, he was surprised to find
that while people had very deep

633
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,000
experiences in their five their
DMT session, he found that it

634
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,900
didn't really produce long
lasting results for the majority

635
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,820
of them. So it's something about
quick in, quick out, hard to

636
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,180
really convert that into a
transformational experience. I

637
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:43,420
can

638
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,780
Marc Caron: certainly, you know,
agree with, with that statement,

639
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,780
and kind of what you're talking
about Steven and the five Meo

640
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,140
with just the DMT. I was like,
it was, it was an experience,

641
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,580
all right. But I was like, okay,
so how does that? What's I

642
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,860
couldn't nail any kind of like
spiritual experience or

643
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,320
mysticism? Well, there's
certainly mysticism. I guess

644
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,460
that's not the word, but it was,
you know, it left me with more

645
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,940
questions, because what I saw
was just really, what was that?

646
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,700
What does it all these
hieroglyphics and things that I

647
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,500
was seeing and what his work I
trusted my DNA, and, you know,

648
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,160
my soul and spirit were getting
it all. But I was like, I still

649
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,300
look back at it

650
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,940
Stephen Gray: and go, what was
that? You know? So, yeah, that

651
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,160
brings up another related
question. I think this, like, I

652
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,720
don't know if this is quite an
exact, accurate assessment or,

653
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,900
you know, description, of the
journeys that you went on. But

654
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,260
the way I remember it correct
me, if I'm not quite getting the

655
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,460
exact nuance here, was that you
you had that you said there were

656
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,480
two parts to every journey.
First two hours or so, was a lot

657
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,940
of letting go. Sometimes, I
think I remember you use the

658
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,820
term exquisitely painful, before
you broke out into the living

659
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:09,120
intelligence of the universe. I
if I may say so, I think you're

660
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:15,840
perhaps unusual in that sense,
in that you were suited, perhaps

661
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,900
from your past, you know, lives
or whatever, your destiny, so to

662
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,460
speak, karma, in this lifetime,
to go to these places, but I and

663
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,120
correct me if I'm wrong. But I
think the majority of the you

664
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,960
know Psychonauts, as it were,
you know, the people that we're

665
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,080
going to be talking to at the
conference and so on, are not

666
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,080
likely to go there. And it's
more about having to get

667
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,080
ourselves out of our own way,
the healing that we need to do.

668
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,500
So, you know, do you have some
thoughts on that? You know,

669
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,060
where that's at for most people?

670
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:58,240
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, I think
basically what I understand now

671
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,780
at the end is different than
what I understood at the

672
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,660
beginning, and it leads me to
approach working with

673
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,700
Non-ordinary states differently.
Now, I'm kind of much more

674
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,960
patient with the slow, gradual
developmental process, rather

675
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,140
than trying to accelerate the
process so far, because I

676
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,080
thought in my early in my work,
I thought, ah, the The goal was

677
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,380
to get someplace. I'd get to an
end destination. I'd get to

678
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,060
home. I'd go home, or become one
with God, or I dissolve into the

679
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:35,960
primordial void. And I had all
of those experiences, but what I

680
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:46,000
found was they didn't have as
long, lasting a penetrating

681
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,720
transformation on my person as I
thought they might in the

682
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,400
beginning. And I also found when
I went as deep as I ever went

683
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,080
into the diamond Luminosity, I
found that what I initially had

684
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,760
felt like after. Absolute
homecoming, the sweetest, most,

685
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:07,320
totally soul satisfying
homecoming. In that moment, I

686
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,100
was shown given a series of
experiences that showed me that

687
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,260
there is an infinite territory
beyond where I was, so that the

688
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,500
idea of getting to the end of a
journey was just I let it go. It

689
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,700
didn't work anymore. So now,
instead of trying to reach some

690
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,800
spiritually defined definition
or end state of enlightenment or

691
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,740
nirvana or oneness with God, now
I feel much more patient with

692
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:42,940
opening up, taking what's given
to you, healing, receive the

693
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,560
teaching, but keeping it within
a measure that's kind of more

694
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,640
practical, so that there may
come time when you want to go up

695
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,620
Periscope, you know, take a deep
look around. But a lot of the

696
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:01,860
really productive work, I think,
is done at a lower level, we

697
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:07,740
don't have to tear apart our
psyche as deeply as I did, or

698
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:13,500
other people do sometimes in
order to really remember who we

699
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:19,140
are, remember what's happening
in history. So I guess I would

700
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,580
counsel a gentler approach into
these things.

701
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,980
Stephen Gray: Good one. Yeah,

702
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,760
Chris Bache: now, as a
philosopher who had a deep

703
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,660
passion to understand how the
work world was put together, you

704
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:38,360
know that part of me, I wouldn't
trade this 73 days for anything

705
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,040
on earth. I mean, they just they
gave me an understanding of how

706
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,580
the world works, which has
changed my heart, changed my

707
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,820
life, yeah, and you know,

708
00:46:49,419 --> 00:46:52,599
Stephen Gray: but and your work
for this, for this lifetime,

709
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:57,039
too, to share that right? So on
this notion of going gentler,

710
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:00,719
maybe you could share with
people a little bit about what

711
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,499
you hope to accomplish, or what
you hope people might walk away

712
00:47:04,499 --> 00:47:06,719
with at the end of the workshop
you're going to do on the

713
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:08,819
following weekend after the
conference.

714
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,820
Chris Bache: You know, I really
don't know yet. I know what I've

715
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,060
experienced. I know what's
living inside me as living

716
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,160
memories. I'm trying to figure
out how I can make these useful

717
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,060
to other people. I know that
they're things that I know and

718
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,940
they're things that I
understand. I know that when I

719
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,020
begin to get into the memory of
these events, when I begin to

720
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:37,040
describe them or that they get
activated within me. I know that

721
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,680
my consciousness changes just in
the talking about them. I'm

722
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,300
still trying to figure out how I
can make this this living

723
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,500
experience, which is only mine
in a certain way. It's I didn't

724
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,500
give myself these experiences.
The Universe poured these

725
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,060
experiences in me. How can I
make these available to people

726
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,380
or whatever? Maybe it's not
making them available. How can I

727
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,700
be of use to people in their own
spiritual practice? Given the

728
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:10,380
history that I've gone through,
I'm now that I'm getting to do

729
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,260
the workshops. That's what I
want to explore. I want to

730
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,480
explore, for example, when we're
Can we go into guided

731
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,580
visualization exercises? When
people go kind of into deep

732
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:29,480
relaxation, or kind of a semi
hypnotic state. Can I work with

733
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,580
them in a way which will allow
them to enter more deeply into

734
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,900
their own inner being? Because
I've explored some of these

735
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,620
dimensions of my own inner
being, and therefore I have a

736
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:46,240
certain sense of some of the
ways maps can be drawn. Can I

737
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,540
convert that into something that
will be useful to people as they

738
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,280
explore their own inner being?

739
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,800
Stephen Gray: So, just so that
people understand who might be

740
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,920
interested in coming to this,
it's not going to be Chris Bache

741
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,680
yacking at you for two days,
right? You're going to do a lot

742
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,060
of exercises with people. But
what I what I sense from what

743
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,920
you're saying, and I, you know,
I have one

744
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,980
Marc Caron: thing, Steven, we're
not doing. LSD,

745
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,440
Stephen Gray: yeah, no, of
course not. No, no, no, no,

746
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,260
Unknown: but not doing anything,
any short, acting, nothing

747
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,280
there, yeah.

748
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,340
Stephen Gray: But you what I
hear you saying, and I I accept

749
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:26,420
it 100% because I know that you
know you're saying it from a

750
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,800
point, a place of humility. Is
that your energetic field, from

751
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,760
what you've accumulated in your
learning, could have an

752
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,260
influence energetically on the
room while they're doing that?

753
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,020
Is that a correct way of putting
it,

754
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,020
Chris Bache: I think so. I mean,
basically, this is what happened

755
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,020
with my students. What I wrote
about in the living classroom,

756
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:53,320
my so called individual,
experiencing my deeper

757
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,380
consciousness, with the larger
consciousness the mind of the

758
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,920
universe, had an effect on my
students, which was a.

759
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Combination of healing and
liberating and kind of causing

760
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,480
them to face things in their
life that they may not were

761
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,040
initially wanting to face, but
when they did, it had a very

762
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,180
beneficial outcome. So that I
know that my being and their

763
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,100
beings are interconnected in
these very, very subtle ways. So

764
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,580
I would think that something
similar happens whenever people

765
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:30,980
gather in groups with a shared
intention, and they're engaged

766
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,860
in meaningful exercises which
everyone kind of chooses to

767
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:42,280
participate in, that our
energies interacts. Their energy

768
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,620
comes into me, my energy flows
into them, and the question then

769
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,980
becomes, well, what can we do
with our shared intention? How

770
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,600
deeply can we take this? What
insights can we, you know,

771
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,320
trigger and what healing I find
that when I teach in workshops,

772
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,100
people, the healings take place
without me intentionally doing

773
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,700
it or doing anything. It's just
when we get together, we open

774
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,920
our hearts and minds, things
happen

775
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,720
Stephen Gray: beautiful, you
know, just from the Department

776
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,260
of wild ideas, so to speak. Have
you ever considered doing

777
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,120
something like this with, say, a
very light dose of a psychedelic

778
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,860
to amplify or potentially deepen
that collective possibility

779
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,280
there.

780
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,360
Chris Bache: Well, that, of
course, is the way shamans

781
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,440
typically work. Will often work
their client or subject will be

782
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,360
using a sacred medicine, and
they will use the same sacred

783
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,600
medicine, perhaps a lighter
dose, to go into these states

784
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,620
together. That's, of course,
there's so much history behind

785
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,440
it, we know that that works.
Well, I've never done that.

786
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,120
First, I don't, I don't. I have
chosen not to be a therapist,

787
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:59,260
not to sort of work with people
going into psychedelic states.

788
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,400
That was a conscious choice on
my part. That's a different

789
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,420
skill set. You know, I'm
comfortable there, but I've

790
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,260
chosen to push my own limits
rather than help people push

791
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,100
their limits. But as a teacher
now, this is something different

792
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,260
when, because just opening our
minds and our hearts to these

793
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:25,700
Horizons has a very powerful
impact. I find now there may

794
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,360
come a time when I would do what
you're suggesting, that time is

795
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:38,240
not now. Now my time is to sort
of get the ideas out, to engage

796
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,040
in the psychedelic circle and
see where our discussion and

797
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:49,240
exercises can take us. And also
I, at the end of this work, I

798
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,940
don't want to go too deeply into
this, but basically at the end

799
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:00,100
of my work, there were energies
that were moving deeper and

800
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,780
deeper into my physical body,
into my psychological body, and

801
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,500
then deeper internalization
process. And I realized at the

802
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,760
end of my work that in order to
let this process mature and

803
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,740
complete itself, I had to not
alter my consciousness. I had to

804
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:20,840
not amplify it. I had to sit
still and let these energies

805
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,900
come into me rather than go out
to meet them.

806
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,540
Stephen Gray: You talked about
even having to stop using

807
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,540
cannabis for that reason, didn't
you? Well,

808
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,520
Chris Bache: a little bit
different with the cannabis. But

809
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,160
when I let me back up and tell a
different story around that when

810
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,440
I stopped my sessions in 99 I
had been given so many gifts,

811
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,900
and there were so many treasures
that I had been given. I thought

812
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,360
that stopping my sessions would
be a pretty straightforward

813
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,020
process. I could just stop, and
I would be able to remember and

814
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,860
be nurtured by these many
wonderful experiences. But what

815
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,360
I found was that it was more
complicated than that. What I

816
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:05,160
found is that I had entered so
deeply and so intimately into

817
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,360
dimensions of the Universe and
dimensions of the Divine. You

818
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:16,260
know that when I stepped back
into time, space, consciousness,

819
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,860
and I knew that I was my
journey, my psychedelic journey,

820
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,840
was heads over at least this
part of my journey was over.

821
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,760
Over the years, I entered into a
very kind of deep existential

822
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,980
sadness. I was literally
suffering from withdrawal of the

823
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,060
Divine, from the Divine. I just
I knew I would never have the

824
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,220
type of ecstatic joy that I had
had in my deepest sessions,

825
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:48,580
where coming light transformed
there, and I I got developed an

826
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,700
over attachment to marijuana
during this period, because I

827
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,300
was kind of self medicating, and
the marijuana allowed me to kind

828
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,300
of stay a little bit above the
earth and not come completely

829
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,620
off the mountain. And.
Eventually I had to address that

830
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,880
and to give that up in order to
come completely off the ground,

831
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,580
off the mountain, to get
completely grounded in time

832
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:13,440
space, in order to continue the
integration process that had

833
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,240
been taking place inside the
sessions themselves. So my work,

834
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,320
a lot of my work, and it's not
that I never touch it, or I

835
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:25,520
don't do psychedelics at all,
but my work is primarily a

836
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,720
contemplative work now, and one
of the things I'm experimenting

837
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:35,840
with is how to build, how to
take classical spiritual

838
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,780
practice, which for me, come out
of the Vadnais tradition, some

839
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:44,620
of these classic, you know,
deity exercises, Guru Yoga

840
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:49,900
exercises, meditation,
contemplation exercises, how to

841
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:56,800
empower those by drawing upon my
memories of these specific

842
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,580
states of consciousness which
are relevant to these outcomes.

843
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:07,020
So it's trying to develop forms
of spiritual practice which

844
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,200
consciously integrate
psychedelic experience without

845
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,460
trying to replicate

846
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:14,939
Stephen Gray: them. Sounds like
a good sort of long term plan

847
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:18,539
for people heading toward
eldership. Hey, Mark, it's been

848
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:20,359
an hour or more. What do you
think should

849
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,320
Marc Caron: we we're pretty much
ready to wrap it up. It's almost

850
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:29,600
an hour, because I feel like we
can dig in and go deep every

851
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,140
time we speak with you, Chris.
And of course, we want to leave

852
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,560
something for the guys who and
gals who come to the conference,

853
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,120
of course, and for the two day
workshop, which is the place to

854
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:45,340
really go into the deep dive,
but I just love so much of what

855
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,700
you shared today. There's some
things that really stuck with

856
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,000
me, and one was just about
gestation, birth and

857
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,280
convulsions. It really, really
kind of struck a chord with

858
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,040
what's kind of happening in the
future, as well as just some of

859
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,400
your other, you know, brilliant
insights in terms of your work.

860
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,820
So I personally thank you for
that, and I look forward to

861
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,160
meeting you again this year at
the conference. I don't know,

862
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,000
Steven, you got something else
you want to, you know, rabbit

863
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,200
hole you want to go down?

864
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,320
Stephen Gray: No, absolutely
not. No. I mean, that's a long

865
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,400
discussion, and a lot of great
stuff came out. I hope for

866
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,920
people. I just hope a lot of
people see this and then come

867
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,040
and see, you know, come to the
conference, if they're not

868
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,220
already, you know, signed up to
do that, and are you gonna do

869
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,980
your little FBl, 33 thing today?
Mark,

870
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,720
Marc Caron: you just did it.
Steve,

871
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,260
Stephen Gray: better explain
what it is. Then

872
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,200
Marc Caron: it's, no, it's no
it's not like some five Meo or

873
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:49,420
anything. FPL, 33 for anybody
watching this, or, you know,

874
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,580
wanting to come to the
conference, since the prices are

875
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,640
up, at regular price, it's just
a discount that we're offering

876
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,120
you for watching the video and
being part of our community,

877
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,160
being curious, looking for
answers, being on the path. And

878
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:06,420
yeah. So FBl, 33 is something
there for you there. And we're

879
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,960
just always happy to connect
with you. Chris. I look forward

880
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,260
to another great weekend,
another great VIP party. We look

881
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,120
forward to that one too. We had
a good time. We

882
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,720
Chris Bache: had a good time.
And I just, I'm really honored,

883
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,920
and looking forward to coming
back to Vancouver, coming into

884
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,060
the conference when I was there
last time, I had just finished

885
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,480
writing the book end stages, and
that was all about the book

886
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,960
that's going to come. And now
the book is out. The book will

887
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,380
be available in Vancouver for
the first time, and I'm just so

888
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,080
pleased to be able to bring it
to this particular audience,

889
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,640
because I was so moved by all
the participants in last year's

890
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,160
conference and the excellent
speakers that you had gathered.

891
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,640
It's a real, living vitality,
vital, vital community that

892
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,580
you've created there. It's just
a pleasure and an honor to be

893
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:51,940
back

894
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,280
Stephen Gray: there. Wonderful.
Hey, Mark, before we go, though,

895
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,800
maybe you should just say a wee
bit more about this workshop

896
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,500
that Chris is going to be doing,
because it sounds like it's

897
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,120
going to be amazing to me. I
actually can't go myself, or I

898
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,260
would definitely go.

899
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:10,440
Marc Caron: I'm going to post it
in the comments of this

900
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:17,040
interview, this conversation,
but it's really a talk on this

901
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,920
book, and Chris can tell us more
about the event, but it's going

902
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,900
to be on the Hang on. Let me
just pull up the date Chicago. I

903
00:59:23,899 --> 00:59:26,179
Stephen Gray: think he already
explained it. I'm thinking more

904
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:28,219
they can get tickets and
whatnot.

905
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,580
Marc Caron: Put that link out
here, because it's right here. I

906
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,620
just didn't have it at my ready.

907
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:34,700
Stephen Gray: Sure.

908
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,520
Chris Bache: It's going to be
the Friday and Saturday, the

909
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,100
weekend after the conference,
and it's going to be two full

910
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,520
days with a meal provided, I
think, right, yep, lunches,

911
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,880
yeah, so it's going to lunches.
It's going to be an opportunity

912
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,300
to really settle down and sink
deep into the mystery, into this

913
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,020
material. But it's also it's a
dialog. It's about sharing our

914
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:00,540
experiences and processing them
together. And it's. Exploring

915
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:05,580
different exercises so that we
can not just absorb these ideas

916
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:09,480
intellectually, but absorb them
in our hearts and

917
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,960
psychologically into our souls.
Wonderful. I'm really looking

918
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,840
forward to it. It's a new it's a
new adventure for me, and I

919
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,420
think it's going to be a lot of
fun. Great.

920
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,680
Marc Caron: I've just shared it
in the comment section on on the

921
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,680
Facebook feed. So for anybody
interested, they can find it

922
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,320
there. It's on the spirit plant
medicine website, conscious

923
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,520
living Network website, it is
all out there. And it's in some

924
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,820
promotional materials and emails
going out with our pre and post

925
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,420
conference events as we get
geared up for a month leading up

926
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,620
to the conference, it's going to
be go time. It's kind of what

927
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:48,160
makes me thrive and go a little
crazy. And I enjoy the pressure

928
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,340
because it's the pressure seems
to be what it takes to get

929
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,860
things done for me. Thank God
for a deadline.

930
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:59,560
Stephen Gray: Yeah, you know,
and Mark deserves an immense

931
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,980
amount of credit, because you're
working really hard at this

932
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,460
mark.

933
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:06,659
Unknown: Yeah, there's a
conference like this.

934
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,080
Marc Caron: I'm just enjoying
the process learning new things

935
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,080
every time, because there's a
lot of, you know, moving parts.

936
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,800
And also, it's like Steve Steven
says to me today, you got that

937
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,260
on your list mark, and I go
list. I'm supposed to have a

938
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:24,980
list. Oh, no. So, yeah, it's
it's go time. We're four weeks

939
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,280
away, four weeks away tomorrow.
So anybody out there want to

940
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:32,120
come? Happy to have you there.
And we're looking to be a sold

941
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:37,940
out crowd. There might be one
day tickets available, but,

942
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,140
yeah, happy to see it all happen
for the ninth year. Thank you,

943

00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,460
Donna Loeffler: Hi everyone.
Welcome to LSD and the mind of

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,220
you of the universe, with author
Chris Bache. The format of this

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,520
meeting is going to go as
follows, I'm going to introduce

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,480
everyone, then the we're going
to have a Q and A and as John

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,540
said, just put your question in
the chat. Let us know who it's

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,480
directed to, and we'll try to
answer as many questions as we

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,840
can. Our panel, Teresa and David
are have some questions that are

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,460
going to be asked first, and
that will be, basically be the

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,540
format. So I have the honor to
introduce Chris Bache. We are so

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,440
happy he is here with us today.
He's here from North Carolina.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,260
He is a professor emeritus in
the Department of Philosophy and

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,920
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University, where he

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,740
taught for 33 years. He is also
adjunct faculty at the

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,140
California Institute of integral
studies, Emeritus fellow at the

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,880
Institute of Noetic Sciences,
and on the advisory board of the

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,500
Grof legacy training. Chris's
passion has been the study of

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,740
philosophical implications of
Non-ordinary states of

18
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,840
consciousness, especially
psychedelic states, an award

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,900
winning teacher and
international speaker. He has

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,120
written four books, life cycles,
a study of reincarnation in

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,480
light of contemporary
consciousness, research dark

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,860
night, early dawn, a pioneering
work in psychedelic philosophy

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,020
and collective consciousness,
the living classroom, an

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,860
explanation of collective fields
of consciousness and teaching

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,240
and LSD in the mind of the
universe, the story of his 20

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,020
year journey with LSD. Chris is
a father of three, a vaccineer

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,060
and lives in Weaverville, North
Carolina, welcome Chris, and

28
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,520
thank you so much for being here
today.

29
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,920
Chris Bache: Thank you Donna, my
pleasure, and thank you everyone

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,580
for spending part of your Sunday
with me. It's a pleasure to be

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,140
here, a pleasure to talk about
these things, and I'm really

32
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,860
looking forward to our
discussion that follows my

33
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,440
comments here. So let me first
shift us into share screen so I

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,280
can throw this PowerPoint up and
people can let me know if this

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,280
is coming through correctly.
John, we're looking good.

36
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,199
John Hock: We are looking good.
Good.

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,420
Chris Bache: All right, what I'd
like to do today is simply take

38
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,520
you into some of the highlights.
It's kind of a highlight reel of

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,420
my book, LSD, in the mind of the
universe, As Donna mentioned,

40
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,540
I've written four books, but all
of them come out of my

41
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,180
psychedelic work, and all of
them, and this book summarizes

42
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,580
the entire trajectory of my 20
year journey working with LSD. I

43
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,660
consider it probably the most
important book I will write in

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,360
my life, and it's an honor to
share it with you here today. So

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,340
let me give you some background
when I came out of graduate

46
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,780
school in 1978 I was a
philosopher of religion and kind

47
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,840
of an atheistically inclined
agnostic, and I was looking for

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,240
where to take my research next.
And it was at that juncture that

49
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,660
I met the work of Stanislav
Grof. Let me get my picture out

50
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,180
of here, a little bit of Stan
Grof and this book changed the

51
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,440
course of my life. All right,
come on. Get to me. Here we go.

52
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,880
Here we go. These two books,
realms of the human unconscious,

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,540
which Dan had just published two
years before, and LSD

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,680
psychotherapy, his manual on
conducting psychedelic sessions.

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,240
I immediately saw not only the
psychological significance of

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,080
Stan's work, but the
philosophical significance to

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,400
actually be able to explore
experientially the deep states

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,300
of consciousness that allow us
to experience the deep structure

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,000
of the universe itself that
immediately I recognize had

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,980
profound philosophical
significance. So what I did was

61
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,240
to split my life in half. During
my day job, I continued to teach

62
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,880
at the university. I was
teaching in a Department of

63
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,820
Philosophy and Religious
Studies, doing the things that

64
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,520
professors do. And in my
nighttime job. I began a 20 year

65
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,640
journey working in Stan Grof
protocols with high doses of

66
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,840
LSD, recording all my
experiences systematically.

67
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,440
Yeah, that's that's the back
story to the book. Now, as you

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,580
know, instead. Dan's work, he
differentiates clearly between

69
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,440
low dose psyche therapy and high
dose psychedelic therapy. Low

70
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,820
dose, maybe up to 100 sessions
unfolding the mind gradually,

71
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,660
layer by layer, psychedelic
therapy limited to three

72
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,740
sessions designed to trigger
something approximating a near

73
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,180
death episode experience for
people who were facing death. So

74
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,220
after three introductory
sessions, medium dose sessions,

75
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,180
what I eventually chose was to
work in the high dose

76
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,580
psychedelic therapy protocol. I
eventually did a total of 73

77
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,600
high dose sessions, and I tried
to be as systematically,

78
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,100
systematic and rigorous as I
could. I followed the same

79
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,240
protocol in all these sessions,
the same sentence, setting, same

80
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,340
sitter, same substance, same
dose level, same recording

81
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,600
process and even the same
location working in Northeast

82
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,140
Ohio, I mentioned that because,
as you know, sometimes the

83
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,500
setting in which we do our work
can influence the nature of the

84
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:19,680
experiences itself. So this was
a long, sustained inquiry into

85
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,480
the deep structure of
Consciousness in the Universe.

86
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,860
Now, I saw myself, at the time,
simply doing an extended course

87
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,700
of psychedelic therapy, but when
I got to the end of my journey

88
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,780
and I was looking back, I
realized that this was more than

89
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,980
simply psychedelic therapy, that
I was encountering phenomena and

90
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,020
dealing with challenges that
were not being addressed or had

91
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,900
not been addressed in the
psychedelic therapy literature.

92
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,020
And so eventually I named this
particular protocol, psychedelic

93
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,760
exploration. The protocol the
methodology, is that of

94
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,380
psychedelic therapy working in
isolation, protected with the

95
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,180
sitter, eye shades, headphones,
the whole nine yards. The usual

96
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,900
thing, the difference is the
number of sessions. The high

97
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,640
number of sessions allow, turns
this into something more than

98
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,620
therapy, into an exploration of
the deep structure of the

99
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,640
universe. So of course, there
are many uses for psychedelics.

100
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,400
We use psychedelics for many
different purposes, for

101
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,540
recreational purposes or to
augment creativity. Let me

102
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,400
mention just three purposes that
stand out in my world. One of

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,720
them is, of course, therapeutic
healing, as this picture from

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,280
map shows which is generating so
much attention in the literature

105
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,600
and so much important attention
in this new renaissance. The

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,520
second use is for spiritual
awakening, as we see reflected

107
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,280
in this dialog between the
Buddhist community and the

108
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,760
psychedelic community. Zigzag
Zen the use of psychedelics to

109
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,460
facilitate a spiritual awakening
into one's deeper essential

110
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,140
nature. And this is actually why
I got started in psychedelics

111
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,280
myself, was to accelerate my own
spiritual transformation

112
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,740
process. The third is
cosmological exploration, and

113
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,660
this is what my journey turned
into, cosmological exploration.

114
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,400
And by this I mean not simply
collecting insights that arise

115
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,700
whenever we open in a
psychedelic state, as always

116
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,740
happens, but the systematic
pushing the boundaries of

117
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,660
consciousness again and again
and entering into deeper and

118
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,040
deeper communion with the
consciousness that lies within

119
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:59,260
and behind the universe itself.
I kept detailed, careful notes

120
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,180
of all my sessions, writing up
every session within 24 hours,

121
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,100
track the dates of my sessions.
Of course, even looked at the

122
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,900
astrological variables of my
sessions, exploring correlations

123
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,320
that Stan and Richard Tarnas
have proposed. Now, few more

124
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,840
introductory comments before we
jump into the book itself. The

125
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,800
story that I'm telling in LSD in
the mind of the universe is not

126
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,380
primarily a personal story. It's
primarily a cosmological story.

127
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,940
I found that this series of sine
waves represents a series of

128
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,920
psychedelic sessions, which I've
drawn overlapping in order to

129
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,960
emphasize the continuity that
runs between our sessions. I

130
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,800
found that insights into my
personal life tended to arise in

131
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,240
the beginning and endings of my
sessions, when I was leaving and

132
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,880
and coming back to times. Based
reality working in this

133
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,220
modality, and I worked at 500 to
600 macrograms, which, as I

134
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,160
explained in the book, is a
protocol that I don't recommend

135
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,080
working at such high dose
levels. When I was in my peak

136
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,800
hours of my sessions, I was
usually operating far beyond my

137
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,360
personal reality, at least after
the first 10 sessions or so. So

138
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,380
sometimes an entire session was
given over personal healing, and

139
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,560
sometimes I would be shown
certain correlations between

140
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,300
what I was being seeing and what
I in my own personal life. But

141
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,420
for the most part, when I was in
my sessions, I was operating at

142
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,620
a state of consciousness that
far outside my personal

143
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,520
consciousness, and When I've
tried, when I've written down my

144
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,660
experiences, I

145
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,600
uh, unmute.

146
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,380
Donna Loeffler: Hold on, Chris,
you're muted. Hold on, hold on

147
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,180
one moment. Okay, there you go.

148
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,920
Chris Bache: Okay. I actually
filtered out a lot of my

149
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,820
personal experiences or
experiences of personal healing,

150
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,340
because I did not consider them
primarily important to the story

151
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,320
I wanted to tell. If you're
writing about therapeutic

152
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,940
psychedelic use, then your
personal experiences are, of

153
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,900
course, absolutely essential.
But I was really functioning as

154
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,680
a philosopher of consciousness.
I wanted to explore the deep

155
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,160
structure of consciousness. All
of us have a story. All of us

156
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,060
have a personal story, but this
personal story tends to fall

157
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,820
away the deeper one enters into
the cosmological journey. Now I

158
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:03,780
found that let me get some
reason I'm losing contact. Yeah,

159
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,540
let me back up just a second. I
found that there was a

160
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,520
continuity between my sessions,
that one session tended to start

161
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,660
to end and the next one would
start exactly where the previous

162
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,140
one had ended, more or less,
with some varying degrees of

163
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:26,660
overlap. And in that process, I
found that one I went through,

164
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,160
not one, but a series of
Death-Rebirth experiences. In

165
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,840
this graph, everything below the
line is time, space reality and

166
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,980
our consciousness functioning in
time. Space reality above the

167
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,360
line is Transpersonal
consciousness when we enter

168
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,520
spiritual reality. And of
course, when one makes this

169
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,180
transition from time space
consciousness to spiritual

170
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,980
consciousness, one goes through
an ego death experience, which

171
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,800
Alex Gray has illustrated so
powerfully in this picture,

172
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,880
which I like very much, a
complete loss, a complete

173
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,740
destruction of one's individual,
ordinary, conscious identity.

174
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,320
What I found on my journey was
that as I continued to press the

175
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,220
limits of my consciousness, I
went through not just one type

176
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,500
of Death-Rebirth experience at
the egoic level, but a series of

177
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,040
Death-Rebirth experiences, and I
began to understand that death

178
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,780
and rebirth is a cycle that
repeats itself as you enter

179
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,920
deeper and deeper levels of
consciousness. And if we use the

180
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,120
vocabulary that Stan uses as we
enter psychic, subtle and causal

181
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,420
levels of consciousness. Now, I
don't have any vested interest

182
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,740
in any particular metaphysical
ladder or description of these

183
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,720
deeper states of consciousness.
The in my experience, the

184
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,840
universe is infinitely deep. One
can enter hundreds of levels of

185
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,180
consciousness. This is simply of
the articulation of a principle

186
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,260
that, as we stabilize
consciousness at one level, when

187
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,580
we go deeper, we have to go
through yet another cycle of

188
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,460
complete surrender in order to
enter into the initiation that's

189
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:29,180
possible at this deeper level of
consciousness. In some ways,

190
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,680
working particularly with high
doses of LSD, has been compared

191
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,580
to a nuclear bomb. The nuclear
bomb was created in the same

192
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:45,340
decade that LSD was created, but
a long sustained series of

193
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,660
psychedelic experiences focused
in a therapeutic modality,

194
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,720
triggers, as it were, a
sustained nuclear explosion, not

195
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,080
only destructuring reality as
you have known it, but

196
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,900
introducing you. You into deeper
and deeper levels of reality,

197
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,320
the way this nuclear explosion
exposes deeper levels of the

198
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,820
atmosphere that were always
there but had been invisible

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,740
until this nuclear explosion
brought them into our awareness.

200
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,280
Now we're not talking about
nuclear bombs, of course. We're

201
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,700
talking about this beautiful
universe that we are part of,

202
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:37,280
100 billion galaxies, billions
of stars in our own Milky Way

203
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,880
galaxy. So I'd like to use this
picture now as the backdrop to

204
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,260
talk about some of the turning
points on my journey and some of

205
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,300
the levels of reality I entered
when I was looking back over the

206
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,660
whole of my journey and trying
to create the structure for the

207
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,040
telling of the story. I
identified five core levels of

208
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,040
consciousness, are core cycles
of death and rebirth that I went

209
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,280
through, one having to do at the
level of personal mind, personal

210
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,500
consciousness, the second
collective mind, or the species

211
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:25,460
mind, the third archetypal mind,
the fourth operating at the

212
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:32,180
level of call, so oneness, or
the one and the fifth diamond

213
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:37,100
Luminosity. So this is the
organization I used in actually

214
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,920
creating the travelog that's in
the book. So let me back up and

215
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,320
simply pull out the chapters or
take you through the book,

216
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,940
identifying the sequence of
experiences. Can't talk about

217
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,420
them very much in the brief time
we have, but just give you some

218
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:01,740
sign posts. The chapter dealing
with personal mind is the

219
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,920
chapter two, crossing the
boundary of birth and death.

220
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,380
This is, in my experience, this
was like classic perinatal

221
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,760
Death-Rebirth process. I felt
like a poster boy for Stan Grof,

222
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,120
description of the perinatal
process, very intense

223
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,860
convulsions, very intense
confrontations with the

224
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,360
meaninglessness of life, with
the limits of existence,

225
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,760
eventually, after, in the course
of two years and 10 sessions,

226
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,380
coming to a point where the
universe just snapped me like a

227
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,140
twig. It just basically broke me
in half, and it did that by

228
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,340
forcing me to become the exact
opposite of everything that I

229
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,620
had known myself to be. I
entered this work as a male,

230
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,280
white, male academic,
passionately interested in the

231
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,420
meaning of life. I became the
exact opposite of that. I became

232
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,740
hundreds of women, women of
color, women who have no

233
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,360
interest in philosophical
inquiry at all. It was just it

234
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,040
was a terrifying ordeal, and
when I let go and I surrendered

235
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,080
to that ordeal, I was then
flipped into the positive side

236
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,220
of women's experiences and taken
on the most extraordinary

237
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,820
journey of women's experiences
under the arm of the great

238
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,020
mother. Now I believe in
reincarnation. I believe we all

239
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,480
have had lives as men and women
and but this wasn't simply an

240
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,100
encounter with my previous lives
as women. The message here was

241
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,040
not embrace your former lives.
The message was where you are

242
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,280
going. Gender does not exist.
Let go. And when I let go of my

243
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,860
identity as Chris Bache, as I
had known myself, I entered into

244
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,860
the beginnings of a deep
conversation with the universe,

245
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,420
a deep communion with the
universe. And I thought, after

246
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,140
having gone through this very
deep ego death, that my

247
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,620
suffering was over then, now
that I would just be introduced

248
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,360
to a banquet of cosmological
insights. But that's not what

249
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,340
happened at the level of
collective mind. There are

250
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:29,300
several chapters here. Now I
divide my sessions, or my

251
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,740
sessions divided themselves into
two halves, a purification, a

252
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:41,260
purifying stage, our cleansing
stage and an ecstatic stage in

253
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,980
the sessions. In the two years
following the crossing the

254
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,840
boundary of birth and death in
the in the purifying stage, I

255
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,560
began to enter levels of of
reality that involved hundreds

256
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,640
of 1000s of people, 1000s and
1000s of. Years a vast domain of

257
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,320
terrible anguish and suffering
and violence. I was brought back

258
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,820
into this domain consistently
and taken deeper and deeper into

259
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,040
it. At first I thought this
represented a deepening of my

260
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,280
ego death. But this went on for
so long and it involved so many

261
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,540
people in such excruciating
detail, that eventually I came

262
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:32,300
to a different conclusion. And
the conclusion was that somehow

263
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:38,960
in my sessions, my personal
reality, sort of, my personal

264
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,420
transformation, had been
exchanged or had been had been

265
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,900
surrendered, and became a
process of collective

266
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,920
transformation that the healing
that was taking place and the

267
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,240
uncovering of trauma that was
taking place was not about my

268
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,560
personal healing and not about
my personal trauma, but was

269
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,120
about collective healing, the
healing that our species has

270
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,740
collected over its 1000s and
1000s of years of history.

271
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,300
When I went into the ecstatic
portion of the same sessions, I

272
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,980
entered in what I called deep
time in the chapter, deep time

273
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,220
in the soul. I had a for one
year. I had a repeated

274
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,440
experience, seven sessions of
experiencing my life, from start

275
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,080
to finish, beginning to end as a
simultaneous present. I

276
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,160
experienced the beginning of my
life, the end of my life, all

277
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,860
the middle of my life as a
completed whole, as something

278
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,440
yet to be and something that was
already complete when I first

279
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,160
entered deep time. It was an
extraordinarily powerful and

280
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,820
moving experience to me, and
yet, when I came out of the

281
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:02,580
session, I lost it. I couldn't
remember it. But what I found

282
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,640
was that by going back into the
same state of consciousness

283
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:11,700
again and again, my experiences
in those states got clear, my

284
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,440
recall got more complete. I was
learning how to stay awake, stay

285
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,040
conscious inside deep time. And
this is an important

286
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,560
epistemological point when you
systematically enter states of

287
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,040
consciousness that are so far
removed from anything we know

288
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,760
inside time and space, it's very
hard to bring back all our

289
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,080
experiences intact. But if you
go back to the same state of

290
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,380
consciousness with rigor and
discipline, eventually your

291
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:46,120
consciousness adapts to the
unusual conditions, and you

292
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,780
learn how to stay awake in
states of awareness that

293
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,840
previously had simply swallowed
you. And this repeats itself, or

294
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,860
in my experience, it repeated
myself over and over and over

295
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,260
again when I would break into a
new state of consciousness, it

296
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,960
was very hard to retain
everything that I had

297
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,220
encountered, but with with
repetition, my recall got

298
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,400
stronger. Now, quick, just a
side comment. In my 20 year

299
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,920
journey, I worked for four years
I stopped for six years for

300
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,220
reasons given in the book, and
then I resumed for a very

301
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,720
intense 10 years. This is where
my journey stopped after four

302
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,600
years, and then I took a six
year hiatus, and when I began,

303
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,500
this is reported in the chapter
initiation into the universe

304
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,080
when I began the ocean of
suffering began exactly where it

305
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,120
had stopped six years before
without missing a beat, and it

306
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,480
continued to deepen and deepen
and deepen in intensity.

307
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,560
Meanwhile, in the ecstatic
portion of the session, I was

308
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,900
taken into an extraordinary
journey into the universe,

309
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,340
completely transcending anything
to do with my personal life that

310
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,540
was over now. It was as if the
consciousness guiding my

311
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:20,600
sessions was giving me a crash
course in cosmology. 101, now i

312
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,700
i give names to all my sessions.
I give names, I take notes, I

313
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,820
break them down into bullet
points. When I see the name, it

314
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,740
brings the entire session to
mind. My goal as a philosopher

315
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,900
is to hold my entire journey in
my mind at the same time. So the

316
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,640
names of the sessions that I
address in this chapter are as

317
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,420
follows.

318
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,000
All of these were operating at
the subtle level of

319
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,800
consciousness beyond the psychic
level of consciousness. They

320
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:06,540
were. All taking me deep into
this learning about how the

321
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,820
universe is put together. The
master plan was an initiation

322
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,080
into some of the core themes of
humanity's evolution. And I'm

323
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,140
going to come back to this
later. Eventually, the ocean of

324
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,940
suffering culminated in session
24 healing the collected womb.

325
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,000
The suffering that I was
absorbed into reached

326
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:38,840
unprecedented levels, and then
it culminated in this orgy of

327
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,120
healing, healing, this
collective pain, and then it

328
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,560
disappeared. And the collective
pain, the ocean of suffering,

329
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,060
never reappeared in any
subsequent session, we then went

330
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:57,100
on to the next level of work.
And the next level of work for

331
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,148
me involved an encounter that
took place at the archetypal

332
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:06,068
level of consciousness in the
chapter the greater real of

333
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:11,648
archetypal reality, so much that
I could say here trying to keep

334
00:26:11,648 --> 00:26:16,088
it short so we can go into the
questions and answers soon, I

335
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:20,108
found that basically, I could
break down My experiences here

336
00:26:20,108 --> 00:26:23,900
between two levels, one level
taking place at the highest,

337
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,160
subtle level, at the what you
might call platonic level of

338
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,420
consciousness, in which I
experience archetypes that lay

339
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,160
far, far beyond time and space.
But they were not archetypes as

340
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,020
Plato described them. Plato
describes archetypes as

341
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:46,180
unchanging, eternal ideas in the
mind of an of an eternal Deity,

342
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:52,240
I experienced archetypes as
vast, living processes so

343
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,160
radically beyond anything we
know of inside time and space,

344
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,840
anything I had known of that I
literally could not wrap my mind

345
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,860
around them, the closest I could
come to seeing them in any

346
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,360
coherent way was I saw them as
galaxies, which was simply the

347
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,560
best my mind could do to
approximate them. They were

348
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,340
operating in a different order
of time, a different order of

349
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,040
intentionality, and these were
the constitutive forces that

350
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,300
were responsible for creating
time and space and creating the

351
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:32,060
reality that was unfolding
inside time and space. At a

352
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,080
lower, subtle level, also at the
archetypal level, I entered what

353
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,920
you might think of as a union
level of consciousness where I

354
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,100
had repeated experiences of the
universe of this mind of our

355
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:51,580
species operating as a single
whole, one mind of the entire

356
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:59,680
species. And I was given
repeated lessons in how the how

357
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,320
this works. How is it that each
of our individual minds are

358
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,360
fractal aspects of the mind of
the species? How our individual

359
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,040
karma is part of our collective
karma? I began to have

360
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,500
experiences at this level of
collective reincarnation. That

361
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,960
is, I began to have experiences
of the entire species

362
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,660
incarnating, generation by
generation as a single unified

363
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,460
whole. Previously, I thought of
reincarnation in terms of the

364
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,420
individual, the story of the
individual soul, the story of

365
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,540
all of our individual souls,
choosing individual lives for

366
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,580
our individual development. But
here all this dissolved into an

367
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:54,220
experience of the entire species
as a single organism evolving

368
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,860
itself through a deep, profound
collective process, and all of

369
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,860
our individual lives were
fractal aspects of this deep

370
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,440
collective process. The
magnitude of what I was seeing

371
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,180
completely reframed my
understanding of the

372
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:20,040
intelligence operating inside
the universe and in our own

373
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:27,680
evolution these are the sessions
which I address in this chapter.

374
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,520
And I'd like to point out how
much cleansing is involved, even

375
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:41,140
at this high archetypal level.
Session 28 The fever is broken.

376
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:47,080
Was a very high my first
encounter with call so reality,

377
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,940
very pure, celestial state of
awareness, after which I was

378
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,220
plunged into three grueling
sessions of just excruciatingly,

379
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,680
excruciating purification. It
took me a long time to

380
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,520
understand what was happening
here, but eventually I began to

381
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,440
realize, to begin to understand
the following, that every step,

382
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,240
every deeper level of reality
functions at a higher level of

383
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,860
energy. And when you break
through to a higher, a deeper

384
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,460
level of reality, your entire
psycho physical system has to go

385
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,600
through a purification process
that will allow you to handle

386
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,140
the enormous flows of energy
that are operating at that

387
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:38,840
higher level of reality. This
repeated itself again and again

388
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,460
after I would have a major
breakthrough into a new level of

389
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:48,520
reality. The following session
was always kind of a carrying

390
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,900
out the garbage session. It was
always a session of deep

391
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,700
cleansing. So much so that I
began to dread the session

392
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:04,620
following a major breakthrough
session. Again. This is, this is

393
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,080
an insight that's important if
you, if you touch a deep state

394
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,580
of consciousness very briefly,
this may not manifest itself,

395
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,660
but if your goal is to have
sustained awareness at a

396
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,340
particular level of reality,
then you must go through this

397
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:27,020
cleansing ordeal, otherwise your
experiences at that deeper level

398
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,860
will be fragmented and you won't
be able to bring back a coherent

399
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:38,360
story. After moving into
archetypal reality, I then went

400
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,300
into what I came to understand,
this causal reality. Causal

401
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:50,380
oneness was an extraordinary
year of blessings, one blessing

402
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,960
after another. The four sessions
that I address in this chapter

403
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,380
are these. The forest was an
experience of Shunyata, what the

404
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,360
Buddhist call Shunyata,
emptiness of self, profound

405
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,220
transparency, no self in me, no
self anywhere in the world.

406
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,900
Experience the world as a
manifestation of diversity, but

407
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,960
complete interpenetration and no
separate self anywhere in

408
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,460
existence, singing the universe
away was an experience that

409
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,840
culminated in an experience of
the void, the fertile void out

410
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,180
of which all existence springs.
Jesus's blood was an experience

411
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,860
of profound, cosmic love, love
unlike anything I had ever

412
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,620
experienced up to this point in
time, the birth of the diamond

413
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,240
soul. Let me just linger there
for just a second, the

414
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,900
traditional teaching of
reincarnation. This was about

415
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,440
reincarnation. The traditional
teaching here is that when we

416
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,780
achieve a certain state of
spiritual maturity, we awaken to

417
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,500
our spiritual essence, and at
that point, then we leave time

418
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,640
and space. The Hindus call
awakening spiritual awakening

419
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,340
moksha, to escape Samsara to
escape cyclic existence. When

420
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,500
one reaches spiritual maturity,
one then Transcendence, time and

421
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,280
space. You can leave Samsara.
You can enter the Pure Land. You

422
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,900
can enter the Garden or enter
Heaven. In this experience, in

423
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,660
session 38 I was given a very
different model of

424
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,100
reincarnation. I began to
experience all my former lives

425
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,500
coming into me very quickly, and
it was like wrapping a filament

426
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,940
of white light around a kite
spool. And at some point,

427
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,380
all these lives fused, and there
was a huge energy generated, and

428
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,400
it catapulted me into a state of
consciousness beyond any that I

429
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:03,240
had experienced up to that time.
I was both an individual, but I

430
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,660
was an individual beyond any
frame of reference that I had

431
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,460
imagined previously. And I came
to understand there was when I

432
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,420
this happened. There was an
explosion of diamond light from

433
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:20,900
my chest, and I was given a
series of teachings that this is

434
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,460
where reincarnation is taking
humanity. We're not simply

435
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,300
growing incrementally, lifetime
by lifetime, year by year,

436
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,680
century by Century, making
incremental improvements in our

437
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:40,700
developmental sequence, becoming
more bit by bit, actualizing our

438
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:46,060
innate potential. Eventually we
come to a point where all of our

439
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:52,960
former lives merge, we
experience our soul. Now I think

440
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,500
this happens when we die and we
return to spirituality, but the

441
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,920
birth of the diamond soul is the
birth of soul conscious.

442
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,280
Consciousness inside our
physical incarnation. I think

443
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,280
that humanity is evolving in a
direction where eventually every

444
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,040
human being born will be born,
not into a contracted, egoic

445
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,160
consciousness, contracted into
our time space person, but every

446
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,640
human being will be born as a
soul more conscious, fully

447
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,000
conscious of their past, and in
a much deeper communion with

448
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,880
surrounding spiritual reality.
From here, my sessions took me

449
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,100
next into the diamond Luminosity
material in the chapter called

450
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:54,340
Diamond Luminosity. Now this
chapter covers 26 sessions and

451
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:00,244
four years of work. And in those
four years, I entered this

452
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:05,344
state, which I call diamond
Luminosity, four times and only

453
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:10,984
four times, I entered a state of
reality that was beyond anything

454
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:15,664
I had previously touched. It was
exceptionally, exceptionally

455
00:36:15,664 --> 00:36:20,464
clear, luminous reality I had
touched light many times before

456
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:24,740
I had been taken into light many
times before, but this was a

457
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:30,140
higher order of light than any I
had previously known. And when I

458
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,440
call this light the diamond
Luminosity, I'm not simply using

459
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,120
a metaphor to describe the
light. I'm trying to describe a

460
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,100
particular register of light, a
particular quality of light.

461
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,640
I've learned that light has
many, many levels to it. There

462
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,360
are many gradations of light,
and this was an exceptionally

463
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:56,200
pure state of luminous
awareness. I think that this is

464
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,080
what the Buddhists would call
Dharmakaya, the clear light of

465
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,180
absolute reality. In between
these four immersions, there

466
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,140
were, as you might guess,
repeated episodes of deep

467
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,740
cleansing, profound
purification, many personal

468
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:20,600
healings, and then coming back
into these states of hyper,

469
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,940
clarity. So much more that I'd
like to say here, but I'll let

470
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:34,280
it stop here and and move on the
ninth chapter. And I wish I had

471
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,100
written the book and put it in
this order, because this is the

472
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,800
order it really belongs. One of
the recurring themes that kept

473
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,920
coming up in all of my work,
going all the way back to the

474
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,820
chapter on the initiation End of
the Universe, was this master

475
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:54,580
story of humanity. I kept being
taken into the deep future and

476
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,740
being taken into the deep
structural evolutionary process

477
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:04,740
underpinning history, and I kept
being given a series of visions

478
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,820
about where humanity was in its
evolution and where we were

479
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,360
going. And what I've done in the
book is I've pulled all these

480
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,960
bits and pieces, rather than
address them bit by bit, I

481
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,620
pulled them together and
presented it into this one

482
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,680
chapter, the birth of the future
human. And let me say that when

483
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,540
I began this work, I never
imagined that I would be talking

484
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,080
about the birth of the future
human. I thought of this work as

485
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,060
personal transformation,
personal awakening. And yet I

486
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,200
think that this chapter may be
the most important chapter of

487
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,300
the book, because if the visions
shared here are true, they

488
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,900
concerned my children, my
grandchildren, your

489
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,320
grandchildren, all of the
children of our grandchildren.

490
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,880
The vision that emerged this
here is that humanity is coming

491
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,580
to a turning point in its long
evolutionary journey, a turning

492
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,480
point that will forever change
the conditions of life on this

493
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,740
planet. Here's the material I
address in this chapter, the

494
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,160
visions of awakening. I gather
all the snippets of bits and

495
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,560
pieces from these sessions that
covered over four years into a

496
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:29,480
series of six visions, which
basically are powerful visions

497
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,080
that are indicating that the
creative intelligence of the

498
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,400
universe is trying to awaken the
entire species, not simply

499
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,120
individuals, but the entire
species. Now for there to be a

500
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,820
profound collective awakening,
there must be a profound

501
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:56,440
purification. And in session 55
which took place in 1995 I was

502
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:03,360
taken deep into the future, and
I. Apologize for the seemingly

503
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,060
absurd nature of this
description, but if you've been

504
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,840
with me so far, you'll go with
me here. I hope I was taken deep

505
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,280
into the future and experienced
not as an individual, but as the

506
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,660
human species as a whole. I
experienced the death and

507
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:24,800
rebirth of our entire species. I
experienced the entire world

508
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,320
coming into a profound global
systems crisis that seemed to

509
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:37,520
have been generated by a series
of global ecological crises. Now

510
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,000
I was not informed on ecology at
this time, I was not at all

511
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,480
aware of the series of
ecological challenges that we

512
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,560
are facing, which we are all
quite aware of. Now. This was in

513
00:40:53,560 --> 00:41:00,540
1995 so this is over 25 years
ago, and yet I was taken into a

514
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,200
future where I experienced
humanity being brought to their

515
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,900
knees, a radical loss of all the
certainties that we live with in

516
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:16,140
life, a complete loss of
control, just an absolute life

517
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,120
threatening, species
threatening, crisis that went on

518
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,580
for years, and yet, just when it
was at its worst, Just when it

519
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:31,400
seemed as if all was lost, the
storm passed, and when the

520
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,780
survivors picked themselves up
and began to reassemble, they

521
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,100
were different. They had been
changed profoundly at the core

522
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,380
of their being by the intensity
of the crisis that we had all

523
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,860
gone through, they were
different. Their hearts were

524
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,740
different. Their minds were
different. They began to

525
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,300
generate powerful patterns of
new patterns of civilization

526
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,740
based upon the new values, the
new understanding, the new

527
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:05,580
insights that had been awakened
in them during this crisis. So

528
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:12,060
much more to say there, but I'll
have to stop at that point. The

529
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:18,420
11th Chapter, final vision, is
the last year of my work, which

530
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,360
included one particularly
intense session, the most

531
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,020
radical strip down that I had
gone through in any of my

532
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:32,720
sessions, taking me far, far
into the future and giving me a

533
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,000
series of experiences of our
universe that seemed to be the

534
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,960
capstone of everything that had
taken place on my journey up to

535
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,920
this point in time. I won't try
to summarize it here, because

536
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:52,900
time is the clock is
relentlessly moving. And the

537
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,860
last chapter, which I don't
think you can see here, is

538
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:02,820
coming off the mountain in which
I describe what happened when I

539
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,020
stopped my journey?

540
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,180
Long story, I will say that this
was the hardest chapter for me

541
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,500
to write. It took me over a year
to write this chapter, because

542
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,280
when I stopped my journey, I had
been given so many gifts on this

543
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,600
journey, I thought that I could
simply withdraw and would

544
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,800
receive the blessings of all
these visions that I had been

545
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,680
given. I would you know, I had
been given the gift of a

546
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,900
lifetime as a philosopher, but
what I found over time was that

547
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,540
I was entering into a state of
deep existential sadness as I

548
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,240
sat with this and lived with it.
Over time, I realized that I was

549
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,400
suffering from a withdrawal of
intimate communion with the

550
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,620
divine fabric. I eventually
reached a point where I realized

551
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:58,360
I was simply waiting to die so
that I could return to intimacy

552
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,160
with the divine could dissolve
into the divine light again,

553
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,780
because once you've dissolved
into the diamond Luminosity,

554
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:15,240
time space can lose it can lose
its appeal. It took me years. It

555
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,560
took me about 10 years to
finally consolidate myself back

556
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,320
into time space in a way that
allowed me to live contentedly

557
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,580
within time and space and the
conditions of time space. And I

558
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:35,300
did so by grabbing my life and
focusing myself on living in the

559
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,720
physical world, in the continued
assimilation of the impact or

560
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:47,800
the implications of the visions
that I had been given. All my

561
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,060
books come out of my psychedelic
work. The work on reincarnation

562
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,580
comes out of my early work in
deep time, in the soul, dark

563
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:01,020
night, early dawn, though it was
published after. My Sessions had

564
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:06,900
ended. I did all this work
between 1979 and 1999 I talk

565
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,260
about my journey in dark night
early dawn, but I only talk

566
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,620
about the first half of the
journey. I really don't talk

567
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,280
about the second half. The core
theme of dark night early dawn

568
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,440
is the collective structure of
consciousness and the collective

569
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,660
import of our transformative
practices. And then I wrote a

570
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,040
book called The living classroom
in 2008 and very quickly, the

571
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,180
back story of that book is that
even though my students never

572
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,600
knew anything about my
psychedelic experiences, and I

573
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,740
did not talk about my
psychedelic work on campus for

574
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,700
obvious legal reasons, I found
that my students were being

575
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:50,500
impacted by my psychedelic work.
That they were there was a

576
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:55,240
ripple effect that the deeper I
went into the Unified Fabric of

577
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,560
Reality, it was as if the it was
center sending ripples of

578
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,480
transformation out around me,
and my students were being

579
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,340
impacted by those ripples.
Eventually, I had to study them.

580
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,700
I had to really understand more
deeply what was taking place,

581
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,360
what was happening. And I wrote
the living classroom, which is

582
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,500
about collective consciousness,
and I don't mention psychedelics

583
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,880
there at all, because
psychedelics are not the issue.

584
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:28,040
The issue is the nature of
consciousness itself, and it

585
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,340
doesn't make any difference
which transformational method

586
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,720
you're using. If you go deeply
enough into the structure of

587
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,680
consciousness, you will have
ramifications that will spread

588
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:46,060
out around you in 360 degrees.
All of these come out of my

589
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:53,500
psychedelic work, and it is
where we go here. Yeah. LSD, in

590
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,960
the mind of the universe,
diamonds from Heaven really

591
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:01,140
tells the core story of this
journey. Thank you very much for

592
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,420
letting me describe it to you
today.

593
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,400
Donna Loeffler: Thank you so
much, Chris. It does tell the

594
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,080
story in detail. It's an amazing
book. I highly recommend it,

595
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,560
especially after hearing this
talk, before we move on to the Q

596
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:26,480
and A, I'd like to introduce our
two co hosts and our CO one of

597
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,340
our CO hosts, Teresa is going to
ask a few questions, but I'm

598
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,760
going to give introductions
right now. Teresa Marie is a

599
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,540
certified coach and speaker on
neuroscience and consciousness.

600
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:43,120
She has a master's degree in
organizational development from

601
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,540
John F Kennedy University.
Teresa has spoken

602
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:50,800
internationally and has a TEDx
talk on what the dying can teach

603
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,140
the living. Teresa and Dr David
Jackson, an anesthesiologist co

604
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,860
facilitate psychedelic
psychotherapy sessions using

605
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,200
ketamine and other psychoactive
medicines. David uses his

606
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,680
medical, scientific and problem
solving nature to work with

607
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,340
clients to find the right
medicine, and Teresa supports

608
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:15,300
clients through the integration
work of the medicine. The goal

609
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,620
is to make clients conscious of
unconscious patterns that keep

610
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:24,440
them in the cycle of depression,
anxiety and addictions so that

611
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,180
they can experience personal
transformation. Their integrated

612
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,320
approach helps clients achieve a
more meaningful experience

613
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,020
existence rather Teresa. You
want to

614
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,040
Teresa Marie: say, hello, hello.
How are you? Okay?

615
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,300
Donna Loeffler: And Dr David
Jackson. Dr Jackson is an

616
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,040
anesthesiologist and functional
medicine doctor with his BSEE

617
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:53,380
from Rice University and MD from
Southwestern Medical School,

618
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,820
David developed his interest in
transform a transformative

619
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,980
mental wellness and entheogenic
treatment of addiction in a

620
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,760
family member after 30 plus
years of failed conventional

621
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,360
therapy, using his experience
with the practice of

622
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,980
anesthesiology, Dr Jackson has
developed specific means for

623
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,360
mitigation of undesirable
effects pharmacological

624
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,680
treatment, while developing
compounded therapies tailored

625
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,720
for optimal effect, timing and
safety. David emphasizes the

626
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,160
importance of interaction with
concurrent medications, age,

627
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,600
coexisting medical conditions,
medical and therapeutic history,

628
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,040
precision dosing, chemical
purity and safety through the

629
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,560
education of therapists and
clients. David partners with

630
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,860
Teresa for an integrative
approach to transformative

631
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,340
therapy for enduring results,
and offers telemedicine

632
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,240
consultation to determine the
best advantageous approach to

633
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,700
your wellness. Welcome David.

634
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,379
Unknown: Thank you, Donna, thank
you. Chris. Was awesome. Thank

635
00:50:01,379 --> 00:50:01,499
you.

636
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,820
Donna Loeffler: Okay, at this
point, we're gonna go to the Q

637
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:10,920
and A and we're gonna start with
Teresa. Chris.

638
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,200
Teresa Marie: That was an
amazing talk, and I love it. And

639
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,980
I have to tell everybody his
book is really wonderful, really

640
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,680
wonderful. Can everybody hear
me? Okay, okay, great. So I

641
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,340
would love for you. You know you
worked with Stan Grof early on,

642
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,400
and you know you worked with an
awful lot of protocols and

643
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,360
things like that. And I know a
lot of people will indicate in a

644
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,960
lot of ways, that, okay, well,
can you get to these states of

645
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:41,140
consciousness other than through
psychedelics? So what? How would

646
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,980
you compare like Holotropic
Breathwork to your high LSD

647
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,340
sessions? Because you've trained
with him a little bit.

648
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:54,279
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, I've
not done any of Stan's training

649
00:50:54,279 --> 00:50:57,159
in the Holotropic Breathwork. I
mean, train Stan as a colleague

650
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:00,279
that we've we've been in dialog,
and we've been on podiums

651
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:05,459
together. And I consider Stan to
be the primary intellectual

652
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:09,239
figure that I've been in dialog
with as I've unfolded my own

653
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:14,219
account. Yes, absolutely, one
can enter into these states

654
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:17,639
without using psychedelics.
Psychedelics are an amplifier of

655
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:21,079
consciousness. So in the end,
it's consciousness that does the

656
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:25,399
work. I've had many people write
me after this book has come out,

657
00:51:25,399 --> 00:51:28,999
and say, I understand what
you're saying. I've had many

658
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:32,659
similar experiences myself, and
I've never used psychedelics.

659
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:37,639
I'm a lifelong meditator, so on
and so forth. As an academic,

660
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:40,479
I've taught courses in
comparative mysticism, and I've

661
00:51:40,479 --> 00:51:44,619
studied, you know, the lives of
the great masters, the great

662
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:48,579
spiritual masters, who certainly
moved into these states and into

663
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:53,439
even deeper states of
consciousness. And clearly, all

664
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:56,799
the great masters, all honor to
the great masters. They've

665
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:01,379
always been my guides in this
process. So, yes, one can move

666
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:07,199
into these states without
psychedelics, but we're talking

667
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,519
about not just a few years of
work, or even a few decades of

668
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,539
work. We're talking about
lifetimes and lifetimes of

669
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:18,539
consistently working to push
these boundaries. The great

670
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:25,999
spiritual masters have been at
this for many lifetimes. My

671
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:29,539
sense is that Holotropic
Breathwork is a very powerful

672
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:36,079
evocative, you know, amplifier
of consciousness. I think it

673
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:41,619
basically, it can evoke states
of consciousness equally strong

674
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:48,999
to psychedelic states. I don't
know think that it would be I do

675
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,939
not have enough experience to
truly say this, but my

676
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:56,499
impression is, in talking with
many practitioners, that I would

677
00:52:56,499 --> 00:53:00,359
think that Holotropic Breathwork
would be able to generate states

678
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:05,159
that are comparable to low or
medium dose LSD sessions, but

679
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:10,199
not high dose LSD sessions, not
the type of states of

680
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:13,439
consciousness that open in a
sustained series of such

681
00:53:13,439 --> 00:53:17,459
sessions. But we're talking
these are points on the

682
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,879
continuum. I've had some very,
very deep experiences in

683
00:53:22,879 --> 00:53:26,659
Holotropic Breathwork sessions
that were certainly in many

684
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,639
respects comparable to my
psychedelic experiences. Great.

685
00:53:31,699 --> 00:53:35,419
Teresa Marie: Thank you so much.
Now you also talk a lot about

686
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:38,419
the future human, and you talk
about kind of that we're going

687
00:53:38,419 --> 00:53:41,739
to go through a lot of
suffering. Okay, well, most

688
00:53:41,739 --> 00:53:46,179
transformation tends to happen
in suffering, and it's kind of a

689
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:49,419
shame that it's that way. I
always say that, but it propels

690
00:53:49,419 --> 00:53:53,559
us on. Can you talk a little bit
more about kind of what some of

691
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:56,619
your visions were? Because how
about have some of them come to

692
00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:00,159
pass, since what you saw in the
90s, have some of them come to

693
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:03,239
pass? Or are you still waiting
for some of them to come to

694
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:06,179
pass? Because I think that, I
think a lot of people are really

695
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:10,379
interested in that. Yeah.

696
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,900
Chris Bache: You know, the
consistent theme in my sessions

697
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,680
was positive, that humanity was
coming to a turning point in

698
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,000
history, that humanity, after a
very, very long evolutionary

699
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,660
journey, was coming to a
decisive turning point that was

700
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:36,860
changing the course of history,
that there was we're coming to a

701
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:41,440
collective spiritual explosion,
and that this was being driven

702
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,580
from underneath this. It was, it
was a decision made at a

703
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:50,440
cosmological level, driving up
underneath us and surfacing in

704
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,220
our individual lives that we
were cooperating with, but was

705
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,480
much larger than the simply the
act of all of our individual

706
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,120
lives. It's really. Only, only
one particular session where I

707
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:09,000
was taken into the specific
conditions of our death and

708
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,840
rebirth, our collective death
and rebirth. And in that vision,

709
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,860
in that session, session 55 I
wasn't given any details. I

710
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,560
wasn't given any time. I wasn't
given any specific experiences

711
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,600
of like covid 19 or anything
like that, what I experienced

712
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,280
was the entire species of the
planet being brought to its

713
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,700
collective knees, being entering
a period of profound

714
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:40,700
compression, profound loss of
control, deep, deep existential

715
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,960
anxiety. Angst and just an
absolute almost hopelessness,

716
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,740
just being overwhelmed by the
conditions we were facing. And

717
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,160
then in the depth of that, in
some ways, a collective

718
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,780
Death-Rebirth process, like a
collective near extinction

719
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:05,940
event. And in that process, we
meta morphized, we changed. We

720
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,440
became more than we had been
before. Now, in many sessions

721
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,620
leading up to that, I was taken
into what I think are the nuts

722
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,740
and bolts of this, and that nuts
and bolts of this are

723
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:21,020
reincarnation. I think that we
have been evolving and

724
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,260
developing ourselves and
becoming more for 1000s and

725
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:29,480
1000s of years. And just as
gestation is a long, gradual

726
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,520
process of development, but
birth is a very short, cathartic

727
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,920
process, likewise, human
evolution is a long, gradual

728
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,880
developmental process, but the
birth of the next level of human

729
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,600
experience, the next form of
humanity, the birth of the

730
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,200
future human, which I think will
be the birth of the diamond soul

731
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,600
in history. That birth process
is, relatively speaking, short

732
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,100
and cathartic. I don't know how
long it will take. I would I

733
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,040
would anticipate that it would
take multiple generations. This

734
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:10,320
is an evolutionary pivot that
we're making. I have had

735
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,400
experiences where I was taken
into the future and allowed to

736
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,600
experience the future human,
experience the archetype of the

737
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:25,880
future human and those
experiences drove me into deep

738
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,080
ecstasy. It was some of the most
profoundly moving experiences of

739
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,820
my journey. Because we're we're
talking about a human, a

740
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,560
humanity healed of all the scars
of history, of all the terrible

741
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,760
things that we've done to each
other, a humanity with its

742
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:47,380
consciousness open, capable of
profound communion with the

743
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,880
creative intelligence of the
universe. I think we are going

744
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,600
through a developmental process.
We're coming into the hard part.

745
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,200
We're coming into the birth
process. And I think it's really

746
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,340
important for us to have a
vision of what this is all

747
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,520
about. Because when it starts to
get really bad, and I think

748
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,900
covid May be the overture of the
symphony of our transformation,

749
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,880
it is not itself sufficiently
powerful to bring about the

750
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,480
events that I that I experienced
in my sessions. But I think it's

751
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,420
an overture. It shows us. It's
teaching us a lot. It has taught

752
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,720
us a lot, if we're paying
attention a lot, that can be

753
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,740
very helpful when the deeper
crises come. And I think the

754
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,460
deeper crises are going to be
any number of forms of

755
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:40,180
ecological punctuated crises
that are going to hit us wave

756
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,320
after wave in the decades ahead.
Now we're getting a better sense

757
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,080
of what's coming at us. We can
see it with you know, we've got

758
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:52,420
good maps. Dwayne Elgin's book
choosing Earth gives a the next

759
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:56,080
five decades, breaks it down
decade by decade of the

760
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,500
challenges we're facing, there
any number of books that are

761
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,360
pointing this out to us, so I
think we can see what's coming.

762
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,840
The challenge is understanding
the evolutionary implications of

763
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,360
what's coming. Yeah, yeah,

764
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,960
Teresa Marie: I would agree.
Thank you. So there was a

765
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,440
question in the chat that asked
you about when you said the same

766
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,300
set and setting each and every
time, can you describe your set

767
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,600
and setting? For those who have
not read your book, I know what

768
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,600
the set and setting is, but you
know it would be really helpful

769
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,920
for you to explain how that
worked in your process.

770
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,960
Chris Bache: I do a lot of
preparation for every session. I

771
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,680
take good care of my body. I
make sure that my body is

772
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:50,440
relaxed and clear. I watch my
diet, particularly in the day

773
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,680
session day, personally, I would
always start in the morning. I

774
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,160
start in the early morning with
yoga and meditation. I was

775
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,520
always working either at home
or. In my wife's office. My

776
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:08,040
wife, then Carol, was a clinical
psychologist. She was my sitter

777
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,840
for all of my sessions. All my
sessions were focused on

778
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,480
spiritual intention. I found
that I tried experimenting with

779
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,500
setting an intention for my
sessions, but I found that

780
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,120
working with doses is high. That
basically was irrelevant. My

781
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,080
personal intention became
irrelevant, so that my intention

782
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:34,460
became one of absolute, complete
surrender. My prayer was

783
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:39,320
whatever you need. I give you
whatever the universe needed

784
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:45,100
from me on that day is what I
would give after the session. I

785
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:50,320
mean, I always wrote my sessions
up within 24 hours the next day,

786
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,960
I developed, the more frequently
you go into these states in a

787
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,620
sustained manner, the greater
the impact is on your subtle

788
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:06,060
energy system. I found that it
was really important to do very

789
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,500
active spiritual practice,
particularly after a session. So

790
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,740
later, when I was entering the
diamond Luminosity work, it was

791
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,160
during that time that my
spiritual practice became more

792
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,800
focused on Vajrayana Buddhism.
So I do specific practices

793
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:27,440
before a session and different
practices after a session. I

794
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,480
found that when I began to do
these Vajrayana practices, these

795
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:37,280
ancient practices that have very
old morphogenetic fields

796
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,520
associated with them, it had a
distinct impact on my journey.

797
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,960
It had it really helped
facilitate, not only the entry

798
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:50,860
into these deep states of
consciousness, but it helped me

799
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,440
absorb the insights and the
energy of the impact with these

800
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,020
deep states of consciousness. So
a lot of intentionality and

801
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,500
these experiences take a lot out
of your body. I mean, these are,

802
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:09,600
you know, huge you're subjecting
yourself to huge tidal waves of

803
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:14,760
energy. So careful preparation,
careful focus, and then very

804
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,820
careful debrief. It's absolutely
essential.

805
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,160
Unknown: Chris, you mentioned,
didn't you mention that music

806
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,220
was a pretty big part of your
journeys, at least in the

807
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:29,480
beginning, and the replaying of
the music afterwards to help you

808
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,540
with your recollections. Did you
feel like that's important, or

809
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,600
that is important even at that
level, your higher levels later

810
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,820
in your sessions?

811
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,960
Chris Bache: Yeah, I worked. I
used music in all of my

812
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,320
sessions, all the way through
very carefully selected music.

813
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:49,780
You know, there's we have
literature on the theoretical

814
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:53,980
approach to the stages of a
session, matching the stages of

815
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:57,640
the session with the music that
has qualities that match the

816
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:02,460
stages of sessions. I like never
working with music that has

817
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:06,420
English, if there are words at
all, it would have words that

818
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:09,120
you couldn't understand. You
don't want to trigger familiar

819
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:14,700
associations. I very quickly,
after a year or so, I let go of

820
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,940
classical music for the most
part, and used almost

821
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,800
exclusively indigenous music. I
found that to be much more

822
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,180
powerful evocative for me. When
I would write up my sessions, I

823
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:30,440
developed a strategy for
improving recall. I would listen

824
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,520
to the music that was played in
the session in exactly the same

825
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,420
order in which it had been
played, and I would keep playing

826
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:41,680
the same music over and over
again while I was writing up the

827
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,640
session, until I felt I had
captured what had happened

828
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,000
during that piece of music. Then
I would go to the next piece of

829
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,900
music and I would continue the
process. I found that playing

830
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,560
the music of the session while I
was writing up the session

831
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:01,140
allowed me to get a more
complete portrait down in print

832
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,920
of the session itself, and
really helped improve recall.

833
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,480
Thank you. Now I've also done
subsequent, I mean, after I

834
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,840
stopped my high dass LSD work,
of course, I've done other

835
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,380
sessions since then, sometimes
I've used music, sometimes I

836
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:21,740
haven't used music at all. I
understand. I understand just

837
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:25,640
opening up without music as well
as opening up with music, but

838
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:31,220
for me, working with high doses
of LSD, the experiences are so

839
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:35,660
intense, so extreme, I found
working with music to be a very

840
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:38,840
helpful adjunct to the opening
process.

841
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:44,319
Teresa Marie: Great. Thank you.
Also you, you mentioned in your

842
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:47,499
book too, that, of course, your
LSD doses were primarily between

843
01:04:47,499 --> 01:04:49,779
five and 600 micrograms,
correct.

844
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:54,219
Unknown: Yes, yes.

845
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:57,040
Teresa Marie: And then you've
mentioned after you, of course

846
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:01,020
you had that down regulate where
you connect. With the divine.

847
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,380
And you you felt oneness of
everything and that amazing

848
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:08,040
consciousness state, and then to
kind of come back down here to

849
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,880
this state and this everyday
being can be a little

850
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,640
disappointing. And you'd
mentioned that you had tried

851
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,880
other, other psychedelic
medicines, and someone had

852
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,200
asked, you know, in the chat,
you know, I know you said you

853
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,020
tried Ayahuasca and Psilocybin,
but you didn't feel like they

854
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:29,600
were as powerful as LSD in your
journey. Can you express a

855
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,040
little bit as to you know why
you feel like that was the case?

856
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,360
Chris Bache: Well, there are
many, many psychedelics, of

857
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,420
course, 1000s of sympathetic
psychedelics, hundreds of

858
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:49,600
organic psychedelics. My sense
is that each psychedelic, while

859
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,120
having the common feature of
opening consciousness,

860
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,840
amplifying consciousness, each
psychedelic has a particular set

861
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:00,540
of qualities and activates, has
a potential to activate a

862
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:06,180
certain range of consciousness.
Serial usage over multiple

863
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:09,600
sessions can deepen that range,
but there's basically a certain

864
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:14,280
range and a certain quality. I
experience LSD as being kind of

865
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,780
what I would call a high ceiling
psychedelic. It tends to push

866
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:23,240
the cosmological ceiling,
whereas Psilocybin tends to be

867
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,920
much more body grounded,
emotionally saturated, tuning to

868
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,880
our physical body, tuning to our
emotional body, it has ceiling,

869
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:36,140
but it's my experience of it is
it tends to be a much more of

870
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:40,780
kind of an embodied, open to
state, rather than a potentially

871
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,200
disembodied open state, or far
from bodied, open state,

872
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,980
Ayahuasca, I've had limited
experience with, but it seems to

873
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:52,060
me similar, in that way, very
closely integrated with the

874
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:56,980
body, with the emotional body.
It has more headroom in my

875
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:02,880
experience than Psilocybin does,
though I have only initial

876
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,900
preliminary experience with
that. I have had some experience

877
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:11,520
with five Meo, DMT, very
different psychedelic, very

878
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,120
potentially profound,
catapulting psychedelic. The

879
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,000
challenge with that
particularly, of course, it's so

880
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,220
short acting, and that opens up
a whole nother area of

881
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:26,600
discussion, short acting
psychedelics versus long acting

882
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:31,280
psychedelics. And I discuss this
in the book. I think there is,

883
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,880
there are certain advantages.
There are clearly disadvantages

884
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:39,620
to the hassle of a long acting
psychedelic but there are some

885
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:44,620
advantages. It does allow the
kind of sustained contact with

886
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:49,840
these deep, Non-ordinary states
that leads to a purification of

887
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:55,300
the mind doing the exploration.
Short acting. Psychedelics don't

888
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:59,620
give you as large a window to be
changed and transformed by the

889
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,540
dimensions of consciousness that
you're contacting. This was

890
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,380
Richard trust Strassman
observations from his work with

891
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,340
DMT. He found, much to his
surprise, that while many of his

892
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:16,020
subjects had profound
experiences on DMT, it did not

893
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:21,140
result in very lasting change to
their personality structure, and

894
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:24,200
he thought it was because it's
very short acting. It's the

895
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,580
window which is important, which
is significant here. Thank you.

896
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:32,360
So I don't I think what I did in
my work was to drill an

897
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,200
unusually deep borehole into the
universe. But there's so much

898
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,160
that I didn't see, so much which
these other substances revealed

899
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,300
to us which I did not
experience. I mean Psilocybin

900
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:46,600
and Ayahuasca connect us to the
elemental world. They connect us

901
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,840
to the world of spirit. They
connect us to the the all the

902
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:54,520
levels of intelligence that kind
of live close to and saturate

903
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:58,480
time, space, reality, so many,
many levels that I did not

904
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,900
particularly engage or touch.

905
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:06,000
Teresa Marie: Okay, thank you.
So I know we have some questions

906
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
in the chat. So, David, do you
want to address some of the

907
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,120
questions in the chat? Thank
you.

908
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:19,859
Donna Loeffler: That was a
beautiful answer. Chris, I just

909
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:25,879
want to say that that was just
so well said. And I've got a

910
01:09:25,879 --> 01:09:30,919
question, or John hawks got a
question, actually, David, while

911
01:09:30,919 --> 01:09:34,939
you look, why don't we let John
ask his question? Go ahead,

912
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:35,239
John,

913
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,500
John Hock: couple quick ones,
actually. Well, this first one

914
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:45,400
may not be quick. I asked Stan
Grof at one point directly if

915
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,900
there was anything that he could
correlate a difficult trip with

916
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:55,240
and he said his work with Tarnas
and his own work turned up that

917
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,560
a hard transit to Mars to nail
Mars was the only thing he could

918
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:07,200
point to. That would predict a
difficult trip, and at the time,

919
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:11,520
he was still working with Rick
to go further. Now, I find it

920
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,580
fascinating that you charted
correlations while you were

921
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,940
doing your journeys, and I'm
wondering specifically, if

922
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:21,320
you've come what sort of
correlate, what things have

923
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,640
correlated astrologically and
specifically, has there been

924
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,400
something that would correlate
to a breakthrough, to moving to

925
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,300
a higher level?

926
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:34,699
Chris Bache: Yeah, good
question, and a complicated

927
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:40,279
question I'm aware of, and Rick
Tarnas is a good friend as a

928
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:45,399
Stan, and I'm aware of Stan's
writing in his analysis of

929
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:49,179
certain cases and and the
astrological correlations of

930
01:10:49,179 --> 01:10:52,959
certain people going through
breakthroughs. I'm aware of the

931
01:10:52,959 --> 01:10:58,359
proposal that the outer planets
correlating with the perinatal

932
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:04,739
matrices seem to be somewhat
predictive of the patterns of

933
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:08,339
oppression, contraction,
breakthrough and liberation in

934
01:11:08,339 --> 01:11:11,819
people's experiences. I've
looked at these correlations in

935
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:15,179
my own work and on the one and
first of all, I completely

936
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:19,019
accept the proposal that they've
made. I understand it. I think

937
01:11:19,019 --> 01:11:23,299
that makes sense the
intelligence of the universe

938
01:11:23,299 --> 01:11:27,979
that I experience. It makes
intuitive sense that the rhythm

939
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:32,359
of the universe would be part of
the rhythm of this intelligence,

940
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:36,559
and that as we open up beyond
personal psyche, that there

941
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:42,699
would be this kind of this solar
system pulse to the nature of

942
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:49,419
our experiences that said, I
have not found correlations to

943
01:11:49,419 --> 01:11:54,759
be as striking as I had
expected, and I have found that

944
01:11:54,759 --> 01:11:59,919
as my work deepened over the
years that I could not correlate

945
01:12:00,519 --> 01:12:05,379
breakthroughs and impasses with
astrological variables as much

946
01:12:05,379 --> 01:12:09,339
as I had expected to do, and so
that led me to formulate a

947
01:12:09,339 --> 01:12:14,259
hypothesis, and I call it the
roll off hypothesis, and that is

948
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:18,459
in the early stages of our work,
or when we're working at lower

949
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:22,699
doses, or In earlier stages,
when our time space identity is

950
01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:26,299
being unfolded and impacted, I
think there'd be stronger

951
01:12:26,299 --> 01:12:31,879
correlations between our natal
transits, the transit to our

952
01:12:31,879 --> 01:12:36,799
natal chart, or even our global
transits. But as when works once

953
01:12:36,799 --> 01:12:42,099
work deepens, when you begin to
go into and beyond archetypal

954
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:45,819
reality. When you're going
beyond time and space and deep

955
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:51,039
into the universe, I think that
there is a roll off effect of

956
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:55,779
the planetary correlates to
experience. At least, I found

957
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,559
that the dynamic relationship
with the universe, the way the

958
01:12:59,559 --> 01:13:04,439
universe crushed me and kissed
me and drew me out and melted me

959
01:13:04,499 --> 01:13:11,639
into herself. Did not seem to
correlate tightly with specific

960
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:16,259
planetary correlation. Sometimes
it did, sometimes it didn't. So

961
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:19,499
I think there is a roll off
effect. My proposal is that

962
01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:24,439
there's a roll off effect of
astrological import. Now this is

963
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:27,799
an open question. I'm not an
astrologer, and this is

964
01:13:27,799 --> 01:13:32,239
something I'm interested in.
It's an active dialog between

965
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:38,179
Richard Tarnas and myself about
this, about this issue. Yeah.

966
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:42,999
Thank you for that. This is why,
in my book, I actually put the

967
01:13:42,999 --> 01:13:46,719
dates of all of my sessions, and
I give my birth information,

968
01:13:47,499 --> 01:13:51,759
because I would like to
encourage this discussion of the

969
01:13:51,819 --> 01:13:56,199
correlations between astrology
and our own psychedelic

970
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,399
experiences.

971
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:02,280
John Hock: Thank you very much.
So excellent, excellent answer,

972
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:06,360
and your hypothesis makes an
awful lot of sense. I'm going to

973
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,540
stop my questions now and let
other people open it up for

974
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,300
other people, there's a number
of very good questions in the

975
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:12,600
chat.

976
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,540
Donna Loeffler: So David, did
you? Did you have

977
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,480
Teresa Marie: one or Teresa?
Well, Rachel had a really good

978
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,900
question. I don't know if she
wants to ask it herself, but she

979
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,960
wanted to speak a little bit
more about how your

980
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,620
consciousness work has changed
and affected your life over the

981
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:31,280
time in your physical essence
right now. In other words, how

982
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,260
has that been transformative in
your life?

983
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:44,200
Chris Bache: Good question, hard
question to answer, and I'll

984
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,960
tell you one of the things that
really complicated things in my

985
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,580
particular instance, and the
thing that complicated it was

986
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:55,060
that I wasn't allowed to talk
about my work. I wasn't I mean,

987
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:58,120
I'm a teacher. I love to teach.
I love to learn and share what

988
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,540
I've learned. I'm a.
Philosopher, and yet our

989
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:07,320
psychedelic, phobic culture did
not allow me or give me any

990
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,100
platform to bring the deepest
philosophical experiences of my

991
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,060
life forward and mind them with
my students or with my

992
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:20,340
colleagues, to extract their
philosophical potential, so that

993
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:24,740
when I stopped my sessions, the
kind of the deep sadness I

994
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:28,700
entered was not simply a sadness
that came from withdrawing from

995
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,960
the cosmological communion, but
it was a sickness which was

996
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,100
generated by silence. I have not
been allowed to talk about this

997
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:42,520
work publicly, and as I wrote
the book, I began to experience

998
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,720
a number of changes taking
place, and as I began to speak

999
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:52,360
about the book, these changes
have deepened. I found my

1000
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:57,400
sessions beginning to as it
were, come together and into a

1001
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,860
larger aggregates, into a larger
whole, as I began to own my

1002
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:05,400
sessions, to own my psychedelic
history and come out of the

1003
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:10,860
psychedelic closet, the sessions
began, as it were, to saturate

1004
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:15,120
me and soak into me at deeper
and deeper levels. And this

1005
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:20,060
process is still continuing. I
don't know where it will go. I

1006
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:25,040
live, I wish I could say, wow,
I've touched the oneness of the

1007
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,980
universe, and I live in
perpetual oneness all the time.

1008
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:31,820
You know, I live in this state
of ecstatic joy all the time.

1009
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:37,220
But it's not like that. I think
that going into these temporary

1010
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:40,480
states, and it's really
important to these are temporary

1011
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,460
states. These are not the same.
They don't have the same impact

1012
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:51,520
as touching these realities
after 30 years of contemplative

1013
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,640
practice on the top of a
mountain. It's not the same

1014
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,720
thing. These are temporary
immersions which are genuine and

1015
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:03,180
you can't, you can't abide in
these states simply when you

1016
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,900
come back when you're done, even
if you've done all your homework

1017
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,840
carefully and even if you attend
to integration very

1018
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,220
conscientiously. But they change
the trajectory of your

1019
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:18,180
evolution. They change the
trajectory of your soul's

1020
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:22,520
development. I live with an
understanding of reality that

1021
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,960
allows me to open into a
prayerful engagement of reality,

1022
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:31,940
which is certainly different
than I had in the beginning of

1023
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:37,640
this journey. And I think that
late in my sessions are at the

1024
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:43,240
end of my journey. Spirit said
to me two things. It said 20

1025
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:47,980
years in, 20 years out, meaning
it would take at least 20 years

1026
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:53,440
to assimilate 20 years of the
journey. And I think now I

1027
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,160
thought at the time that sounds
about right now I'm thinking

1028
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:01,200
that might have been optimistic.
I literally think it will. The

1029
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:06,420
things that I've touched will be
unfolding over many lifetimes,

1030
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:10,080
not simply one lifetime, but
it's changed the trajectory of

1031
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,160
the evolution of my soul. The
other thing it said to me is,

1032
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:20,720
there's the dying of seeing and
the dying of keeping. The dying

1033
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,500
of seeing is the death and
rebirth process you go to when

1034
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,700
you're being initiated into the
deep structure of the universe.

1035
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:33,440
The dying of keeping is what you
do when you were in your

1036
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,880
ordinary state of consciousness
back inside time and space, in

1037
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,920
order to let those experiences
enter into and saturate you

1038
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:46,300
deeper, more and more deeply
into your daily life. My

1039
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:52,360
practice these days is primarily
contemplative practice, Buddhist

1040
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:57,820
Vajrayana practice. I'm
basically kind of sitting still

1041
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:06,300
and letting the universe come to
me. Come to me here, rather than

1042
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,920
going out to meet it there.

1043
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:13,619
Teresa Marie: Thank you. So I
know Donna, you said there were

1044
01:19:13,619 --> 01:19:15,779
a couple more questions in the
chat you thought were

1045
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:19,620
Donna Loeffler: good. I do,
yeah. Andrew has a question for

1046
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:22,220
Chris. And you know, Chris, none
of these are going to be easy

1047
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:27,020
just because of the nature of
your work. How has your

1048
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:32,600
understanding of the future
human changed or been reinforced

1049
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:36,980
since first experiencing it in
the late 90s to the writing of

1050
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,680
this book to the present day?
Yeah.

1051
01:19:43,231 --> 01:19:49,351
Chris Bache: It hasn't changed
one bit. I say in the book that

1052
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:54,031
when I had the experience in of
session 55 the death and rebirth

1053
01:19:54,031 --> 01:20:00,719
of humanity in 1995 for weeks I
walked around one. Like I was

1054
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,579
walking around Hiroshima a week
before the bomb went off. I have

1055
01:20:05,579 --> 01:20:12,359
carried in my being in my body,
a knowing of where we are in

1056
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:18,239
history and what's coming. And
when I look around everyone

1057
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:21,499
around me, whether I agree with
them, politically or socially or

1058
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:28,339
not, I look at them and I see I
see heroes. I see every human

1059
01:20:28,339 --> 01:20:33,019
being who is here on this planet
has incarnated voluntarily, has

1060
01:20:33,019 --> 01:20:37,099
chosen to be part of this
evolutionary pivot. Every person

1061
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:40,839
here, even though they may not
remember it at all, has chosen

1062
01:20:40,839 --> 01:20:46,719
to be here, and this is going to
be a very, very difficult period

1063
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:51,279
to incarnate, and the beings who
are part of the Incarnation

1064
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:57,519
process are just extraordinarily
Powerful, valuable beings.

1065
01:20:58,419 --> 01:21:04,079
Nothing has changed. I still
it's been interesting to watch

1066
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,739
covid It's begin. It's been
interesting to watch ecological

1067
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:12,359
awareness begin to grow and
ferment. And frankly, things are

1068
01:21:12,359 --> 01:21:17,639
coming to a head or happening
faster than I had expected. I

1069
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,719
expect this decade, if
everything the scientists are

1070
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:25,699
telling us this decade is the
last window we have to change

1071
01:21:25,699 --> 01:21:29,719
the trajectory of what's coming
at us, but if the past is an

1072
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:33,499
indication, we're not going to
change as radically as we need

1073
01:21:33,499 --> 01:21:38,179
to change to avert this trauma,
and so I expect the patterns of

1074
01:21:38,179 --> 01:21:43,239
trauma to intensify in the
decades and decades coming, this

1075
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:47,679
century is going to be an
extraordinary ordeal. It is

1076
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:52,119
going to be the dark night of
our collective soul. But the

1077
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:56,979
dark night of the soul is, of
course, a process of profound

1078
01:21:56,979 --> 01:22:02,219
purification, and we as a
species are purifying ourselves

1079
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,599
extraordinarily rapidly. We're
purifying ourselves of all the

1080
01:22:06,599 --> 01:22:10,319
decisions we've made in history,
of all the choices we've made in

1081
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:13,739
the past, our choices on how to
treat each other, our choices on

1082
01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:16,259
how to treat animals, our
choices on how to treat the

1083
01:22:16,259 --> 01:22:20,159
planet itself, all of these
choices are kind of coming at us

1084
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:25,879
very, very fast and very, very
deeply. This is what I saw in my

1085
01:22:25,879 --> 01:22:28,759
sessions. This is what I've
carried. This is what I'm

1086
01:22:28,759 --> 01:22:33,919
carrying now. This is what I I
bring to my children and to your

1087
01:22:33,919 --> 01:22:38,779
children. And that is the vision
that what we are doing is

1088
01:22:38,779 --> 01:22:43,299
profoundly significant, and it's
important for every individual

1089
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:47,799
to reach as deeply as possible
and as high as possible, and to

1090
01:22:47,799 --> 01:22:53,499
manifest their the noblest
intent possible. If the future

1091
01:22:53,499 --> 01:22:57,159
were moving in the same way at
the past, if we were using

1092
01:22:57,159 --> 01:23:01,679
linear understanding of history,
we might say it's the forces

1093
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,079
arraigned against us are
overwhelming. It's just too

1094
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,839
much. The individual can't do
anything. We're just going to be

1095
01:23:06,839 --> 01:23:11,339
swallowed whatever, by these
environmental processes. But

1096
01:23:11,339 --> 01:23:14,039
that's not what I saw in my
sessions. What I saw in my

1097
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:19,619
sessions is that as the
suffering increases, the entire

1098
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:24,139
psychic field of humanity, the
collective unconscious. That

1099
01:23:24,139 --> 01:23:28,759
collective psyche is going to be
increasingly pressurized. It's

1100
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:32,359
going to be shoved into what
physicists call nonlinear

1101
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:35,899
conditions. Are far from
equilibrium conditions, and in

1102
01:23:35,899 --> 01:23:41,019
far from equilibrium conditions,
individual perturbations produce

1103
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:45,459
large changes, large outcomes,
which means that as we enter

1104
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:50,319
deeper into our crisis of
history, individuals can have a

1105
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:54,519
larger and larger share an
impact on the outcome, on how

1106
01:23:54,519 --> 01:23:58,419
this crisis will manifest. So I
think it's a time of individual

1107
01:23:58,419 --> 01:24:02,999
empowerment to facilitate deep,
cultural, profound social

1108
01:24:02,999 --> 01:24:04,079
transformation.

1109
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,840
Donna Loeffler: Thank you,
Chris. Another amazing answer.

1110
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,740
Again, I highly, highly
recommend this book. It's so

1111
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:19,500
detailed, just an amazing work,
and we're almost at the end of

1112
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:23,780
our time with you, Chris and
again, many thanks for being

1113
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:28,520
with us today and presenting on
our platform. And just as a note

1114

00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:08,112
Stephen Gray: At the end of
Chris's talk, during the this

2
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:13,272
break, Chris will be signing his
new book, and I don't know if he

3
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:17,772
was going to tell you this or
not, so I'll tell you the book

4
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:21,860
is called LSD and the mind of
the universe, and it's based on

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,380
his experiential work with LSD,
and he got the publisher they

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,620
were going to publish it, put it
out in December, and he got them

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:37,040
to agree to put out an advanced
printing for this conference. So

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:45,520
this weekend is the debut of the
book. Yeah, right. And I don't

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,300
know there's going to be enough
copies for all the people that

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,940
will really want this book,
because I've read the book I

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,760
offered, because I'm so enamored
of Chris's work, to write an

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,960
endorsement for it. And so he
stuck me in there with some of

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,120
the other big shots that gave
him endorsements. And so I've

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,540
read the electronic version of
this book, and it's a mind

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,900
blower. I'm not kidding. It is a
mind blower. So give a warm

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,520
welcome to Chris Bache, please.
Chris

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,320
Chris Bache: Give me just a
second folks to hook up my

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,220
technology. I

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,440
your fingers crossed.

20
00:01:51,820 --> 00:02:00,960
Okay, can you give me PowerPoint
on all three? Okay, all right,

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:12,600
is my is this mic working? Is it
working now? Okay, Mercury

22
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:24,620
Retrograde, right, all right,
okay, okay, great. And we'll get

23
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,420
it on the screen. Okay, thank
you. All right, how the

24
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,060
technology moves forward. It's
wonderful to be here with you

25
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,080
again, after last year, this is
such a wonderful community. When

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,760
I was here last year, I spoke to
you about a book that I was just

27
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,540
finishing, that I was calling
diamonds from heaven, and it

28
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,400
describes a 20 year journey of
using high doses of LSD, 73

29
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,240
sessions over 20 years to
explore the structure of the

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,680
universe. That book is now here.
Do we have it? Okay, let's see.

31
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:14,100
Do we have it here? Oh, come on,
work for me. Okay, let's see

32
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,660
one. Here we go. There it is.
Publisher changed the title, but

33
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,100
in my heart it will always be
diamonds from heaven.

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,080
I want to say up front that I'm
not sure that what I did was

35
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,980
wise, honestly. I mean that I
pushed myself extremely hard on

36
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,800
this journey harder than was
probably good for me, but I've

37
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,940
come through it intact,
reasonably So, and I'm really

38
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,120
looking forward to sharing with
you where this journey took me

39
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,300
and to share it with the world.
And it's not because I think my

40
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,380
experiences are in any way
unique or special, but they are

41
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,840
a particularly, I think, well
focused exploration of the

42
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,500
structure of the universe. And I
want to say clearly that I did

43
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,480
this work, not as a therapist,
and not really seeking therapy.

44
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,640
So all honor and deep respect to
all the psychedelic therapists

45
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,280
in the room, this is a different
agenda. What I was primarily

46
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,580
seeking I was trained as a
philosopher of religion, and

47
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,420
what I was primarily seeking was
an understanding of our universe

48
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,900
as deeply as I could get by
sinking deep into my own

49
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,900
consciousness, and in those deep
states of consciousness,

50
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,320
exploring the structure, the
deep structure of the universe

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:47,320
itself. Now I want to ground
this story in the context of our

52
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,680
collective psychedelic
experience. Let's see, Is my mic

53
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,940
on yet? Do we this? No, this
one? No, okay, sooner or later,

54
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,980
it will come on. I like to walk,
but okay. Do. Is it on? Now it's

55
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,680
on. Okay, good. Pump the volume
a little bit, okay. How many we

56
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,760
have so many people working in
so many different psychedelic

57
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,360
mediums in this room, right? So
many different substances, so

58
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,080
many different forms and so many
different agendas. All honor to

59
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,280
the psychedelic community and
all the work that we are doing

60
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,540
collectively. What I'm bringing
to you today is the story of one

61
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,220
particular journey into the
universe, one particular method,

62
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,320
one particular format, which
does not negate in any way, any

63
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,680
of the other dimensions, other
dimensions that we're exploring.

64
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,660
It is simply one voice in our
collective expression.

65
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,560
So let's go into it. Let's see.
I got two clickers here, which

66
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,460
one is going to work.

67
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,660
Okay? Looks like it's just as a
winner. Okay. This is my

68
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,080
psychedelic lineage. My
psychedelic lineage basically

69
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,720
grounds in Stan Grof work. When
I was 29 years old, fresh out of

70
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,920
graduate school, just beginning
my academic career in Ohio, I

71
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,780
met Stan grofwork, his work
realms of the human unconscious,

72
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,420
and then his book, LSD
psychotherapy, which is this

73
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,920
fundamental manual for working
psychedelic sessions, changed my

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,620
life, turned my life around,
pointed me in a completely

75
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,580
different direction, and it has
become my entire life's work.

76
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,980
Now, in in terms of the sessions
themselves. Of structuring

77
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,280
sessions, I want to emphasize
I've never tripped. I've never

78
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,700
gone to a concert on LSD. I've
never spent the night, all

79
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,000
night, tripping with my friends
and talking about things. It's

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,180
not that those are bad things.
Those can be fine. But in my

81
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,620
work, every time I took LSD, I
was working in a very, very

82
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,700
carefully controlled
environment. I was isolated. I

83
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,080
was in my home. I was are in my
wife's office. I was totally

84
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,280
perfected, protected from the
world. I did always solo work. I

85
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,980
didn't work in groups. There are
advantages for working in

86
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,160
groups. There are advantages for
doing solo work, just owning

87
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,860
mine was always solo work, which
allowed me to go to follow

88
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,700
exactly where the experiences
were taking me and to push

89
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,520
myself in that direction,
wherever it would take me in

90
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:43,780
Stan's work. Are we not getting
Ha, okay, come on. Okay,

91
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,160
clearly, two different
therapeutic modality that Stan

92
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,820
outline, psycholytic, low dose
therapy, psychedelic, high dose

93
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,840
therapy, psycholytic, low dose
maybe about 200 micrograms,

94
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,100
where the psyche peels itself
layer by layer, we move into it

95
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,680
layer by layer sessions, up to
about 100 sessions psychedelic

96
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,180
therapy, very, very different
therapy, very concentrated, very

97
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,600
intense experiences. The goal is
not to work through all the

98
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,300
layers of the personal
unconscious, but to sort of blow

99
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,780
through the psychodynamic level
of consciousness and to trigger

100
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,520
an experience of Transcendence,
an experience. Basically, they

101
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,280
were trying to trigger near
death episode experiences,

102
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,280
working with people who were
terminally ill they were going

103
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,220
to die, and they were working
with the anxiety that they were

104
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,420
facing as they were going
towards the death. This form of

105
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,600
therapy was limited to three
sessions in Spring Grove

106
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,820
Hospital, no more than three
sessions. So I came along and I

107
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,560
thought, Well, okay, if it can
be done safely three times, it

108
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,460
can be done safely more than
three times, and it can be done

109
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,720
safely more than three times,
but I found that it was a much,

110
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,980
much more demanding protocol
than I had anticipated in the

111
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,780
beginning, and it took all of my
research, my resources, to

112
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,800
basically manage what unfolded
in this journey. This is not a

113
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
therapeutic journey. It's a
journey of cosmological

114
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
exploration, and therefore it
requires something of an

115
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,120
Explorer's constitution, and it
also requires something of an

116
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,640
Explorer's preparation, an
Explorer's position in life,

117
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,640
where you have the opportunity,
where you can push this deeply,

118
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,940
this far beyond the edges,
beyond the maps, where most

119
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,380
people have gone. When I got to
the end of this journey, and was

120
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,180
writing up my accounts, and was
looking back over the whole

121
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,300
thing I realized, well, I
thought I was just doing an

122
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,020
extended course of psychedelic
therapy, high dose therapy, but

123
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,520
what I realized was that this
process that I had gotten

124
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,160
engaged in went so deep and went
so far and generated

125
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,720
complications that were so
intense i. Had to give it a

126
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,640
different name. So I call it. Do
I have psychedelic exploration?

127
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,080
The method is the method of
psychedelic therapy, total

128
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,280
isolation, always working with a
sitter, carefully selected

129
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,540
music. You know, the whole works
there. The difference is the

130
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,180
number of sessions involved. For
me, 73 sessions. I did three

131
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,320
sessions at the psychodynamic
level. I did three sessions

132
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,520
about 200 micrograms, and then
after that, all of my sessions

133
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,880
were at 500 600 micrograms.
Again, this is not a protocol

134
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,800
that I recommend. I wouldn't do
it that way. Again, I would do

135
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,580
it differently. I would balance
the plant medicines more with

136
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,540
the synthetic psychedelic
medicines. I would really only

137
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,140
push myself periodically with
high doses, rather than pushing

138
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,680
myself so relentlessly. In that
way, I have worked with

139
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,020
Psilocybin, I have worked with
Ayahuasca and salvia divinorum,

140
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,560
a number of plant medicines. I
did most of that work after I

141
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,180
stopped my LSD work. But LSD, in
the mind of the universe, is

142
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,020
really focused specifically on
what happened on this high dose

143
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:21,680
journey. I want to emphasize
that the circumstances in which

144
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,060
I did this work were kind of
unusual in that they were very,

145
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:32,600
very stable and concentrated and
focused. In all of my work, I

146
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:39,620
had the same sitter for all
these years, the same set and

147
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,720
setting, same same intention,
same location, all in Northeast

148
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,660
Ohio, same substance, same dose
level and the same recording

149
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,840
process, always recording every
sense, every session, as

150
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:59,140
completely as possible within 24
hours of the session. Okay, what

151
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,280
this did? I've come to
appreciate. When you stabilize

152
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,940
your work in this way, when you
eliminate as many variables as

153
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,540
possible and you're using the
same methodology and the same

154
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,440
consistency, it stabilizes the
conversation that opens up

155
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,620
between you and the creative
intelligence of the universe. It

156
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,660
stabilizes the communion so that
one session leads to another

157
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,960
session, leads to another
session in a very coherent,

158
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,380
intelligent manner, even though
you may not understand all the

159
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,580
details of the continuity when
it's unfolding, when you're

160
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,480
looking out over a longer period
of your work, you can begin to

161
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,480
understand the patterns of
continuity that you are in

162
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,260
dialog with, in a sense, a
single intelligence in this

163
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,880
process. I say that carefully,
because there's so many layers

164
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,120
to this intelligence. There's so
many forms of this intelligence.

165
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,520
But in the end, when you see the
the continuity across sessions,

166
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,740
it you're can't help but feel
like you're engaging a single

167
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:09,600
creative intelligence. Now, I
kept detailed records of my

168
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,980
work. I have about 400 pages of
session notes, again, recording

169
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,220
the session always within 24
hours, because you know what

170
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,480
it's like two or three days
later, things are not as clear

171
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,220
as when you do it right. The day
after, I kept track of all the

172
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,900
dates of the sessions. I even
plotted the astrological

173
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,080
variables late in the work, I
used astrology to choose the

174
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,500
dates of my sessions. I was
working, on average, about five

175
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,380
sessions a year. Now I worked
for four years. I stopped for

176
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,100
six years for reasons that are
not important to go into now

177
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,280
they're in the book. And then I
picked up for another 10 years

178
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,600
of very intense work. I worked
about five sessions a year. And

179
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,960
so I looked when I became aware
of Rick Tarnas and Stan Grof

180
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,620
hypothesis of the relationship
between the outer planets and

181
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,080
transit astrology, global
transits and my psychedelic

182
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,540
sessions, I wanted to study
this, so I looked at that,

183
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,440
tracked at those variables, and
there's an appendix on that

184
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,400
issue in the back of the living
class of LSD, in the mind of the

185
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,120
universe, I keep wanting to Say
diamonds from heaven. I have to

186
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:28,040
retrain myself. Now, the story
I'm telling in LSD, in the mind

187
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,300
of the universe is not primarily
a personal story. There was a

188
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,060
personal story. There was
personal healing, there were

189
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,660
personal insights. But what I
found was that when I was doing

190
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,340
this work, the personal
components generally tend to

191
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,940
manifest in the beginning of a
session and at the end of the

192
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,420
session, when I was leaving
space time and when I was coming

193
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,140
back into space time. That's not
entirely correct, because

194
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,380
sometimes a whole session was
spent in personal healing. But

195
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,900
in general, after about the
first 15 sessions. Years when I

196
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,720
was at the peak of the sessions,
as indicated in these large

197
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,680
circles in this series of sine
waves, which represent a series

198
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,240
of sessions. When I was at that
those peak hours, I was

199
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,700
operating far beyond personal
reality. Okay, that's the story

200
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,080
I'm trying to tell in LSD, in
the mind of the universe, I've

201
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,920
dropped out a lot of the
personal story because from a

202
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,940
philosophical perspective, that,
from a therapeutic perspective,

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,420
that's relevant, but from a
philosophical perspective, it's

204
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,480
the large story which is the
more important story.

205
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,780
A lot of work at the medical
level. At the therapeutic level,

206
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,080
really focuses on ego
dissolution, transcending the

207
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,620
limitations of your physical
body, entering into a deeper

208
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,060
communion, into mystical
experiences. What I found was

209
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,500
when you when I did this work,
it wasn't just one cycle of

210
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,260
Death-Rebirth. Now, in this
image, the drop at the bottom of

211
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,380
the circle represents egoic
awareness, our time space

212
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,160
awareness the line. Everything
below the line is physical

213
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,300
reality. Everything above the
line is Transpersonal reality or

214
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,560
spiritual reality. A lot of
work, a lot of discussion

215
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,660
focuses on that first circle,
the Death-Rebirth of ego, and

216
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,780
that's an important place to
focus. It is the fundamental

217
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,400
transition. What I found in my
work was you actually go through

218
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,480
multiple levels of death and
rebirth. And it's not ego dying

219
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,960
over and over again. You're
going through death and rebirth

220
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,980
processes which take place at
different levels of the

221
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,640
universe, at different levels of
the creative intelligence of the

222
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,260
universe, and the deaths and
rebirths at the higher levels

223
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,220
are different than the death and
rebirth at the beginning level,

224
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,980
when you're shedding time and
space, when you're shedding your

225
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,120
identity built up in time and
space, they're harder to

226
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,260
describe, because you know the
levels of consciousness that

227
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,820
you're born into. In the
beginning you're born out of. At

228
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,140
the end, when you're being born
into the species mind, it has a

229
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,440
certain set of qualities and
characteristics. But when you

230
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,740
are shedding the species mind,
when you are going beyond the

231
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,820
collective psyche, when you are
entering into archetypal

232
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,720
reality, that is a different
pattern of death and rebirth.

233
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,240
Now I follow, I use Stan Grof
category. Stan talks about

234
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,300
psychic level, Transpersonal
experience, high and low,

235
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,020
psychic high and low, subtle
level, high and low, causal

236
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,520
level. That's a kind of
convenient category. But of

237
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,240
course, how can we possibly
describe the full spectrum of

238
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,760
the divine experience, of
spiritual experience, with

239
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,300
simply three or six categories?
These are simply rough

240
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,020
approximations which are useful
in order to describe certain

241
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:05,100
transitions that took place on
this journey, the 19, when I got

242
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,920
to the end of the journey, and I
was kind of working and

243
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,340
crunching all the experiences
and putting them all together

244
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,660
for the book, I realized that I
began to count up how many

245
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,240
fundamental, deep Death. Oops,
oops, sorry, I'm jumping ahead

246
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,260
of myself. These cycles of death
and rebirth are kind of really

247
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,120
like Tauruses. You kind of break
through, you open up, you expand

248
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,540
into a new level. And then there
is a sense of gathering in

249
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,540
everything that took place,
blowing through into another

250
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,600
level. And then you explore that
level, you become competent and

251
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,180
stabilize states of
consciousness. At that level,

252
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,440
there's a kind of a gathering in
and then, if you follow the

253
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,800
process through, takes you into
yet another death and rebirth

254
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,740
process into a deeper level. And
one of the ways I kind of image

255
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:06,960
this in terms of a nuclear
explosion. Now, this image

256
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,780
triggers very, very deep
responses in us, and it should.

257
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,780
This is, this is an image of
humanity's insanity at one

258
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,320
level, but I don't want to. I
want to, don't want to go there.

259
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,720
I want to use it simply to make
one point, when you go through

260
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,500
deep, deep death and rebirth
processes where you are

261
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,660
shattering every level that you
have known and in not only in

262
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,740
earth, but everything that you
have known. In some sessions, it

263
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,060
drops you deeper into the
universe, and it allows levels

264
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,520
of reality to come into your
awareness which were not in your

265
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,720
awareness before. They were
always there, but you were not

266
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,900
experiencing them. And there is
something like that that happens

267
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,920
with a nuclear explosion. When
this explosion drives deeper

268
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,620
into the atmosphere, it brings
out levels of the atmosphere

269
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,260
which. Previously you could not
see. And something like that

270
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,940
happens with the LSD work or any
kind of deep psychotherapy, deep

271
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,380
psychedelic work. It brings you
into levels that previously you

272
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,880
were not aware of. Now, the
dualism here is, is, I want to

273
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,300
dissolve the dualism now,
because the nuclear explosion in

274
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,600
the center and the levels of
reality one is entering are in

275
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,580
this image, are two different
things. Now dissolve that

276
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,660
duality, because when one dies
at that level, you literally

277
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:41,200
dissolve into that field of
reality. You dissolve into that

278
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,020
stratum, that stratum of
reality. But we're not talking

279
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,940
about bombs here. We're talking
about the universe exploring the

280
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,560
nature of the cosmos itself.
When I got to the end of my

281
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,900
work, and I was kind of counting
up out of all the deaths and all

282
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,320
the purifications and all the
purgations. How many core

283
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,760
fundamental levels of reality
did I go through? I counted

284
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:16,980
five. Here they are. First, the
death of self, transcending our

285
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:24,080
time space, identity, our egoic
reality. After that, something

286
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,260
that took place at the
collective mind, transcending

287
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,620
the individual mind. Something
is taking place at the level of

288
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:36,500
species consciousness. After
that, something that took place

289
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,240
at the archetypal level, at the
archetypal dimension of mind.

290
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,820
And then something that took
place at what I call causal

291
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,440
oneness. Now oneness, of course,
comes up many, many levels.

292
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,620
Oneness can come up in the first
ego death. Oneness is a

293
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,540
fundamental truth, and it occurs
in many different forms. There's

294
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,460
something distinctive and unique
about causal oneness, or oneness

295
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,460
at causal level reality, because
here you're dealing with there

296
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,420
is no outside to reality. When
you're in causal oneness, you

297
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,860
are not experiencing oneness.
You are in the condition in

298
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,320
which the universe experiences
itself as being fundamentally

299
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,420
unified with no core divisions
whatsoever. At any level,

300
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,420
physical, spiritual,
reincarnational, it's a

301
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,840
fundamental core oneness of
reality. And then at the last

302
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,960
level, what I call diamond
Luminosity, what Buddhism calls

303
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:51,760
Dharmakaya, the pure light of
absolute reality. So let me use

304
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,640
these five categories and then
show you how these lay out in

305
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,680
the chapters of LSD, in the mind
of the universe. And then I'm

306
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,100
just going to share some
observations on each of these

307
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,840
categories as we go through just
to kind of give a quick overview

308
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,540
death of self, there's a chapter
crossing the boundary of birth

309
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,660
and death. I'm going to go back
into these in more detail in a

310
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,900
minute, but just to give you
where it is in the book. Now

311
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,280
there is a chapter one, which is
the chapter on methodology. It's

312
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,920
a rather long chapter in the
book, because I really wanted to

313
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,820
be very, very clear on the
methodology that I used and some

314
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,100
of the ways of working with
psychedelics at this level. And

315
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,100
there's a chapter after this
called a session day, because

316
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,300
someone had asked me, why don't
you just kind of take us into a

317
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,620
typical day and show us what
happens? And so I did. I kind of

318
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,640
wrote a narrative of a typical
session day, but in terms of the

319
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,680
levels of consciousness, those
three levels of consciousness

320
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,280
really kind of function at the
death of self.

321
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,280
My wife is taking care of me, by
the way. I didn't mention I

322
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,760
forgot astrology, working with
astrology and psychedelic

323
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,480
sessions really, really
interesting insights emerge. My

324
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,100
wife, Christina, is a
professional astrologer, and she

325
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,420
kind of helps me understand some
of the archetypal dynamics that

326
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,760
are operating in some of the
session material.

327
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,620
Okay, collective mind. There are
three chapters that have to do

328
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,440
with the collective mind, the
ocean of suffering, sort of the

329
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,040
challenging, purifying part of
working with the species mind,

330
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,440
deep time in the soul. Is an
initiation into the universe.

331
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,660
I'm going to come back to these
in a minute, archetypal mind.

332
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:19,020
There is a chapter the greater
real of archetypal reality calls

333
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:25,368
a oneness. The chapter, a
benediction of blessings. Then

334
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:29,808
we move to diamond Luminosity,
the chapter diamond Luminosity.

335
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:34,668
But before I discuss diamond
Luminosity, I have a chapter

336
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:39,048
called The Birth of the future
human, which actually describes

337
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:44,320
a series of visionary
experiences that started at the

338
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,820
initiation of the universe and
continued all the way into the

339
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,580
final chapter, into from session
22 to session 70, is one of the

340
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,720
most consistent recurring
themes, what's happening to

341
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,100
humanity? Where are we going?
What is our historical time in

342
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,500
history? What's happening at the
deep structural level? And then

343
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,960
diamond Luminosity. And then the
last chapter, final vision,

344
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,200
where I was given the last, what
I call the last of the great

345
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,980
visions of the journey. And then
the goodbye sessions, the wrap

346
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,440
up sessions. So let me go back
and just offer a few

347
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:32,360
observations on each of these
levels. First, let me check my

348
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,520
time. Okay, that's not bad.
We're okay.

349
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,760
First, crossing the boundary of
death and birth. How many people

350
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,240
here know the work of Stanislav
Grof? Okay, then you know

351
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,000
exactly what I'm going to be
talking about here, because this

352
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,520
is the perinatal level of
consciousness. This is that

353
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,280
level that is the boundary level
between space, time,

354
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,380
consciousness and first
Transpersonal reality. When I

355
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,680
got into this level, I felt like
a poster child for Stan's

356
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,240
perinatal level of
consciousness, intense, intense

357
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,060
physical purifications, fetal
sensations, reliving aspects of

358
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:27,380
birth, tremendous psychological
existential angst, questioning

359
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,440
the fundamental meaningfulness
of life, confronting the

360
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,880
meaninglessness of life, and
then eventually ego death, a

361
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,960
complete shattering of egoic
reality. The ego is a tough son

362
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,260
of a bitch, but in the final
analysis, it's not that hard to

363
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,580
take apart. It's harder to heal
than it is to shatter. It's kind

364
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,380
of curious. But on these last
two sessions, this is two and a

365
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,400
half years work in 10 sessions.
At the end of these sessions,

366
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,240
the last two sessions, it just
took me and snapped me like a

367
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,460
twig. I started the day as a
white male, highly educated

368
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,020
academic, obsessed with the
meaning of life. It totally

369
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,740
inverted all of those variables.
It turned me into women, turned

370
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,980
me into women of color, turned
me into women at the laundromat

371
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,840
with no prospects. Turned me
into women who had no interest

372
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,160
whatsoever in philosophy or the
meaning of anything of life at

373
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,220
all. Of course, it wasn't women
that were the problem, of

374
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,100
course, and it wasn't a lack of
education that was the problem.

375
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,660
It was what it was the social
identity that I had internalized

376
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,320
and accepted as what I am that
was the problem, and the

377
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,260
universe forced me to become the
opposite of what I was, and just

378
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,920
snapped me. And when eventually
I let go and surrender to that

379
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,160
experience, I entered the world
of women under the arm of the

380
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,640
Great Mother, and I was taken
through the experience of

381
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,300
hundreds and hundreds of women's
lives. It was just an

382
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,720
extraordinary transformation in
my own experience. I wish every

383
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,020
man could have the experience,
and I'm sure many of the men in

384
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,160
this room have had that kind of
experience, of experiencing so

385
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,780
deeply the inner essence and the
inner experience of the so

386
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,900
called opposite sex. Now I
believe in reincarnation. I've

387
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,680
written a book on reincarnation.
I think we've all lived lives as

388
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,520
men and women, but what was
happening here was I was not

389
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:35,600
being invited to reclaim my
former lives as women. This was

390
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,480
different. This was saying where
you are going. Gender does not

391
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,840
exist, let go, and so I let go
and I entered into spiritual

392
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:54,820
reality. What happened next,
much to my surprise, is that

393
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,560
things didn't get easier. Things
got harder after going through a

394
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,600
trans. Mission, experience in
which my compassion was expanded

395
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,560
and open to the suffering of the
world. I entered a domain of

396
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,620
collective suffering and anguish
and and pain, which deepened

397
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,160
session by session
systematically, and it deepened

398
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,920
for two years. It took two years
and 14 sessions to go through

399
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,960
all of this work. There was a
year of the ocean of suffering

400
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,160
before I stopped my sessions for
the six years. I stopped for six

401
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,180
years, and then I started again
six years later, under

402
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,140
completely different a different
time in life, different set of

403
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,300
expectations and different
astrological transits, but at

404
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,720
the other side of that six year
gap, the ocean of suffering

405
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,000
started exactly where it had
stopped six years before, which

406
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,300
I think is a measure of the
intelligence and the

407
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,540
intentionality of the
consciousness that's directing

408
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:06,900
our work. So hmm, when the ocean
of suffering opened, at first, I

409
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,400
thought that this represented a
deepening of my ego death. I

410
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,240
thought I was being, you know,
kind of cleaned up more. And

411
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,480
this is kind of implicit in
Stan's theory. He see, he

412
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,560
recognizes, and he's, he's
witnessed these collective

413
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,160
ordeals, but Stan sees these
collective ordeals, or at least

414
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,700
he did. He saw these collective
ordeals as being drawn in

415
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,840
through resonance to ego death.
All right, so it's ego death

416
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,560
which is really the primary
driver. And when you get into

417
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,780
ego death in the context of the
collective psyche, you can tap

418
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,680
into some of the suffering of
humanity that's still stored in

419
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,040
the collective psyche, and it
seeps into your experiences

420
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,380
through resonance. That's what I
so I went with that

421
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,160
interpretation at first, but
what I found was that this went

422
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,160
on for so long, it was so
extreme, and it lasted for so

423
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,940
many years, and it involved so
many millions and millions of

424
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,080
beings, that I decided that this
could not be correct.

425
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,520
Eventually, I came to the
conclusion that these sessions

426
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,780
were not trying to sort of
purify me or heal me or

427
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,780
transform me. These experiences
were aimed at nothing less than

428
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,500
the transformation of the
collective psyche of our planet.

429
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,580
It was about healing the entire
planet in some way, shape or

430
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:38,600
form, somewhere in working with
very, very intense states of

431
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,060
consciousness, something happens
that there is a flip. And what

432
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,320
had started out in my mind as
personal transformation was

433
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,460
taken over by the work of
collective transformation. Now I

434
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,900
don't think anything anyone did
this to me, nobody. It was no

435
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,860
trick that was done to me. I
accept responsibility for this.

436
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,320
This is simply part of my karmic
contract in this lifetime, and I

437
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,140
think it's part of the karmic
contract of a lot of people in

438
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,900
this room. The work you take on
in your deep, deep work is often

439
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,440
disproportionate to anything
that makes sense in terms of

440
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,440
your personal life story, even
your personal former life, life

441
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,160
story. Many of us get into work
so so deep that you have to open

442
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,420
up to a deeper understanding of
what's actually taking place in

443
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,980
these sessions, especially at
this time in history. If we were

444
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:42,580
doing this work, maybe 500 years
ago, maybe not so, but this

445
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,240
time, at this time in history,
the work of the hour is

446
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,140
collective transformation. Our
species is going into a near

447
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,060
extinction event. We do not have
time to fuck around. We are

448
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,360
getting this is serious work
here, and if you are open, I

449
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,020
yes, if you are open and willing
to let this work come through.

450
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,720
And I'm not saying everybody
should be, and I'm not saying

451
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,440
that it's necessarily a healthy
thing. In many circumstances, it

452
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,200
can be overwhelming and it can
be intimidating, and you do not

453
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,320
want to go there. But if you're
open and if you're capable, and

454
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,880
if it is part of your karma
contract, the work we do in

455
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:31,520
these deep sessions, I think
there are more bodhisattvas on

456
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,720
this planet than we might think.
Initially, the work we do is for

457
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,280
our collective transformation.

458
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:51,339
Now, in my experience, working
at high doses, every session

459
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,819
kind of breaks down into two
phases. There's a purification

460
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:59,919
phase and an ecstatic phase.
There's kind of the dark, hard.

461
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:04,499
A death, dying kind of phase.
And then there's the static

462
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:11,039
phase, if you in reference to
this work, James Excellent talk

463
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,459
this morning about shadow work
and engaging the shadow in

464
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:19,019
working as I did in a non
therapeutic modality. One of the

465
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:22,279
great gifts I learned from Stan
Grof is to completely,

466
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:26,419
absolutely surrender to whatever
is taking place in your sessions

467
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:30,859
and let it take you as far as
wherever it wants to take you.

468
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:34,459
Now, remember, these are not
tripping. There's no confusion

469
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:36,439
in the outer world. There's
nothing going on in the outer

470
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:39,199
world that's getting into my
inner space. I know that

471
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,059
anything I am confronting is
coming entirely from within or

472
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:47,019
through within. If you submit my
experiences, if you submit

473
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:51,159
completely to whatever is taking
place in that context, it will

474
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:54,159
take you deeper and deeper. It
will take you into sometimes

475
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:58,479
unspeakable anguish and
completely inexplicable anguish,

476
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:05,339
into chaos, into just terrible
suffering confusion. But if you

477
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:09,839
let it do that, eventually that
will come to a crescendo. It'll

478
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,799
peak, and then it'll take you
through to something that lies

479
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,999
on the other side. You enter
into the ecstatic phase of the

480
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:21,439
session, into the teaching phase
of the session, into the

481
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:25,999
cosmological phase of the
session, even if the next

482
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:29,539
session, you may come back
around and enter back into the

483
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:33,439
suffering again. But if you go
through this process, into the

484
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:37,339
surrender, death and rebirth
process, and let it take you,

485
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:41,799
there is a deeper, deep,
underlying dynamic that's maybe

486
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,579
not be clear to you at the time,
that unfolds itself over time.

487
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:49,839
Often you cannot understand
what's happening to you in the

488
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,679
pain part of a session. You
cannot understand the logic of

489
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,699
the pain until you have moved on
to the next stage, because often

490
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:00,299
these transformations, it's not
until you're looking from a

491
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:03,779
higher state of consciousness
that you can understand what you

492
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:07,199
are engaging at this lower state
of consciousness, you understand

493
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:13,799
it's really important to follow
this all the way through,

494
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:17,579
because if you follow the pain
all the way through, What

495
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:24,559
happens is you go from suffering
to resolution, to peace, and

496
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,579
what you internalize, therefore,
is the entire cycle, and this is

497
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,759
what prevents the suffering from
being lodged in your system as

498
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:35,659
unintegrated trauma or some kind
of something you have to deal

499
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:38,839
with. I have gone through
terrible, terrible suffering. I

500
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,399
don't have any negative
ramifications or After Effects

501
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:47,259
of that suffering, because you
internalize the suffering.

502
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:54,759
Resolution, peace, suffering
resolution, you learn to trust,

503
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,899
to trust the cycle, and to trust
that there is an intelligence

504
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:05,219
that's behind this dynamic
process. When I came out of the

505
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:09,659
ocean of suffering in that first
year's work, I was spun into

506
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:14,759
what I call deep time, and I was
given the experience for one

507
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:19,979
year, seven sessions over and
over again, consistently,

508
00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:23,659
methodically, laying out, I
experienced the total, the whole

509
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:28,879
of my life from beginning to end
as a simultaneous now deep time.

510
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:32,479
I called it whole time first,
and then I called it deep time.

511
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:36,919
Deep time is not eternity. It's
not timelessness. That's

512
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:40,279
something different. Deep Time
is moving into a state of

513
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:43,119
awareness where you can
experience different spans of

514
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,279
time as simultaneously present.
I experience all the time

515
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:51,999
moments of my life as
simultaneously present, and I

516
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:58,899
experience it like a tree. The
deepest themes of my life were

517
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:02,819
the deep branches which had been
received, the biggest branches

518
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:05,939
which had received most of the
energy the my most recent

519
00:39:05,939 --> 00:39:10,259
experiences were the leaves at
the edges of the before I died,

520
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:14,999
were the leaves at the edges of
my of The tree, but all of them

521
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:25,639
being simultaneously present in
you, when I first went into this

522
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:30,979
state in the 11th session, when
I came out of it, I couldn't

523
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:34,579
remember it. It was the most
meaningful experience of my life

524
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:38,059
hours before, but when I came
out of it, I could barely

525
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:42,039
reconstruct the edges of it. It
took me months to recover the

526
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:47,079
pieces of the session, but what
I found was, if you go back

527
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,819
again and again and again at
that edge, to your living edge

528
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:56,139
in your sessions, what I found
was you understand more. You're

529
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:59,139
able to remember more things
that didn't make sense in the

530
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:02,099
beginning. Be. Begin to make
sense. The pieces begin to

531
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,599
cohere. Fragments begin to
become integrated. Gestalts.

532
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:11,999
This is an important
epistemological point. When you

533
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:16,379
break through into a new level
of consciousness, you often get

534
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:19,319
fragmented. You can't maintain
coherence because you're in a

535
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:23,239
totally different cognitive
reality. But if you go back with

536
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:28,399
clear focus and intent and clear
setting isolation, clear

537
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:34,459
setting, you go back again and
again your cog. You learn to be

538
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,759
aware in levels of consciousness
that, in the beginning, just

539
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:41,799
swallowed you. You learn, I
learned how to stay conscious in

540
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:45,879
deep time. And this is something
which happened again and again,

541
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:48,939
when I would break through to a
deeper level of consciousness,

542
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,719
there was often a fragmented
quality. I couldn't remember. I

543
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,979
could only get details that hold
on to details. But over time,

544
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:01,619
those details began to coalesce.
They began to become complete

545
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:07,799
patterns of understanding
reincarnation was this whole

546
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:12,239
inside of my life from beginning
to end was all kind of saturated

547
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,799
with insights of karma and the
intentionality, the deeper

548
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:20,479
intentionality that binds us
into the world of time and

549
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:25,159
space. I wrote life cycles, not
mentioning psychedelic work, but

550
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,399
my first book, life cycles is
about reincarnation and the web

551
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:32,479
of life. For me, reincarnation
is just a fundamental axiom. If

552
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:35,059
you don't understand
reincarnation, then you just

553
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,119
don't understand what the hell
is going on in this world. You

554
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,719
just have to to see the deeper
patterns.

555
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,499
Six year break, had two more
children, wrote a book, got

556
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:59,199
promoted. Six years started
again. Ocean of suffering starts

557
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,539
exactly where it had stopped
before, but now in the ecstatic

558
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:08,279
portion of the sessions, totally
different world. It started me

559
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:13,199
completely beyond personal
reality. I was given a series of

560
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:19,199
seven initiations into the
universe. It was as if it was

561
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,639
not as if it was the creative
intelligence. Some creative

562
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,059
intelligence took me and
basically gave me a course in

563
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:31,459
cosmology, 101, it just took me
through and gave me a series of

564
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:34,939
experiences that, ch, that
deepened my understanding of

565
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:42,339
what's going on in the universe.
Now I name. I give each of my

566
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:44,739
sessions a name, because I'm
trying to hold all of my

567
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:48,819
sessions in my mind all at the
same time. So I give them a name

568
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:51,939
that reflects the pith of the
session, and I actually will

569
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:55,839
break my sessions into bullet
points as well. So here are the

570
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,139
names of the sessions that were
that I deal with in the chapter,

571
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:07,619
the initiation into the
universe. The first you and I

572
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:12,299
creating was an exploration of
the very the co creation of the

573
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:18,539
universe, the I won't go into
the details. So attempting can't

574
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:22,399
go into the details. Just the
book, the cosmic tour was just

575
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:26,179
an extraordinary tour of the
universe. This intelligence that

576
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:30,259
took me somewhere would show me
things, show me how things were

577
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:34,039
working. Sometimes I didn't
understand it come back for me,

578
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:37,159
and everything would get bigger,
and then I would understand, and

579
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:42,459
it would take me on. It was just
extraordinary journey. Council

580
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:46,299
of Elders was actually a session
which was teaching me how to

581
00:43:46,419 --> 00:43:51,399
keep my cognition coherent with
respect to levels of reality.

582
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,279
It's really important when you
have a substance that allows you

583
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:57,759
to break through multiple levels
of reality, you have to train

584
00:43:57,759 --> 00:44:02,039
yourself to keep your experience
coherent with respect to levels

585
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:07,499
of reality. That was part of a
training exercise. Dying into

586
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:11,399
oneness was an experience of
just repeatedly dying in deeper

587
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:18,239
and deeper death, death by
death, deeper into oneness, the

588
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,639
master plan, I'll come back to
healing the collective wound was

589
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:29,539
basically kind of an orgy of
pain and suffering, and then I

590
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:33,499
was spun deep into archetypal
reality, and the collective

591
00:44:33,499 --> 00:44:38,239
suffering, the ocean of
suffering, never returned. It

592
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:43,539
never returned. Now it's not
like the world isn't suffering.

593
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:47,199
It's not that there isn't pain
in the collective psyche. But my

594
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:52,119
work with the ocean of suffering
was time limited, and we went on

595
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:56,559
to another level, and what I
learned later is that you don't

596
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,539
abandon your species when you go
deeper beyond. The ocean of

597
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:03,539
suffering, or deeper beyond the
pain of the species. You

598
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:08,099
actually become more useful to
it by in the beginning, you're

599
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,699
sucking pain out of the
collective psyche, but later,

600
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:16,259
you're pouring grace and joy and
insight into the collective

601
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:21,199
psyche from higher levels of
consciousness. I have to speed

602
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:27,019
up. I'm getting the time
signatures here, the greater

603
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:31,219
reel of archetypal reality. When
I entered archetypal reality, my

604
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:35,719
identity as a human being began
to fall away from me. I found

605
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:39,319
out that we have an identity, a
deep, deep, visceral identity,

606
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,599
which is deeper than our
individual egoic identity and to

607
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,679
die as a human being is deeper
than to die as an individual

608
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:52,899
human being. And if in order to
go into archetypal reality, I

609
00:45:52,899 --> 00:45:57,519
had to literally cease to
function at a cognitive level

610
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,039
that had anything to do with
human cognition, I had to be

611
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,779
willing to give that up in order
to learn how to acclimate into

612
00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:11,459
flows of reality that were
radically, profoundly beyond not

613
00:46:11,459 --> 00:46:15,959
only my individual existence,
but beyond human existence. I

614
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:21,979
moved outside the human field
two levels of archetype of

615
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:25,039
reality, one high, platonic
level, where I experience

616
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:28,519
something like what Plato is
pointing to, except that Plato

617
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,579
describes archetypes as eternal
forms in the mind of an

618
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:35,959
unchanging God. That's not how I
experience them. I experience

619
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:40,219
them as vast, living, massive
beings that were just so

620
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:45,099
overwhelmingly I could not wrap
my mind around them. They're

621
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:50,379
just totally beyond my capacity
to comprehend. I could touch

622
00:46:50,379 --> 00:46:56,679
them experience pieces, but they
just were far, far too large at

623
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:59,979
a lower level of archetypal
reality, at a lower subtle

624
00:46:59,979 --> 00:47:02,879
level, entering deep into the
collective unconscious of

625
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:07,859
humanity, deep into the species
mind, experiencing patterns

626
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:13,679
that, experiencing the human
species as a single being, and

627
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:16,979
experience networks of
intelligence weaving together

628
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:21,319
our individual efforts, our
individual minds, our individual

629
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:25,939
karma into larger patterns,
which were how the species as a

630
00:47:25,939 --> 00:47:32,359
whole lived and breathed. I
think I was being given a crash

631
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:36,499
course on how our species works
as a single organism in order to

632
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:45,399
prepare the way for what came
next. I at archetypal reality.

633
00:47:46,419 --> 00:47:48,399
Here are the sessions that I
address,

634
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:00,780
and notice how much cleansing is
taking place at this level. The

635
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,440
28th session was an
extraordinarily positive

636
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,380
session. It was of my first
contact with causal level

637
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,520
reality, tremendous ordeal, but
then spinning out into causal

638
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,360
level reality, incredibly
beautiful, clear, gorgeous

639
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:20,100
experience. The next three
sessions were just grueling

640
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,960
Ordeals of purification. They
went on for hours and hours and

641
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,180
hours and lasted three sessions
over six months. What I came to

642
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:34,220
understand eventually is that
deeper states of consciousness

643
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,720
are higher states of energy.
When you shift into a deeper

644
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,400
state of consciousness, you are
entering a higher level of

645
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,760
energy, and you have to
acclimate to that energy, and

646
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,540
that takes time and work. You
have to go through a series of

647
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,560
purification processes,
cleansing processes, and it's

648
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,260
hard to describe, because
they're not personal

649
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:01,020
purification processes. You
literally have to purify

650
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,640
whatever you are at the time in
order to stabilize consciousness

651
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,480
at these deeper levels of
reality. And this repeats itself

652
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:15,540
over and over again, so much so
that I came to dread the session

653
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,360
after a breakthrough session
when I have a breakthrough the

654
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,020
next session was usually a
turgid carrying out the garbage

655
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,940
kind of quality, right? But you
go through that, you go clean it

656
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,580
up, clean it up until you can
come back into that level of

657
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,960
consciousness and maintain
coherent cognition at that level

658
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,980
of consciousness, I began to
have experiences of

659
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:44,980
reincarnation as a collective
process, I began to experience

660
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:51,700
the human species as a single
organism that was growing itself

661
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,920
evolving itself by incarnating
all billions and billions of its

662
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,100
precious beings simultaneously.
Exactly, I began to understand

663
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:07,680
certain patterns of
reincarnation as an evolutionary

664
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,760
driver, not just as I had always
thought of the reincarnation as

665
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,060
an individual story, the
individuals, person grows,

666
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,680
matures, makes individual
choices, hopefully good choices.

667
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:23,960
But here I began to experience
reincarnation as an evolutionary

668
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,800
driver, an evolutionary dynamic
that operated at the collective

669
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,700
level simultaneously with the
personal level. And at that

670
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,300
point, the wall between personal
karma and collective karma came

671
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,900
down completely, and I realized
that there is no such thing as

672
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,960
private personal karma, personal
karma and collective karma are

673
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,940
all deeply intertwined. And I
wrote dark night, early dawn, in

674
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:53,500
order to answer the question,
Why did my suffering go as deep

675
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,880
and as long as it did in my
sessions? And the answer is

676
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,600
because, at this deep level of
consciousness, the boundary

677
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,480
between the individual and the
collective becomes very, very

678
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,140
porous, and if you are willing
to, you become an agent of

679
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,240
collective transformation in
this process, hurrying right

680
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:21,740
along. After a year and a half
and eight session No, a year and

681
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:26,780
a half and 11 sessions at the
archetypal level, I entered into

682
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,620
a year of extraordinary
blessings. I entered into causal

683
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:37,520
oneness. It was just non stop
joy. There are four sessions

684
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,460
that I address in the book
describing this, the forest the

685
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:46,480
birth of the diamond soul.
Singing the universe away in

686
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,120
Jesus' blood, first one is
experience of oneness. Shunyata,

687
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,600
emptiness, no self in me, no
self anywhere in the world.

688
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,980
Singing the universe away was an
experience of entering into the

689
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:06,000
primal void, what Stan calls the
meta cosmic void, the domain of

690
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,300
the formless, out of which the
light emerges that actually

691
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,860
gives birth to the physical
universe. Jesus's blood was an

692
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,000
experience of extraordinary
cosmic love, just being loved

693
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,920
like I've never been loved
before in this lifetime, the

694
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,400
birth of the diamond soul. Let
me pause just for a second

695
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:31,700
there, because it's really
important. 11 years before, I

696
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,000
had experienced my life as a
totality, from start to finish.

697
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,040
Now I began to experience where
I began to experience all my

698
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,540
former lives coming together.
They were just coming in fast

699
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,780
and furious, and it was like
wrapping a filament of white

700
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,860
light around a kite spool, and
at a certain point, when they

701
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:55,060
hit critical mass, and when they
hit critical mass, they fused,

702
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,380
and when they fuse, they
exploded into a diamond light.

703
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,700
It was my first contact with
what I came to call diamond

704
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:07,260
light, and it was an experience
which was showing me where

705
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,680
reincarnation is taking
humanity, not exactly where, but

706
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,240
how it works. Reincarnation is
not simply making incremental

707
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,540
improvements in our life,
lifetime by lifetime, adding a

708
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:23,900
layer, adding a layer. It's true
we do, but at a larger level,

709
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,700
sooner or later, if we keep this
process up, we die. We remember

710
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,360
who we are, we're born. We
forget, we learn we die. We

711
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:37,760
remember we're born. We forget,
we learn, if we keep this up,

712
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:43,660
lifetime after lifetime, sooner
or later, the soul, the larger

713
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:48,880
consciousness that holds all of
our lives, wakes up inside time

714
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,660
and space, not just in the
spiritual reality that we return

715
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:58,480
to when we die, but it wakes up
inside time and space that I

716
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,320
call the birth of the diamond
soul, just to Put a language to

717
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,680
it, other people have spoken
about this. I think it is, in a

718
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,360
sense, spiritual awakening. In
the deepest sense we it is the

719
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,980
emergence in history of a fully
integrated being that is

720
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,320
integrated hundreds of 1000s of
years experience and has now

721
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,200
been jumped into a quantum, a
higher level of awareness and

722
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,520
functional functionality, with
tremendous expansion of

723
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,540
compassion for other human
beings, because we we've had so

724
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:37,700
many lifetimes of experience
with each other and a profound

725
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,520
transparency To the universal
creative intelligence. It's just

726
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,940
it is a turning point in the
evolutionary story.

727
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,400
I'm being pushed on time and
absolutely right to be So, and

728
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,680
this is the most important
chapter. The Book, the birth of

729
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,380
the future human when I started
this work in 79 I didn't think

730
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,560
much about the future of the
human race. I didn't really

731
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,560
understand much about the ego
crisis we were going into. This

732
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,840
is 1979 and yet this became one
of the most consistent recurring

733
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,820
themes of my work, a series of
visionary experiences that kept

734
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,780
showing me over and over and
over again. Humanity is coming

735
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,500
to a turning point. Humanity is
coming to a profound revision of

736
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,040
its foundation. Humanity is
coming into a time of great

737
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:39,800
awakening over and over again.
Great Awakening the turning

738
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,940
point of history, a before and
after moment in time. The

739
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,240
visions of awakening is a
collection of six visions that I

740
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,120
pull out of different sessions.
I just group them together in

741
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:58,840
order to tell the story in a
coherent fashion. But I had not

742
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,940
been shown how the universe was
possibly going to pull this off.

743
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:08,220
How are we going to make this
transition? And then a year and

744
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,120
a half later, I went into
session 55 the Great Awakening

745
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,920
session, where I was taken deep
into deep time, but not personal

746
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,020
deep time, deep into collective
deep time. And I went into the

747
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,460
future, and I experienced the
death and rebirth of our

748
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:33,620
species. I wasn't a human being
when I experienced this, I was

749
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,840
the entire I had merged into the
field of the collective psyche,

750
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,780
and I experienced this crisis in
history as the species will

751
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,760
experience it. I experienced a
crisis that brought us to our

752
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:54,280
knees, a deep and profound
unraveling, a shattering of life

753
00:56:54,340 --> 00:57:01,260
as we had known it, a profound,
frightening time. But out of

754
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:09,120
this process was born an
extraordinary being, a

755
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:14,220
transformed humanity, a shift in
the fundamental blueprint of the

756
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:18,000
human psyche. And this was being
done not at the surface level,

757
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,620
but at the deep level of the
collective unconscious. This is

758
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:27,920
a shift in the blueprint of our
species. I was also given a

759
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,640
series of initiations into how
this was actually going to be

760
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:36,140
pulled off, and I don't have
time to go into it, maybe at the

761
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:42,100
workshop retreat I'll be doing
next week where we talk it has

762
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,880
to do with understanding the
dynamics of the collective

763
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,600
psyche, understanding non linear
systems, understanding how

764
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:54,400
systems are ch affect our how
systems functions when they're

765
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,180
driven into non linear states.
We have a good understanding of

766
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:01,200
what happens to physical systems
when they're driven into non

767
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,480
linear states. Well, the human
species is the human unconscious

768
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:11,520
is a fundamental, unified
psychic field. My sense is that

769
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,200
the great suffering that we are
entering is going to energize is

770
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,680
going to be so widespread and so
long lasting, it will literally

771
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,700
energize the collective psyche
as never before in human

772
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,180
history. And when it is
energized by such terrible

773
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:32,120
suffering, it will be capable of
transforming itself in an

774
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,140
historically unprecedented
manner, and it will give birth

775
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,220
to the future human. And I
believe that the future human

776
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,880
will be the diamond soul. Our
future is already encoded in our

777
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,900
past. Meaning that nature has
been preparing us for this

778
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,680
event. Has been preparing for us
for hundreds of 1000s of years.

779
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,320
We have been growing. We have
been collecting information,

780
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:01,320
collecting experiences, going
forward, going deeper. Labor is

781
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:06,420
a long I mean, birth, excuse me.
Gestation is a long process.

782
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,880
Birth is a relatively fast
process. Reincarnation has been

783
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,540
gestating the future human for
generations after generations

784
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:20,660
after generation. We are coming
into the time of birth. It's a

785
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:25,940
hard time, it's a scary time,
it's a Near-Death Experience

786
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:32,720
kind of time, but it's a
process, I think, which is

787
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,340
giving birth to an extraordinary
creature, just an extraordinary

788
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:42,220
creature. All right, my time is
used up, so I have to just pop

789
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,500
this very quickly the diamond
Luminosity. You.

790
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:12,000
Will you give me five minutes of
your break? Okay? When I

791
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,100
finished the greater reel of
arc, when I finished the

792
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:17,400
benediction of blessings, I felt
completely satisfied. I felt

793
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,360
like I had given something in
the ocean of suffering work, and

794
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:25,160
I had been rewarded by more than
I could possibly imagine. I felt

795
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,460
completely at peace. I had known
oneness. I had been drenched in

796
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:33,080
cosmic love. What more could you
ask for? But there was still

797
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,360
five years of work to go, after
going through yet one more very,

798
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,700
very intense death and rebirth
process at a cosmological level,

799
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:50,380
I was spun into the domain of
absolute, transcendent clarity,

800
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:55,420
light, light as I had never
known light before, absolutely,

801
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,920
absolutely clear. Just the
Buddhist to write, just touching

802
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,260
it once, just touching it, once
can undo centuries of wandering

803
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:09,780
around, lost in Samsara,
extraordinary purity, dissolving

804
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:15,540
into the crystalline body of the
Divine, becoming light, becoming

805
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:21,200
light, your mind completely
dissolved into the light which

806
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,220
is the primal light before
existence, before physical

807
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:32,480
existence manifests. The
sessions. There were out of 26

808
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:36,860
sessions over four years, I
entered this reality only four

809
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:46,120
times, four times in 26 sessions
in between those four times more

810
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,440
purification, more purgation,
just tremendous cleansing,

811
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,580
cleansing, cleansing, and also
interesting healing, personal

812
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:57,340
healing, which really surprised
me, because I would have thought

813
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,320
personal healing would have come
sooner, But here I was suddenly

814
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,440
involved in personal healing
after years of working at the

815
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,740
collective level, and it took me
a while to understand why things

816
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:11,520
were unfolding in this order.
Not time to talk about there.

817
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:17,460
But there was a logic to it.
There was an intention to it. I

818
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,840
entered into the diamond
Luminosity two times. I went

819
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,500
into deeper and deeper into the
diamond Luminosity. And then the

820
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,580
last two diamond Luminosity
experiences were not about going

821
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:32,180
deeper into the universe. It was
about the diamond Luminosity

822
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:35,120
crunching itself deeper and
deeper into my physical body,

823
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:40,160
crunching itself into my psyche,
into my into my psychological

824
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,240
awareness, but literally going
right into my physical body and

825
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,660
changing the physiological
structure of my cells. That's

826
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:51,760
what it felt nice. And the pivot
came in the middle when I was in

827
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,800
the 50th session, and extremely,
the deepest I ever went anywhere

828
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,660
in the universe. So I was in
this blissed out, incredibly

829
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:05,580
beautiful place, and all of a
sudden, everything pivoted 90

830
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:09,480
degrees, and I saw a reality
that was extremely far in the

831
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,220
distance. I saw whole worlds in
the far distance, and a light

832
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,600
hit me from that reality. I call
it the absolute light, just to

833
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,800
differentiate it to it
something, it hit me, and it

834
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:28,040
absolutely shattered me. And
that's when I understood, this

835
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:32,960
is an endless journey. I had
thought I had picked up the

836
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,680
idea. I had believed that this
journey, you do it to get

837
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,180
somewhere, to get there, as an
end point to the journey you get

838
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:44,320
home and it's either oneness
with God or entering in the

839
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,360
primal void. But there's a
point. There's an end point. At

840
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,320
this session, I let go of that
idea, and I realized it's an

841
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:58,360
endless journey. The Infinite is
much, much larger than any of

842
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:02,400
our spiritual traditions have
ever been able to grapple with,

843
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,420
yet it is an infinite process,
and that's why I would be much

844
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,120
gentler with myself if I were
doing this work again.

845
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,180
I've learned that the process is
not to try to get to the end of

846
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:27,740
the end of the line. The process
is simply open up, let as much

847
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:30,500
of the creative intelligence of
the universe into you as you

848
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,940
possibly can. Let it transform
you, let it break your heart and

849
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:40,120
open your heart, and then be
patient with the slower pace of

850
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:48,400
our organic transformation. The
last the final vision gave me

851
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:54,580
one last vision, the final
capstone of the entire 70 of 20

852
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,940
year journey. It gave it was the
capstone of the birth of the

853
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,380
future human. It took me deep
the it. It was, put me through a

854
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:05,460
terrible strip down, took me
deeper into the time than I had

855
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,140
ever been taken before. And it
gave me an intimate experience

856
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:14,220
of the future human. It gave me
several different lessons, and

857
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:19,380
it gave me an experience of the
universe as a diamond maker. I

858
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:24,020
experienced a swamp, a very dark
kind of mud which is represented

859
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,380
the top soil of reincarnation,
where everything, all individual

860
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,920
life forms, were dissolving,
reconstituting, dissolving,

861
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,980
reincarnating, dissolving,
reincarnating. And then there,

862
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:37,520
there were these sparks of
bright light shooting off into

863
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,040
the universe. These were diamond
souls. These are fully

864
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:46,900
integrated souls moving into the
universe, centers of integration

865
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,140
capable of integrating more and
more levels of consciousness

866
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:55,720
that the ego could alone could
never integrate. The universe is

867
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,560
a diamond maker. The universe is
growing sparks of diamond

868
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:04,020
Luminosity, and it makes no
difference to it or makes it

869
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:07,080
makes a difference, but it makes
no difference whether it takes a

870
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,460
million years or a million years
for this process to come to

871
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,840
fruition. It is a very, very
patient process. It has created

872
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,920
the cauldron of creativity, and
it is taking us deep, deep into

873
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:27,920
places that we can only imagine.
The last session, the last

874
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,120
chapter is coming off the
mountain, which I won't talk

875
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:37,520
about, but I learned that coming
off the mountain was as hard as

876
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,220
going up the mountain, walking
away from such intimacy with the

877
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:46,420
divine, walking away from such
profound immersion into the

878
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:52,420
divine reality, it's hard. Once
you have known the joy of

879
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,560
dissolving into light, time and
space, can begin to feel kind of

880
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:05,700
dried up, not very interesting.
It took me 10 years to really

881
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:11,580
get back into time and space, to
be grounded, to be in to be

882
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:17,280
comfortable being who I am, what
I am, for the remaining years of

883
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,200
my life here, I don't know
whether I would have been able

884
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:25,580
to make it back fully if it had
not been for the love of my

885
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:26,660
wife, Christina.

886
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:40,099
Thank you for letting me share
this joy, this story, with you.

887
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:44,679
It's a joy to bring it to this
particular community. We're

888
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:48,579
going to be doing the workshop
Friday, Saturday, which I hope

889
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,599
we'll have more time to go into
it. And one of the things I want

890
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:57,879
to experiment with is, can we
use guided visualization to open

891
01:07:57,879 --> 01:08:00,719
these places which are
universal, they lie in all of

892
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:03,539
everybody's hearts and
everybody's experience, in

893
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:06,119
addition to having a
conversation about psychedelics

894
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:09,479
and protocols and methodology
and the different experiences

895
01:08:09,479 --> 01:08:12,299
that different people have
gotten into, in addition to

896
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:15,419
that, we're going to explore
using guided imagery and deep

897
01:08:15,419 --> 01:08:20,399
relaxation to sort of activate
some of these deep places inside

898
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,539
that live inside each of our
hearts. Thank you very much. You

899
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,120
Unknown: you.

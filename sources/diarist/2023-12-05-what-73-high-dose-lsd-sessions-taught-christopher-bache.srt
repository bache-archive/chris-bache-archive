Steve Thayer: Steve Thayer,
welcome back to psychedelic

2
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:09,612
therapy frontiers, the podcast
devoted to exploring the

3
00:00:09,612 --> 00:00:12,312
frontiers of psychedelic
medicine and what it takes to

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,912
cultivate a healthy mind, body
and spirit, as always,

5
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:19,512
psychedelic therapy frontiers is
brought to you by Numinous. I'm

6
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:22,940
Dr Steve Thayer, and today my co
host, Dr Reed Robinson and I are

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,660
joined by Dr Christopher Bache,
PhD. Chris is a professor

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,480
emeritus in the Department of
Philosophy and Religious Studies

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,960
at Youngtown State University,
adjunct faculty at the

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,020
California Institute for
integral studies, Emeritus

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
fellow at the Institute of
Noetic Sciences and on the

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,340
Advisory Council of Grof legacy
training. He's the author of

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,980
several books, but the one that
prompted us to reach out to him

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,460
for this interview is LSD and
the mind of the universe, an

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,040
account of what Chris
experienced and learned from 73

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,060
high dose LSD journeys that he
embarked on over the course of

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,120
20 years. In today's
conversation, we explore Chris's

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,380
LSD session protocol, the
difference between using

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,220
psychedelics for what he calls
cosmological exploration versus

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,000
spiritual enlightenment or even
psychological healing. Talk

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
about how Chris processed and
integrated his very intense

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,720
experiences, what he learned
about reincarnation, evolution

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,200
at the collective and individual
levels, what humans need to do

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,280
to survive the mounting
existential threats we face.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,180
What he means by Diamond
Luminosity and diamond soul, and

26
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,480
of course, much, much more,
Chris's book had a profound

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,780
impact on me. His disciplined,
scholarly approach to

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,720
psychedelic exploration,
combined with his ability to

29
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,200
articulate and teach what for
most of us would be an

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,940
overwhelming or ineffable
experience has resulted in a

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,820
must read, in my opinion, for
anyone who thinks deeply about

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,420
questions like, Who are we? What
are we doing here, and where we

33
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,960
might go from here? If you've

00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,240

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,380
psychedelics in a clinical

Reed and I are very honored

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,840
today to be joined by Dr Chris
Bache, Chris, thank you so much

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,920
for joining us.

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,820
Chris Bache: It's a pleasure to
be here with you today. So why

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,060
don't

58
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,820
Steve Thayer: we just start
Chris by introducing yourself to

59
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,100
our audience, and you can, you
know, share as much or as little

60
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,140
as you'd like, just to give us
some context,

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,180
Chris Bache: well, I'm a
professor, retired professor of

62
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,200
religious studies. I've made my
living teaching in the

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,320
Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies in Youngstown

64
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,040
State University, which is a
state university in Northeast

65
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,580
Ohio. So my what brings me to
this program, I guess, is the

66
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,420
book that I published three
years ago called LSD in the mind

67
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,220
of the universe, which is a
strange book for a professor of

68
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,660
religious studies to have
written. So my story is that

69
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,720
right at the very beginning of
my academic career, 1978 I just

70
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,980
finished my graduate work at
Brown in philosophy of religion,

71
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,820
and I met the work of Stan Grof,
and I immediately recognized

72
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,620
that his research and LSD
psychedelics in general were

73
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,480
extraordinarily important, not
just for clinical psychology and

74
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,380
for therapy, but for philosophy,
which was what interested me the

75
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,040
most. And so I began, even
though it was illegal, I began

76
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,360
of quiet, private psychedelic
practice, which ended up

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,520
continuing for 20 years. I
worked for four years, I then

78
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,420
stopped for six years for
reasons I described in the book,

79
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,980
and then I worked for another 10
years, and then I spent another

80
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,720
10 years digest. This is from 79
to 99 when I was 50 to 30 to 50,

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,680
and then I spent the next 20
years digesting those

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,760
experiences, trying to absorb
them, trying to extrapolate and

83
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,820
clarify the cosmological
implications of those

84
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,820
experiences. And that's. And
then I published LSD in the mind

85
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,440
of the universe. So that's kind
of a brief sketch of what brings

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,980
me here.

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,080
Steve Thayer: Yeah, it's an it's
and I remember, as I was reading

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,900
your book, I was thinking, what
a heroic undertaking. I don't

89
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,560
know if heroic is a word that
lands for you, Chris, but I mean

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,540
heroic in the sense of a hero's
journey, the things you describe

91
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,480
in the book, the experiences
that you had, not for the faint

92
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,200
of heart, and I've heard you say
that you don't necessarily

93
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,980
recommend the protocol, the
things that you did to others,

94
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,900
and I was curious as to why.

95
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,920
Chris Bache: Well, first, let me
describe the protocol. First,

96
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,600
everything I did was within a
strict therapeutic protocol. I

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,580
followed Stan's protocols from
his book, LSD psychotherapy, so

98
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,760
traditionals, lying down, eye
shades, earphones, listening to

99
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,980
very carefully choreographed
music to guide the session. I

100
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,380
was always, always in private,
always protected, always with a

101
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,000
sitter, who was my wife at the
time, who was a clinical

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,820
psychologist, so established in
what I call the psychedelic

103
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,360
Kiva. And, you know, a Kiva of
spiritual practice, for reasons

104
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,440
that we can go into, but we
don't need to. I chose to work

105
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,180
with very high doses of LSD.
After about three sessions, 250

106
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,540
micrograms, I chose to work at
500 to 600 micrograms, which is

107
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,240
the upper limit. It's, it's the
body saturation point. And

108
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,420
naively, I was thinking at the
time that this work was about

109
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,160
personal transformation, even
personal spiritual awakening.

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,220
And all the spiritual literature
described one's karma ultimately

111
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,160
as finite, even though it may
involve, you know, causation

112
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,480
patterns from multiple
incarnations, but ultimately

113
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,260
it's finite. So I thought that
this therapeutic work is a

114
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,160
process of clearing the
conditioning of my of my psyche,

115
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,480
and essentially engaging and
clarifying and purifying karma.

116
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,380
And I thought if I worked with
large doses of LSD, I could

117
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,620
basically go through this faster
if I could manage the intensity

118
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,460
of the work, essentially taking
bigger bites of karma in every

119
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,200
session. Well, I found out down
the road that all those

120
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,100
assumptions I was making were
wrong. This work was not about

121
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,140
personal transformation, not
working at this high dose level.

122
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,800
If you're working with a gentler
psychedelic or in lower doses,

123
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,400
then the activation and the
purification and the healing

124
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,200
that would take place might be
constricted or to personal

125
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,040
levels. But if you're working
with a very powerful

126
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,800
psychedelic, like this much LSD,
you basically amplify

127
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,780
consciousness so deeply that
what may have begun as a

128
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,540
personal transformative process
becomes engaged in collective

129
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,080
processes that having to do with
the collective unconscious, the

130
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,780
species mind. And from there
you're off to the races into

131
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,040
deeper and deeper levels of
consciousness, cycles of death

132
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,360
and rebirth, not just ego, death
and ego death is the first of

133
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,720
many deaths that you face on
this journey, but as you go

134
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,720
through one level of
consciousness after another,

135
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,560
systematically, you go Through
many forms of death that are

136
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:47,980
more foreign, perhaps, than ego
death. So that's that's why I

137
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,480
don't recommend the protocol,
because it's an extremely

138
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,900
demanding protocol. It takes a
lot of it basically becomes the

139
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,300
center focus of much of your
life, just to engage these deep

140
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,980
states, to navigate them, to
absorb them and integrate them

141
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,820
into your life, and integrate
them into your your social life,

142
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,040
and into your body. If and I
also, I thought that there was

143
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,240
an end point to this journey.
You know, one of my false

144
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,720
assumptions. Was the reason for
doing this work was to get

145
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,900
somewhere, to get to
enlightenment, or to become one

146
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,240
with God, or to enter into the
primal void of existence. And I

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,780
had all of those experiences,
and I discovered that there were

148
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,400
many levels of divinity that one
can enter into communion with.

149
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,840
And there were even many levels
of the of the pure void, of the

150
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:53,380
fertile void. And about, oh, 15
years into my experience, I had

151
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,820
a particular experience when I
was as deep into the universe as

152
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,040
I would ever go deep. To what I
call the diamond Luminosity

153
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,500
domain, and I had an experience
that I saw reality far, far into

154
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,220
the distance which and the beam
of light hit me from that

155
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,160
reality, and it shattered me. It
just shattered me. And I was in

156
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,900
a very high and subtle state of
consciousness, and that's when I

157
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,700
realized it's an Infinite
Journey. You'll never get to the

158
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,520
end of the universe. The
universe is just too vast. The

159
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,860
depth of the divinity is just so
great. So now that, if I were to

160
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,000
start this journey over again, I
would be much gentler with

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,280
myself. I'd work with gentle I
balance low dose, high dose,

162
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,320
organic psychedelics, synthetic
psychedelics, because now I

163
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,760
understand that the real goal of
this work is to open yourself to

164
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,080
let in as much of the love and
intelligence and wisdom of the

165
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,040
universe as you can into your
system, and then to digest it

166
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,780
and hold on to it and draw it
into your life and let it guide

167
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,880
you. And it's not about getting
to some final destination

168
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,840
Reid Robison: that's beautiful.
Chris, thank you for for

169
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,100
sharing. I'm so many questions
come up, but one thing I wanted

170
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,100
to ask along those lines is,
what do you think the risks are

171
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:29,660
of going straight to those
higher deep states, like going

172
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,820
to the higher doses and perhaps
bypassing some of the healing

173
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,300
work or the lower dose work? Is
there a little more you can

174
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,720
share on how you might use those
two different dose ranges as

175
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,060
tools? Yeah.

176
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,900
Chris Bache: Well, first of all,
any work with psychedelics,

177
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,140
especially if you're working
with higher doses in a

178
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,600
therapeutic protocol, any work
with psychedelics can be

179
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,360
challenging, and therefore calls
for good psychological screening

180
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,620
to make sure that you have a
psyche that's ready to engage

181
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,480
these deep levels. As you know,
there are some people who should

182
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,020
never go near psychedelic
psychedelics, and there are some

183
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,900
people who should really work
very gently with psychedelics,

184
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,440
if they work with psychedelics
at all. I happen to have a

185
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:35,240
constitution that can become
large or can flow into expansive

186
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,180
states pretty readily and
congeal pretty readily and

187
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,720
smoothly at the end of the day,
not everybody is wired like

188
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,920
that. And so it's, you know, all
the cautions have to be taken,

189
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,300
all the clinical you know,
criteria have to be met for this

190
00:12:52,300 --> 00:13:00,100
type of work. Now, if you work
with high doses, you can bypass,

191
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,300
I mean, you can get into
situations where you can chase a

192
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,860
particular level of experience
and bypass but that wasn't that

193
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,760
didn't happen to me. It wasn't
part of my work. I spent the

194
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,520
first 10 sessions and two and a
half years in very grueling kind

195
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,440
of work with in what Stan calls
the perinatal level of a level

196
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
of consciousness, the interface
between your personal

197
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,240
unconscious and the collective
or Transpersonal, personal

198
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,380
consciousness. So it's you know
you're You're reliving your

199
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,800
birth. You're dealing with all
sorts of existential crises.

200
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,000
You're really grinding things
very deeply at that level. Now I

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,140
will say that late in my
sessions, rather late. I mean,

202
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,060
15 years down the road. I mean,
there was lots of personal

203
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,300
healing that took place along
the way. Don't get me wrong.

204
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,880
There were personal healings
that took place in those first

205
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,420
10 sessions, and other down the
road. Often they would take

206
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,080
place at the beginning and
ending of my sessions, if I

207
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,400
would, when I was leaving space
time and when I was coming back

208
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,940
into space time. Because when I
was working in the peak of the

209
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,540
sessions after about, you know,
the first two or three years of

210
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,080
work, I was working in states of
consciousness that were far

211
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,120
beyond my personal consciousness
and far beyond space time even.

212
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,920
But along the way, you know,
packaged around the areas, there

213
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,220
was lots of healing at different
parts. And late in the sessions,

214
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:47,140
there was some very quick
healings of pieces of my life.

215
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,500
And I think if I had been
working with lower doses, those

216
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,660
healings would have taken place
earlier. But I found that in my

217
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,780
particular instance, I don't
think it was because I was

218
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,336
jumping over. Any problems, or
was not willing to confront any

219
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:08,496
problems, because the things you
confront at the deep levels of

220
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:12,756
the psyche are much, much more
severe than anything that you

221
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:16,356
confront at the personal level
in the psyche. And I want to say

222
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:20,180
that, you know, I came into this
work, I wasn't carrying any

223
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,100
personal trauma, I had a pretty
easy start in life. I had good

224
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,460
parents, good good home
environment, nothing more than

225
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:34,280
the ordinary push pull in a
family. And so there wasn't a

226
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,980
deep wound that I took into this
work, other than the deeper

227
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,080
wound is really the wounds that
everybody, every human being,

228
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,640
carries when they enter time and
space. That is the wound of

229
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,660
stabilizing within time and
space and understanding why we

230
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,400
are here. What is the whole
purpose my existence in this

231
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:03,780
domain? And can I? Can I
discover what my reason for

232
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,460
being here is, and can I enter
into communion with the

233
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,700
intelligence that I believe
saturates all existence? So in

234
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:21,500
my particular case, I what I
found was that, and I have to

235
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,160
say this carefully for someone
who doesn't know my work. It may

236
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:32,600
sound grandiose, and I apologize
for that, but I found that my

237
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:39,140
personal wounds were not kind of
healed until late in my work,

238
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,840
because it was my personal
wounds that anchored me in the

239
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,120
larger fields of consciousness
in such a way that it allowed me

240
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:56,140
to accomplish, or to be used to
accomplish, some of the healing

241
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,800
of the collective psyche that
took place in my work. And that

242
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,720
is I it's like the way I
describe it in the book, my

243
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,460
personal wound anchored one side
of a bridge and the other side

244
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,200
of the bridge was the collective
psyche. And by having that

245
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,540
bridge, when I went deep into
awareness consciousness, it

246
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,720
allowed my sessions to become a
conduit to pull some of the pain

247
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,460
of the collective psyche out of
the collective psyche and to

248
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,100
transform it. And if my personal
wounds had been healed early on,

249
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,020
that ability to do that would
have been compromised. And what

250
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,400
I learned along the way is that
this function, this specific

251
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,900
function, to engage the
collective psyche in a way, to

252
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,240
bring a certain measure of
healing to it was part of my

253
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,080
soul's work. It was something
that I kind of signed up for in

254
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,640
this incarnation. And I think,
personally, I think there are a

255
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,240
lot of people who are doing this
type of work and have signed up

256
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,300
for this type of work. I don't
think is anything special or

257
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,560
unusual about my choice to do
this work. It is,

258
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Reid Robison: from our
perspective, a very brave hero's

259
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,960
journey, as Steve mentioned
earlier when we were chatting,

260
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,100
but, but I'm also curious about
that disposition you mentioned,

261
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:31,880
because it comes into play in
people we work with, and a lot

262
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,780
of questions we get. How much of
it do you think is nature versus

263
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,500
nurture? How much can you
cultivate as an ability to

264
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,220
expand and hold those states
without, you know, shattering

265
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,660
into overwhelm or getting
discombobulated, wondering if

266
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,860
you have some thoughts on that,

267
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,920
Chris Bache: I'm I'm sure you, I
mean, I know we can learn how to

268
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,900
enter these states more
skillfully. Some people have a

269
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,380
natural aptitude for moving into
them, but whatever the level of

270
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,000
aptitude is, we practice in
these states, and we enter into

271
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,900
them carefully. And if you enter
carefully and process carefully

272
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,800
and debrief carefully, we can
learn how to enter these states

273
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,900
better in future, in future
sessions, I really think

274
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,940
integration and very careful
debrief, careful recording of

275
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,260
your session after it's over,
processing it really sitting

276
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,860
with the content of it is really
important, because it

277
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,240
establishes the baseline for
your next entry into your non

278
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,180
ordinary state. And so it's like
a cycle, and integrating your

279
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,500
work as you could hold is really
important to the next step in

280
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:54,760
your work. Now I want to mention
that in my work, particularly

281
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,600
since it was being it was being
driven by such highly amplified

282
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,160
states of consciousness. So in
my work, I kept as many

283
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,500
variables stable as possible. So
for all these sessions, I worked

284
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,480
in the same sentence, setting,
same substance, same dose, same

285
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,800
sitter, same recording process,
even the same part of the

286
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,540
country, because any of these
variables can change some of the

287
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,280
texture, and that's not bad to
change the texture, but by

288
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,600
standardizing the variables, I
think it created a container

289
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,600
which allowed my conversation
with the universe and my

290
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,480
communion with the universe to
progressively deepen deep get

291
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,420
deeper and deeper over time. So
by stabilizing the content, the

292
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,740
contact, the zone of contact I
made with the universe, it

293
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,960
allowed the deepening to take
place. Now, of course, what kind

294
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,140
of communication or contact we
have with the universe partly

295
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,340
depends upon the headroom of the
psychedelic that we're using.

296
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,180
And all psychedelics, you know,
Psilocybin, Ibogaine, MDMA,

297
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,060
five, MEO, DMT, LSD, they all
have certain qualities of how

298
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,200
they engage consciousness, and
they have a certain spectrum, a

299
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,560
range of engaging. And I think
one of the reasons I kept

300
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,300
breaking through over 20 years
one level of consciousness after

301
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,220
another had to do with holding
the posture, holding the

302
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,840
setting, but also with the sheer
power of the psychedelic that I

303
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,000
was using, if I had been working
with say Psilocybin, I'm sure my

304
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,900
experiences would have
overlapped a great deal, but I

305
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,260
don't think it would have had as
much headroom, cosmological

306
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,560
headroom, as working with LSD
did.

307
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,480
Reid Robison: And how did your
your wife then feel about the

308
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,420
trip sitting duty, that's kudos
to her on the dedication for

309
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,280
that role as well. Was it hard
to hard to convince her to do

310
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,460
that? Or was she kind of with
you in this purpose of the the

311
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,160
philosophical adventure?

312
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,140
Chris Bache: Carol did this out
of love for me. She was never

313
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,240
particularly drawn to working
with psychedelics. They were too

314
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,620
much too fast. In her opinion.
She's a deeply spiritual person,

315
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,260
and we eventually, after 24
years of marriage, we separated,

316
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,720
and she has got we're friends,
and we stay in contact with each

317
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,840
other and with our children,
particularly around our

318
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,620
children. She has gone on to
complete her three year, three

319
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,780
month retreat in the vadna
tradition. So she's a serious

320
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,960
practitioner, and she has a deep
spiritual orientation. It's been

321
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,360
it's lifelong, and it was a
tremendous value to me to have

322
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,680
her spiritual wisdom grounding
me while I entered into this

323
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,600
work. But it was never her work,
and she did it because she knew

324
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,800
I wanted to do it, and we always
supported each other in our

325
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,240
spiritual paths.

326
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,560
Reid Robison: That's really
neat. No thanks for sharing all

327
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:21,980
this.

328
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,540
Steve Thayer: Yeah, Chris, I'm
I'm really captivated by the the

329
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,160
very scientific like approach
that you took, or at least a

330
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,700
very careful and deliberate and
disciplined approach. And the

331
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,880
way I imagine it is by
controlling for those variables,

332
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,040
you were able to return to maybe
the same drill site and just

333
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,420
sort of auger down and get this
very, very deep core sample of

334
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,540
the cosmos. You know, very, very
deep core sample of the

335
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,480
universe. And you know, as it
manifested in you, and you

336
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,900
manifested in it, as opposed to
what some Psychonauts or people

337
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,660
who are approaching psychedelics
for therapeutic or spiritual

338
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,920
exploration purposes do, where
they just sort of pockmark the

339
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,480
surface by not paying close
attention to set and setting, or

340
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,060
they're experimenting with many
different types of of

341
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,900
substances,

342
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,460
Chris Bache: yeah, yeah. I think
that's I think that's true

343
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,860
there, of course, there's no
right or wrong way to use

344
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,260
psychedelics. There are so many
ways of using them, and many

345
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,520
good ways of using them. So I
just happened to represent one

346
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,120
particular strategy. I was
trained as a philosopher of

347
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,900
religion. I have a natural
orientation towards precision

348
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,940
and analysis, and so
particularly since I wasn't

349
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,080
didn't fully know what I was
getting into, I wanted to leave

350
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,580
breadcrumbs in case I needed to
work my way back out again. It

351
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:54,640
turns out that was a that was
not a needed concern. I'm sorry

352
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,560
I'm losing my train of thought
here a little bit.

353
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,720
Steve Thayer: Well, no, I have,
I guess I have a follow up

354
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,620
question here, Chris. Because.
Yes, as a trained philosopher of

355
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,620
religion, I think I've read, if
not in the book, it might have

356
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,160
been in the post script that you
wrote for paradigm explore that

357
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,440
you know you when you started
approaching this work, you might

358
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,860
have described yourself as an
agnostic, sort of atheist,

359
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,040
leaning agnostic. Yeah, and I'm
curious to hear how your belief

360
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,540
in or relationship to the Divine
changed, if at all, as a result

361
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,040
of your experience with this
substance and this protocol.

362
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Chris Bache: Well, you know,
basically through all the

363
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,020
Graduate Studies and I went
through, I basically studied my

364
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,340
way out of religion entirely,
and out of theism, and out of

365
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,960
any belief in the divinity as I
had learned it by studying world

366
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,800
religions and the history of
theology and philosophy. And so

367
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,820
I began this work as as not just
an agnostic, but an

368
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,100
atheistically inclined agnostic.
It was like, Okay, you're going

369
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,280
to put up or shut up on this
one. Because right now it's, it

370
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,720
doesn't look good. I mean, my
the whole, I think science has

371
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,020
just gone through and wiped out
anything, any thing that smacks

372
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,980
of traditional religion, because
the God of the religions of the

373
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,160
Axial Age, that deity is just
too small for the universe that

374
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,480
science is showing us is, is
here just the massive scale and

375
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,860
scope and intelligence of it.
And, you know, it's just, I

376
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,080
think it just erased the
Blackboard, and we're still

377
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,240
catching up with this erased
Blackboard. So I brought a mind

378
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,800
that was not adverse to
religion, but was adverse to

379
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:51,280
theology in a way, and but when
you begin to have experiences of

380
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,080
the reality that the religions
have been talking about, well

381
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,380
that changes everything very
quickly, so that when one goes

382
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,920
does this work? And you go
through cycles of death and

383
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:11,160
rebirth, and you go through this
process of losing your reality

384
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,360
or surrendering your reality as
you have known it, inside time

385
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,300
and space. And you go through a
death of that reality and a

386
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,380
rebirth. You wake up in another
level of reality, another

387
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,180
dimension of existence, and you
do that again and again in a

388
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:38,480
systematic way. Then the reality
of the reality of a reality

389
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,720
beyond space and time, just
becomes overwhelmingly clear and

390
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,260
true to you, and your ability to
understand it and to absorb it

391
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:59,860
and to taste it becomes second
nature. Now, in all the years I

392
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,060
did this work, and all the
levels of consciousness I went

393
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,280
through, I never encountered
anything that might be

394
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,740
recognized as a deity or even a
personal spiritual guide, which

395
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,700
is pretty common in many
shamanic traditions. But I

396
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,580
always felt myself to be
engaging an intelligence that

397
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,960
was essentially guiding my
experiences, or kind of feeding

398
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,100
these experiences to me in an
interactive, participatory

399
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,740
manner. And this this
consciousness, boundaries of

400
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,780
this consciousness, kept
deepening the deeper my practice

401
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:47,860
when in that context, I could
speak about God, but I don't

402
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,760
really like to, because God has
so many connotations in the West

403
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,660
that I'm not comfortable with.
And you I could speak about

404
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,360
divine, divinity, but that's
just kind of smuggling in, you

405
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,040
know, through a side door. So I
tend to speak about the creative

406
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,280
intelligence of the universe,
because, in one way, a way of

407
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,280
understanding the scale and
scope of what I actually

408
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,160
experienced is to understand
that the universe has a mind the

409
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,980
and actually the universe arises
out of a mind. It arises out of

410
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,940
a consciousness, and it's always
sustained and nurtured, nurtured

411
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,560
by a more fundamental reality,
which you can call it spiritual.

412
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,900
You can call it dark energy,
dark matter, you know, but now

413
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,360
we know that 96% of the universe
is invisible, dark energy, dark

414
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,460
matter. So it's not that radical
to sort of suggest that there is

415
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:55,780
a reality behind physical
reality. I think all our

416
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,280
historical concepts of God have
been profoundly. Incomplete,

417
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,020
inadequate, and we are entering
a period of history where we're

418
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:11,540
basically going to be rewriting
that story. And I think

419
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,140
psychedelics have an important
role to play, because it lets

420
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:21,440
ordinary mortals, in a way, just
ordinary lay people, have first

421
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,380
hand contact with this vast
expanse of spiritual reality

422
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,560
that gives you experiences that
you know are the kind of

423
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,220
experiences that previously in
earlier generations, people

424
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,280
would have described as the
experience of God.

425
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,860
Steve Thayer: So Chris, who are
we in this story? You know, are

426
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,120
we, as others have stated, are
we sort of this, this, you know,

427
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,080
unique organization of molecules
that is the universe

428
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,400
experiencing itself. This, each
one of us a fractal, you know

429
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,180
that where the universe gets to
joy and experiencing itself in a

430
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,700
way that wouldn't have
otherwise. Like, what do you

431
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,540
think we are?

432
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,020
Chris Bache: I think you say it
pretty well. I think you know

433
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,540
this. That question has so many
levels to it, and it depends on

434
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,860
how we want to frame it going
in, we are clearly part of the

435
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,080
creative experiment that the
universe is. We are. We are an

436
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,160
aspect of it. We're not
separated from it. We are our

437
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,960
nature, our body, the cells of
our biology, arise out of this

438
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:39,140
evolutionary masterpiece. And
our mind, just as our body

439
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,660
derives from the universe. Our
mind derives from the universe.

440
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Now, I know in our period of
history, we're taught that the

441
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,880
universe is a machine, and it
moves with the machine's

442
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,900
blindness, and it evolves
through random mutation and

443
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,600
genetic mutation and random
variation and screening by a

444
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,260
necessity, but that's just a
story that we've told, and it's

445
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,460
not been a bad story, but it's a
profoundly incomplete story,

446
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,500
because when you when you sink
down into the depths of your

447
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,100
mind, you drop eventually out of
your mind into deeper layers of

448
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,280
mind, into the species mind,
into the, you know, a solar

449
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,720
system or galactic mind. And as
you drop down into that, you

450
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,640
engage you, you find yourself
confronting or being dissolved

451
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:41,860
into an intelligence that is
just stunningly vast. I mean,

452
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,540
it's just a massive intelligence
and a depth of love and

453
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,460
compassion that's behind that
intelligence and and it's this

454
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,500
intelligence which is
manifesting the universe that we

455
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,620
experience. It's manifesting
itself. Ask the universe, and we

456
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:07,140
are fortunate enough to be cells
within this body of divine self

457
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,460
manifestation, fractally
embedded in it, so that our

458
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,340
story is part of its story, its
story is part of our story. Now

459
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,200
that's at one level, and then at
a deeper level, if we add

460
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,220
reincarnation into it. And of
course, that's an assumed in my

461
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,180
worldview, not because of faith,
but because of the empirical

462
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,200
evidence that we have a mass at
this point in time. My first

463
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,220
book was on reincarnation, and I
think that's just part of how

464
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,740
nature functions. We don't
really know how it came to

465
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,620
function this way, but nature
has found a way to fold learning

466
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,880
forward, not only at the species
level, in an eval in a broad

467
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,600
species evolutionary sense, but
it's found a way to fold

468
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,280
individual learning forward in a
way that I think reincarnation

469
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:03,000
is simply a higher octave of
evolution. And once we add

470
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,720
evolution of reincarnation into
the story, once we understand

471
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,000
that we are participants in this
evolving universe for not just

472
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,340
100 years, but for 100,000
years, then the plot really

473
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:23,180
thickens. Then we're looking at
the universe is intensely

474
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:28,100
involved in manifesting
galaxies, solar systems,

475
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:36,440
planets, life, self aware life,
and then evolving, reincarnating

476
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:45,580
life, that puts us on some type
of profound co footing with

477
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,260
creation, with existence, so
that we really are, our

478
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,160
evolution and its evolution are
really part of the same fabric,

479
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,840
human evolution, individual
evolution, they're really two

480
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,160
different aspects. Is of the
same process.

481
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,220
Steve Thayer: So if you'll
permit me, Chris, to just keep

482
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,560
pulling on this thread, because
it's one that's fascinated me

483
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,340
and preoccupied me, frankly, for
my entire life. I mean, this

484
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,980
notion of who we are in relation
to the universe. What is the

485
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,000
what is divinity? Because when
you when we're preoccupied with

486
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,840
the month, what feels like the
mundane, you know, mundane of

487
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,240
daily life, paying our taxes,
going to work, that kind of

488
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,320
thing. And we think of ourselves
as this, as I said before, sort

489
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,660
of this fractal piece of what
you describe as this practically

490
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,960
infinite intelligence, the
substrate of which it sounds

491
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,320
like is love. It causes me to
think like, Well, so are we,

492
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,520
have we always existed in some
way, shape or form, as an

493
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,280
individualized intelligence
related to this grant, this

494
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,980
grander one? Because when you
talk about reincarnation, it

495
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,920
makes me wonder, like, was
there, is there some continuity

496
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,920
to Steve Thayer that goes back
hundreds and hundreds of 1000s

497
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,780
of years that I just don't
remember, right? Or is it, each

498
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,020
time we're we're deconstructed
to our constituent parts and

499
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,440
reassembled with new parts and
and it's just sort of pieces

500
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,600
that move forward in time. What
do you think?

501
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,920
Chris Bache: Yeah, but you know,
we don't know the answers to all

502
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,520
the all the answers to those
questions. We don't really know

503
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,200
how reincarnation works. We
don't know what the physics of

504
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,800
reincarnation is. Even if we
have evidence, evidence that

505
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,800
reincarnation is a fact of
nature, we don't know the nature

506
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,820
of it, how it goes, how it
works. But it seems to be that

507
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,680
the universe is a learning
system, and reincarnation is a

508
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:43,840
part of a learning system. So
because our consciousness did

509
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,400
not begin with our body, but our
consciousness goes back farther,

510
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,320
we can then use a concept like
Soul, some type of concept that

511
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,520
holds and gathers the learning
from all of the incarnations

512
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,640
that we've experienced. How far
back does it go? Two questions,

513
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,140
how far back does it go? Right?
And the answer is, nobody knows

514
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,380
for sure. But all the cultures
that have believed in

515
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,060
reincarnation say it doesn't
start with human beings. It

516
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,320
starts before human beings. How
far before human beings? Well,

517
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,960
we're not really sure. Now my
sense is that it's it starts

518
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,000
when individuality begins to
emerge within the evolutionary

519
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,200
matrix. And I'll use the term
evolution frequently, as you

520
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,300
know, as you've heard, but that
and I believe in the concept of

521
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,920
progressive development, of
progressive unfolding, but that

522
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,340
doesn't mean I agree with the
kind of standard textbook theory

523
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,360
of what's driving reincarnation.
So when I use the term

524
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,940
evolution, I don't mean that
theory of that reductive

525
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,140
determinist theory.

526
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:07,560
It's about learning. How far
back does it go? Somewhere along

527
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:15,660
the way between grasses and
chimpanzees, it's hard to think

528
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,200
of individual blades of grass
having individual consciousness.

529
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,000
We usually think in terms of
broad classes, but somewhere in

530
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,940
the evolutionary process, an
individuality emerges, and as

531
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,860
that individuality emerges,
there's a learning that deepens

532
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,280
that individuality over time,
and that's when I think

533
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,100
reincarnation becomes possible.
Classically, they look to

534
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:50,080
animals that are well lower than
the mammalian change, but

535
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,980
somewhere around in somewhere in
the animal life form, but

536
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,420
wherever it emerges. The next
question is, what are we

537
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,760
underneath these evolved
changes? And I think the answer

538
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,060
to that is you have to get that
takes us down into a deeper

539
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,780
level underneath the soul. And
we ask, well, what is the

540
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,920
essence of the soul? What is the
essence of our individuality?

541
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,760
What's the essence that makes
this evolving individuality

542
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,640
possible? And there, I think we
we find the same answers in

543
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,260
psychedelic work that we find in
the classic mystical traditions,

544
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,860
classic high spiritual
traditions. And that is, the

545
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,700
essence of the individual is the
essence of the Divine. The

546
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,020
essence of the one is the
essence of the totality we are,

547
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:44,200
in essence derived from the
Divine sparks of the Divine.

548
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,460
We've been sort of teased out of
the unitive matrix of the

549
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:54,280
Divinity, and been given the
privilege of individuated

550
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,500
existence, which then is
polished and refined and deep

551
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,780
and over. 1000s and 1000s and
1000s of years of going back and

552
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,560
forth between spirit and matter,
spirit and matter, spirit and

553
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,120
matter, taking us onto a
developmental process. But the

554
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,860
essence of what we are is the
divine itself. The manifestation

555
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,800
of what we are depends upon how
long we've been cooking.

556
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,200
Reid Robison: That's
fascinating. And how you

557
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,660
mentioned karma earlier, how you
viewed it going into this work,

558
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,900
and suggested that maybe it
changed, but wondering how you

559
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,940
view karma now, in this, in this
broad perspective that you've

560
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,600
been sharing,

561
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,700
Chris Bache: it's simply as
cause and effect. You know, it's

562
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:49,300
karma, vipaka, cause and effect.
It's simply making it course the

563
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,140
universe pulses with cause and
effect right at all of its

564
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,680
levels. But here we're simply
talking about a substrate of

565
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,060
cause and effect, the causes
that are set in motion by the

566
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:06,900
exercise of our capacity to
choose. We make choices, we

567
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,380
inherit the consequences of
those choices. In that new

568
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,740
context, we make new choices,
and then we inherit the

569
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,540
consequences of those choices.
So if we've been smoking two

570
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,600
packs of cigarettes every day
for five years, we're not free

571
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,980
to not want that next cigarette,
but we are free to begin to set

572
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,040
in motion a series of choices
that can free us from that

573
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,280
addiction to those cigarettes.
So we're constantly making

574
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,100
choices. We inherit the
consequences of those choices.

575
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,680
One of the ways in which my
thinking has changed over the

576
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,420
years since writing life cycles,
my first book is that I have a

577
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:53,320
much deeper appreciation of the
synergistic relationship between

578
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,480
individual development or
individual karma and collective

579
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,640
development or collective karma.
I think that we have a tendency

580
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,320
in the West to over personalize
the concept of Karma, to really

581
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,120
kind of tell the story of the
individual soul in maturing over

582
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,620
many lifetimes and reaching
enlightenment or whatever. And I

583
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:23,780
think this our species is
evolving, pulsing every 100

584
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:30,560
years in reincarnation, and
there is a collective learning

585
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,280
process taking place, which our
individual learning process is

586
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,740
part of. And so the boundary
between collective learning and

587
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:44,980
individual learning is porous,
and I have much more respect or

588
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,840
sensitivity to the collective
karma that I had might have

589
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,960
previously seen as personal
karma.

590
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:57,340
Reid Robison: Yeah, wow. And
earlier you mentioned the role

591
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,720
psychedelics might be playing in
this kind of evolution of

592
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,220
consciousness these days, and
when we were talking about that

593
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,120
place between blades of grass
and chimpanzees, I'm wondering

594
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,900
what your thoughts are on
Terence McKenna's like stone day

595
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,080
hypothesis, and if that was an
example of The Universe between

596
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:25,160
spirit and matter, learning as
it evolved. And if you viewed

597
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,680
psychedelics as playing a role
in history as well,

598
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,160
Chris Bache: Terence is
hypothesis. There is

599
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,840
interesting, isn't it? Yeah, and
I don't have, I don't have an

600
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,040
opinion on that. I don't have
any particular, any new insights

601
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:46,600
to add to that, I hold it as an
interesting hypothesis. I don't

602
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,560
have any individual, any
independent way of assessing

603
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,980
that. Well, I just don't know.
Now. I do think that we are

604
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,380
coming to a turning point in
history. We are coming to a make

605
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:09,900
or break point in history, and I
think that psychedelics have a

606
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,920
significant role to play, and
they're giving us extra

607
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,280
awareness at a time when we
desperately need extra

608
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,620
awareness. They also are giving
us a form of accelerated and

609
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,480
deepening healing at a time when
we desperately need accelerated

610
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,440
and deepening healing. Because I
think that there is a tremendous

611
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,700
inner fermentation process
taking place, a tremendous

612
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:39,680
detoxification taking place at
the collective level as well as

613
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,780
an individual level, and it
manifests itself in our

614
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:49,900
individual lives in terms of
this kind of more up rushing of

615
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,520
content of karmic content of
conditioning, of pain and trauma

616
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,680
that we've been carrying in our
soul history. But I think this

617
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,600
has. Happening, not just to a
few select individuals who are

618
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,380
middle class able to attend to
this, but it's happening

619
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,900
underneath us, in our social
movements and underneath the

620
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,640
world at large. And I think
psychedelics by giving us an

621
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,960
amplified experience of our
consciousness and our

622
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,440
consciousness and the
consciousness that we are part

623
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,660
of it not only helps us heal and
helps us manage this

624
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,760
purification process, but it
also gives us a wider world

625
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,440
view, which it only takes, you
know, a one good, deep

626
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:40,600
psychedelic experience of
communion with the deep

627
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,860
structure of the universe to
shatter materialism, the

628
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:49,420
philosophy of that matter, is
the only thing that's real. I

629
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,900
think Huston Smith was right
that a mystical experience does

630
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,480
not a mystic make, but a
mystical experience can an

631
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,300
atheist unmake, you know, and I
think psychedelics have a very

632
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,440
important role to play in that
now. How far can will this go?

633
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,020
How deep will psychedelic
healing reach in our culture?

634
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,640
How fast, with these insights
realized under psychedelic

635
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,700
communion, change or contribute
to the paradigm shift that's

636
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,240
taking place, which is being
driven by multiple disciplines

637
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,700
right now. I don't know, but it
seems that you know the fact

638
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,840
that LSD was invented the same
decade that the nuclear bomb was

639
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:41,620
invented, and the nuclear bomb
has changed the order of global

640
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:45,580
order, I think, is maybe a
significant, significant

641
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,540
synchronicity.

642
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:51,519
Steve Thayer: So speaking of
this time in human development,

643
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:55,359
and as somebody who has really
dedicated his academic and

644
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,059
personal life to exploring what
it means to be human, I'm

645
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:01,079
curious to know if you have an
opinion on artificial

646
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,699
intelligence. You know, some
folks who talk about the way

647
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:09,179
psychedelics are helping us
learn who we are might be

648
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:11,519
really, really important, given
that we might be creating

649
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,599
something that is different, but
also conscious. I'm curious to

650
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,739
know if you have an opinion.

651
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,520
Chris Bache: You know, I don't
really have an opinion. People,

652
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,820
it has not come up in any of my
sessions. I, you know, I

653
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:30,380
finished my sessions in 1999
artificial intelligence never

654
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,120
came up in my sessions. I stand
on the sidelines as a lay

655
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,100
person, and kind of an old lay
person. I'm 74 years old, and

656
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,740
this is really a younger
generation's work. And I watch

657
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,920
what's happening in artificial
intelligence work just from the

658
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,760
edges, and I can see that it's
developing much faster than I

659
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,020
could possibly keep track of
personally, I'm concerned about

660
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,280
it, but clearly it's here. It's
happening now. It's going to

661
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,400
have huge impact on us in the
future. I don't know what role

662
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:11,400
it will play, whether it will be
a friend or an enemy over time.

663
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,600
I'm more concerned about the
ecological cliff that we're

664
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,100
going over, because this is very
we can extrapolate, and we are

665
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:25,220
getting a clearer and clearer
vision of how the imbalances

666
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,700
that we have generated in the
industrial era are beginning to

667
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,560
manifest with catastrophic
consequences, and the cumulative

668
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,240
effect of these ecological
crises, which are going to keep

669
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,680
hitting again and again until we
get on top of this, and we're

670
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,500
not anywhere near to beginning
to get on top of it. This is

671
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:54,220
turning the 21st Century, I
think, into a tremendous century

672
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:58,240
of tremendous global instability
and global unraveling and

673
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:03,360
crisis. So that, to me, has been
kind of focal point in my

674
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,680
thinking how artificial
intelligence plays into this, I

675
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,220
don't know.

676
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,720
Reid Robison: And on the
ecological front, how much of

677
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:18,840
that realization of the problems
that we face, how much of that

678
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,980
came from these psychedelic deep
dives and or how much of it is

679
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,520
just from kind of your
experience in life, and did you

680
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,660
get any insights, any any ways
you think psychedelics or the

681
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,280
expansion of awareness or
raising consciousness might help

682
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,360
us In our in a better path
forward?

683
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,560
Chris Bache: Well, let's hold
the second part of that question

684
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,040
of how psychedelics might help
us in a better path forward, and

685
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,440
let me address the first part of
it, because this was one of the

686
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,480
biggest surprises of my of my
work. I mean, first I had to let

687
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,760
go of the framing. Of my work is
personal journey, personal

688
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,700
transformation, personal
healing, personal awakening,

689
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,100
spiritual awakening. Get
involved in a much larger dance

690
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:16,500
with the species mind, with the
collective unconscious, being

691
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,020
catapulted from there into
levels of archetypal reality and

692
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,140
then being catapulted into
deeper, causal levels of

693
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:29,600
reality. And so I say this just
to mark that I understand that

694
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,600
what I'm about to say about
human where we are and where

695
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,160
we're going historically, will
sound outrageous and they will

696
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:43,780
sound highly speculative. But
when you my experience is very

697
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,400
simply, when you work very, very
deeply, way under, far

698
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,220
underneath the personal psyche,
dropping into the collective

699
00:50:54,220 --> 00:51:02,460
psyche and into the creative
intent underlying evolution, the

700
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:08,220
evolution of our species. These
things come naturally into focus

701
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:16,560
in a way which make perfect
sense from a quantum paradigm or

702
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:25,220
a post Newtonian atomistic
materialist paradigm. So there's

703
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,080
a chapter in LSD, in the mind of
the future and the universe,

704
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,980
which is the birth of the future
human. And it's a chapter where

705
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,700
I gather together all the
experiences that took place in

706
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,280
my journey that bear on this
question, where is humanity

707
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,820
right now, and where are we
going? And it was one of the

708
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:50,020
complete surprise to me that
this came up in my sessions, and

709
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,260
this was a long this is a long
time ago, before I had any

710
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,620
ecological awareness, you know,
before I had absorbed the

711
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:01,260
information that we're all
absorbing today. These visions

712
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:08,100
took place between 1991 and 1995
so, you know, a long time ago, I

713
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,560
was completely naive about
hitting our environmental

714
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,440
limits, hitting our ecological
limits, the crisis that was

715
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,500
building in our culture. What
began to happen is tucked in

716
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,480
around the edges here and there.
I began to be given visions of

717
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:31,100
where humanity was in its
evolutionary saga. I began to be

718
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,820
given visions that we were
coming to a turning point, a

719
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,020
definitive turning point in
human history, an evolutionary

720
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,840
pivot. I began to be given
visions that we are entering a

721
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,860
magnificent period of human
history where there was just

722
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:53,440
tremendous blessings coming to
us, a period of profound

723
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:59,140
transformation, that the future
of humanity would be radically

724
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:04,560
unlike its present and its past,
and there was some fundamental

725
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:09,360
process that we were undergoing
that was taking us there. But

726
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,720
for the first three or four
years of this, I was given these

727
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,000
consistent visions of a future,
but was given no indication of

728
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,220
how we would actually get there.
How was nature going to pull

729
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:26,360
off? Because you look around us,
it doesn't look very positive.

730
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,500
Guys. I mean, you know, more
people are at the shopping mall

731
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:36,920
than they are in transformative
weekend workshops. Violence is

732
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,560
escalating. How? How are we
going to make this transition.

733
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:49,960
And then in 1995 in December of
95 when I was very far along in

734
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,740
my psychedelic work, I had
entered a stage of work that I

735
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,880
call the diamond Luminosity
material. So I was halfway

736
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:04,140
through years of work in this
very subtle, exquisitely sublime

737
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,600
diamond Luminosity work. And in
the middle of that in a rhythm,

738
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,260
when I was expecting to be taken
back into the diamond

739
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,540
Luminosity, instead, I was
dissolved into the species mind.

740
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:24,680
So and in that context, ask the
species, I went through a

741
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,880
process, or I experienced a
death and rebirth of the human

742
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,060
family. I experienced a profound
unraveling of life as we had

743
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,820
known it, a profound challenging
i

744
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,880
It's hard to describe this,
because most of our experiences,

745
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,840
we experience from within a self
referential point and and it

746
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,580
sounds ludicrous to say I
describe the death of humanity

747
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,120
as humanity, but I experience.
Is this tremendous building

748
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,580
crisis in the world and the
unraveling of people's lives and

749
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:13,320
the shattering of expectations
and the shattering of systems,

750
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,420
until eventually humanity was
reduced to the bare challenge of

751
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,580
survival. Just bare survival. It
was so deep it looked for a

752
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:26,180
while like it was going to be an
extinction event. It was a

753
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:30,620
global systems crisis, which
appeared to be driven by a

754
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:36,440
cascading series of eco crises.
I wasn't given any details

755
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,480
beyond that. I wasn't given any
timetable. I wasn't given any

756
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:47,500
sense of how this would happen.
I was just taken into this deep

757
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:52,660
cultural collective crisis, and
then just when it was at its

758
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:57,940
worst, we seemed to move through
this crisis, and when we began

759
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,740
to pick ourselves up on the
other side of this crisis. We

760
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:06,540
had been changed by this crisis.
We had been changed radically.

761
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,620
They had taken place an opening
of the human heart, an opening

762
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:15,960
of compassion, a profound change
in human we would say,

763
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:21,320
classically, in human nature. I
would describe it as a shift in

764
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,400
the fundamental structure of the
collective unconscious. What

765
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,520
we're looking at is what you
might think of it as, a shift in

766
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:34,280
the plate tectonics of the
collective psyche. When we move

767
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,360
through this crisis, as we began
to reassemble ourselves, the

768
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:44,020
entire world was saturated with
new values, new perceptions of

769
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:48,160
the good, new social
institutions. This was a huge

770
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,180
transformation of the human
heart. And then I was given many

771
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:56,260
instructions on the mechanisms,
how we would make through this,

772
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:00,900
make it through this crisis
faster than we would think

773
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,340
possible given given the space
at which history moves, and it

774
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:10,380
has to do with understanding the
function of the collective

775
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:16,140
psyche as a field. The the you
know, this is going on maybe a

776
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:20,060
little long, but the synopsis is
that the collective psyche is a

777
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:26,060
unified field, and this crisis
will be so severe, it will shove

778
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:32,240
not only individual psyches into
a non equilibrium, into an

779
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,120
highly altered state, but it
will shove the collective psyche

780
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,660
of humanity into a non
equilibrium, or far from

781
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:42,400
equilibrium condition. We have a
certain knowledge about how

782
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,820
physical systems, when they are
shoved into a non equilibrium

783
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,960
state, behave. We've learned
this from chaos theory a number

784
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,940
of different areas. There is a
sense in which I was shown that

785
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:59,440
the human psyche, when shoved
into a similar non equilibrium

786
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,900
state, will exhibit some of the
same characteristics, the

787
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,400
capacity for rapid change, the
emergence of new structures,

788
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:14,220
emerging from the floor of the
collective psyche, that small

789
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:18,840
iteration, small changes, can
produce dramatic outcomes the

790
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,180
net. The bottom line of this is
that we were going to be moving

791
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,740
through this crisis much faster
than we would think possible,

792
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:33,620
because of the severity and the
negative impact this crisis was

793
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:40,220
going to be having on lives all
Around the world subsequent

794
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:44,920
sessions in the years following,
I was given the experience

795
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,180
moving into deep time. Again,
it's moving beyond linear time,

796
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:54,640
experiencing what I call the
future human, experiencing the

797
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:06,780
archetypal form of humanity. And
I experienced this being. This

798
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,480
being is an extraordinarily
beautiful being, just a

799
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,800
magnificent being. This being
is, in some ways, as far beyond

800
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:20,960
us as we are, beyond our earlier
Homo erectus cousins, a being

801
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,240
with a massive heart, a healed
heart, an open mind. And not

802
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,540
just a transformation of our
heart and a transformation of

803
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:33,500
our mind that opens up all sorts
of possibilities, but actually a

804
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:38,060
transformation of our sensory
experience, we tend to have a

805
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,648
mechanical understanding of our
theory about how senses work,

806
00:59:43,428 --> 00:59:47,928
but I was shown. I was given the
experience that the more

807
00:59:47,928 --> 00:59:52,668
consciousness is consolidated in
our body, the more refined our

808
00:59:52,668 --> 00:59:56,928
experience, our sensory
experiences can become. So I had

809
00:59:56,928 --> 01:00:00,840
an experience at the very end of
my journey, of my vision. 100

810
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:05,100
times sharper than it is an
ordinary consciousness, and so

811
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,240
the same applies to our hearing
in all our other senses. So this

812
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:13,920
is a pivot of a radically
transformed human species, of a

813
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,040
radically opened heart,
radically open mind and a

814
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:24,620
radically augmented physical
capacity. All right, so I think

815
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,860
this is the story of our
century. This is the story of

816
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,500
the century that we're all
dealing with is, how do we make

817
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:35,480
this transition? How do we make
this pivot from our present

818
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:41,020
condition into our next
evolutionary form? And this is

819
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:45,700
what I call the birth of the
diamond soul. But I'll stop here

820
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,980
and give you a chance to ask any
questions.

821
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,980
Reid Robison: Well, one follow
up question on that last note,

822
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,940
but I definitely want to get
into the birth of the diamond

823
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:59,200
soul. But do any of as a
professor of religious studies

824
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:06,540
and just wondering if any of the
the ways certain religions or

825
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:11,220
philosophies view this line up
with what you're describing. I'm

826
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:16,080
thinking in particular of, say,
the Kali Yuga from Hinduism.

827
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,440
And, you know, 1000s of years
ago, the beginning of this dark

828
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,300
age and materialism and
corruption and the the ancient

829
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,080
sages or Rishis kind of retreat
into the the Himalayas or

830
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,320
wherever, but haven't
disappeared entirely. And then

831
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,860
kind of that, the turn of this
age into the Golden Age, or

832
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:38,420
Satya Yuga, you have the return
of wisdom, intelligence,

833
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:44,380
compassion. And I'm wondering if
any of those line up, or if you

834
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:48,280
apply any frameworks to help
understand this. From from your

835
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,060
other studies,

836
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,780
Chris Bache: in addition to the
ones you mentioned, we have a

837
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:56,920
number of Hopi prophecies. Of
course, there are a number of

838
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,320
indigenous cultures that have
been seeing this profound

839
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,260
transformation. They've been
talking about it for a long,

840
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:11,160
long time, and it's interesting,
and it does line up. I think the

841
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:16,380
general perception is that we
are, we are in a period of

842
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:21,560
darkness, but I would
conceptualize that darkness as a

843
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:27,620
period in which the conditioning
of the past, which is, you know,

844
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,100
kind of the karmic patterns
which shape the human psyche at

845
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:37,640
deep structural levels. We are
entering a period of infusion of

846
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,700
grace and infusion of energy,
which is driving, driving this

847
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,480
past to the surface of our
psyche so we can deal with it,

848
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,400
all the hatreds of history, the
divisions which we've carved in

849
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,880
the human psyche, which we've
carved on the planet, the

850
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:58,180
divisions of race, the divisions
of gender, divisions of

851
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:02,820
nationality, the divisions of
haves and have nots this all the

852
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:09,720
patterns of splitting the world
between in these categories are

853
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,440
being driven to the surface. And
they're all these toxicities are

854
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,300
coming out of us and have to
come out of us in order to make

855
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:25,820
make us available to the influx
of the divine energy which is

856
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,240
entering you can think of it as
entering us from above or coming

857
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:33,380
up within us underneath. But I
think there's something deeply

858
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:37,460
true about these ancient
prophecies, that we are, in a

859
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:42,460
sense, in the age of the Kali
Yuga, and we are coming into a

860
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:48,940
profound new age when it will
hit us, when we are how we will

861
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,780
get there, I don't know, but I
think there's a relation between

862
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,920
these prophecies.

863
01:03:54,819 --> 01:03:57,039
Steve Thayer: It is something
that feels as I hear you talk

864
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,919
about it, Chris, it's something
that does feel very true. And I,

865
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:02,339
as a psychologist, you know,
I've been very curious about the

866
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,799
human psyche, and kind of, like
the questions I asked earlier

867
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,399
about who we are, have always
been on my mind, because when I

868
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:11,819
look at the human organism, I
see a being that is capable of

869
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:16,439
so much more than we currently
tend to produce, that is a

870
01:04:16,439 --> 01:04:20,959
capable of great violence, that
is capable of fear and terrible

871
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:23,659
behaviors that are based on fear
but also capable of great

872
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:27,139
creativity and adaptation and
love and inclusion and

873
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:31,399
compassion were such a paradox
and I and as terrifying as it

874
01:04:31,399 --> 01:04:34,639
sounds, the things that you
described, this sort of maturity

875
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:38,479
process, this next stage of
development, it does sound

876
01:04:38,479 --> 01:04:42,939
necessary that we would need
some kind of crisis to I don't

877
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:46,419
know if the right word is force
or draw out this next stage of

878
01:04:46,419 --> 01:04:50,499
our development. And I look at
my own psychedelic experiences

879
01:04:50,499 --> 01:04:53,379
and those of my clients and
others that I've read about as

880
01:04:53,379 --> 01:04:57,519
almost an exercise in
existential crisis, right? It's

881
01:04:57,579 --> 01:05:01,979
almost like going through a
refiners. I are to to kind of

882
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:05,459
burn away the dross, so that the
purity of what you really are

883
01:05:05,459 --> 01:05:08,939
can come forward. But, but back
to our conversation about

884
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:12,179
integration. I think because of
how intense that can be and how

885
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:16,919
confusing it can be, it can be
really hard to make use of in

886
01:05:16,919 --> 01:05:19,259
sort of our imminent life,
right, day to day life.

887
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:24,200
Chris Bache: Yeah, it can. It
really can. What happens, I

888
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,220
think, is that once we get into
this work deeply, we suddenly

889
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,580
realize we're playing on a
different playing field than we

890
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:35,780
had thought we were playing on
before. And it's a lot, it's a

891
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:40,100
much bigger game that's afoot.
It's not about our own personal

892
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,280
life and personal
transformation, but we are

893
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:47,500
involved in historic processes
of enormous import. And so if

894
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,520
you're going to engage the deep
psyche, you're kind of going

895
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,980
into the deep end of the pool.
You're you're going into the

896
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:58,000
deep water. And the deep water
is moving very fast right now,

897
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:03,660
and there's a tremendous kind of
a bubbling taking place. And

898
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:08,580
everybody has a certain
tolerance for being able to

899
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:14,580
handle the complexity and the
intensity of what's taking place

900
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:19,140
at that very deep level. So when
we come back, we need to not

901
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:23,900
only record as carefully as we
can. What is the nature of our

902
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:28,280
visionary experience? But then
we really have to take care of

903
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,360
ourselves as we try to integrate
those experiences. I'll tell you

904
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:37,040
that it took me a year to
recover from that experience,

905
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,960
that session I told you about
the birth of the future human

906
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,980
that collapsed the death and
rebirth of humanity. It took me

907
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:48,940
about a year to really recover
from that and to sort of

908
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,680
stabilize that. And even then, I
mean, for for the years that

909
01:06:53,680 --> 01:07:01,980
I've held that vision, you
really have to practice the arts

910
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,120
of grounding. If you're going to
go deep, you better be well

911
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,440
grounded in all levels,
physically, emotionally,

912
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:16,500
psychologically and socially
with your peer groups, because

913
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:21,620
it's a demanding process that
we're involved in now, my sense

914
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:27,140
is, before my understanding of
how reincarnation works is we

915
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:31,160
get to choose the life that we
incarnate in. We are given a

916
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:35,000
certain set of options of and we
sort of see what we're going

917
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,960
into if we choose the lives that
we're going into. And that

918
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,700
means, I think, that every
person here on this planet has

919
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,440
chosen to be here in the form
that they are, and that means

920
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:53,320
that all of us have chosen to
incarnate at this very demanding

921
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,540
time in history. We want to be a
player in this demanding time in

922
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:04,740
history from a spiritual
perspective. Well, let me back

923
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,280
up. Be careful on this. I don't
want to go too far, too fast,

924
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,920
but I think we all knew what we
were getting into when we

925
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:19,320
incarnated, and we chose to be
part of this process for our

926
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:23,660
benefit, for the benefit of our
children and our grandchildren

927
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,920
all around the world, and for
the development, for the benefit

928
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:32,420
of the Divine itself. Because
the Divine is working. I mean,

929
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:35,660
this is not something humanity
is doing. This is something

930
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:39,320
nature is doing. And whatever
the intelligence is that lies

931
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,280
behind and within nature that
that's doing.

932
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,460
Steve Thayer: You know, this has
always been a question I've had

933
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:49,540
about this notion of choosing to
incarnate, and if you'd rather

934
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:52,840
not go down this path, we don't
have to Chris, but you know the

935
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:59,620
idea that somebody would choose
to incarnate as as a baby born

936
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:02,820
with fetal alcohol syndrome, or
somebody would choose to

937
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:06,960
incarnate as a kid who was born
in the last year in some war

938
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,080
torn country or a place where
there was a lot of disease and

939
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,680
conflict? Yeah, again, if you'd
rather not try to tackle that,

940
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,660
it's okay. I know there are some
things we just don't have

941
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,380
answers to. But how does, how
does a reincarnation perspective

942
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,600
grapple with those realities?

943
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,580
Chris Bache: Yeah, in just
terrible, terrible suffering,

944
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,760
babies born without brain,
without neocortex, and in

945
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:33,560
cephalic children, babies who
born into violent circumstances,

946
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:40,420
destined to die after a very
short left life with terrible

947
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:47,020
pain. How can we possibly assert
that there is intelligence, let

948
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:52,900
alone compassion behind in such
a universe? And I think in order

949
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,960
to see the wisdom and to see the
intelligence, we have to look

950
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,920
very deep. We have to look deep,
and we have to look wide. I.

951
01:10:00,064 --> 01:10:04,564
Because on the surface, life is
a mean son of a bitch, and life

952
01:10:04,564 --> 01:10:08,704
is cruel and vindictive, and
it's as filled as decimated by

953
01:10:09,244 --> 01:10:18,484
by circumstances that just crush
the human heart. From a

954
01:10:18,484 --> 01:10:24,500
reincarnation perspective, the
awareness is that life did not

955
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,040
our life did not begin with
birth, and our life does not end

956
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:35,240
at death, that our life is part
of a larger story. Why one would

957
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,680
choose? Someone would choose a
life that involves so much

958
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:45,040
suffering is a, maybe an
impossible question to answer

959
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,580
from within, inside a time,
space perspective and from

960
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:56,140
within an individual, almost
centric perspective. In order to

961
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:00,880
perhaps glimpse some of the
larger patterns of life, we

962
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,440
really have to open up into a
very large perspective, an

963
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:09,120
evolutionary perspective, a
spiritual perspective. The

964
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,780
important that I think the most
important thing to be aware or

965
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:19,380
to understand is that all of our
suffering is preserved, is

966
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:25,640
conserved and use, and it's all
of our suffering. All human

967
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,240
suffering is experienced by the
Divine. There is no divine

968
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,240
outside of human suffering
watching us suffering, doing

969
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,900
something that's making it
possible or not possible. But

970
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,380
everything that humanity
suffers, everything that the

971
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:44,740
animal kingdom suffers, the
spiritual world suffers at a

972
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,580
very deep level.

973
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:50,980
Steve Thayer: So, yeah, I mean,
if we are the as we talked about

974
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:53,980
before, the universe
experiencing itself, it's not

975
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:56,380
just the people with awesome
lives that the universe is

976
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:59,260
experiencing, right? It's every
instantiation of the universe,

977
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:02,280
every life, the ones that suffer
and the ones that don't suffer

978
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:02,820
as much.

979
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:07,680
Chris Bache: And you know, and I
address this in life cycles,

980
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:13,620
human suffering brings us to our
knees, and I don't think we have

981
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,840
an adequate understanding or
explanation of it. In my

982
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:24,140
experience, when I have been
drawn into this larger overview,

983
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,360
and when I have experienced the
intelligence behind this

984
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,920
process, I have found myself
trusting beyond what I can

985
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,060
understand, and I trust because
of the quality of the of The

986
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:43,360
being that I encounter that's
behind these circumstances. So I

987
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:48,700
can't understand all the pain
behind all this, and I can, I

988
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:52,360
have, I can come up with any
number of kind of partial and

989
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:56,140
incomplete theories for how this
stuff works or how it goes, but

990
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:00,340
in the end, I think we're
ultimately brought to our knees

991
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,500
in trying to understand it
intellectually. But if you

992
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:12,000
experience the love and wisdom
of the universe, then it gives

993
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,820
us confidence that there truly
is a logic to it. And I want to

994
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:22,640
say, I want to the universe is a
hard task master. And you know,

995
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,800
if when you look at pictures of
Kali, the destroyer, you know,

996
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,760
and she is a liberator of of
brings about enlightenment, but

997
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,480
she brings death and destruction
in one hand and enlightenment at

998
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,480
the other, these things go
together. There is nothing

999
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,100
easier gentle about the love of
the universe or the love of the

1000
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:46,900
Divine. It is a fierce, fierce
place that we are part of. It's

1001
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:52,180
a very, very demanding world.
But the question is, does the

1002
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:56,380
universe in a deeper sense, is
it paying attention to our pain?

1003
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,860
Is it? Is there a way in which,
by engaging our pain as

1004
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:06,960
conscientiously as we can, does
it lead to our own development

1005
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:13,260
in the long term? And is the
universe listening to us as we

1006
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:17,040
are in pain? And I think it is.
I think it is an intentional

1007
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,660
process, even though I can't
answer your question

1008
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,680
satisfactorily.

1009
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,599
Steve Thayer: Well, it was a
beautiful answer, and I really

1010
01:14:23,599 --> 01:14:27,319
appreciate you taking it and
trying to answer that question,

1011
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:31,399
Chris, because I certainly feel
like I'm on my knees, and I

1012
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:34,999
think I read somewhere, maybe
this was yours or someone else,

1013
01:14:34,999 --> 01:14:38,059
but that the divine, as you've
described it, as something that

1014
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:41,979
we can experience but not
necessarily comprehend. And that

1015
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:44,919
concept has actually brought me
quite a bit of peace as somebody

1016
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:47,979
who's, you know, a self
described truth seeker, really,

1017
01:14:47,979 --> 01:14:51,879
really wanting to understand
things, thinking that that would

1018
01:14:51,879 --> 01:14:55,479
give me some kind of assurance
that everything would be okay,

1019
01:14:55,479 --> 01:14:59,019
or help me understand what I
should do or shouldn't do, you

1020
01:14:59,019 --> 01:15:02,399
know, kind of at. Typical
experience of somebody who's

1021
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:06,119
looking for for the answers, so
permission to not know all the

1022
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:09,059
answers is quite comforting.
Yeah.

1023
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,720
Reid Robison: And Chris, do you
have certain people you count as

1024
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:20,600
teachers or like, your
philosophical and spiritual

1025
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:26,300
perspective and leanings. Now
I'm thinking of that question

1026
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,960
that, you know, I hope we can
get into next of, how does one

1027
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:36,320
proceed on a path of exploration
like this? Wisely? What are good

1028
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:40,960
preparatory, you know,
philosophies and spiritual

1029
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,520
frameworks and systems to to
check out or try on, perhaps,

1030
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:46,420
yeah,

1031
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:52,360
Chris Bache: well, I had the
benefit of being a professor of

1032
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:57,100
religious studies, and so I
spent a lot of My life, my

1033
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:02,940
professional life, teaching
courses in comparative

1034
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:08,400
mysticism, in Buddhism, in, you
know, introductory courses in

1035
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,840
Eastern traditions and Western
traditions. And so I got to

1036
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:17,400
study a lot of the masters and
learn their stories. And they

1037
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,260
were always my kind of guide.
Post, the great masters, the

1038
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:25,700
great spiritual beings, were
always even though my work was

1039
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,820
not focused on spiritual
awakening, we haven't talked too

1040
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,700
much about that, but still, the
great masters were my

1041
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:37,820
touchstones, and I tried to hold
myself accountable to them As I

1042
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:46,120
conducted myself in this unusual
spiritual practice. I indigenous

1043
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,660
cultures. I have tremendous
respect for I have not

1044
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:52,540
academically studied them. I
have a, you know, kind of a

1045
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:55,720
layman's reading of a number of
books, and a respect for them.

1046
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,380
And I really appreciate that
people who are undertaking this

1047
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:05,040
type of work, it's very
beneficial to do it under the

1048
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,180
tutelage of an experienced
teacher, of a guide, or someone

1049
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:13,260
who can help them process what
they're experiencing. That

1050
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:17,220
hasn't been my particular
destiny, my particular work.

1051
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:24,920
I've never had a teacher. I've
never been advised by an elder

1052
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:29,060
in a psychedelic community. In
this way, the only teacher that

1053
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:34,460
I've personally had has been the
universe itself and and she has

1054
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:40,540
been a fierce and a loyal, uh,
teacher. She's broken me down,

1055
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:46,240
ground me up, spit me out, and
beat me severely, and she's also

1056
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:49,540
helped me and blessed me and
loved me and taught me more

1057
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:55,120
things than I ever imagined were
possible when we do this type of

1058
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:59,020
work, it's foolish to do it
alone. These were my

1059
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:02,280
circumstances, and I had the
constitution to survive it. And

1060
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:07,140
I had the companionship of my
partner, who was a very wise,

1061
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:11,700
spiritual woman, who helped keep
me grounded. And I had the

1062
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:17,280
advice of the elders that I was
studying in my courses. For most

1063
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,720
people, when we do this work,
it's dude. It's good to do this

1064
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:25,160
work in groups. It's good to do
this work under the guidance of

1065
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,580
someone who has more experience
in these states than we do,

1066
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,100
because this is a new territory,
and when I say a guidance, I

1067
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:38,420
don't mind someone who's guiding
our experiences, but someone who

1068
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:42,280
can help us enter these states
safely, and someone who can help

1069
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:45,640
us understand and process the
our experiences when we come

1070
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:49,240
back out of that. And I think
it's important to have people

1071
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,120
that we can talk to. This was
one of the burdens of my

1072
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:56,500
particular journey, and that
because I was working in

1073
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:01,380
isolation, because it was all
illegal, I could not bring it to

1074
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,440
the office. I could not bring it
to campus. I could not talk to

1075
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,040
my students about it. I'm a
teacher. I love to learn and

1076
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:13,380
share, and I'm a gabber, so I
could not talk about this stuff.

1077
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:16,560
And that's not a healthy way to
be. It's good to have community

1078
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,560
that you can share your
experiences with and that you

1079
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,120
can listen to other people's
experiences, and as that

1080
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,600
experience grows, we know that
we're all in this together. We

1081
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,560
really learn from each other as
we're going deeper into this. So

1082
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:35,960
I think it's really important to
do this work in a responsible

1083
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:41,560
way, with the guidance or
tutelage of people who have more

1084
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:44,800
experience than you do, yeah.

1085
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:48,460
Reid Robison: Oh, thank you for
that. And, and I know time is

1086
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:51,700
whizzing by, as it tends to do,
but I'm just on the edge of my

1087
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,180
seat dying to know if there's
anything you could share about

1088
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:59,260
the birth of the diamond soul,
or however you put it, or that

1089
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:04,320
second part. Of the the kind of
evolution and ecology of

1090
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,820
consciousness or or where we
might focus our intentions on a

1091
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:09,900
path forward.

1092
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:15,000
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, about
halfway through my journey, in

1093
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,660
the 38th session, in a year of
great blessings, it's just

1094
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:26,240
enormous blessings I was taken
on experience that was preceded

1095
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:29,540
with some very, very intense
purification processes, very

1096
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:34,580
intense Death-Rebirth process.
And at one phase in this

1097
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:40,660
journey, I had the experience of
all my former lives coming into

1098
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:44,200
me. I mean, I had done past life
therapy before. I was familiar

1099
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:47,020
with about a dozen of my past
lives. I'd already written the

1100
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:50,020
book on reincarnation, so I was
comfortable with the idea of

1101
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:54,280
reincarnation, but I began to
experience my former lives

1102
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:59,320
coming into me. And it was like
winding a string a kite spool.

1103
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:05,340
And what happened is they seemed
to hit a critical mass, and when

1104
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:09,600
they hit a critical mass, they
fused. And there was there was

1105
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,340
an explosion of energy, and all
of these separate lives fused

1106
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:19,560
into one life. There was an
explosion of diamond light out

1107
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,460
of my chest, and I was
catapulted into a state of

1108
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:25,940
consciousness that was beyond
anything that I had realized up

1109
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:31,160
to that point in time. I was an
individual, but an individual

1110
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,180
beyond any frame of reference
that I had known before. And I

1111
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:39,620
came and then I was given a
whole lot of teachings and over

1112
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,460
and over again so that I would
understand what was happening,

1113
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:49,120
and this came to be, it changed
my whole understanding of how

1114
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:54,100
reincarnation works and where
it's taking us. The classic

1115
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:58,060
understanding of reincarnation
in Eastern cultures is that you

1116
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:01,740
know you incarnate, you make
some proof. You self challenge,

1117
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,760
you make mistakes, you make
progress, but basically you get

1118
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,580
better and better, stronger and
stronger, more compassionate

1119
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:12,180
over time, until eventually you
reach some type of spiritual

1120
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:16,020
realization, some awakening
experience, enlightenment

1121
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:19,680
experience. And once you reach
that, then you're free to leave

1122
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:23,180
the system of space time. So
it's an up and out cosmology.

1123
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:27,080
And all the religions of the
Axial Age of last 5000 years,

1124
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,960
they're all up and out
cosmologies. So you achieve

1125
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,400
salvation, and then or you
achieve enlightenment, and then

1126
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:40,120
the fruition comes in an off
planet, spiritual paradise. My

1127
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:44,020
experience in my sessions, the
teaching I received in my

1128
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:47,320
sessions is that that is not an
adequate description of what's

1129
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:51,820
happening. That's a first stage
approximation that humanity made

1130
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,360
when they began to have
sufficient depth of experiences

1131
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,840
that they began to have contact
with spiritual reality. They

1132
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,520
began to understand
reincarnation, but it's stopping

1133
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:08,640
halfway. I think the what I was
shown in in my experiences, was

1134
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:14,640
that humanity is not simply
evolving one lifetime after a

1135
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:18,720
lifetime after lifetime, making
small, incremental improvements

1136
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:24,080
in our quality of the souls
existence sooner or later. I

1137
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,980
mean, we, sooner or later, all
of our lives, come together

1138
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:32,900
inside our physical existence.
Now we die, we expand into the

1139
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,820
soul. We incarnate into our
narrow, egoic experience. We

1140
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:41,320
die, incarnate into the soul. We
incarnate in an individual

1141
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:45,400
lifetime. We know the soul in
between our lifetimes. But if we

1142
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:50,920
keep this incarnational rhythm
up long enough, and I have my

1143
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,820
students sometimes do this as an
exercise for 15 minutes, we're

1144
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:58,420
doing this each lifetime,
expanding out sooner or later,

1145
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:04,860
the soul wakes up inside our
physical existence, and this is

1146
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:09,600
what I call the birth of the
diamond soul. When the soul

1147
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,140
wakes up inside our physical
existence, not only is there a

1148
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:18,060
tremendous expansion of our
heart and mind, but it changes

1149
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:23,180
our entire orientation. It it.
We focus on the long term

1150
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:28,520
vision, the long term good, the
wide good. Because we have, in a

1151
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:33,260
sense, an intuitive awareness of
all the hundreds of people,

1152
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:36,020
1000s of people we've been in
relationship with through

1153
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:40,840
history. We have been every
race. We've been every religion

1154
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:45,940
through time, we've been up and
down the economic ladder. We've

1155
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:50,560
had all the roles in history
possible that when all those

1156
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:55,480
lives come together and wake up
into a singular consciousness,

1157
01:24:55,780 --> 01:25:00,480
it radically changes one's
perceptive perception of. What's

1158
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:06,900
taking place, who we are, and
where we're going. I think this

1159
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,320
when people ask, what form will
the future human take? And we're

1160
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,440
exploring this with all sorts of
science fiction, you know, what

1161
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,740
the form of the future human
will be, but I think it's really

1162
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:20,720
much more simple than that. We
have been developing and

1163
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:24,080
gestating the future human for
hundreds of 1000s of years

1164
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,940
reincarnation, we've been
gestating the future human

1165
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,420
through reincarnation for
hundreds of 1000s of years.

1166
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:39,080
Gestation is long, labor is
short and intense. I think we

1167
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:43,060
are entering a period of history
of labor, and I think we are

1168
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:48,160
desperately trying to grow into
the largest, deepest, richest

1169
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:52,000
version of ourselves, and that
is the diamond soul. I think the

1170
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,200
diamond soul is being born in
history. The diamond soul is the

1171
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:00,540
form that the future human would
take and imagine if the entire

1172
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:04,800
species went through this
process, not just a few Christ

1173
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,160
and the Buddha and Muhammad and
a few saints privileged here and

1174
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:11,340
there, but if the entire species
went through this transition

1175
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:15,420
that they awakened spiritually
to this deeper identity that's

1176
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:20,540
been gestating inside of them
all these years, what an

1177
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:25,880
extraordinary species that would
be, and what would that species,

1178
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:30,800
what an extraordinary history
that species would create. I

1179
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,860
think we've reached a point in
history where we simply cannot

1180
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:39,020
run this planet out of egoic
consciousness. We either grow up

1181
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,500
or we go extinct. And extinction
is a tremendous evolutionary

1182
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:50,260
accelerator. So I think we are,
personally, I think this crisis

1183
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:54,160
evolving this century is going
to take us to our edge. But my

1184
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:59,380
experience is that we do make it
through this crisis. I've, I've

1185
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:05,340
experienced the future human as
a task to be actualized and also

1186
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:09,600
an accomplishment that has
already been realized. So from

1187
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,860
my personal perspective, I
deeply believe that we will make

1188
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:16,500
it through this crisis. We will
make it through the

1189
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:22,280
developmental challenges, and
when we do and we're looking

1190
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:28,040
back over human history and our
individual soul history, we will

1191
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:32,300
recognize that everything, all
the pain we suffered, all the

1192
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:36,440
hardship that we went through to
get to this place, it's been

1193
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:40,360
worth it. It's been worth it.
We're giving birth to a new

1194
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:44,500
child in history, and it will be
worth it,

1195
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,220
Steve Thayer: Chris, I am
finding myself feeling very

1196
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:51,160
grateful to you for your life's
work, for your willingness to

1197
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:54,940
share it. I'm glad that you
decided to come forward and

1198
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:59,200
share with you know, all of us,
not just your students, that you

1199
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,520
had to you know, do so almost
covertly, just by living the

1200
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,340
difference, but also now through
your written work, through

1201
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:08,760
coming on podcasts like ours, it
means a lot to me personally,

1202
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,640
and I'm just so grateful for
your willingness to come on our

1203
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,000
show.

1204
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,080
Chris Bache: It's an honor to
have this discussion with you,

1205
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:20,900
gentlemen, and it's an honor to
share these ideas and this

1206
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,960
teaching with your audience, it
truly is

1207
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:29,600
Reid Robison: Thank you, Chris,
this has been such a delightful

1208
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,860
honor and pleasure, so we'll
cherish this conversation. Thank

1209
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,740
you for your generosity in
sharing with us.

1210
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:40,040
Chris Bache: Thank you for your
work, gentlemen, thank you for

1211
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,280
the healing you bring into the
world and the insight you're

1212
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,300
bringing into the world.

1213
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:46,180
Steve Thayer: And Chris is there
anywhere in particular you'd

1214
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:49,780
like to point people a website,
any of your current work? Where

1215
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:51,100
can they find out more about
you?

1216
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:56,020
Chris Bache: They can contact me
through my website. Chris

1217
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:59,920
bache.com it's a website in need
of an overhaul, but it's there,

1218
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:05,220
and I have posted, you know,
things I've written there and

1219
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,780
but, you know, I'm all over
YouTube. Various podcasts and

1220
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:15,480
talks I've given are on YouTube.
They can find if there, if the

1221
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:18,780
articles, the things that I've
written are not on my website,

1222
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:23,660
they'll be on academia.edu,
under my name there, all my

1223
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:27,320
articles are published there, so
all the most important things

1224
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:31,160
that I've written are available
and they can reach me on my

1225
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:35,300
website. I'm not doing any
structured teaching at present.

1226
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:40,120
I may be doing some retreats in
the near future, but those are

1227
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:44,500
still in the planning stages
right now. I'm just doing some

1228
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:50,020
talks here and there at
conferences, maybe some retreats

1229
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:53,920
being coordinated by some of the
people I've been working with

1230
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:00,300
individually. But basically I'm
just following the work. Gotten

1231
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:05,100
into the world. I really don't
have, I really don't have an

1232
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:10,020
agenda. Right now, I'm
responding to where the book

1233
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:13,320
takes me. People read the book,
they get interested like you,

1234
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,780
and I'm just following it out.

1235
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:18,180
Steve Thayer: Well, Chris Bache
retreat sounds awesome. I'll put

1236
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:21,440
it on my bucket list tonight.
I'll be looking for it and

1237
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,500
willing to your website and
places where people can find

1238
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,620

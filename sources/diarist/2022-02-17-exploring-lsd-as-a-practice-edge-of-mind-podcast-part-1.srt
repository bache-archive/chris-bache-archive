00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Andrew Holecek: Everybody.
Andrew holochick here, and I

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,440
simply cannot contain my
excitement about my guest for

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,280
today. Dr Christopher Bache. And
so with a brief introduction,

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,940
we're going to launch into what
I believe will be quite a

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,840
revelatory, I hope, provocative
conversation. So Chris PhD is

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,540
professor emeritus in the
Department of Philosophy and

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,800
Religious Studies at Youngstown,
Youngstown State University,

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,240
where he taught for 33 years. He
is also adjunct faculty at the

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,240
California Institute of Medical
studies, Emeritus fellow at the

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,280
Institute of Noetic Sciences and
on the advisory board of Grof

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,420
legacy training. Chris's passion
has been the study of the

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,120
philosophical implications of
Non-ordinary states of

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,440
consciousness, especially
psychedelic states. An award

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,660
winning teacher and
international speaker, Chris has

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,860
written four books, life cycles,
a study of reincarnation in

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,360
light of contemporary
consciousness research, dark

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,960
night, early dawn, a pioneering
work in psychedelic philosophy

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,320
and collective consciousness,
the living classroom and

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,200
exploration of collective fields
of consciousness and teaching

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,280
and LSD and the mind of the
universe, the story of his 20

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,380
year journey with LSD. Chris is
a father of three. About You,

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,340
ianna practitioner, and lives in
Weaverville, North Carolina with

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,800
his wife, Christina Hardy, oh my
gosh, Chris, where do we start?

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,280
Right? First of all, thank you,
my dear friend, for for taking

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,160
time out of your busy schedule
to talk with us. It's a

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,860
pleasure. Really. I've been
looking forward to this one for

27
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,620
a while, and so oh my gosh. Just
some preparatory comments before

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:51,880
we launch in. I have read a fair
amount over my years. I consider

29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,660
myself a bit of a an academic. I
love to read. I love to devour

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,280
books, and I have to say, I have
never read anything like your

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,400
last book, LSD and the mind of
the universe, and so out of all

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,220
the books that you've written,
this is the one I really want to

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,540
focus on, because it's no
exaggeration to say that it

34
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,720
really stretched my mind open,
challenged me. And maybe we can

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,960
talk about some of the areas
where I was challenged created

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,960
both tremendous resonance with
my own path and also some

37
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,620
dissonance. And so that's a
great way to make modern music,

38
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,400
right? So maybe, maybe we can
create a symphony of sanity with

39
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,900
with some questions to you, of
which there is no shortage, but

40
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,740
one kind of preparatory comment,
there's a term by the Eco

41
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,240
philosopher Timothy Morton that
I really quite like. He talks

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,440
about hyper objects, and he
refers to this in relationship

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,860
to climate change. When you have
something that is just so

44
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,300
enormous that is really
difficult to wrap your mind

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,540
around it, it just defies
description. It's literally mind

46
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,860
bending, mind stretching, and
then maybe even mind blowing,

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,480
and it's no exaggeration that
your book and your journey is a

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,760
hyper object to me, and I can't
tell you how it's impacted me

49
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,420
and how I want to really get
into some of the nitty gritty of

50
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,284
what you went through. But in
order to give our listeners even

51
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,184
a rough idea of what we're going
to be talking about, perhaps

52
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:29,504
give us a long elevator pitch.
Okay, so this is we have 1000

53
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:34,544
floors to a sand, right? So this
is a long elevator pitch. Share

54
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:40,184
with us, if you would, a little
bit about this book before we

55
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:44,080
get into the weeds, and I start
exploring particular topics with

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,320
you, yeah,

57
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,880
Chris Bache: well, I know it's a
radical book, and I think we are

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,120
at a pivot point in history, and
I think that psychedelics

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,360
represent a major transition
point, a true historical before

60
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,540
And after point with respect to
philosophy, not just psychology.

61
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,800
It generates not only a new
therapeutic protocol for healing

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,760
the personal psyche, but
literally, a new way of doing

63
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,820
philosophy. It's not really new,
because it goes back to the

64
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,440
elysinian mysteries and the
Ayahuasca traditions in Brazil,

65
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,200
but I got involved in it right
out of graduate school. I had

66
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,220
just finished my PhD from Brown
University. I went to work in

67
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,720
Ohio, at Youngstown State. I was
looking around for where to

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
begin, where to continue my
research. I was a pretty deeply

69
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,420
convinced agnostic at the time,
and I encountered realms of the

70
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,420
human unconscious. Stan Grof
first book, and that was a

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,820
turning point in my life,
quickly followed by his

72
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,360
methodology book, LSD,
psychotherapy. This was 1978

73
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,460
when I began graduate school,
and I saw the significance of

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,020
his work for philosophy, for my
tradition. Tradition, which was

75
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,020
philosophy of religion. And I I
knew that I needed to do this

76
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,620
work, that this would the people
making the most substantive

77
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,340
contributions to my discipline
in the future would be people

78
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,580
writing out of an experiential
basis, not simply an

79
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:25,040
intellectual basis. So I began
to work privately. I split my

80
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,620
life into two. On my day job, I
was a traditional academic, you

81
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,940
know, teaching courses, grading
papers, going to meetings and

82
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,900
all that. And in my private
life, I began a 20 year journey

83
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,580
working following Stan Grof
protocol. I ended up working

84
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,840
with high doses of LSD for
reasons I described in the book.

85
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,740
This is a very aggressive
protocol. It's not a protocol

86
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,280
that I would recommend today at
the end of the journey, but I

87
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,060
basically did 73 high dose LSD
sessions, let me say that each

88
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,840
session was completely isolated.
I was separated from the world.

89
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,100
I was in what I call the
psychedelic Kiva, a very

90
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,840
protected environment separate
from the world, lying down with

91
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,540
the sitter. My sitter was a
clinical psychologist who also

92
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,220
happened to be my wife, through
all of my sessions, wearing eye

93
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,240
shades and with headphones,
listening to very carefully

94
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,020
selected music to support the
deepening of the process. So

95
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,980
that's where I began. I worked
for four years. I stopped for

96
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,600
six years again for reasons that
I give in the book, and then I

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,040
resume for another 10 years, and
the method, the psychedelic

98
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,820
method, as a philosophical
method, involves systematically

99
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,780
expanding the boundaries of
one's consciousness. And let me

100
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,460
say that we understand that
psychedelics in general and LSD

101
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,100
in particular, represent is an
amplifier of consciousness. It

102
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,820
doesn't give you any specific
experiences. It amplifies your

103
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,640
consciousness. Makes you
hypersensitive for a number of

104
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,620
hours at a time. How you use
that hypersensitivity very much

105
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,580
influences what emerges over a
long period of time. If you go

106
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,480
to a concert or you just sit
down chat with friends, you're

107
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,900
going to have a certain level of
experience. But if you approach

108
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,280
these hours in a contemplative
manner, if you approach them as

109
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,680
an opportunity to go deep within
your consciousness, totally

110
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,340
internalized, isolating yourself
from the world, a journey

111
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,040
begins. It's a journey that has
many levels, because as we

112
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,200
confront all the things that a
hyper sensitive mind throws up

113
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,140
to us to confront, and it
usually starts with all the

114
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,140
fears, all the things we're
ashamed of, all the things we're

115
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,600
unhappy about, those are the
early confrontations that lead

116
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,600
to the healing process. But if
you keep that up, it keeps going

117
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,060
deeper and deeper and deeper. If
you navigate this, this journey

118
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,040
carefully, I always recorded my
sessions within 24 hours, and

119
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,820
that's really important, because
the more careful you are in

120
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,400
recording your session and
pondering them, the clearer, the

121
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,520
deeper your next session is
likely to be. So there's a

122
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,060
circle of learning that's
involved. So for 20 years, I

123
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,980
kept up this systematic
practice, and then I waited. I

124
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:40,960
stopped it. I went from 79 to 99
and then I didn't write LSD in

125
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,620
the universe, I didn't publish
it until 20 years later. In 2019

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,440
I spent many years analyzing my
experiences, pondering them,

127
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,680
trying to sort them out, before
I was ready to really publicly

128
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,500
release this hidden side of my
life. My students never learned

129
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,220
about my psychedelic work. I
kept a firewall between my

130
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,880
public life and my private life
in this regard, and it's only

131
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,420
after I retired from the
university that I've really been

132
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,860
willing to go public on this
side of my life. Amazing.

133
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,780
Andrew Holecek: Even there,
there's so much to talk about.

134
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Let me just if I might ping one
question for you. Just briefly,

135
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,320
I am a musician. My first degree
is actually in classical piano,

136
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,200
and so just briefly, why? Why
music? What was the role of

137
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,580
music and how did it help you?
How did you choose it? I don't

138
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,140
want to spend a ton of time on
this. Yeah, but, I am

139
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,440
interested, where did that
inspiration come from, and how

140
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,020
did, how did it end up
supporting your journey? There's

141
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,740
early

142
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,000
Chris Bache: research done on
how music influences psychedelic

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,080
sessions. I have references to
that, to the those sources in my

144
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,800
work based. Basically it creates
a field and an ambiance that

145
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,900
supports you, letting go of your
current physical reality,

146
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,700
relaxing and yielding to this up
rushing of material that comes

147
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,660
from the unconscious. There are
about five stages in a

148
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,400
psychedelic session as the
energy is building, as it's

149
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,580
peaking, and as you're coming
down, it's hours, you know, it's

150
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,160
eight hours of the day, and you
have to choose music to support

151
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,820
each stage of that process. So
the music would be very

152
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,740
aggressive and very long,
chordal sequences with powerful

153
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,880
crescendos in the early stages,
long, expansive passages in the

154
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,660
middle stages, gradually
tapering off into quieter and

155
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,220
quieter and judgment music at
the end. After of after only a

156
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,360
year or so, I basically stopped
using classical music, which is

157
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,200
more commonly used. I shifted to
using a lot of indigenous music

158
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,700
because I found it to be more
powerfully evocative. It helped

159
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,560
me go into let go of my
conventional reality and enter

160
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,720
into unusual reality.

161
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,640
Andrew Holecek: Well, that's
really interesting, Chris,

162
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,100
because in the inner yogas of
tantric Buddhism, which I know

163
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,640
you're a student of the
Vajrayana. Yeah, as you know,

164
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,580
the subtle body is actually the
kind of frequency or the domain

165
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,460
that is literally quite in
resonance with sound. And so

166
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,060
when we're actually touched by
music, it's really our subtle

167
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,780
body that is touched. And this
is really interesting to me,

168
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,980
because when you talk about this
journey, which in one way, and

169
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,800
I'll be curious to see if this
resonates with you, I really

170
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,160
appreciated your frequent
allusions to the work of Carl

171
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,960
Jung, and I don't remember you
saying this overtly, but the

172
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,380
process of individuation, how it
is that bringing the unconscious

173
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,860
processes into the light of
conscious awareness is what, in

174
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,100
fact, constitutes one vector of
awakening. And so the reason

175
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,300
this is interesting to me is
that the subtle body is also

176
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,360
connected to the unconscious
mind, and so in a certain way.

177
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,260
And let me see if this is
landing with you. When you're

178
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,780
working with this type of music,
it's almost as if you're

179
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,420
creating a tuning for
Invitational harmonic in

180
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,420
external auditory mechanisms or
mediums that therefore could

181
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,780
perhaps evoke correlative inner
qualities that help you, in

182
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,360
fact, bring these processes into
the Light of Consciousness. Is

183
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,800
it fair to say something like
that?

184
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,800
Chris Bache: I think that's
fair. And, you know, basically,

185
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,620
I think that's a good
description. The subtle body is

186
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,720
very actively involved in the
psychedelic process when you

187
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,920
open up into deeper states of
consciousness, I learned that

188
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,420
deeper states of consciousness
are higher levels of energy, and

189
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,620
so it places enormous demands on
your physical body, but

190
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,620
particularly their subtle energy
body. And so it's very the

191
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,460
subtle energy body is very much
involved. It's a very you're

192
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,420
moving into highly stimulated
states, which are not simply

193
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,080
psychologically stimulating, but
they're energetically subtle,

194
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,800
energetically stimulating and
physically stimulating. Yeah,

195
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,580
that really

196
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,739
Andrew Holecek: makes so much
sense to me. But I want to put

197
00:13:19,739 --> 00:13:23,899
an exclamation point, and return
to something that you intimated

198
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,799
that you also ping on later in
your book, connected to this

199
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,899
kind of amplification, using
these agents as means to

200
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,379
heighten awareness and
amplifying the mind. And what

201
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:38,419
you said at the end really
struck me, because, in fact, I

202
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:42,639
was a student of chugya Trungpa
Rinpoche, a statement that I

203
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,779
always took from him to be
pejorative negative, that LSD is

204
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,559
super Samsara. I originally
heard that as a negative, your

205
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,099
twist on it was fantastically
alchemical or tantric, because

206
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,459
now you put a positive spin on
it, that in a very beautiful

207
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:03,059
way, the super Samsara gives you
the opportunity to bring these

208
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:06,419
unconscious processes into the
light of awareness. And

209
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,179
therefore, I think the word you
use is confront, even

210
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,899
confrontation, the word you
could say inner jihad, right to

211
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,519
wrestle with these inner
dimensions as a way, again, in

212
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,399
the alchemical or tantric
spirit, to transform these super

213
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,179
Samsara into nirvana through
proper relationship. Is that? Is

214
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:28,879
that one way to talk about what
you experienced as well?

215
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,740
Chris Bache: It is I want to, I
want to tag two items there. The

216
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:40,240
first one, again, it all depends
on how you meet this super

217
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,140
Samsara. Samsara is very
addictive. It's very

218
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:50,320
distracting, it's very alluring.
And if you increase the your

219
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,060
sensitivity to Samsara, it can
take you on a journey that just

220
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,380
will just distract you and lead
you, and it really doesn't take

221
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,060
you anywhere. Accept through
into more Samsara. But if you

222
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,900
use this opportunity in a true
contemplative fashion to look

223
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,580
deeply at the Samsara that's
there, then you you find that

224
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,700
you the Samsara will fall apart.
You, when really take the

225
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,880
samsaric tendencies to their
roots, and when you take them to

226
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,200
their roots, they become
uprooted, and you begin to move

227
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,740
into deeper levels, deeper
levels of Samsara, but then

228
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,820
eventually into the levels that
go beyond Samsara, into extra

229
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,680
Samsara levels of reality, into
the Bardo, but then eventually

230
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,000
into extra Samsara levels of
reality. Now I want to the

231
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,060
second point I want to mention
is people use psychedelics for

232
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,480
many different purposes, some
for recreation, some to hyper

233
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,300
stimulate creativity. But three
basic purposes are therapeutic

234
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,180
healing, which is the dominant
way that people are using

235
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,420
psychedelics today in the
psychedelic Renaissance, to heal

236
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,580
the wounds of life, of the
personal psyche, second for

237
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,980
spiritual realization to
accelerate one's awakening, to

238
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,360
accelerate the one's awareness
of Nirvana, or entering into the

239
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,800
condition of nirvana. And this
is why I had started. This is

240
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,260
what got me started, like many
people in the late 70s, into the

241
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,980
psychedelic work, but
eventually, very quickly,

242
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,280
really, that agenda fell away in
my practice, partly because of

243
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,620
the very powerful protocol that
I adopted. Personal

244
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,840
enlightenment fell away as not a
significant part of my journey,

245
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,440
it came back around in the end,
and it was always there, but it

246
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,600
wasn't the primary modality,
collective awakening became very

247
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
important that is working on
behalf of the human family. The

248
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,060
Bodhisattva vow, in a sense,
came through very strongly. But

249
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,240
eventually my work settled into
a third agenda, which I would

250
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,260
call cosmological exploration.
The what my work became was a

251
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:16,020
long journey into what I think
of as the consciousness of the

252
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,840
universe, or the consciousness
of the creative intelligence

253
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,400
that's behind the universe and
within the universe, and you

254
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,920
don't need to explore all those
deep pathways in order to awaken

255
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,520
spiritually. You don't need to
go into archetype of reality.

256
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,940
You don't need to go back to the
birth of the universe in order

257
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,360
to awaken to the truth of your
essential nature, as the

258
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,800
Buddhist would say, or to your
Christ consciousness, as the

259
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,640
Christians would say. And so I
wanted to differentiate

260
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,500
cosmological exploration from
the project of spiritual

261
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,060
awakening, because if we hold
cosmological exploration to the

262
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,040
measures or criteria of success
of spiritual awakening, I think

263
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,380
we're going to miss the mark of
what's actually taking place in

264
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,980
the journey.

265
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,140
Andrew Holecek: Oh my gosh,
Chris boy, you're going to the

266
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,760
deep end of the pool. Yeah. Wow.
So let's unpack this, because I

267
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,040
think this is really
interesting. This is super

268
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,980
important, in my opinion,
because it begs a number of

269
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,420
questions. One, is the
relationship between, excuse me,

270
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,360
the individual and the
collective, the individual and

271
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,400
the cosmos. And therefore, deep,
as a scholar of religion and

272
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,800
philosophy, deep questions about
the nature of mind and reality

273
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,760
that I guess, to paraphrase it,
there's so many ways to get into

274
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,680
this, but 111, question that
comes to mind is, is it, in

275
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,320
fact, the mind that's in the
universe or the universe that's

276
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,620
in the mind? In other words,
what exactly is the relationship

277
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,300
between the individual and the
cosmic? And is, in fact, part of

278
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,320
what I hear is a dissonance,
potential. Dissonance, for me,

279
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,500
is a, is a subtle cosmological
dualism that there therefore

280
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,940
seems to intimate a difference
between the individual and the

281
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,300
cosmic, that there's still some
sense of separation implied

282
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,780
there. So maybe help me
understand that tease that apart

283
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,020
for me, because if I noticed in
one of your footnotes, you talk

284
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,400
that if you were to pin yourself
into a corner philosophically,

285
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,940
you would, you would define
yourself as a monist. And so how

286
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,180
does monism play into this if,
in fact, you're intimating a

287
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,200
subtle dualism?

288
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,240
Chris Bache: It's only a
functional dualism which all

289
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,140
monist traditions recognize. Fun
at Quora. I'm a monist at heart.

290
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,980
And this comes this not a
philosophical position, it's an

291
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,540
experiential position.

292
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,520
The deeper one goes into one's
own consciousness eventually

293
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,320
come to that point where, where
let. Let me, let me back up and

294
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,820
start again. Contemporary
thought, scientific thought,

295
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,020
tends to see the physical world
as the only world that exists.

296
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,200
And they tend to see the
physical world as operating by

297
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,000
mechanistic processes, that
there is not consciousness in

298
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,420
atomic in chemical processes,
and that consciousness somehow

299
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,780
pops into existence at some
point in the evolutionary

300
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,980
process. Now there are lots of
philosophical reasons for

301
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,120
challenging the adequacy of that
understanding of consciousness,

302
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,860
and I align with those
philosophers who are

303
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,780
panpsychists who believe that
consciousness, or the what you

304
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,320
might think of as or
consciousness, a core origin,

305
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,960
consciousness is present in
physical reality or energetic

306
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,520
reality from the very start, and
that conscious consciousness

307
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,080
isn't added later, but
consciousness is part of the

308
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,240
emerging universe from the Big
Bang forward. So that just mark

309
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,480
that okay experientially, when
one, when one shatters one's

310
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,040
personal mind, when when one
reaches the limits where your

311
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,980
personal history can no longer
contain what's happening in your

312
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,360
mind. And when you've excavated
through the various levels of

313
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,340
your personal unconscious, one
drops into a larger field of

314
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,120
consciousness. Part of that one
of the part of the field you

315
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,260
drop into is the field of your
species mind. And here's the

316
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,880
common ground with Carl Jung the
collective psyche. But if you

317
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,360
keep working and dropping and
dropping and dropping you deep,

318
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,480
it drop into deeper and deeper,
larger and larger levels of

319
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,340
consciousness until eventually
you're in very familiar, very

320
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,540
territory that's very familiar
to the mystics. When they are

321
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,600
talking about God consciousness
are talking about all as one.

322
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,220
The experience over and over
again, is that the entire

323
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,400
universe, both its physical
manifestation and it's the mind

324
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,900
that underlies this
manifestation is fundamentally a

325
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,600
single organism, and that all
life takes place within this

326
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,220
single singularity, and all life
is a manifestation of an

327
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:35,420
emergence of this singularity in
diversity. And when we first

328
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,620
began to discover this
underlying reality, what I would

329
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,700
call the mother universe that
underlies the daughter universe

330
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,180
of the physical world during the
Axial Age, you know, about three

331
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,580
to 5000 years ago, it was so
what we encountered, where we

332
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,840
began to get, have the the
meditation techniques, or the

333
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,160
psychedelic techniques in the
early Hindu Soma, to Drop into

334
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,080
this reality. It was so
intoxicating and so ecstasy

335
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,880
filled, that we developed an
interpretation of life that said

336
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,020
that the purpose, the purpose of
life was to get back to that,

337
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,960
that there is nothing worth
holding on to in physical

338
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,440
reality. There is nothing worth
holding on to in individuality,

339
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,980
what you really want to do is
take the drop and put it back

340
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,200
into the ocean. You want to
dissolve ego and end up in back

341
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,860
into the oneness. And I
understand that, but I think

342
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,480
it's a fundamentally flawed
cosmology. Now that we're

343
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,040
beginning to understand how old
the universe, how big it is, how

344
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,480
intelligent it is, how how long
it's been working to bring

345
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:54,040
forward the more evolved forms
of life that it has to think

346
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,200
that after 13 point 7 billion
years of evolution, when just a

347
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,480
Few 1000 years ago, we've become
self conscious enough to be able

348
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,320
to penetrate our individual
consciousness and discover this

349
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,980
underlying cosmic, cosmic
consciousness, which holds the

350
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,780
entire universe, just when we
discover that, then we want to

351
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,140
dissolve and disappear out of
existence altogether, home.

352
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,640
Makes no sense. I don't think
that's and what I've learned, or

353
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,840
what I've been taught in my
sessions, is that the universe

354
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,720
wants to support individuality,
not the prism, not not the

355
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,860
individuality that's imprisoned
within solitary, egoic

356
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,380
awareness, but a robust
individuality of what we might

357
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,780
call the soul, which is open and
porous and in constant exchange

358
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,880
with the larger rhythms of life.
This is the both and position

359
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,020
that when one awaken
spiritually, one literally

360
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,300
becomes more. More of an
individual than you were before

361
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,680
you awakened, you know. So
there's a, so there is a, I

362
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,880
think that when we go deep, we
not only discover the oneness,

363
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,380
and we discover that that
oneness is the essence of our

364
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,780
individual being. Classic Atman
is Brahman. The essence of the

365
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,400
individual is the essence of the
totality. But now we discover

366
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:33,140
that Brahman delights in
manifesting Atman and in growing

367
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,200
Atman, and in Atman waking up to
its own true nature, and then

368
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,380
that waking up is just a stage
in a larger evolutionary process

369
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,960
of empowerment so that we
literally learn to become more

370
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,660
and more and more of a conscious
synthesis of individuality and

371
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,120
spiritual totality.

372
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,080
Andrew Holecek: Oh, Chris, oh my
gosh. I can hardly contain

373
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,620
myself here. What I mean? Talk
about diamonds from heaven. I

374
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,260
mean, this is your journey.
You're not Johnny Appleseed.

375
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,640
You're You're Johnny diamond.
See, your life is throwing

376
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,440
diamonds. But let me just maybe
this is an issue of semantics

377
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,080
and the nuance of talking. Yeah,
what a challenge when you start

378
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,580
talking about Non-duality,
nature of mind and reality using

379
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,780
dualistic mechanisms, you're
headed into trouble. So but help

380
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:36,740
me understand a couple things
when, when you talk about the

381
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,240
universe, wants to support and
there are other intimations in

382
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,900
your in your book, that I found
really compelling, how it is

383
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,780
that you felt from day one, that
there was a larger intelligence

384
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,380
that was guiding your journey,
that you felt held by the

385
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,280
beloved. And remind me to come
back to this, because I want to

386
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,180
share a personal story about my
own retreat time where this,

387
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,240
this came into real dissonance
with me as a practicing

388
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,560
Buddhist, because, as you know,
on the Buddhist tradition, their

389
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:13,140
biggest, one of the biggest
teachings, is on emptiness, non

390
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,980
theism and that sort of thing.
And so I'm wrestling a little

391
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,360
bit with reconciling things like
non theism and emptiness with

392
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,140
what you're talking about. So to
be a little more articulate

393
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,500
about this, let's be point a
little bit more paint point

394
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,000
blank. From my end, how do you
reconcile man theism, with this

395
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
notion of Universal
Intelligence, which almost seems

396
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,780
to intimate a creator principle,
a God, if we dare say, because

397
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,600
you almost seem to be implying
that there is a divine trans

398
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,460
human intelligence, God,
whatever term you want to pen to

399
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,700
it, that somehow is, in fact,
your beloved that is holding

400
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,920
you, guiding you and nurturing
you. How do you reconcile that

401
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,900
with the teachings on emptiness
and non theism?

402
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,160
Chris Bache: Yeah, it's really
not difficult when you when you

403
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,460
move into it. So let's focus on
the Buddhist teaching of anata,

404
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,560
no self, emptiness of self.
Shunyata trans, which can also

405
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:19,800
be trans, translated
transparency. I think I really

406
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,200
endorse the Buddhist position of
its radical agnosticism. I think

407
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,580
it's an anti theism. So
basically, it's a critique that

408
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,380
says every theism which is being
proposed or has been proposed

409
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,240
has structural flaws to it that
it so the concept of God, the

410
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:49,780
concept of theism is critiqued
as being inadequate, and in its

411
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,940
place, Buddhism proposes a pure
process understanding of

412
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,580
reality, that everything is
dynamic, everything is

413
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,780
constantly changing. Everything
is fluid. Everything is in

414
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,040
process. There is no thing which
holds its existence by itself.

415
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:11,100
You only exist in the interplay
of the whole ocean of causality,

416
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,620
of karmic forces, cosmic, down
to species, down to individual.

417
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,560
It's all an open system. And
when you when you wake up to

418
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,220
your essential nature, you
don't. You don't wake up to a

419
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,720
separate thing. You wake up to a
fluid process, and you breathe.

420
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,340
Now, the fluid process of
existence, I take that to heart,

421
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:41,200
and that resonates with my
experience, in that every I

422
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,460
experienced myself as constantly
being guided and instructed and

423
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,780
tutored in my psychedelic
sessions. But the nature of that

424
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,760
consciousness that held me and
broke me down and and opened me

425
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,060
and then broke me down some
more, the nature of that

426
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,920
consciousness never revealed
itself. As a being, as a person,

427
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,200
as a personality, and the very
structure of what it was that I

428
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,560
was engaging kept expanding and
changing. Now in psychedelic

429
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,180
states, you don't learn, or you
learn by becoming what it is

430
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,980
that you're trying to learn
about. You don't take the ego

431
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,580
there and have an experience of
something. You literally shatter

432
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,760
and you dissolve and become
this. So my experience was that

433
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,660
when I began to become aware of
this, this other that was

434
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:40,900
holding me and guiding me, and I
began to ask it, who are you?

435
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,060
What are you? I experienced a
death which then dissolved me

436
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:51,400
into a deeper level of reality
where I discovered that I was

437
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,900
this was myself. It was a deeper
level of quote, myself, not my

438
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,900
personal self, capital M. And
this repeated itself over and

439
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,560
over and over for hours on this
one particular session, until

440
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,280
eventually it brought me into
the realization that it's an

441
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,800
endless progression. It's it's a
seamless consciousness within

442
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,840
this vast consciousness. We are
an individual consciousness

443
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,300
confronting an infinite
consciousness. How we experience

444
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,260
ourselves at the moment of
contact, as we dissolve into it,

445
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:34,400
influence what arises out of
this infinite consciousness. And

446
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,380
that's that awareness, that this
consciousness that I was

447
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,800
engaging and discovered myself
to be part of was truly infinite

448
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,940
and open ended, and that I
reached a point 15 years into

449
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,840
the journey where I discovered I
would never reach the end of it.

450
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,160
It was an infinite progression.
No matter how many years I did

451
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:03,000
this work, there was always more
to discover. So that means, and

452
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,980
that, to me, resonates very
deeply with the Buddhist

453
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,900
position on its critique of
theism, its critique of gods

454
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,920
that have physical forms of the
critique of gods that are come

455
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,080
out of human history and that
are we can understand to be

456
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,000
partial approximations, attempts
to understand something which

457
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,260
are partially adequate and
radically inadequate at the same

458
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:38,720
time. You know so when you move
beyond individual consciousness

459
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,980
and move into the collective
psyche and begin to engage some

460
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,580
of the dynamics of the
collective psyche. Part of what

461
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,820
you engage are all the stories
that we've been telling

462
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,080
ourselves for 10s of 1000s of
years, all the values that have

463
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,380
been involved in these stories,
which have been reinforcing

464
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,280
themselves on all these cultural
traditions. And there comes a

465
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,160
point where you die out of the
collective psyche, just as

466
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,880
earlier you had died out of your
personal psyche. And when you

467
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,880
die out of the collective
psyche, you move into a states

468
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,100
of awareness which are trans
species, which are go far beyond

469
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:23,360
the entire human history. And at
that point, you're moving into

470
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:29,480
states of awareness that are
radically, radically beyond and

471
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,200
clear than any states of
consciousness that take place

472
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,160
within the collective psyche.
And you just you realize that

473
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,760
all the stories of our religions
are part of the collective

474
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,520
psyche story, and that there are
the realities far, far, far

475
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,020
beyond any of those realities.
And I think that Buddhism is

476
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,280
pointing to that phenomena. When
it says it's fundamentally

477
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,780
agnostic, it says you shouldn't
restrict yourself to any

478
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,620
limiting belief about God.
However, you can experience the

479
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,660
reality that we're pointing to.
We can experience this reality,

480
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,140
but our understanding of it will
always be partial and

481
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,980
fragmented.

482
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,579
Andrew Holecek: Oh, my goodness.
So geez, every one of these

483
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:21,059
little snippets brought off for
a couple hours on this. Yeah,

484
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,539
there are a couple of things
here that really stood out for

485
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:26,299
me, Chris and again, there's,
there's, these are really seed

486
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:29,779
syllables for massive arenas of
for conversation. But one is, is

487
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:32,599
what you talk about so
beautifully in your book. And I

488
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,259
have not read living classroom
yet, but I literally just got it

489
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:42,039
in the mail, and that is this
radical, revolutionary new

490
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:45,279
pedagogical approach, which you
talk about, and I love it. This,

491
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:49,779
this transition from kind of
Newtonian, atomistic pedagogy,

492
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:53,799
individuality, separate from
others, to kind of a quantum

493
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:57,879
entangled pedagogy where using
that mixing metaphor is the

494
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,679
connective tissue of
consciousness that you're

495
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,119
really. So you're learning by
becoming I mean, what a

496
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,139
fantastic thing to say, which,
by the way, has resonance in

497
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,539
both the Hindu and Buddhist
traditions through what my

498
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:12,779
language is the Gnostic
pedagogical approach of hearing,

499
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:17,999
contemplating, meditating, which
is ingest, digest, metabolize,

500
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:22,279
until the teachings actually are
purified, filtered from

501
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:26,239
conceptual defilements into full
somatic empowerment, embodiment,

502
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,899
and there that's where true
knowing comes from. And so I

503
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:34,399
love that aspect of your
journey, that that it introduces

504
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:37,399
a type of pedagogy that is
completely resonant with the

505
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:41,859
classic wisdom traditions. You
experience this through your

506
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:45,339
journey, I also want to come
back to and this is key to me,

507
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:48,999
and this was a really, really
big experience for me when I did

508
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:53,199
my three year retreat where I
experienced what you're

509
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,959
referring to for the first time
in my life, and I wrestled with

510
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:59,499
it, Chris, because it really at
that time, it wasn't dissonance

511
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:03,239
with my obviously limited
understanding of emptiness and

512
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:09,119
non theism, where I did feel I
was being held and loved by

513
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,399
something bigger than me. And
this really created a rut for

514
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,799
me, because it was like, Hey,
wait a second. I thought there

515
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,659
was no externality. I thought it
was all solipsist. You know,

516
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:24,919
it's not solipsistic, but it's
just mind only. So how, how can

517
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:28,159
there be an external agency
without capitulating to the god

518
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,659
principle? And so what I want to
share with you, that, again,

519
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,239
your book was such an
inspiration for me, is that, in

520
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,879
a very real way, when I was
doing these guru yogas and

521
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:42,459
devotional practices properly,
my mind broke. I died to a

522
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:46,119
limited self sense I had, you
know, we can come back to this

523
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,939
in a little bit. There's just
tremendous hardship and pain

524
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:52,119
before that breakthrough
occurred, and then the minute

525
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,899
that happened, I felt this
complete container, mandala,

526
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,739
holding environment of love and,
dare I say, and this is in

527
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:03,419
quotations, an external agency
that was, in fact, holding me.

528
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:05,639
And then what became
unbelievably interesting to me,

529
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:10,679
Chris was, in a certain way, in
the third year of my retreat, I

530
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:14,879
lost something. I lost some of
these initial qualities. And so

531
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:19,439
it first, it was like, Wait a
second, I Where did my magical

532
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:23,659
nature of mine go and, and I
was, I really entered a kind of

533
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:26,599
a dark night of the soul within
my three year retreat. And a

534
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:31,399
lama came in and said something
that just floored me, that it

535
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:36,799
was a female Lama that said the
dakinis can bestow awakening,

536
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:39,079
and they can take it away. And,
and I said,

537
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,900
Unknown: What? What

538
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,960
Andrew Holecek: like that was
like, you know, it was like a

539
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,560
big Bong just hit my head. But
it was so true, it felt like

540
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,280
somehow it had been taken away.
And it took me decades, Chris,

541
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,260
to finally understand the really
brutal, painful, powerful lesson

542
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,200
that was developing in my
retreat. And you mentioned this

543
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,560
a little bit in the very last
chapter of your book, which I

544
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,800
thought was just absolutely
genius, that I was getting stuck

545
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,800
in a kind of almost spiritual
bypassing, or Transcendentalism,

546
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,340
in the negative sense, that I
was dissolving into these

547
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,520
completely formless realms where
I became the universe. And I

548
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,580
realized, on one level, when
this agency, for lack of a

549
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,680
better term, took it away the
and this is my thought bubble,

550
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,200
probably akin to some of the
thought bubbles that entered

551
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,900
you. It was like the command
was, you will find me in form,

552
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,560
or you will not find me at all.
In other words, it was almost as

553
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,920
if don't get stuck on this
formless stuff. Don't get stuck

554
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,360
in the transcendental aspect.
Come back to the earth. Come

555
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,960
back to the imminent, come back
into body. And that turned out

556
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,160
to be one of the most radically
challenging. And eventually,

557
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,860
over 20 years of trying to
incorporate that revelatory

558
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,400
experiences of the retreat was
that, no, it's not about this

559
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,480
ascent into this fundamental
Godhead. That's just half the

560
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,720
journey. The other half, the
evolutionary half, is taking

561
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,140
that and bringing it riveting,
it molding it back into the

562
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,700
earth. And so I want to pause
just to share that story with

563
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,400
you, because when you share that
in your book, it was like, Oh my

564
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,300
gosh, this is exactly resonant
with what happened in my own

565
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,200
experience. And so I want to
return to, if you don't mind,

566
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,320
help me further understand, and
this will help many of my

567
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,220
listeners, who are Buddhists,
who really work in the realm of

568
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,180
non theism and emptiness, this
so called agency, the beloved,

569
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,320
that, in fact, can embrace, that
we can call on, that we can work

570
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,280
with, that we really are not
alone. We can take refuge in

571
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,420
these greater forces to help us
along our path. So sorry for the

572
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,840
long winded interjection, but I
want to because I appreciate

573
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,960
very powerful my own experience,
not just a theoretical thing.

574
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,120
This is a big deal in my own
practice life.

575
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:59,860
Chris Bache: Yeah, you know,
maybe it's a footnote to my.

576
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,560
Earlier comment to bridge into
this new wing. I think Sri

577
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:09,660
Aurobindo critique of Buddhism
is correct in that he he

578
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,100
criticizes Buddhism for not
sufficiently confronting the

579
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:19,440
fact of existence, the the
extraordinary power and majesty

580
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,460
of existence in in rejecting
anything static and anything in

581
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,480
form, in its agnosticism, in its
anti theism. And it's I'm not

582
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,640
taught teaching all of that as
well and good. But he says, We

583
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,140
have to come to Terence with the
fact of the magnitude and the

584
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,480
genius and the majesty of the
universe of which we are part.

585
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,460
Now Buddhism may say, well,
thank you very much. We don't

586
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,580
need that. What we really need
is freedom from our suffering.

587
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,580
I'll take the freedom from
suffering, and I'm not going to

588
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,620
engage in the metaphysical quote
speculation and our bend those

589
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:05,640
responses. It's not an either
or, and it's a certain kind of a

590
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:12,600
capitulation to not confront
some of the magnitude of the

591
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,960
breath of life. And I think that
now to move more towards what

592
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,180
you were describing, I mean

593
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,360
when we have these
breakthroughs, when we do the

594
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,900
work and we go through the
purification processes, and we

595
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,860
face our shortcomings, and we
let go, and we let go, and we

596
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,960
immerse ourselves deeper and
deeper, and then when we have

597
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,200
these melting experiences,
where, as you say, we are

598
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:50,380
embraced, we are held by orders
of of genius and orders of love

599
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,720
beyond anything we had ever
experienced before. And one can

600
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,780
go deeper into that, there's
there's, I've learned that

601
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,820
there's so many levels of
oneness. And there's even levels

602
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,720
of of of the void, of the
fertile void, though that seems

603
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,900
like a contradiction. There are
levels of that, and you can go

604
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:21,860
deeper and deeper into that. And
it feels initially like an

605
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:26,000
external or an other because it
wasn't there before, or we

606
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,960
didn't experience it before, but
we do now, and it's it clearly

607
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,500
is not inside of us. It feels
outside of us because it's

608
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:39,620
holding us. But the more sorry
I'm having something peeping off

609
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,180
back here, it's okay. It's all
good. The more you go back and

610
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,860
forth into that condition and
back out again and into it and

611
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,160
press it, of course, the more
you realize that you're just

612
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,400
waking up to your own nature.
You're awake because your nature

613
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,420
and this universal nature is the
same nature that our essential

614
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,700
nature is this vast expanse,
this love that floods us from

615
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,560
outside is actually a love which
is welling up also from with

616
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,100
inside. The challenges is
stabilizing those insights and

617
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,840
bringing them into our daily
experience. Now I think this is

618
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,740
a this is a challenge of all
spiritual practice. Of course,

619
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,920
we go on these long retreats, we
get into subtle, subtle

620
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,240
territories. We come back to the
honking horns, and it's just

621
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,560
it's so difficult to hold on and
to integrate day to day. And

622
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,440
this is particularly the case, I
think, in psychedelic practice,

623
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,860
whether you're using
psychedelics as a spiritual

624
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,180
practice, or whether you're
using psychedelics, as I did, as

625
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:56,260
a measure aiming at cosmological
exploration. Because in my

626
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,620
experience, in what I did, I
think I pushed myself far, far

627
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:08,160
deeper into the consciousness of
the universe than I could ever,

628
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:15,420
ever internalize and stabilize
in this lifetime. And I came to

629
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,860
realize during my time, after I
came off the mountain, after I

630
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:25,760
stopped my work when I was
beginning to kind of just come

631
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,880
off the mountain, come away from
that long period of practice

632
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:36,440
that I had, I had created an
imbalance, an unwitting

633
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,140
imbalance. I thought that
because I had integrated each

634
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:43,000
session thoroughly and carefully
and conscientiously, that I

635
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,760
could step back from my sessions
and I could take all these

636
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:52,420
blessings with me. And I learned
that I had basically leaned so

637
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,680
heavily into Transcendence that
I had sort of lost my foothold

638
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,960
in imminence. And I knew from my
experience. Experience is that

639
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,260
the entire universe was the body
of divine are the body of this

640
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,420
infinite consciousness. I knew
that I was never outside of

641
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,660
divine reality, inside physical
reality, but I could not hold

642
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,920
that awareness. Yet inside
physical reality, I know that

643
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,840
there are beings who do the
Great Beings are always one's

644
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:30,380
guides in these things. But I
had, it's kind of like you, I

645
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,120
think what, what I was kind of
kicked off of the path, kicked

646
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,760
off of the mountain by the
sessions themselves. I did not

647
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,160
know I was ending them. They
were being ended. But there came

648
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,180
I had these last sessions, which
basically let me know that it

649
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:51,100
was time to end. And one of the
things I learned in the process

650
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:57,220
of ending is that I had to not
expand my consciousness. I had

651
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,400
to not alter my consciousness in
any way if the states of being

652
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,700
that I had experienced in my
sessions were ever going to come

653
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,440
and awaken fully inside my
historical existence. So I had

654
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,080
to sit with the shell of my
historical existence if I was

655
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:23,780
ever going to fully integrate
these vast bliss, domains of

656
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:29,720
ecstatic presence. And I think,
I think I did go farther than

657
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,480
was good for me, and I have been
in a completely different but

658
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,320
equally important process since
I stopped my sessions, the way

659
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,120
the sessions put it, or the way
my meditation put it is, there

660
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:52,360
is the dying of discovering, and
then the dying of keeping. And I

661
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,780
had done the dying of discovery,
but now I had to do the dying of

662
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,580
keeping, and that's a different
process. Wow.

663
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,940
Andrew Holecek: I mean, you're
stopping my mind with every one

664
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:09,960
of these, so many things here,
but a couple things, whoa. So

665
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,120
much about this is mind bending.
It's really mental yoga,

666
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,440
stretching almost to the
breaking point. And so a couple

667
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,780
questions here is, and I wrestle
with this. I mean, your the

668
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,040
integrity of your being, Chris,
your presence, the clarity of

669
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,740
your writing, the elegance of
your scholasticism, your

670
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:34,340
academic predispositions and the
like, I have to say, have been

671
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,640
incredibly important for me to
substantiate the veracity of

672
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,520
your journey. And I see it with
the mobility of simply the way

673
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,000
you're presenting yourself. It's
like this is the real deal. The

674
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,420
real deal, but it is such a mind
stretch. And so a couple of

675
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,960
things along this beautiful
challenge of stretching into the

676
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:54,880
notion of, I love your
nomenclature here, psychedelic

677
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,620
practice. I've never heard that
before. So talk to us a little

678
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,240
bit about this revolutionary
notion Greek, you know, the

679
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,260
skids have been greased by
Michael Pollan, James Kingsland,

680
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,100
Stan Grof, these amazing
predecessors, the shoulders upon

681
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,660
which you now stand where you
can now silently but radically

682
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:21,860
proclaim the validity of
Entheogen, psychedelics as path.

683
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,540
So talk a little bit more about
the practice of psychedelics,

684
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,200
how to work. This is a path. And
then to come back to before I

685
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:36,260
forget, parenthetically, the the
importance of integration and

686
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,980
the danger of disintegration. In
other words, were you ever

687
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,560
afraid of going insane, that you
were stretched beyond your

688
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,660
capacities to contain, and
instead of stretching, you snap.

689
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,420
So again, there's two big
noodles thrown there. The first

690
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,960
noodles, yeah, the first and I
think in many ways, probably the

691
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,200
most important, is talk to us
about psychedelics as practice

692
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,540
and path, and then to come back,
maybe a little bit about the

693
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,960
process of integration versus
disintegration, sanity versus

694
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,740
insanity.

695
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:11,819
Chris Bache: Yeah. Well, you
know, in different interviews

696
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:14,939
that I've done, I make the point
that I've never tripped. People

697
00:49:14,939 --> 00:49:17,879
say, you've done 73 trips. I
say, No, I've never tripped.

698
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:21,739
I've done sessions. These are
therapeutically focused

699
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:25,159
sessions. But actually, I'm in
my own mind, I think of the

700
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:31,519
Japanese term sashin. The sashin
is a meditation retreat. It's a

701
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,599
period of time set aside for
spiritual, intense spiritual

702
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,899
practice. So when I talk about
LSD sessions, I could be talking

703
00:49:40,899 --> 00:49:47,199
about LSD sashin. It is a period
of time set aside for

704
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:56,559
therapeutic work, for spiritual
work, for cosmological work. And

705
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:01,259
there are certain just as in a
sashin that. Your daily right?

706
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:04,559
Life changes. You change your
schedule, you change your eating

707
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,079
you change your sleeping
patterns, you change your

708
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:10,859
rhythm. In order to focus and
intensify this practice, just as

709
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:14,339
you did when you did your three
year retreat, everything changes

710
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:18,839
around this long period of
sustained introspection. The

711
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:24,079
same is true in the psychedelic
process. The critical the

712
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:29,419
underbelly of using psychedelics
as part of a practice of

713
00:50:29,419 --> 00:50:34,339
transformation, an organized
practice of transformation. The

714
00:50:34,459 --> 00:50:38,599
underbelly is that it's
temporary. You only have these

715
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:42,759
states for a few hours at a
time, and even if you use them

716
00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:48,339
diligently, you still only have
them for a few hours of a time

717
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:52,899
at a time, which is really the
major reason why I stopped. It

718
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:59,979
became too painful for me to
keep coming back from these

719
00:50:59,979 --> 00:51:06,779
states, until eventually, I made
a deal with my beloved, my name

720
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:11,999
for this intelligence, whatever
it is, that it would not bring

721
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:16,439
me back into these dimensions
again until I could stay it

722
00:51:16,439 --> 00:51:23,659
became It was just too painful
to come and go. But before you

723
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:27,319
get to that point, you can do a
lot of cleaning, you can you do

724
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:30,499
a lot of healing, and you would,
you can do a lot of good for

725
00:51:30,499 --> 00:51:36,979
other people in that. What
happened in my work, after about

726
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:40,219
two and a half years, when I
went through this, what Stan

727
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:43,359
calls the perinatal process. And
all you go through this,

728
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:47,139
reliving your birth, confronting
all the fears of death,

729
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:50,979
confronting the fundamental
existential crisis of whether

730
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:54,819
there is any meaning in
existence, eventually going to a

731
00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:59,199
complete shattering of your
individual egoic reality. I

732
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,979
thought, Oh, that's great. I've
gone through an ego death. It

733
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:04,919
was a shattering experience.
Things are going to open up now

734
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:10,499
go into clean sailing, not what
happened. What happens that

735
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:14,759
everything cranked up all over
again. The suffering got worse,

736
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:19,919
and it expanded for two years of
practice into larger and larger

737
00:52:19,919 --> 00:52:25,159
levels, 1000s, hundreds of 1000s
of people, 1000s and 1000s of

738
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:30,739
years, I had entered the hell
realms. And at first I thought

739
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:35,059
this is like a deeper level of
ego death. But eventually I came

740
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:38,779
to understand that, no, this was
not about me at all. This was

741
00:52:38,779 --> 00:52:42,519
not about fundamentally, my
personal transformation, on my

742
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:47,439
personal awakening, or even my
personal healing. This was about

743
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:51,819
trying to heal some aspect of
the collective psyche, that

744
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:56,319
there is an organizational
structure, a consciousness, that

745
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,159
that is our species
consciousness, and all the

746
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,019
wounds of history that are left
unresolved are not only left

747
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:07,619
unresolved at an individual soul
level, but they are left

748
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,419
unresolved at the species level.
So all the wars we fought, all

749
00:53:12,419 --> 00:53:15,419
the terrible things we've done
to each other, all the trauma,

750
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:21,679
to the extent that that trauma
is not healed, it it resides as

751
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,239
unfinished business within the
collective psyche. And every

752
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:29,959
spiritual practitioner who goes
deeply enough in whatever

753
00:53:29,959 --> 00:53:36,079
methodology they're using is
given, often an invitation, if

754
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,679
they choose to exercise it, to
lift some of that suffering, not

755
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:44,559
out of their personal life, but
to lift some of that suffering

756
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:49,839
out of the collective psyche,
and for reasons that I think are

757
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:57,039
sole choice that became a large
part of my work. And I think

758
00:53:57,339 --> 00:54:01,679
there's nothing really special
here. I mean, this is what any

759
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,759
mother who sees a child
suffering is going to do if she

760
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:09,059
can do something to try to help
that child suffering, to

761
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:13,079
alleviate it. Any father worth
his salt is going to try to help

762
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:17,099
a suffering child, if we are
given the opportunity, we're

763
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:21,619
going to try to help other
people who are in pain. This is

764
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:25,639
just the normal workings of
life. So to me,

765
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,360
in fact, it became a mystery to
me why the collective suffering

766
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,800
stopped, why I wasn't allowed to
stay in there anymore, when

767
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,420
clearly there's continuing
collective suffering in the

768
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:48,760
human psyche. Why was I taken
into deeper levels beyond that,

769
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,280
levels which are very difficult,
very challenging, but they were

770
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,920
not involved with collective
pain. I'm losing the second.

771
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,800
Andrew Holecek: Part of your
question that you would ask,

772
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,380
yeah, no, happy, happy. To throw
it back up, because there's and

773
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,460
there's so much richness coming
out that's returning to this

774
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:12,420
notion of we circumambulated
this but haven't really

775
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,700
directed. Talked about if the
place of fear and well of

776
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,020
integration versus
disintegration, did you ever

777
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:26,300
actually fear, especially coming
back to the so called real world

778
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,000
for your sanity? I mean, did you
ever feel you're going to become

779
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,140
so unhinged? Because let me just
say this very briefly, Chris,

780
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,780
one of the things that was
profoundly resonant with with

781
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:40,640
your work, and this is what just
blew me away, this kind of on

782
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,420
one level I've come to see
psychedelics is a type of

783
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,440
Tantra. And by this, what I mean
is, and this has been a radical

784
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,740
change in my more conservative
nature, being more

785
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,160
traditionalist and paying homage
again. There's tremendous genius

786
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,100
to the power of tradition. But
there are also some near

787
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,020
enemies, ossification,
redefining even the tradition

788
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:05,100
itself losing tributaries of new
information and growth. And so I

789
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:10,080
used to be really somewhat
disdainful of these kind of

790
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,920
psychedelic approaches. Is
chemical mysticism in the

791
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,860
pejorative sense, these kind of
cheap fixes. But I've really

792
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,780
changed my tune in that I now
see them as a type of Tantra. By

793
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,680
that, what I mean is that in
Tantra, body is as important as

794
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,640
mind. And now we're talking
about body, very subtle body.

795
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,400
We're talking about chemical
body. We're talking about body

796
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:36,260
at the level of neuro chemistry,
basically. And so I think again,

797
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,840
within the context of
psychedelics as practice and

798
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,360
path, it actually can fit in an
expanded rubric of Tantra, where

799
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,700
body, in this case, chemistry,
is as important as the mind that

800
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:54,580
is evoked. And this kind of
neuro pharma, phenologic, neuro

801
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,180
phenomenological way to use the
neuro end to bring about these

802
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:02,280
phenomenal states. And so with
that in mind, yeah, the question

803
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,180
was the role of fear, fear and
integration versus

804
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,420
disintegration, and how that
relates to your ability to

805
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,680
contain this information

806
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:19,080
Chris Bache: you I had, I did
come into places to go through A

807
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,720
Death-Rebirth cycle is always an
ordeal at one level or another.

808
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,080
It always involves a surrender
to the unknown. It always

809
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:31,340
involves yielding to a certain
fear that's holding your system

810
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:37,220
locked in place. And there were
places where at advanced stages

811
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:41,440
of the game that I truly did
fear for my sanity, or at least

812
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,500
I knew that I was going
someplace that was completely

813
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,120
beyond anything which I could
hold on to. I could not hold on

814
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,960
to sanity as I had known it. And
it was like going over a

815
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,880
waterfall, and you just but once
you go through that, once you go

816
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:04,376
over that waterfall, and you
experience that death, and you

817
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:10,496
experience waking up in a new
reality as a new being, a new

818
00:58:10,496 --> 00:58:13,736
kind of being, not only a new
and improved you, but a

819
00:58:13,736 --> 00:58:17,156
different kind of being, where,
for hours at a time, you can

820
00:58:17,156 --> 00:58:21,680
experience the universe as it
experiences itself completely

821
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,240
beyond any human right frame of
reference once you experience

822
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,180
it. That is the nature of the
cycle. And this is one of the

823
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,960
great gifts that I got from Stan
Grof, was the absolute

824
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,040
conviction that if you let these
experiences take you wherever

825
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,540
they want to take you, even
though you don't understand

826
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,760
them, even though you don't
understand why it's happening

827
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,480
this way, and it's extremely
painful. If you surrender

828
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,800
completely, it will always take
you through a crisis, and it'll

829
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:57,100
catch you on the other side, and
it will receive you, and there,

830
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:02,940
there is a blessing waiting for
you on that other side, and for

831
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:08,340
me, coming back from a session,
it's never I have no trauma from

832
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,120
any of my psychedelic history. I
can listen to the music I used

833
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,840
and even the most horrifying
aspects of the journey, and I

834
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,260
love it. I'm completely
comfortable with it. I can talk

835
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,060
about any of the difficult
portions without any resonating,

836
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,800
any trauma, because when you
take it all the way through, you

837
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,100
complete the cycle. Things get
bad. They get worse. They get

838
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:35,300
worse. They get very, very bad.
But if you let surrender, it'll

839
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,320
take you through to a
completion, into ecstasy, and

840
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,960
then what you bring back is this
entire cycle. You bring back the

841
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:48,100
knowledge that things get bad,
but things things get great, and

842
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,240
that's the rhythm of death and
rebirth. That is the spiral of

843
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,280
death and rebirth. Now that
doesn't mean and I thought as

844
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,260
long as that was going on, I
was. Teaches that you know that

845
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,680
I was holding everything in
balance. What I did find,

846
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:09,300
however, is that other thing we
talked about, you can go so far

847
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:16,500
into the ecstasy, you can go so
deep into Transcendence that

848
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:22,700
literally learning how to live
with your memories becomes a

849
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:28,940
major challenge. So as a
spiritual practice, this

850
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:34,880
practice is different from
classical spiritual practices,

851
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,020
which are much more emphasizing
kind of holding on to

852
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:44,440
everything, relatively speaking,
holding on to where you go in

853
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:53,020
smaller increments. I have an I
have an understanding of how the

854
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:57,640
universe works, but I don't live
within that reality on a 24/7

855
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:02,160
basis. The great beings live
within that reality on a 24/7

856
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:08,280
basis. So being able to, I'm
speaking out of my memory, and

857
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,060
it's good to have memories of
these realities. I mean, I

858
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:16,320
really think that changed my
life. But it's one thing to be

859
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,260
speaking out of memory. It's
another thing to be speaking out

860
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:22,460
of an immediate present, right
here, living experience of this

861
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:29,300
reality and learning you can
internalize so many profound

862
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:35,660
memories that it literally
becomes challenging to live with

863
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:40,040
those memories. They haunt you
for the rest of your life, and

864
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,160
they haunt you in a good way.
They're not. They don't haunt

865
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,820
you in any negative way. You
literally are haunted by the

866
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:53,380
beauty of the universe, right?
And so you just, you try to live

867
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:58,600
it and embodiment as best as you
can. Yeah.

868
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,540
Andrew Holecek: Do you think? Do
you think, Chris, one of the

869
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:04,380
things that really struck me was
what you just paraphrased, and I

870
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,380
have to say, in this part of the
book, I struggled with this part

871
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:11,940
of this part of the book, when
you were talking about just all

872
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,680
the pain, all the hardship, all
the death, the unbelievably

873
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:22,220
wrenching section about the
dying children, was I was almost

874
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:26,120
too much. And so, yeah, I hung
in there, and I'm glad I did, in

875
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,780
a certain way, almost metaphoric
of you're hanging in there. But

876
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,560
is it possible that that perhaps
the what was being invited was

877
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:41,020
developing a one taste
relationship to both the heaven

878
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:45,040
and the hell, that there would
in fact, be no preference and no

879
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,940
because that's what they say,
allegedly, the very highest

880
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:53,920
stages before the 11th Bhumi,
the highest kind of membrane

881
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,640
barrier before awakening, is no
preference whatsoever for

882
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,820
Samsara, nor Nirvana in
discovering the inseparability.

883
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,080
So do you think on one level
that the agency was somehow

884
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,240
eliciting the teaching lesson of
great equanimity, that, in fact,

885
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,260
relate to the agony in the same
way you relate to the ecstasy,

886
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,900
to realize that there's
fundamentally no preference for

887
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,740
either that, that that may have
been what was being suggested

888
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,020
there? Does that resonate with
you.

889
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:27,020
Chris Bache: I understand the
teaching, and that teaching does

890
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:32,600
come up and reflect certain
aspects of the journey. I'm not

891
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,160
sure that it reflects this
particular aspect in a in a

892
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,280
satisfying way. I have a
different way of understanding

893
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,300
because you're talking here
about the ocean of what I call

894
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:49,900
the ocean of suffering. And you
know, one of the things I

895
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:54,160
describe in the book is insights
that came much later in the

896
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,700
session, that I don't think
everybody has to go into

897
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,800
something like the ocean of
suffering. I don't think

898
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,180
everybody has to go into the
hell realms or spend as long in

899
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,240
the hell realms as I spent
there. I mean, I don't think

900
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:10,560
people need to be afraid of
going through what I went

901
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:17,340
through as kind of a necessary
part of any kind of spiritual

902
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:23,300
journey or cosmological
exploration. I think that this

903
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:28,340
was something that my chose, my
soul chose to do before I was

904
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:33,740
born. It manifested so quickly
in my sessions after a couple of

905
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:38,480
years, and it was such a
tenacious and sustained part of

906
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,040
my journey that I came to
understand that this was

907
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:47,740
literally a soul's choice. And I
say this without pride at all,

908
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,980
because I think there are many,
many, many beings in the world

909
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:55,600
today who have made the same
choice. I think we are living in

910
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,560
a critical time in history. We
are living in a time when the

911
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,900
sin. Of the fathers literally
are just pouring out of us. And

912
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,500
I don't I quote The biblical
passage, not to put this all on

913
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:13,740
men, but that really the
limitations of our up to now

914
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:19,500
standard, of our evolutionary
standard, are just pouring out

915
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,840
of us because we are being
challenged to move into our next

916
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,880
evolutionary step, not only as
individuals, but as the species

917
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,320
that the creative intelligence
of the universe is trying to

918
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:38,180
awaken not only individual
spiritual practitioners, but the

919
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:41,620
game is collective now it's
desperately trying to awaken the

920
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:48,220
entire human species and the the
hell realms that one are

921
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,700
literally manifesting on Earth
as part of this collective

922
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:56,320
detoxification process. And I
think there are many beings who

923
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,860
are have taken the Bodhisattva
vow into their life and are

924
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:06,480
working to alleviate suffering,
collectively, socially,

925
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:12,780
politically and also psycho
spiritually. Because I think

926
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:16,440
this century is different than
earlier centuries, because

927
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,640
there's a boiling taking place
as a there's a there's a turning

928
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,860
which is taking place deep
within. And so I assume that I

929
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:28,460
knew what I was getting into,
and I volunteered for this work,

930
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,420
and I know that this it's a hard
chapter to read, even though I

931
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:38,180
cut it down to the minimal form,
it's difficult material. And yet

932
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,560
I've had so many people write me
and say, I know exactly what

933
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,040
you're talking about, because
I've been, I've been going

934
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,920
through these experiences for
years, or I went through them

935
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,920
and I didn't understand them.
You've helped me understand them

936
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:58,900
some. But I think it's, it's not
an unusual experience, once we

937
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:04,020
understand that what's taking
place here is a collective

938
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,440
dynamic. It's something that we
as an individual may have

939
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,900
started, but the universe uses
our individual initiative to

940
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,800
accomplish something of its
purpose of its agenda, and its

941
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:21,740
agenda is to heal the human
species in order to clear out

942
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,960
the dross that is holding us
back, to make more room for the

943
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:35,120
infusion of grace, our energy or
awareness that is coming to

944
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,420
carry humanity through this
crisis that we are coming into.

945
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:42,100
We literally cannot afford to be
a planet that's run by egos

946
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,900
anymore? Yeah, for sure, we're
just killing the planet. We need

947
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:51,520
to be a planet that's run by
awakened souls, and by that I

948
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:58,660
mean beings who have a conscious
awareness of their history, so

949
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:02,820
that they know that they are not
simply egos, separate private

950
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:08,220
cells that they have an awakened
soul consciousness where they

951
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,360
know themselves to be spiritual
beings in dynamic relationship

952
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:17,520
with other spiritual beings,
including non human beings. In

953
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:23,120
this world, you know, animal
kingdom, and when we wake up in

954
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:27,500
that way, and we discover how
old we are and how many

955
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,380
generations we've been doing
this, and we discover the

956
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,280
breadth of our human of our
relationships with other beings,

957
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:41,440
then Naturally, we make
different choices. We make more

958
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,700
inclusive choices. We make
choices for the long term, we

959
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,660
make choices on that serves the
good of all. And right now, I

960
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,620
think we desperately need to be
making choices that are

961
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:55,600
inclusive and work for the good
of all.

962
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,940
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, that's
really beautiful. With your

963
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:01,860
permission, and if you don't
want to go here, that's fine. I

964
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:06,960
want to turn again. I have to
contain both my enthusiasm and

965
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,320
the energy of like, Oh my gosh.
We need to talk about that. We

966
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:15,060
need to talk about that. So I'm
letting so much slide that it's

967
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:20,460
fantastic. But with your kind
permission, I want to turn to

968
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:25,160
this issue of the the scientific
and academic elephant in the

969
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,700
room. How do we know if
anything, any of this is

970
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:33,260
actually true? How do we know
issues of replica bill,

971
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:37,100
replicability? I mean, how do we
know if, if what you're seeing

972
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,780
is idiosyncratic to your own
biochemistry, that this and

973
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,240
again, in the best sense of the
word, not pejorative, this is

974
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:47,800
your trip. Yeah. And how do we
know that if seven, if 1000

975
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:51,460
other people did exactly what
you did, that they could even

976
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,860
come close to replicating your
insights? Or would they, in

977
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:57,940
fact, have their own particular,
biological, historical,

978
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,200
phenomenological, whatever
matrix? Context whereby they

979
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:05,340
would see and write a different
journey, a different book,

980
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,180
through 20 years of exploration.
So the issue here is the problem

981
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:14,100
of proof and universality. What
would happen if 1000 people did

982
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,680
exactly what you did and they
came up with 1000 different

983
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,840
visions? I mean, how certain are
you that what you're

984
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:23,540
experiencing is actually true,
or simply your enculturation,

985
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,680
your your own unique
biochemistry and all the

986
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,320
histories that bring about the
narrative that you're sharing

987
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,440
with us. So are you okay? Okay,
going in this direction?

988
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,020
Chris Bache: Absolutely, that's
a really important question. I

989
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:40,960
mean, that's like a foundational
question, because if it, if this

990
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:45,460
is only echoes from my own
personal psyche, or even echoes

991
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:49,300
from the collective psyche, then
it has a certain kind of

992
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,500
epistemic value, but it doesn't
really have sufficient epistemic

993
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:58,480
value that we that warrants our
attention. And I discussed this

994
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,700
all the way back in dark night,
early dawn, in the first

995
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:07,080
chapter, where I'm outlining
what it this psychedelic

996
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,080
philosophy, and there's a
section there called the

997
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:15,720
epistemic warrant of psychedelic
experience, where I flesh out

998
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:19,320
this question and look at what
the issues are involved In this,

999
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,060
in questioning whether these
experiences truly do have

1000
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:28,220
epistemic value. So that's I
just point there. Also Ken ring

1001
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:33,260
and I have had a dialog about
this. Ken is good friend,

1002
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:37,400
wonderful researcher near death.
Episode, I used his books for

1003
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:42,340
years in my classes. He
challenged me on the same

1004
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:46,660
questions, and we did a dialog.
Eventually we published it in

1005
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:53,800
I'm blanking on where it is. I
should have this at the tip of

1006
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:59,320
my tongue, it's online. Yeah,
it's online. It's quite the

1007
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:05,280
essay. Is our deep psychedelic
experiences trustable? Yeah, and

1008
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,740
if it were just my experiences,
that would be one thing. But

1009
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:18,060
here's, I think, the great value
of Stan Grof work, where Stan

1010
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:21,740
Grof has collected psychedelic
experiences from hundreds, if

1011
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:25,940
not 1000s of people over
decades, and he's integrated

1012
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:30,260
them into a certain model of
what happens at different stages

1013
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:35,240
of the journey. My experiences
fit squarely within the broader

1014
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,100
phenomenological discussion of
experiences that he has already

1015
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:44,440
outlined. And so I think that he
provides, in a sense, a broad

1016
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:50,080
epistemic warrant for look,
taking seriously my maybe a

1017
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,620
little unusually intense, or
maybe a little unusually deep my

1018
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:58,240
experiences. But there's not too
much new here. When you look at

1019
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,860
the full breadth of experiences
that he's reported in his many,

1020
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:06,120
many books, culminating in his
great master work, the way of

1021
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:11,280
the psychonaut. So there's a
deep, you know, overlap. There

1022
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:17,640
another point, I think I'm
thinking of Michael sabhm, who

1023
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,580
was a cardiologist in the early
days of the near death episode

1024
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:25,820
movement, and he was very upset
that people were talking about

1025
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:28,280
coming back from a cardiac
arrest and talking about

1026
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,980
spiritual realities. He didn't
believe in any of that stuff,

1027
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,580
and he was going to
systematically disprove it. And

1028
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:38,000
he eventually wrote a book in
which he came to the conclusion

1029
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,860
this stuff is real, and he
differentiate between what he

1030
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:45,400
calls the local event and the
transcendent event that when

1031
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,820
somebody has is in surgery or
has a cardiac arrest, they get

1032
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,800
out of that they have a
sensation of getting out of

1033
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,400
their body, and they can
experience what's going on in

1034
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,820
the local arena, the surgical
theater, the waiting room down

1035
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:00,360
the hall, the hospital, what's
going On in the parking lot

1036
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:04,920
outside, and then they go into
the light, and they leave

1037
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,340
physical reality, and they go
into a transcendental reality.

1038
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:13,860
He says, We can't evaluate the
transcendent experience that

1039
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:18,060
they have, but we can evaluate
the accuracy of their local

1040
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:22,040
experience, and that's what he
tries to do whether what they

1041
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,760
think they experience locally
is, in fact, verified,

1042
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:30,440
verifiable in that world. And he
provided evidence that in fact

1043
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,520
it was. Now that doesn't prove
that the transcendent experience

1044
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,420
is true, but it certainly
increases the credibility that

1045
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:41,680
if it's the local experience is
true, the Transcendence

1046
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,140
experiences gets a little bit
more little boost of

1047
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:47,260
credibility. The same thing
happens in psychedelic

1048
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:50,920
experiences. Many psychedelic
experiences are such that they

1049
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:55,540
can be verified information
about the conditions of birth or

1050
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:59,440
circumstances of birth, the
things that people learn that

1051
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,480
they really. We can reasonably
exclude the possibility that

1052
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,240
they had learned through natural
means, and yet, it turns out

1053
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:11,520
that these things can be
validated. That plays here. The

1054
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:17,400
other part, though, is, I think,
cross validation, other people

1055
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,720
having similar experience,

1056
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,440
Andrew Holecek: communal
confirmation, exactly now,

1057
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:25,160
Chris Bache: what we find is
this, when people start working

1058
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:29,420
with psychedelics, if you took
100 people from 100 different

1059
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:33,320
backgrounds, different socio
cultural backgrounds, different

1060
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,900
trainings and whatnot, they
would have very different

1061
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:40,780
experiences, because
psychedelics, or LSD, is an

1062
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:44,800
amplifier. It doesn't take you
to a particular experience that

1063
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,700
amplifies your mind. And because
we have different histories, we

1064
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,860
come in contact with different
experiences. However, Stan

1065
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:57,340
reports that when people go
through the perinatal

1066
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:01,440
Death-Rebirth process, our
experiences get very, very

1067
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,460
concentrated and very
standardized, we begin to deal

1068
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:08,880
with issues which are not
idiosyncratic, but are

1069
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:12,900
universal, fundamental
existential issues, and that

1070
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,980
when people navigate the
Death-Rebirth experience, every

1071
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:20,460
person that he has experienced
who goes through that process

1072
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:24,200
comes back with a an
understanding of spiritual

1073
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:28,040
reality, which is fundamentally
compatible with each other, that

1074
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:31,700
there is a spiritual world that
was waiting for us and receives

1075
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:37,400
us from then it's a matter of
evaluating our individual

1076
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:44,320
explorations of that spiritual
world. Now, what I did in my

1077
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,040
first in my first book on
psychedelics, near dark night,

1078
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:52,720
early dawn, I put together three
areas of inquiry, psychedelic

1079
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:57,220
research, near death episode
research and out of body

1080
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:00,480
research, particularly the work
of Robert Monroe, founder of the

1081
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,180
Monroe Institute of Applied
Science, author of three books

1082
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,840
exploring the out of body state.
And I asked whether these

1083
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,140
cosmology is that emerge from
these separate bodies of

1084
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:13,980
exploration, out of body
research, near death episode

1085
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,820
research, psychedelic research,
are their cosmological visions

1086
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:23,480
diverging, or are they
converging? And once you look at

1087
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,720
them carefully, they are
converging. They are clearly

1088
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,940
converging. So that's addressing
the question Are, are these

1089
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:37,220
experiences trustworthy? Now, in
my dialog with Ken ring, I

1090
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,160
present other reasons why I
think they're trustworthy, and

1091
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:45,340
that is for every time I had my
own cultural expectations

1092
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:48,820
fulfilled, because I'm educated
in world religions, I'm educated

1093
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:52,120
in comparative spirituality, I
have an understanding of certain

1094
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,840
of these things, but for every
time I've had them confirmed,

1095
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:02,760
I've also had more experiences
that that shatter my

1096
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,380
expectations. I learned things I
was not expecting. I learned an

1097
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,620
understanding of reincarnation,
how reincarnation works, and

1098
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:13,920
where it's taking us that I was
not expecting at all. I wasn't

1099
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,460
expecting anything about the
birth of the future human. There

1100
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:20,120
was nothing about my
conditioning, which led me to

1101
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:24,320
think that humanity was coming
into this crossroads. There were

1102
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,580
so many things that I was shown
so consistently that were far

1103
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:32,540
and beyond anything that I had
personally expected, that I

1104
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:36,680
think one can reasonably
conclude that this is a

1105
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,260
confrontation with truly an
independent reality. And I mean

1106
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:45,040
independent, I have to qualify
that, but a reality that it was

1107
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,900
not simply echoing back to me,
my own expectations. And if you

1108
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:53,380
study the work of other people
who push deeply into these

1109
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:57,100
conditions, into these states, I
think we find a fundamental

1110
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:00,600
convergence, which doesn't mean
we're seeing the exact same

1111
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:05,760
thing. But the issue is, do our
do our visions overlap? Are they

1112
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,140
coherent with each other? Do
they overlap? Now, clearly we're

1113
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:15,060
only at the very early stages of
this inquiry. What's important

1114
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:18,660
is not any one person's
experience. What's important is

1115
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:22,160
when we get, if we were to be
able to get a standardized

1116
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:26,720
protocol, take 100 people, 1000
people with some type of

1117
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,300
standardized protocol, with
very, very different

1118
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:34,220
backgrounds, and put them
through the same regimen of

1119
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,860
internal, introspective work,
then we get all of their

1120
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,120
testimony, all of their
experiences, put them all on the

1121
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,360
table, and begin to look at,
what is it that's consistent and

1122
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:50,380
what is idiosyncratic? That's
where, where we're going. We're

1123
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:53,680
just are not there yet. We're
only at the very early stages.

1124
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:58,000
So I have no doubt that some of
the things may be somewhat

1125
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,680
idiosyncratic to me. But. I
think that when we get to that

1126
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,740
point where we have hundreds of
people putting their testimony

1127
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:09,060
forward, we're going to find
much more consistency and

1128
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,760
overlap than we find divergence.

1129
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,720
Andrew Holecek: Oh, my goodness.
So so so many things here as

1130
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,900
well. What a beautiful answer.
Crystal really the difference

1131
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,220
between correspondence
epistemology and coherence.

1132
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,400
Epistemology, I mean, the truth
is born of coherence is the type

1133
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,460
of knowing that you're alluding
to here. But this begs the

1134
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:35,300
question of aspirations around
this. And so pardon the tongue

1135
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:38,120
in cheek reference here. But I
was this came to me out of who

1136
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,980
knows where, where you know,
where do you see yourself in 20

1137
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:45,160
years? Do you see yourself and
again? If you don't want to go

1138
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:49,900
here, fine, but how do you see
yourself? Are you a shaman for

1139
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:54,340
our age? Do you see yourself?
And this is where the play on

1140
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:58,660
Word comes in, not establishing
the church of LDS, but the

1141
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:03,840
church of LSD, right? So do you
see yourself? Not the Latter Day

1142
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,280
Saints, but you know LSD. So do
you see yourself? Do you see

1143
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,100
yourself? And I think you
understand the heart of my

1144
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:15,660
question, founding a church
where, in fact, you know you

1145
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:19,980
have a place where you can, you
now can create, as a visionary,

1146
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,980
as a revolutionary, a holding
environment, a mandala container

1147
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:30,440
that can allow future
Psychonauts to actually embrace

1148
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:35,060
this as path, because otherwise,
where is this going to go? Are

1149
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:40,480
you just a unique and really
interesting blip, or is are you

1150
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,900
portending the possibility of
really creating a tradition of

1151
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:47,920
Psychonauts using rigorous to
whatever extent they can,

1152
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,900
methodologies, frameworks? I
think you see where I'm coming

1153
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,960
from here. You know what's next
in terms of people say, somebody

1154
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,260
comes to you and says, Chris,
I'm so blown away by your book.

1155
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,000
I want to take psychedelics as a
practice. I want to create this

1156
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:06,120
as a path. What do I do? Where
do I go?

1157
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,460
Chris Bache: Well, the first
thing I tell that person always

1158
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:16,320
is, please, don't do what I did.
Do it gently. Be gentler. Be

1159
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:22,040
more careful. I think I'm a
symptom of a cultural pivot that

1160
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,820
we're making. I don't think I'm
important, and as we make this

1161
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:30,080
cultural pivot, I think I will
just sort of disappear under the

1162
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:37,580
wave of history as a somewhat
early explorer. But I think we

1163
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:44,320
are making a pivot that's going
to include and is embracing the

1164
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:49,240
value of psychedelics now, right
now, you know, we basically did

1165
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:55,180
about 25 years of this work, and
then in 1970 6970, it was all

1166
01:22:55,180 --> 01:23:00,780
made illegal. Then we went into
this long dry period until 2014

1167
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,820
when Scientific American
published an editorial basically

1168
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:10,320
on the front page of that saying
that it's time to let scientists

1169
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,800
determine, not politicians
determine whether psychedelics

1170
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:18,000
have therapeutic value. So right
now, there's this tremendous

1171
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,260
Renaissance taking place.
Universities all over the world

1172
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:24,680
are studying psychedelics, are
establishing centers for

1173
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:28,040
studying psychedelics. A
tremendous explosion. We're

1174
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:34,820
starting where we started back
in the 1950s exploring these

1175
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:39,140
potentials for healing the
personal psyche. We're looking

1176
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:44,860
at post traumatic stress,
healing addiction, healing death

1177
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:49,780
anxiety, healing depression.
We're really focused on using

1178
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:54,460
these substances in therapeutic
applications and under control

1179
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:59,380
scientific conditions. And this
is, and that's perfectly where

1180
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:03,180
we ought to be. We need to now
that we've started this inquiry

1181
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:06,060
again, we need to be very
rigorous, establish the

1182
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:10,560
protocols, do the documentation,
look at the brain wave pictures,

1183
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,120
so on and so forth. Sooner or
later, however, we're going to

1184
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,960
discover the same thing we
discovered far back, and I'm not

1185
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,000
talking about the popular 60s
psychedelic movement, though

1186
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,720
that too. But the serious
researchers, the Stan Grof and

1187
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:30,440
that early generations Ralph
Meister, that generation of

1188
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:35,660
researchers, discovered that
these substances have

1189
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:40,300
philosophical value, not just
psychotherapeutic value. They

1190
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:45,460
give us entire insights into the
structure of the deep psyche.

1191
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:49,060
They can even give us insights
into the structure of the

1192
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:53,500
cosmos, into the structure of
the cosmology of the mind. And

1193
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:58,300
if we take PhDs who have people
who have PhDs in physics and

1194
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:02,160
astronomer they can. Literally
come back with deeper insights

1195
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,660
into the realities that they
are, that they are educated to

1196
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:11,160
understand. I often have wished
that I had PhDs in astronomy and

1197
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:15,060
physics, because then I would be
able to understand so much more

1198
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:18,480
than I was able to understand
given the background that I had

1199
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:23,840
in humanities. We're making this
pivot, I think that just as

1200
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,040
psychotherapists are creating
all sorts of creative protocols

1201
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:32,060
for exploiting the therapeutic
potential of these substances,

1202
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:36,020
it's only going to be a matter
of time before we develop

1203
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,600
philosophical protocols which
for systematically exploring

1204
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,140
these states of consciousness,
going into them in a rigorous

1205
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:50,500
manner, coming back, recording
them, evaluating them, looking

1206
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,160
at our experiences in the in a
social context for social

1207
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:58,060
validation, or asking that
question, embodying putting our

1208
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,260
experiences in the context of
other bodies of knowledge

1209
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:05,460
looking at how these experiences
correlate to quantum physics,

1210
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:10,020
for example, or correlate to
super string theory. I think

1211
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:14,940
this is, this is not me. I'm
going to be gone 20 years. Hell,

1212
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:17,640
I won't be around in 20 years. I
don't think I'll be around

1213
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:23,120
nearly that long. I'll be gone
and and actually and two, I

1214
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:28,400
should say it took me a long
time to even be willing to share

1215
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:32,180
these experiences, because I
know how upsetting or

1216
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:38,420
controversial they are. I
literally thought of writing the

1217
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:42,460
book and letting it be published
post human, yeah, exactly,

1218
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:45,880
because I didn't want to deal
with the fall out of it. And I

1219
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,500
think what happened with

1220
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,540
Andrew Holecek: Wolfgang Pauli
in his conversations with Carl

1221
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:52,180
Jung, right? He didn't want any
of that revealed until after he

1222
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,920
died. But anyway, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to

1223
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,860
Chris Bache: cut, yeah, and I
just, I thought, but you know,

1224
01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:02,040
the mother told me, said, No,
you can't do that. She said, she

1225
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:08,280
said this, we need all oars in
the water. She said, You didn't

1226
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:12,120
give yourself these visions. We
gave you those visions, and they

1227
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:15,540
were never given to you for your
private edification. You were

1228
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:19,740
holding these visions in trust,
and that she wanted me to share

1229
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:23,300
them, not because it's not
important that they're my

1230
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:27,740
visions. She wanted me to share
them because they would support

1231
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:31,280
other people in their spiritual
practice, other people in their

1232
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:36,560
social work, to help us through
this very, very intense time of

1233
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:42,700
history that we're coming into,
all hands on deck. And so I did

1234
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:47,260
the book, and I don't have any I
don't have any agenda. I think

1235
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:50,680
what's what's clear is that
there is a social pivot taking

1236
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:55,060
place, and that's what's
important as we move forward

1237
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:59,140
collectively, the work, which is
being done in graduate programs

1238
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,100
and medical schools all over the
country. That's what's

1239
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:06,180
important. I think I'm a little
bit ahead of the curve in terms

1240
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,720
of the philosophical discovery
only because of the very, very

1241
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:13,320
intense methodology that I used.
But I don't think I'm really

1242
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:19,560
that far ahead of the curve.
There is a professor from

1243
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,760
Southern Methodist University
called Bill Barnard, who's

1244
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:26,660
written two fantastic books, one
on William James and one on

1245
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:31,700
Henri Bergson, a fine academic,
Bill Barnard and he's publishing

1246
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:35,960
a book from Columbia University
Press this year called liquid

1247
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:41,560
light, Which basically is a
philosopher's reflections on his

1248
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:45,940
extended experiences with
Ayahuasca and living with the

1249
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:50,380
Sante Daime community in Brazil.
Beautiful book, magnificent

1250
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:55,060
book, and symptomatic one more
academic who's willing to go

1251
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:58,960
public on their psychedelic
experiences and not simply

1252
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,740
recording them and saying all
this is, you know what's

1253
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:05,940
important, but evaluating them
critically, digesting them and

1254
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:10,080
offering them as part of a
ongoing historical discussion.

1255
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,960
So we're making this pivot.
It's, it's happening,

1256
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,240
Andrew Holecek: and it's, it's
radically brave. Chris, I want

1257
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,760
to acknowledge your bravery on
this. And again, this is a

1258
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:23,780
stretch for for me, because I'm
being introduced, over the last

1259
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:26,300
couple of years to how
conservative I am. In some

1260
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,180
levels, I always thought myself
as this liberal, far out kind of

1261
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:32,000
guy, but I realized, in my own
way, I have my, I wouldn't say,

1262
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,120
blind spots, but natures of
being conservative that that

1263
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,240
really know, being challenged
stretched open and going, Wow,

1264
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:43,600
this is fantastic. And one of
these is the just the generous

1265
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,960
courage of writing a book like
this, because you know this from

1266
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,640
the traditional admonitions, He
who knows does not speak, He who

1267
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,400
speaks does not know. And so
here you are. You're speaking

1268
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,900
all over the place, and I used
to really question it. And then,

1269
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,520
you know. The beautiful book by
me. Je Rinpoche, if you haven't

1270
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,160
read it, in love with the world
amongst journey through the

1271
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:08,940
Bardo life and death. It's an
amazing journey of his intimate

1272
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:13,380
sharing that is profoundly
inspiring. Your book. Vi, in

1273
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,860
certain sense, violates the code
of secrecy, but I think we're

1274
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:20,600
living in unusual times that
require unusual slash extreme

1275
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:25,880
measures. And so I, for one,
really applaud your courage that

1276
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:28,940
you are you are stretching the
boundaries in so many levels, in

1277
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:32,420
terms of pedagogy, radical
innovations and path and also

1278
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:36,740
courage and sharing. And so you
were about to say something, I

1279
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:39,320
want to return to what you're
about to say, but I really

1280
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,760
deeply thank you for that,
because the other tradition, to

1281
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:47,380
Kuhn Rinpoche said sharing
experiences inappropriately, and

1282
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:51,940
that's the key, is like being in
a dark cave with a candle and

1283
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:56,920
giving your candle away, you're
left in the dark. Opportunity is

1284
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:01,020
transformed into obstacle. And
so I this is both an applause

1285
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:04,260
for what you're doing and
perhaps a commentary elicited

1286
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:08,700
from you in terms of inviting
more and more of the sharing so

1287
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,060
that people can realize there is
a chorus of sanity coming out.

1288
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,240
Yeah, radical, innovative,
innovative ways of learning.

1289
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:19,080
Chris Bache: So yeah, I had to
really face resistance around

1290
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:22,640
that too, because Buddhism,
traditionally, you don't talk

1291
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:26,120
about your experiences. You
know, you really don't talk. It

1292
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:30,140
can become an encumbrance on you
to talk about your experiences.

1293
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:38,240
But you know, I'm a teacher. I
love to teach. I was designed to

1294
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:45,460
teach. I'm a yacker. I I love
to, yeah, you know, I just,

1295
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:49,660
that's what I love to do. And as
I said at the in that coming off

1296
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:53,620
the mountain chapter, it wasn't
simply the imbalance of toward

1297
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:57,220
Transcendence which made me sick
coming off the mountain. It was

1298
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:01,560
the silence that I had to live
with, because, as a philosopher

1299
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:04,920
of religion, I had had the most
powerful philosophical

1300
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,340
experiences of my life, and I
wasn't allowed to talk about

1301
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:11,340
them. I wasn't allowed to share
with them. I wasn't allowed to

1302
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:16,620
do my job, which and to do my
job as an academic, because of

1303
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:22,160
our phobia, our laws around
psychedelics and that holding

1304
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:27,620
that information literally makes
you sick inside. You know I

1305
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:31,940
wasn't allowed to be who I truly
am, and writing the book was

1306
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:36,320
part of my own self healing, and
beginning to speak about it is

1307
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:40,160
part of my own self healing. And
at the same time, having said

1308
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:47,980
that, I have no agenda
whatsoever. I I'm not. I have no

1309
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:51,880
I'm not trying to persuade
anybody. I don't have an ax to

1310
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:56,680
grind. I've got nothing to sell.
I'm I'm an old man. You know,

1311
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:02,700
I'm 72 years old. The end of the
diving board is getting close.

1312
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:10,140
Thank goodness. This being that
I am is so ephemeral, is so

1313
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:15,720
short lived. I have no
attachment to it, and certainly

1314
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:19,620
no attachment of using it as a
model of anything. But I love to

1315
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:23,420
teach, and I hope that the
experiences will be useful to

1316
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:26,600
other people, even if they never
take any psychedelics

1317
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:31,760
whatsoever. I hope that the
vision of the universe and the

1318
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,940
vision of the intelligence of
the universe will resonate

1319
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:39,560
deeply with the people's inner
experiences and their cognitive

1320
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:43,900
experiences as science becomes
more aggressive in pushing its

1321
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:48,880
own boundaries, but I hope it
will speak to people, whether or

1322
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:54,700
not they ever take any
psychedelics, because I think we

1323
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:59,200
are at a pivot point. We are
just we're coming out of this

1324
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,460
terrible period of history where
we believe that there's no

1325
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:05,580
intelligence to the universe,
that it's all an accident, that

1326
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:10,140
it's all a mechanistic rule of
the genetic dice, and there's no

1327
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:13,320
real intelligence to the
existential circumstances that

1328
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:17,880
we confront. And I think this is
being exploded, and we're waking

1329
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:21,380
up and suddenly we're it's like
a veil is being lifted. We're

1330
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:25,040
waking up to a world in which
reincarnation is a fundamental

1331
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:31,100
fact of life. It's a fact of
nature. We're waking up to to

1332
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,660
truly an emergent intelligence
in the universe, which

1333
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:39,200
everywhere we look, whether it's
in the solar system, in

1334
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:43,540
galaxies, in the genetic code.
Everywhere we look, we are

1335
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:48,520
seeing orders and orders and
orders of intelligence. And this

1336
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:52,180
is simply accelerating that
immersion into that

1337
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:57,640
intelligence, and that opens up
a whole new I think this is a

1338
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:00,900
pivot point that we're coming
into in. And you know, it

1339
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:04,740
couldn't happen a minute too
soon, because we are about to go

1340
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,900
extinct if we don't change.

1341
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,600
Andrew Holecek: It really
reminds me, Chris, of what the

1342
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:14,580
ecology scientists talk about is
punctuated equilibrium. Things,

1343
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:18,480
simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer,
simmer, and then they sudden,

1344
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,560
flip some certain way. It's like
what you said so beautifully in

1345
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,320
the book that gestation takes a
long time. Birth happens

1346
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,500
quickly. And so when I look at
the 50,000 foot view, what I'm

1347
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,680
seeing here is exactly what
you're intimating, that that

1348
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:33,500
correlative, like the Taoist
say, correlative with the dark,

1349
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:36,080
is the emergence of light. And
in direct proportion to the

1350
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:40,100
insanity, are voices of sanity
coming in. And so if we can

1351
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:44,440
relate, it's like they say in
Tantra, hell is paradise, that

1352
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:48,040
the greater the obstacle, the
greater the opportunity. And

1353
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:51,820
voices like yours and others
that are actually coming up in

1354
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:55,240
this ocean of tremendous dark
edge talk about the Kali Yuga

1355
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:00,480
really lend credibility to this
CO emergent principle that if we

1356
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:04,260
simply look properly, voices
like yours and others, where

1357
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:07,560
you're just part of a chorus of
sanity coming up, just a chorus,

1358
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,500
and if we see that, then we then
we can. It's all about right

1359
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,200
view, isn't it? Like the Buddha
say that if we simply have the

1360
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,520
right view, that the greater the
obstacle, the greater the

1361
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,200
opportunity, then what you're
talking about is adding to that

1362
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:25,160
kind of view, and so I don't
want to draw too much of your

1363
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:28,640
time. I could talk to you for
the rest of this day, but with

1364
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,860
your permission, there's just a
few more things that, oh my

1365
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:36,740
gosh, I have to ask you sure one
is in this is a little bit, I

1366
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:39,080
mean, it's philosophical, but
it's interesting for most

1367
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,760
people. And I think this is for
you as well. When, when we say,

1368
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:45,100
oh, that's just theoretical,
that's philosophical, well, it

1369
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,800
may be so simply because it's
not your experience yet, but

1370
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,860
when it becomes your experience,
it's no longer theory, it's no

1371
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:54,460
longer philosophy, it's your
reality. And so one of the

1372
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:59,020
things that you talk about that
that again, challenges both

1373
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:05,700
Hindu and Buddhist approaches to
teleology, purpose on one level,

1374
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,120
as you know, the Tibetans talk
about Leela. The world is just

1375
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:13,860
play. The Tibetans talk about
Rolpa, just this divine play and

1376
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:18,300
dance without directionality,
without purpose, and so is it

1377
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:23,240
simply a matter of stepping out
of binary modes of thinking that

1378
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:26,840
is either that or the other and
switching to more. What do they

1379
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:32,600
call it? Dioletheism. This the
ability to hold different views

1380
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:36,260
concurrently. I think Jung
talked about this as well. So

1381
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:41,200
talk to us a little bit about
the emerging human which implies

1382
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:45,880
purpose, teleology ends the
Omega point. I mean, does that

1383
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:48,100
fit into your both your
experience and your

1384
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:50,500
understanding of what you went
through?

1385
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:55,540
Chris Bache: You know, I think
when some of the great masters

1386
01:37:55,540 --> 01:37:59,740
talk about life is leela, life
is play. Creation is Leela. It's

1387
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:04,560
a dance. I don't think they're
saying, of course, in any

1388
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:12,840
frivolous way, but I think what
they're saying is not

1389
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:16,380
necessarily that life doesn't
have an intelligence that is

1390
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:20,660
expressing itself in purposeful
activity, but they're saying

1391
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:25,820
that life isn't generated out of
compulsion, life is not

1392
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:30,140
generated out of necessity, that
life comes out of the fullness

1393
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:33,140
of being. It comes out of the
excess of being. It doesn't come

1394
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:37,160
out of a deficit of being. And
that there's an exuberant

1395
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:41,860
quality to life, and we express
this exuberant quality in this

1396
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:46,720
metaphor of a dance, because
dance is not compelled. We dance

1397
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:50,320
out of joy. We dance out of an
excess. We don't dance out of

1398
01:38:50,320 --> 01:39:04,020
necessity. I think the I think
when I you know, the theme of

1399
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:06,600
the future human, of the
emergence of the future human,

1400
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:12,180
was a completely unexpected
theme in my work, and it was one

1401
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:16,140
of the most consistent themes of
the work, and it became the

1402
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:19,560
context within which everything
else took place. And it

1403
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:23,240
eventually became the context in
which I understood my entire

1404
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:29,060
incarnation to be taking place.
It started in the 23rd session,

1405
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:32,180
and at the last time I
encountered it was in the 70th

1406
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:40,040
session. It was a consistent
thing, and it is. And here I

1407
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:46,180
would just suspend any theistic
notions of mechanistic intention

1408
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:50,500
or purposeful intent or
manipulative intent. I don't

1409
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:55,540
think in those categories, I
would hold onto an emergent

1410
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:59,500
understanding of a cosmology
that there is an innate quality

1411
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:02,220
which is. Emerging, we go
through these punctuated

1412
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:07,500
equilibriums, this these crisis
points and that there is a a

1413
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:13,560
genius at work in this which I
don't begin to understand. The

1414
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:18,960
you know how this works. What I
will report is that in my

1415
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:25,520
sessions, when I dissolved into
this larger intelligence, which

1416
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,860
existentially, I was part of,
but cosmologically, was much

1417
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:36,800
larger than anything I could
relate to personally. It was It

1418
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:40,840
told me a story over and over
again, and it laid it out

1419
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:45,400
systematically, layer by layer,
without contradiction over years

1420
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:49,060
that humanity was coming to a
turning point. Humanity was

1421
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:53,200
approaching a critical time in
its evolutionary journey, a true

1422
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:58,180
before and after time that
there, that the karma of

1423
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,680
millennia was kind of rushing
into this valley. It's like

1424
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:05,520
multiple rivers pouring into a
canyon. There's nowhere for us

1425
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:14,820
to go except up. This is a
critical time and that, and it

1426
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:18,900
is a time in some way foreseen
by the great seers of history,

1427
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:23,360
by the great saints, by the
great spiritual geniuses of

1428
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:28,160
history, the great incarnations,
the great prophets, the great

1429
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:32,240
awakened ones that they that
they have seen this kind of

1430
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:35,840
coming forward. It's a vision
which is shared by indigenous

1431
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:43,720
peoples that we are coming into
this time and then 55 sessions,

1432
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:49,480
15 years or so into the work.
Now I have to back a bit, time

1433
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:53,560
became very porous to me in my
work. I mean, I was taken beyond

1434
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:58,000
linear time, multiple times, in
many different modalities, into

1435
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,580
what I call deep time. Deep time
is not eternity. It's not it's

1436
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:06,120
not timelessness. It's
experiencing different spans of

1437
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:10,260
time from within a different
frame of reference. And I was

1438
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:15,960
taken into deep time, and I was
taken into it, not as Chris

1439
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:21,020
Bache, because Chris Bache had
been dissolved long before, and

1440
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:27,080
I had been dissolved into the
human unconscious, into the

1441
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:31,400
human species mind. And I don't
know whether it was because of

1442
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,660
the work that I had given in the
ocean of suffering, whatever it

1443
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:42,160
was I was taken into the future
and experienced what I saw, what

1444
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:46,240
I experienced as the death and
rebirth of humanity, asked the

1445
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:51,520
human species a cataclysmic
period of history in which

1446
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:56,740
humanity was literally just
broken down. We lost control. We

1447
01:42:56,740 --> 01:43:01,440
were we were put through a
crushing historical process

1448
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:06,600
where all the all the
assumptions of the past broke

1449
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:11,880
down. We were literally brought
to our knees. We were reduced in

1450
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:16,800
the end to the challenge of mere
survival. It just we were

1451
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:23,840
stripped down. It was a terribly
excruciating experience, but

1452
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:28,100
when it was at its worst, when
it was at its peak, it was like

1453
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:33,560
a hurricane that passes over a
Pacific Island, suddenly, I

1454
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:37,280
began to experience it. Things
were beginning to get better.

1455
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:41,560
Things were beginning we there
were many, many people had died,

1456
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:47,320
but many survived, and the storm
began to pass. We began to pick

1457
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:52,180
ourselves up. We began to
reconnect, and as we did, when

1458
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:56,380
we did, we discovered that we
had been changed. This crisis

1459
01:43:56,380 --> 01:44:02,640
had changed us at our core. We
began to enact a living

1460
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:07,800
intelligence, an aliveness, that
we had discovered in the worst

1461
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:12,420
of this crisis. It was like this
crisis opened up our hearts and

1462
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:16,680
made us a more compassionate
species, and it opened up our

1463
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:19,920
mind, making us a more
intelligent species, able to

1464
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:26,000
integrate and access information
from the intelligence of the

1465
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:33,200
universe itself. As we began to
reconnect with each other, we

1466
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,860
began there was a snowballing
effect, so that just as there

1467
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:39,440
had been a breaking down and a
breaking down and a breaking

1468
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:43,300
down, there was an acceleration
of creativity, an acceleration

1469
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:48,160
of the actualization of values
that we had discovered in the

1470
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:52,840
worst of this crisis, where
everything felt new, everything

1471
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:56,320
there was a new set of values, a
new set of ideas, a new

1472
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:04,380
political reality emerged, a new
social reality emerged. Later, I

1473
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:09,780
was given more instructions on
the mech, some of the mechanisms

1474
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:15,120
that are involved, and
instructions and teachings on

1475
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:19,920
that. This is a shift which is
taking place at the center of

1476
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:24,980
the collective psyche without
going into too many layers of

1477
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:29,720
the discussion. Now this is not
simply a shift in the political

1478
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:34,400
arena or the social arena or
economic arena. It is a shift in

1479
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:39,260
the core substructure of the
human psyche, a shift in the

1480
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:44,500
architecture of the collective
psyche, and we've been just as

1481
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:47,740
we collect all our experiences
over many incarnations at the

1482
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:51,280
soul level. The human species
has been collecting and

1483
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,580
integrating its experiences at
the collective level, at the

1484
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:58,660
unconscious, collective psyche
level. And what's happening now

1485
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:02,760
is that we are pivoted. We're
poised to make a pivot in the

1486
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:06,540
collective psyche, and that
after we make this pivot, all

1487
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:11,220
human beings born will be
operating within the context of

1488
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:15,360
a literally, of a different
collective psyche. And I think

1489
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:20,160
we see the prototype of this
psyche in Christ, in Buddha, in

1490
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:23,660
Muhammad, in these awakened
beings who we have been trying

1491
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:27,980
to emulate for generations and
generations, beings with

1492
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:33,380
expanded hearts, with expanded
compassion, with expanded deeper

1493
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:36,800
insights into the universe. They
speak differently. They don't

1494
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,300
work the way ordinary people
work. They are different kinds

1495
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:44,080
of being, and I think we are
becoming a different kind of

1496
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:49,060
being, at least. That's the
consistent message that comes

1497
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,920
through my work over and over
again.

1498
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:56,800
Andrew Holecek: It's literally
breathtaking. Chris, a few with

1499
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,040
your confirmation, I have to
bring you back at some point,

1500
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,220
because we haven't, I wouldn't
say we haven't gotten to the

1501
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:05,700
goodies. Oh my gosh, it's been
so rich. Your chapter on the

1502
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:10,620
diamond Luminosity blew my socks
off. Your chapter on coming from

1503
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,680
down from the mountain was
brought me to tears. I have to

1504
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:16,200
bring you back to talk about
that, because I don't want to

1505
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:20,960
dilute the impact of what you're
saying by trying to do a shotgun

1506
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:25,700
of I mean, how do you distill 20
years of unbelievable insight to

1507
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,240
even two hours of conversation?
And so to whatever extent I have

1508
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:31,880
been able to, I wanted to
concentrate on a couple heart

1509
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:34,700
essence points. Add a little
water to them so we could

1510
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:38,540
understand them without
capitulating to my near frenetic

1511
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:40,840
predisposition to like, oh my
gosh, I have to talk to him

1512
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:41,560
about this, right?

1513
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,320
Chris Bache: We'd be going,
you're doing a great job. You're

1514
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,420
hitting really important topics.

1515
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,940
Andrew Holecek: We'd be going at
this my point, but I wanted

1516
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,900
there's a couple of things
before we close for today that I

1517
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:56,260
want to return to, that that I
think are somewhat important, at

1518
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:00,480
least they are to me. And two
things here. One is, your

1519
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:08,460
journey seems to imply a type of
attainment. In other words,

1520
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:14,340
you're alluding to extraordinary
states. And I'm not contesting

1521
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:18,300
that at all, but I'm wondering
if the languaging, the branding,

1522
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:21,800
so some of the things that
occurred to me, using somewhat

1523
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:26,300
marketing methods is one thing
that needs to happen is this

1524
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:29,300
whole thing needs to be
rebranded, this whole LSD thing,

1525
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:34,580
the branding thing is really so
contaminated with histories that

1526
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:38,300
we need to rebrand it as
entheogenic practice or

1527
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:40,540
whatever. But the other thing
that needs perhaps to be

1528
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:44,080
rebranded. And this is just me.
I'm curious how this lands with

1529
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:50,260
you. Is there seems to be this
intimation that you have a left

1530
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:52,960
conventional reality on what
level you have and attain the

1531
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,500
state that are extraordinary?
But is it, in fact, Chris, just

1532
01:48:56,500 --> 01:49:00,520
as viable, if not more so, to
say that this is the

1533
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,440
extraordinary state. In other
words, this is the non ordinary

1534
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:07,980
state, Samsara, and that what
you're actually doing in your

1535
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:11,220
journey is, is, this is a
narrative that keeps coming over

1536
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:15,000
and over. I loved it, the
narrative of opening, receiving,

1537
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,860
surrendering, and maybe for next
time, not only opening the mind,

1538
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:22,220
but just as much. Again, in
tantric languaging, the

1539
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:25,880
unbelievable importance of
opening the body and so as a

1540
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:29,180
consequence of opening. And you
mentioned this so many times, I

1541
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:33,920
was curious how often you said
this, dropping. You open, you

1542
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:37,760
drop. So it's not a journey of
ascent, so much as it is a

1543
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:42,220
waking down into really. What
are ordinary states that that

1544
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:46,360
when you relax properly and have
the capacity to be so open, what

1545
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:49,360
you're talking about is
completely ordinary that you're

1546
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,840
not really going anywhere.
You're simply relaxing deeply

1547
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:55,360
into the right here and now. And
so the reason I say this, Chris

1548
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:58,420
is because one thing that they I
think could be a little bit

1549
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:01,020
intimidating for people, is, Oh,
my. Gosh, I can never do that. I

1550
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:04,920
could never attain that that's
so far removed. I think if, if

1551
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:07,440
you look at it in this different
way, and I'm curious, if this

1552
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:11,400
lands with you, it empowers the
immediacy of what you're talking

1553
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:17,040
about, that that fundamentally,
this is the nature of the mind,

1554
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:21,260
this is the nature of the human
and even trans human condition.

1555
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:26,360
And so talk to us a little bit
about the, the the almost the

1556
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:30,140
false note, the false notion of
path. Because even the notion of

1557
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:33,260
path needs to be rebranded here,
because that implies you need to

1558
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:36,740
go somewhere else. And in the
very striving you actually

1559
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:40,060
ironically leave what you're
trying to attain. Yeah, no, the

1560
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:43,000
whole notion of like you attain
enlightenment, that's actually

1561
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,460
an oxymoron. You cannot attain
enlightenment. There are

1562
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:48,640
mutually exclusive terms, so a
lot of noodles against the wall,

1563
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:51,760
but I think important ones,
because it also ties into the

1564
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:55,120
last thing I wanted to say here
is you also use the phrase a

1565
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:59,140
number of times of coming and
going. In other words, you enter

1566
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:02,040
the state. You left it, you
entered it, you left it. That

1567
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:07,620
also means a return to some kind
of source. So I'm wondering

1568
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:10,080
about the relationship here
again. I know I'm tossing a lot

1569
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,040
out the relationship between
source and essence, and the

1570
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:18,480
relationship of all this to
recognition. That is, in fact,

1571
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,740
recognition not the central
message here that if you simply

1572
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:24,740
open your mind and heart,
irrespective of the means,

1573
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:29,000
meditative, pharmacological or
whatever, if you simply open and

1574
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,200
recognize everything that seems
to be intimated here is, oh,

1575
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:35,960
geez, I need to do this 20 year
journey to attain this.

1576
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:41,140
Provisionally, maybe yes, but
absolutely no, it's right here

1577
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:45,880
right now. You just need to open
your eyes, divine eyes, and it's

1578
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:46,840
been here all along.

1579
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:55,300
Chris Bache: Yeah, I absolutely
agree with you, in fact. Well,

1580
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:00,780
let me back up, and there's a
lot there. I'm sorry, yeah, in

1581
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:04,680
the early stages of the journey,
there is a subjective sense as

1582
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:07,800
one moves into psychic level
reality and subtle level

1583
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:11,400
reality, there is a subjective
sense of opening becoming

1584
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:15,720
larger, opening and becoming
larger. And that's why I think

1585
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:19,500
psychedelics were named mind
opening. It is a sensation of

1586
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:24,560
opening the mind, late in the
journey, later at a more

1587
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,920
advanced stage, when I was
working at what Stan would call

1588
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:32,060
causal level reality. Yeah, we
can as well. Yeah, everything

1589
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:36,500
reversed. I had the experience
that my mind, everything was

1590
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:42,700
converging. I was in very, very
large states of consciousness,

1591
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:46,420
very, very high energy. But
instead of going deeper into

1592
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:49,900
those states, all everything was
converging back to right here,

1593
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:53,920
right now. My my sessions were
getting harder to describe

1594
01:52:54,100 --> 01:53:01,200
because they they were so taking
place inside ordinary reality. I

1595
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:04,020
wasn't being taken outside.
Everything was converging, and I

1596
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:07,500
began to think, Oh, my God, have
we really misclassified what

1597
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:10,740
these substances are. They're
not mind openers, they're mind

1598
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:15,300
concentrators, absolutely. And I
think what happens is, at

1599
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:19,500
different levels of reality, the
subjective experience changes

1600
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:24,020
from opening to a concentration,
or it may be the case that the

1601
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:27,860
consciousness orchestrating My
experience was bringing me back

1602
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:33,320
into what would more be
recognized as a more classical

1603
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:37,580
kind of spiritual awakening. But
the core is that it's really

1604
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:44,500
simply the case a sashin is you
turn your mind and you focused

1605
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:48,820
on the present, you eliminate
the outside, and you go right

1606
01:53:48,820 --> 01:53:53,380
here, right now. And when you do
that, this purification process

1607
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:58,420
happens, of course, but where
you end up at the end is simply

1608
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:02,580
where you were in the beginning,
but with fewer distortions. Yes,

1609
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:06,960
Elliot, yeah. And you're just
cleaning, you're cleaning the

1610
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,200
makyo, you're cleaning the
distortions. But there's no

1611
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:16,080
place to go. There's no place
else to go to, except where you

1612
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:20,660
already are, and there's nothing
to become except what you

1613
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:24,800
already are and always have
been. You don't you know that

1614
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:29,180
reality, which doesn't begin, it
doesn't end. There's no turning

1615
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:32,240
on, there's no turning off.
There is only the relaxing into

1616
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:38,120
what has always been right here,
right now. And I think that's

1617
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:42,880
that is true on at least it was
true in my experience in the

1618
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:50,200
psychedelic path, I don't think
anything that I'm describing is

1619
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:53,920
original. I think everything
that I've described in the book

1620
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,100
can be found in the spiritual
literature of the mystical

1621
01:54:57,100 --> 01:55:02,640
traditions, the contemplative
traditions. The cosmology that

1622
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:06,960
emerges in psychedelic research
is not a new cosmology. It's an

1623
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:11,700
old cosmology. It's it's only
new in the context of its

1624
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:17,460
emergence, and it leaves you, I
say, you know, in somewhere in

1625
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:21,920
the end stages of the book, like
the only thing which is of value

1626
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:29,540
to me in the psychedelic work is
purification, purification and

1627
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:35,960
just purification, and it
because it brings us into a more

1628
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:42,640
intimate experience of what
already is. And by some silly

1629
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:48,940
nonsense, we keep ourselves out
of the joy of this deep and

1630
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:54,280
profound reality that is living
in us, that is us that is

1631
01:55:54,280 --> 01:56:00,060
expressing itself. So I
absolutely agree with you. I uh,

1632
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:07,140
yeah, it's yeah, it's just
purifying. That's all.

1633
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:13,680
Andrew Holecek: And again, the
not that this brings validity to

1634
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:17,520
what you're saying, other than
the validity to my world, is we

1635
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:21,200
come and learn and understand
things in terms of other things,

1636
01:56:21,380 --> 01:56:26,360
yeah, technological knowing and
so what brought such deep, deep

1637
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:30,920
resonance was, wow, here's an
amazing individual who's taken

1638
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:36,980
an entirely new path that is so
resonant with my path, and

1639
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:40,580
again, completely aware of the
hubris of saying my Path

1640
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:43,480
betokens the truth, and
therefore yours is true because

1641
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:47,980
it relates to mine, right?
Subtle self aggrandizement there

1642
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:50,620
is actually not so subtle,
right? I think your stuff is

1643
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:55,840
true because it resonates with
my trip, totally aware of that,

1644
01:56:56,260 --> 01:57:00,940
yeah. But with that said,
there's so many resonances the

1645
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:04,080
notion of purification as you
know you're and this is what the

1646
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:10,440
question I wanted to ask you,
how, as we start to close up for

1647
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:15,360
today, one of the chapters or
sections that really spoke to

1648
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:19,140
me, of course, somewhat
previewed by what I just said

1649
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:24,800
was your interjection of the
path of Vajrayana, that and how

1650
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:29,000
that is now perhaps create,
creating a, again, a holding

1651
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:34,040
environment to support augment
transition in more and this you

1652
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:37,880
understand, hopefully, the
question in more Organic means

1653
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,400
more phenomenological versus
neurological means, so called

1654
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:47,200
traditional methods. And so as
we start to wrap up for today,

1655
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:50,500
because I want to give people
something to take home, like,

1656
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:54,040
how can they use this work with
this? And I have one follow up

1657
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:57,160
there, but what has been the
role, and continues to be the

1658
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:02,880
role of both meditation and the
Vajrayana to augment, support,

1659
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,060
enhance, stabilize what you've
gone through.

1660
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,800
Chris Bache: Well, one of the
gifts that came out of my

1661
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:21,800
psychedelic experiences was a
deepened appreciation of the

1662
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:27,320
power and effectiveness of
classic spiritual contemplative

1663
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:34,820
practices, and including the
Vajrayana practices, by becoming

1664
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:39,680
sort of temporarily more aware,
I was able to appreciate more

1665
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:45,760
deeply how these practices were
affecting my body and how they

1666
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:52,900
were affecting my mind, even
though, and they also helped me

1667
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,020
manage some of the challenges
that I was running into,

1668
01:58:56,020 --> 01:59:01,380
because, remember, I wasn't
doing this work, or I didn't end

1669
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:05,040
up doing this work for the
purpose of spiritual awakening,

1670
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:08,160
though that was always there in
the background. But I was doing

1671
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:12,780
it to explore the universe as a
philosopher hungry to explore

1672
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:18,780
the nature of reality. But the
Vajrayana practices helped me

1673
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:23,120
manage the excess of energy that
was having was being flowing

1674
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:28,580
through my body by giving it an
intermediate place to live and

1675
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:33,020
breathe that was like in between
my physical existence and my

1676
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:37,100
psychedelic existence, there was
This Vajrayana practice space

1677
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:44,980
that, of course, taught me that
these pop these practices, are

1678
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:49,000
much more powerful than I had
appreciated, or I might have

1679
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,060
appreciated just from working
with them, from my ordinary

1680
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:56,020
time, space consciousness, I
also came to appreciate that

1681
01:59:56,020 --> 02:00:00,540
these practices are empowered by
the Morphic field. Which have

1682
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:04,380
been generated by 1000s and
1000s of beings doing these

1683
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:07,860
practices for hundreds and
hundreds of years. The power of

1684
02:00:07,860 --> 02:00:12,960
transmission the lung when a
practice is given, it's not just

1685
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:16,200
to maintain the formal purity
the practice, but there truly is

1686
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:20,660
an energetic transmission, and
the power of this practice draws

1687
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:24,860
upon the cumulative power that
is set in motion by 1000s of

1688
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:32,360
beings using these practices
over many, many years. Now, I

1689
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:35,360
don't know whether to describe
myself as a Vajrayana

1690
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:41,380
practitioner today, because
while I do practice and I do

1691
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:50,440
meditate. The focus of my
practice is different. In some

1692
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:59,620
ways. The focus of my practice
is actually speaking. There is a

1693
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:05,940
way in which when I speak about
these things, I remember them,

1694
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:10,020
when I remember them, they
become actualized within me.

1695
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:14,100
When they become actualized
within me, my mind shifts, my

1696
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:21,080
body shifts. Everything shifts
inside of me. And so actually

1697
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:23,420
for me, this wonderful
discussion that we've been

1698
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:30,020
having, and I really, really
appreciate the deep, engaged

1699
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:33,080
quality of the questions you've
been asking me and where you've

1700
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:38,660
been taking us. For me, this is
like a spiritual practice. For

1701
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:43,720
me, your your questions give me
the opportunity to open in ways

1702
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:47,080
that I wouldn't ordinary. I
wouldn't be open in today

1703
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:53,020
otherwise, in that context, as
part of my ongoing effort to

1704
02:01:55,480 --> 02:02:00,300
simply to be useful to the
universe. I practice. I do my

1705
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:07,620
practices, but I don't practice
with the intention of trying to

1706
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:11,460
accomplish something beautiful,
and I don't practice with the

1707
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:16,620
intention of changing what's
going to happen to me when I

1708
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:21,920
die. Now it may be arrogant to
say this, but I just report that

1709
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:25,940
I have a sense of what's going
to open to me when I die,

1710
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:30,140
because I've been there. I've
been there, different ways, been

1711
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:35,120
there, done that, and the
universe has has made promises

1712
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:37,880
to me, and I don't think the
promises are false. I think

1713
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:42,940
they're just very matter of
fact, and so I don't practice in

1714
02:02:42,940 --> 02:02:48,340
order to change what's going to
happen to me when I die. I

1715
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:54,820
practice to change how I am
right now, and to try to be of

1716
02:02:54,820 --> 02:03:02,340
more use to people right now. So
to kind of declare my system to

1717
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:09,420
clear my system to remember,
yeah, and I use my psychedelic

1718
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:14,460
memories in my Vajrayana
practice. You know, in Vajrayana

1719
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:18,660
there's the Samaya sattva and
the chinana sattva, the being of

1720
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:23,900
practice which attracts the
being of reality. And so we do

1721
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:27,920
these visualizations and
exercises and mudras in order to

1722
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:31,400
create something which is an
approximation of an eternal

1723
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:35,180
principle, by virtue of which we
draw that principle into our

1724
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:44,500
being. Well, I use my memories
as Samaya sattva in the creation

1725
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:51,460
of Samaya sattva in order to
open the channels to the Jnana

1726
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:56,920
sattva of these principles in
reality. And that, to me, is

1727
02:03:56,920 --> 02:04:02,700
just, this is a this is a
natural process. So I do the

1728
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:06,960
Vajrayana practices, but I do
them with my own particular kind

1729
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:12,960
of twist. And understandably,
it's hard to find a teacher who

1730
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:17,640
is comfortable with somebody
who's owns a psychedelic history

1731
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:18,720
the way I own mine.

1732
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,820
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, and maybe,
maybe that needs to change and

1733
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:25,400
adapt. I mean, and who are we to
say that? Talk about the

1734
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:28,280
arrogance of that. Because, as
you know, Chris and I'm so glad

1735
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:31,220
to hear you say this, there
actually have been in the wisdom

1736
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:35,840
traditions admonitions, a
warning against originality.

1737
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:40,100
That's very interesting to me,
that originality is somewhat

1738
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:44,560
suspicious. And I find that a
very interesting statement. On

1739
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:48,700
one level, yes, it abides by the
elegance, the beauty of the

1740
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:52,000
tradition, and on one level, the
sort of irreducibility,

1741
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,580
irreducibility of the awakened
mind that's already been

1742
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:58,420
discovered. And I think if it's
related to properly, that can

1743
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:02,700
prevent rogue and. Uh, science
and the like. But on another

1744
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:06,720
level, if we don't evolve, we're
going to go extinct. If we don't

1745
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:10,200
bring we meaning the wisdom
traditions as a representative

1746
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:14,340
of if we don't bring new
tributaries of upaya, skillful

1747
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:18,780
means, cultural adaptations to
perennial traditions, then I

1748
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:21,260
think it's not going to be
applicable to the modern age,

1749
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:23,480
and it's just going to be
relegated to the dusty

1750
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:29,540
disciplines in dust bins, in old
stole stale churches. But just a

1751
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:33,320
couple of things here before we
close, because I don't want to

1752
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:37,400
take more advantage of your
time. We started with this

1753
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:41,440
notion, or I did with this
notion of hyper objects, top

1754
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:46,960
issues, topics, phenomena that
are so big it's hard to wrap

1755
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:50,380
one's mind around that. You
know, I always say stretching is

1756
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:53,800
good for growth. This has been a
journey of a mental yoga, yeah,

1757
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:58,660
and I'm wondering if Is it too
ostentatious to talk about. And

1758
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:03,180
I so appreciate your your
humility, your modesty, but

1759
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:07,620
there's also tremendous power
that you're releasing, that you

1760
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:11,700
are a shaman to, that you were
expressing, and I so appreciate

1761
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:17,340
I've never really related to
this is is also speaking as

1762
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:20,780
practice. Dialog is practice,
engaging in what we're doing

1763
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:25,700
here is path that's really
beautiful. But would you say, or

1764
02:06:25,700 --> 02:06:29,540
is it fair to say that you're
also pointing towards and this

1765
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:32,660
connects to your book, the
living classroom, hyper

1766
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:37,160
pedagogy? Are you, in fact,
intimating a possibility for

1767
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:41,740
accelerated forms of learning?
And I resonate with this deeply,

1768
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:44,920
because when I explore what I
call the nocturnal meditations,

1769
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:48,580
Dream Yoga and the like, one of
the reasons I'm so passionate

1770
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:51,760
about these practices is because
they are a revolution in

1771
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:55,540
pedagogy. It's a way to use the
mind and the nocturnal arena to

1772
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:57,820
really accelerate learning,
because you're working with

1773
02:06:57,820 --> 02:07:02,460
these foundational dimensions
and so is it fair to say, based

1774
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:06,540
on what your experience, that
what you're also pointing to are

1775
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:10,020
possibilities for hyper
pedagogical approaches where we

1776
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:13,800
can, in fact, accelerate our
evolution, if it's held within

1777
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:16,500
the right view, within the right
set and setting, within the

1778
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:19,800
right container, that we can
really ramp things up in a

1779
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:24,560
healthy way, with a boat, again,
with a Bodhisattva ideal, and

1780
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:27,140
the motivations and all the
parameters of safety and

1781
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:30,620
security, because the faster you
go, this isn't the essence of

1782
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:34,880
the Vajrayana. It's a jet versus
a car. Jets can crash. Cars are

1783
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:38,840
safer, but they're slower. Is
that a fair thing to say that if

1784
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:41,680
we relate to this properly, what
you're also pointing out here is

1785
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:45,100
not only just hyper objects, but
hyper pedagogical approaches.

1786
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:48,640
Chris Bache: I think so, yeah,
you know, in the living

1787
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:53,140
classroom, I don't mention
psychedelics at all. I wanted

1788
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:56,680
this book to be about fields of
consciousness and the effects of

1789
02:07:56,680 --> 02:08:01,560
fields on learning and the
accelerating effect of focused

1790
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:05,820
intentionality and energetic
transmission that takes place in

1791
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:09,840
the classroom or in any group
context. And I don't talk about

1792
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:14,580
psychedelics at all. But the
backstory to that book is this,

1793
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:18,900
I was doing my private
psychedelic so called Private

1794
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:21,800
psychedelic practice. I was
opening up into the ocean of

1795
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:24,740
suffering. I was going into
these very, very deep collective

1796
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:28,100
states of consciousness and
eventually into deeper, you

1797
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:31,580
know, Transcendence, states of
consciousness. I never talked to

1798
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:35,600
my students about it, but I
found that my students began to

1799
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:40,600
be impacted by my work in very
precise ways. When I was going

1800
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:44,080
through certain thresholds. They
began to go through certain

1801
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:49,900
spiritual thresholds. And it
began to happen when I was

1802
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:52,900
lecturing, nothing to do with
psychedelics, just lecturing on

1803
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:57,280
world religions, just something,
and I would be looking for some

1804
02:08:57,700 --> 02:09:04,800
example to use to make a point.
And I experienced a door open in

1805
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:08,460
the back of my mind the way it
first happened, and this little

1806
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:11,460
piece of paper slipped into I
read the piece of paper, and it

1807
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:16,380
was an idea of something to use,
and I tried it, and when I tried

1808
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:19,560
it, all of a sudden, the energy
in the room shifted, and

1809
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:24,980
everything became more animated,
and I began to work consciously

1810
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:30,380
with these kind of subtle
suggestions that would pop into

1811
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:37,940
my mind from seemingly nowhere.
And then few years down the

1812
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:41,980
road, students started to come
to me, and they said at the end

1813
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:44,980
of class, you know, it's strange
that you said what you said

1814
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:48,100
today, or gave this example,
because this is exactly what

1815
02:09:48,100 --> 02:09:51,880
happened to me this week, or
this is exactly what happened to

1816
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:54,760
my mother. And at first I
dismissed it, and I thought,

1817
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:59,920
okay, but it kept happening, and
it kept happening, and the deep.

1818
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:06,540
My psychedelic practice went. It
began to happen more, but it

1819
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:11,280
also began to touch deeper areas
of their life. It was as if

1820
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:14,880
their soul was slipping messages
to my soul, which was slipping

1821
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:19,920
it to me, leading me to say
things that were giving them

1822
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:24,440
information or touching very
intimate places in their life

1823
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:29,300
that I had no way of personally
knowing about, experiences that

1824
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:35,060
places that they needed healing
or information that they needed

1825
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:39,140
to take the next step in their
learning, and this was became

1826
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:44,140
such a characteristic part of my
teaching, so many people were

1827
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:48,940
being moved in ways that were
beyond my conscious intention

1828
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:53,680
and even beyond my awareness
when it was happening. And a

1829
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:57,940
pivot point came when I I looked
at my class one day and while I

1830
02:10:57,940 --> 02:11:03,300
was lecturing, and I looked up
and I saw a half dozen, 10

1831
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:07,680
people in the room with very
quietly tears rolling down their

1832
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:12,420
face, and I realize I've got to
understand what's happening. I

1833
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:19,140
really have to understand this.
And that's the entire book

1834
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:23,960
living classroom was downloaded
in 10 minutes in one session,

1835
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:27,380
the title just dropped right in.
And I had been wrestling with

1836
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:30,500
this idea, but it gave me all
the information I need to

1837
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:35,960
understand two basic points, but
all of the both of them hinge

1838
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:41,260
around the fundamental reality
that consciousness has an atomic

1839
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:46,960
quality, a separate quality, and
it has a quantum quality. So

1840
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:50,560
there is individual awareness.
And individual awareness is

1841
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:54,280
true. They don't know what I
know. They're here to get what I

1842
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:57,640
know. We give a test, and I can
test whether they have it, you

1843
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:01,500
know, that kind of stuff, but
there's a quantum reality, that

1844
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:06,480
my individual experience is
grounded in a quantum in an

1845
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:09,180
expansive field of
consciousness, and they are

1846
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:12,720
grounded in this expansive field
of consciousness, and that

1847
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:18,300
activates potentials, which are
entirely natural. It's like

1848
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:21,620
throwing a stone into the war
into a lake, and the ripples

1849
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:26,360
spread out. When one person does
deep clarifying work, it

1850
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:29,840
triggers clarification in the
consciousness of people that

1851
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:34,640
they have karma connection to.
It's a simple, simple natural

1852
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:43,420
phenomenon. So I think what I
eventually wrote down and

1853
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:49,360
clarified was, what would it be
like if we taught consciously in

1854
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:53,320
a Transpersonal pedagogy, or in
an integral pedagogy, or in a

1855
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:59,020
pedagogy that recognize the the
innate interconnectivity of

1856
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:03,300
consciousness, which doesn't
mean that we abandon the

1857
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:06,780
individual strategies that we
know and work so well, but we

1858
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:13,920
incorporate using strategies of
focused intentionality, of of

1859
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:17,640
conscious of conscious
engagement that goes beyond

1860
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:23,420
classical teaching, so that, for
example, you know Chud as a

1861
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:28,280
Vajrayana practice. It's a
purification practice. And I

1862
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:32,120
learned Chud and I was doing ch
for my spiritual practice. I

1863
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:37,580
began before class even began,
when I would get a roster of the

1864
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:43,540
students for my class, I would
start incorporating this roster

1865
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:47,260
in my ch practice. I would
literally pray for my students

1866
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:51,640
using this particular vehicle. I
would pray for them, and I pray

1867
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:55,540
for them through the entire
course, for their well being.

1868
02:13:55,540 --> 02:14:00,180
Not I don't try to. It's not my
job to think I know what's right

1869
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:02,400
for them, or what they should be
doing, or anything like that. I

1870
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:09,420
simply pray for their well
being. I think the more we kind

1871
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:15,540
of activate these latent
potentials in groups, the more

1872
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:19,320
we accelerate learning. And I
found it's not only the there's

1873
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:22,880
not only a collective field in
the room, but there is a class

1874
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:27,500
field. But even deeper than that
is the course field, that there

1875
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:33,140
is a learning and empowerment
that takes place over years, so

1876
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:37,040
that the students you have the
individual mind situated within

1877
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:42,220
a class mind, situated within a
course mind. This is an

1878
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:46,360
absolutely once you see it, once
you understand it, you begin to

1879
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:49,300
recognize it happening in all
sorts of different contexts, in

1880
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:55,600
different places. So if there is
a hyper object, the hyper object

1881
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:59,800
is simply the connective tissue
of mind. It's that we are at

1882
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:04,500
all. Always, always inherently
connected, and we simply become

1883
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:08,880
conscious of that and become
responsible to it, yeah, in

1884
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:09,960
whatever we're doing,

1885
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:12,180
Andrew Holecek: yeah. And again,
it's back to that narrative of

1886
02:15:12,180 --> 02:15:15,480
making unconscious processes
processes and making unconscious

1887
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:20,360
processes conscious. Because if
you can do that, then you can

1888
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:24,320
increase levels of
communication, elicitation,

1889
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:29,240
evocative whatever, to then,
then really heighten that what

1890
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:33,560
is, what is already again, it's
already there. So why not take

1891
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:36,680
advantage of it? Why not engage
it? Why not make it, bring it

1892
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:39,200
into conscious awareness, pay
allegiance to it, surrender to

1893
02:15:39,260 --> 02:15:43,480
it, and therefore enhance it,
accelerate it in and of itself.

1894
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:47,380
And so Chris, I want to pay
homage to your time. I just a

1895
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:51,700
few last things, the famous last
words, wait a second, it'll be

1896
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:52,240
midnight.

1897
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:54,400
Chris Bache: Wait Chris, this is
fun.

1898
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:57,940
Andrew Holecek: I mean, I
literally, I could talk to you

1899
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:05,220
for the entire day. But to wrap
it up for now, people are what

1900
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:11,280
you're releasing here is a
Pandora's box of both wisdom and

1901
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:16,140
potential neurosis. And by this,
what I mean is I wonder if you

1902
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:20,960
worry about what you've released
here, because here's a little

1903
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:24,740
bit of where I want to close
with this is I can definitely

1904
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:31,880
hear or imagine listeners going,
this is for me. I This is my

1905
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:36,800
path. I want to do this. And
they may see this as a quick

1906
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:42,100
fix, as a lazy man's approach.
And of course, your book shows

1907
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:44,740
this is not for the feeble
minded or the feeble hearted.

1908
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:49,240
You have to this is jihad. This
is inner Dharma combat. You have

1909
02:16:49,240 --> 02:16:54,160
to really go to work here. So
what would you say, like Dharma

1910
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:57,760
surgeons General's warning,
these teachings are hazardous to

1911
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:01,320
your egoic health, right? So I
want to throw a little bit of a

1912
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:05,580
caveat to listeners who go, oh
heck, I don't need to go into

1913
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:08,520
retreat. I don't need to do a
three year retreat. I can just

1914
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:12,420
pop these pills and I'm going to
attain these states. And I knew

1915
02:17:12,420 --> 02:17:15,600
there was a quick silver bullet,
this is it. So you understand,

1916
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:19,260
it's a slightly extreme
rendering of this, but people

1917
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:21,860
glom onto these sorts of things,
and they're gonna run into them,

1918
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:26,420
run with them with wrong
motivation, with wrong intent.

1919
02:17:26,480 --> 02:17:31,520
So talk to us as we close here
several things. And this also

1920
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:34,100
ties into my experience. I have
not done this yet, but I've

1921
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:36,980
talked to people who've done
Ayahuasca retreats in Costa

1922
02:17:36,980 --> 02:17:40,280
Rica. They go down there. They
have these mind blowing

1923
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:45,160
experiences over four or five
planned medicine trips, and then

1924
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:47,920
they leave, and then they tell
me, I know these people. They

1925
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:50,800
go, it was great, but I don't
feel supported. They don't

1926
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:54,580
follow up with me. I'm left
completely to my own devices. I

1927
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:59,380
am like, what do I do with that?
Yeah. So as we close for today,

1928
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:03,240
again, lots of noodles, because
this topic is just so rich. Talk

1929
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:08,640
to us about like, if someone
came to you, would you act as an

1930
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:12,000
advisor? Or are there advisors
they can be drawn to? Do you

1931
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,900
take responsibility for this
Pandora's box of wisdom that

1932
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:19,740
you're releasing? What are the
shadow sides of doing this

1933
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:23,060
without proper sentence setting.
And so I know trying to close,

1934
02:18:23,060 --> 02:18:26,660
but I can't help myself. I think
this is important. We have to

1935
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:31,820
throw some caveats out there for
those who may be thinking that,

1936
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:35,180
ah, this is the long awaited
spiritual silver bullet. I'll

1937
02:18:35,180 --> 02:18:36,740
just pop these things and I'm
good to go.

1938
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:40,840
Chris Bache: Yeah, boy, no
silver bullet there. There are

1939
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:45,760
no shortcuts. In this one, I've
learned there are no shortcuts.

1940
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:51,700
There are intensifications of
practice, but there's no getting

1941
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:55,420
around the fundamental laws of
spiritual reality. You know that

1942
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:58,660
there's just no getting around
them? And the early idea that

1943
02:18:58,660 --> 02:19:03,720
psychedelics represented an easy
path. It just turned out to be

1944
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:09,960
facile and not true. In fact, my
concern is just the opposite. My

1945
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:14,340
concern is that if you use these
substances even conscientiously,

1946
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:20,180
they are, they can be so intense
that it's too demanding a path.

1947
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:24,080
It's just too demanding. You
have to really, really be wise

1948
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:30,860
in the in the handling of it.
I'm I was very concerned in

1949
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:34,880
sharing this material, because
it would break my heart if

1950
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:39,620
someone were to read my book and
then jump into some type of use

1951
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:43,000
of psychedelics and injure
themselves. And it's easy to

1952
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:47,140
injure yourselves, because you
you open, you can open so

1953
02:19:47,140 --> 02:19:52,000
deeply, so quickly that you
really can't handle everything

1954
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:56,740
that comes at you. And you can,
you can disrupt a healthy psyche

1955
02:19:57,100 --> 02:20:00,300
in ways that can be permanently
crippling, and it would. Break

1956
02:20:00,300 --> 02:20:05,520
my heart if somebody did that,
and I did a lot of practice, a

1957
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:14,280
spiritual practice around that
particular issue. What we're

1958
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:17,700
learning is that breaking
through, breaking the boundaries

1959
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:20,420
of the personal psyche, going
into deeper states of

1960
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:24,620
consciousness, is really not
that difficult. It's really not

1961
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:29,000
that hard. We're beginning to
see more and more attention

1962
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,340
being given to integration, the
requirements of integration,

1963
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:38,660
what constitutes a healthy
practice. And I offer myself as

1964
02:20:38,660 --> 02:20:41,740
an example of someone whose
practice was not entirely

1965
02:20:41,740 --> 02:20:45,220
healthy, I would think I went
too deep, and it's caused me

1966
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:54,700
years of kind of, I won't say,
distress, but years of having to

1967
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:56,680
manage

1968
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:10,500
uh, the joy that I had temporary
that I knew on a temporary

1969
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:16,800
basis. So and in it, one of the
reasons I left the suffering I

1970
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:19,320
you know, I didn't blunt the
suffering. In the book, there

1971
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:21,980
were people who were advising me
don't put that in, because

1972
02:21:21,980 --> 02:21:24,320
people are not going to get
scared. They're not going to

1973
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:27,500
understand it. One of the
reasons I put it in just because

1974
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:31,100
it was true and I promise to
give it an accurate account, but

1975
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:35,660
I put it in partly because I
wanted people to be able to

1976
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:40,480
understand how this stuff works,
how understands it. They are

1977
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:44,320
amplifiers. Amplifiers brings up
our garbage. It brings up our

1978
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:48,100
trash. We have to confront that
garbage, confront that trash.

1979
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:53,020
But even when we do that and do
that well, we still have to

1980
02:21:53,020 --> 02:21:56,860
manage the wisdom of
integration. There is a book

1981
02:21:56,860 --> 02:22:01,020
that was just published this
past year in England. It's inner

1982
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:05,040
tradition press psychedelics and
psychotherapy. And the focus of

1983
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:08,280
this book is really on
integration. And I have an essay

1984
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:12,780
in there with other people. My
essay is called the challenge of

1985
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:16,500
integrating an extreme
psychedelic journey, not simply

1986
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:21,620
in a psychedelic session, but an
extreme psychedelic journey. I

1987
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:25,040
think we need more essays like
that. We mean more discussions

1988
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:29,300
about what is good, what does
healthy psychedelic practice

1989
02:22:29,300 --> 02:22:33,560
look like? What are the symptoms
of imbalance in psychedelic

1990
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:39,200
practice? What is the symptom of
too much people chasing new

1991
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:42,220
experiences before they've
integrated the experiences that

1992
02:22:42,220 --> 02:22:47,080
they've had. I've seen many
students suffering. They've

1993
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:50,500
literally fried themselves.
Their energy feels very fried.

1994
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:53,500
They've gone back to the well
too many times. They've plugged

1995
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:58,120
into the universe at too high a
level. And they haven't stayed

1996
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:03,540
grounded. They feel kind of
crispy. They have paid a price,

1997
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:09,480
and some people truly have paid
a price of dysphoria and various

1998
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:12,000
types of imbalance,
psychological imbalance from

1999
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:16,680
entering into these states. So
the problem is, you see that our

2000
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:21,260
culture doesn't have a wisdom in
the use of psychedelics. Some

2001
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:24,680
indigenous cultures do the
shamanic cultures do have that

2002
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:29,360
wisdom. We have to learn from
them how to use these practices

2003
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:32,900
wisely. Right now, we're using
these practices within a

2004
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:36,680
therapeutic arena, and we are
drawing upon our therapeutic

2005
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:41,260
wisdom of how to integrate these
healing practices well. But as

2006
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:44,980
we go deeper, we have to go
beyond therapeutic wisdom. We

2007
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:48,400
have to go into shamanic wisdom.
We have to go into the sage

2008
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:52,600
tradition wisdoms, to really
learn how to integrate these

2009
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:57,640
practices. Well, having deep
experiences, it turns out, is

2010
02:23:57,640 --> 02:24:02,760
not that difficult, and it's not
necessarily very beneficial. It

2011
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:09,060
doesn't have a long lasting
effect. Juliana, of Norwich,

2012
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:14,760
English mystic, had one. She was
on her death bed. She was dying.

2013
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:17,460
She had a Near-Death Experience.
She had an experience of the

2014
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:21,740
love of Christ, and she had an
experience of the feminine God.

2015
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:26,000
She spent the rest of her life
meditating on it, and she

2016
02:24:26,060 --> 02:24:29,900
unpacked one experience in her
book, the revelations of divine

2017
02:24:29,900 --> 02:24:35,780
love. It takes years to unpack
the full potential that's

2018
02:24:35,780 --> 02:24:44,020
unleashed in even one
experience. So it would there.

2019
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:49,000
We have a lot to learn.
Hopefully, we will be wiser in

2020
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,780
this century with psychedelics
than we were in the last

2021
02:24:52,780 --> 02:24:57,520
century. In the 1960s where we
did a lot of psychedelics, we

2022
02:24:57,520 --> 02:25:01,620
had a lot of experiences, a lot
of. Breakthroughs, lot of cap,

2023
02:25:01,620 --> 02:25:04,980
some casualties, not as many as
popular press would have us

2024
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:09,060
believe. But did we change
people's lives profoundly and

2025
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:13,560
permanently? Some Yes, but not
as many as we thought. Would we

2026
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:19,380
would? I think we need to really
be wise and grounded in our

2027
02:25:19,380 --> 02:25:23,000
reappropriation of psychedelics.
Do you worry about what

2028
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,760
Andrew Holecek: you've released?
I mean, one thing that comes to

2029
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:29,240
mind here is, I spent a lot of
time in the Himalayas. I've

2030
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:34,100
tracked above Everest base camp.
I've seen a lot of high altitude

2031
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:37,460
sickness. And so on one level,
that's what this is like. It's

2032
02:25:37,460 --> 02:25:40,660
like I've seen this where, when
you're climbing to Everest,

2033
02:25:40,660 --> 02:25:44,500
you've got to spend two days in
Namche Bazaar, for instance, at

2034
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:48,280
12,000 feet to acclimatize. And
the people that don't, that

2035
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:50,800
don't acclimatize and go up,
they're the ones that get high

2036
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:54,940
altitude cerebral or pulmonary
edema and run into very serious

2037
02:25:54,940 --> 02:25:57,700
problems. And then the way they
have to cure it, as you know,

2038
02:25:58,180 --> 02:26:03,780
you get headache, you stop, you
go back down. You retreat to an

2039
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:07,560
altitude where the symptoms were
not there, and then you slowly

2040
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:10,200
work your way up, otherwise the
high altitude sickness, your

2041
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:15,660
lust for the summit, will kill
you. So do you sometimes worry,

2042
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:18,900
Chris, about again, what you
release? Because on one level,

2043
02:26:19,140 --> 02:26:22,040
this ties in so beautifully, I
think, to what we said, but I

2044
02:26:22,040 --> 02:26:24,080
said at the outset, because
that's why it's beautiful.

2045
02:26:25,340 --> 02:26:29,720
Because I said, is, this is a
form of Tantra, and it's

2046
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:35,360
interesting, is, I just wrote an
article for tart, is the West

2047
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:40,180
ready for tantra? And as a form
of Tantra, as you know, there

2048
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:43,480
are practices that are
prescription strength, TUMO,

2049
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:47,380
dark retreat. There are
practices that are does not

2050
02:26:47,380 --> 02:26:51,400
designed for public consumption
because they're too powerful.

2051
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:55,240
You're dealing with
thermonuclear power as it's

2052
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:58,060
embodied in your subtle body.
And so what you're talking about

2053
02:26:58,060 --> 02:27:01,380
here is the danger of what's
called salon practice, inner

2054
02:27:01,380 --> 02:27:07,620
yoga practice where the
condensed impact of your entire

2055
02:27:07,620 --> 02:27:11,640
cosmic history is ensconced in
your body and subtle body. And

2056
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:14,880
so when you're doing something
like this, as the danger with

2057
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:18,360
doing inner yogas, and this is
what your book screamed out to

2058
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:22,100
me. Said, Oh my gosh, Chris is
doing inner yoga here, and this

2059
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:26,300
is why, not only is he opening
his mind, he's opening his body.

2060
02:27:26,660 --> 02:27:30,140
And as the channels winds,
chakras are open and released,

2061
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:32,840
whoa, if you can't ride that
wind, you're going to be blown

2062
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:38,240
away by that wind. And so I see
this as a absolutely confluent

2063
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:41,800
with these prescription strength
tantric practices, yeah, if I'm

2064
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:44,800
not done with the proper
motivation, proper set in

2065
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:48,580
setting, really intelligently,
they're not going to light you

2066
02:27:48,580 --> 02:27:52,660
up, they're going to burn you
up. And so again, lots of things

2067
02:27:52,660 --> 02:27:55,540
being thrown out there. But I
think this is really important,

2068
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:59,260
especially in the impatient
West, where people, people are

2069
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:01,260
going to go shit, I'm just gonna
run with this.

2070
02:28:01,980 --> 02:28:02,460
Unknown: Yeah, do

2071
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:04,500
Andrew Holecek: you worry about
you worry about what you

2072
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:11,820
Chris Bache: there, so to speak,
or worry about it. I made, first

2073
02:28:11,820 --> 02:28:19,560
of all that I do worry about it.
It's, I'm glad we're talking

2074
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:23,180
about it. I hope I get
opportunities to talk more about

2075
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:26,900
it. It needs to be discussed,
the relationship between this

2076
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:30,920
high potency psychedelic as a
spiritual practice, but also as

2077
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:35,960
a initial initiatory practice,
and the practices that you're

2078
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:39,980
talking about as initiatory
practices, they can burn you up.

2079
02:28:40,940 --> 02:28:46,300
I got rather well singed. And,
you know, had to manage them.

2080
02:28:46,300 --> 02:28:54,160
Have had to manage them. The
other side of it is the mother

2081
02:28:54,820 --> 02:28:59,140
asked me. She said, You know, we
did not give you these visions

2082
02:28:59,140 --> 02:29:05,580
for you. We gave them for the
people. She said, Let them see

2083
02:29:05,580 --> 02:29:09,960
me through your eyes. Just, just
let me see. Let them see me

2084
02:29:09,960 --> 02:29:14,700
through your eyes, as you have
seen me. And it's like, I am not

2085
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:20,900
important. What's important is
what was shown me, and I hope

2086
02:29:20,900 --> 02:29:28,520
that by sharing that cleanly and
honestly, it will help people in

2087
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:34,640
their own spiritual development.
That is my fundamental

2088
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:42,880
conviction, my fundamental
motivation as a philosopher. I

2089
02:29:42,940 --> 02:29:45,880
trust my students to deal with
the information that I make

2090
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:49,240
available to them, even when it
jars their system, even when it

2091
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:55,060
upsets their agricultural
worldview. I work with them to

2092
02:29:55,060 --> 02:29:57,880
make sure that they don't get
pushed too hard, that they

2093
02:29:57,940 --> 02:30:00,480
integrate them. This is
something. It's a. Little

2094
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:04,680
different. This isn't a way I've
said something. I've not said it

2095
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:07,920
in motion. It's happening all
around me. I'm simply one voice

2096
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:11,520
which is part of a psychedelic
revolution. It's just one voice

2097
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:18,180
trying to bring some clarity on
one certain set of issues. I

2098
02:30:18,180 --> 02:30:23,720
should also mention that I made
a choice a long time ago, not to

2099
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:27,080
function as a therapist, not to
function as a clinician, but to

2100
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:32,540
function as an explorer. I do
not work with other people. I do

2101
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:36,560
not work as a therapist. I do
not take people in psychedelic

2102
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:39,980
sessions. I don't do that work.
That's a different set of

2103
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:44,740
skills. It requires training
that I don't have. I work with

2104
02:30:44,740 --> 02:30:49,600
people who are training to be
those people, and there are lots

2105
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:53,200
and lots of places where people
are training to work as

2106
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:58,420
psychedelic elders and as
psychedelic therapists, and I'm

2107
02:30:58,420 --> 02:31:01,680
in conversations with some of
these training groups. I'll be

2108
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:08,040
doing one this coming weekend,
in fact. But I've made a choice

2109
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:13,800
to really work as an explorer
and to bring a report back and

2110
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:17,880
to support other people who are
working as clinicians, who are

2111
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:25,340
really trying to help people use
this material wisely. Now, as I

2112
02:31:25,340 --> 02:31:28,820
said, I think right now we're
learning the wisdom in the

2113
02:31:28,820 --> 02:31:33,020
therapeutic context. We still
have to learn that wisdom,

2114
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:36,800
incorporate that wisdom into the
shamanic the shamanic wisdom,

2115
02:31:36,980 --> 02:31:41,080
and to integrate the wisdom that
comes from the sage tradition

2116
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:48,160
different levels of depth, I
just trust that we will find

2117
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:52,000
that wisdom. I hope there are
not casualties or not too many

2118
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:59,800
casualties along the way in that
process. I do worry about it. I

2119
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:03,420
trust. I just in the end, I have
to trust that we will find the

2120
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:07,380
wisdom to do this. Now, my sense
is we're going there. No matter

2121
02:32:07,380 --> 02:32:10,980
what psychedelics are here,
they're not going away. They

2122
02:32:11,220 --> 02:32:14,580
didn't go away during the 40
years of prohibition. They're

2123
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:19,140
not going away. Now what we need
to do is accelerate and deepen

2124
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:22,100
our understanding of how to what
they are, how they work, and how

2125
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:26,000
to work with them. Well, what
they do and don't give us. And

2126
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:31,400
in my book, I've really tried to
emphasize the underbelly of

2127
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:35,420
psychedelics, that they are
temporary, that my chapter on

2128
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:39,560
methodology is the path of
temporary immersion. That's not

2129
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:43,600
the same as the path of
contemplative immersion. You

2130
02:32:43,660 --> 02:32:46,840
really have to work with those
limitations and understand them,

2131
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:51,100
to work with them safely, and
they are powerful. And I really

2132
02:32:51,100 --> 02:32:55,180
mean it. I don't recommend that
people work with high doses of

2133
02:32:55,180 --> 02:32:59,440
LSD as consistently and
methodically as I did. I

2134
02:32:59,440 --> 02:33:02,940
wouldn't do it that way again, I
would be gentler with myself. I

2135
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:07,620
would open up smaller windows,
gentler substances, lower doses,

2136
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:12,420
precisely because of the
challenge of sustaining the

2137
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:17,100
impact how these experiences
impact you, not only in the days

2138
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:20,300
immediately following your
session, but in the years

2139
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:22,400
following your session.

2140
02:33:23,060 --> 02:33:28,520
Andrew Holecek: Yeah, you know,
so interesting, Chris, you

2141
02:33:28,520 --> 02:33:32,000
talked earlier about and this is
a wonderful definition of

2142
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:34,700
translation of Shunyata.
Emptiness is translucency,

2143
02:33:34,700 --> 02:33:39,140
transparency and one on one
level, you are the exemplar of

2144
02:33:39,140 --> 02:33:43,120
that transparency. There's no
difference between the inner and

2145
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:46,720
outer with you, and to me, it's
really quite beautiful to see.

2146
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:49,900
And I also have to share a
little bit of the magic that I'm

2147
02:33:49,900 --> 02:33:53,620
feeling, even in the
conversation itself, that and I

2148
02:33:53,620 --> 02:33:56,560
hope my listeners take this in
the right way. Some of these

2149
02:33:56,560 --> 02:34:00,060
questions are not coming from
me. I can tell when I'm asking a

2150
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:04,140
question. But I can also tell
when these questions are coming

2151
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:08,940
from me, and so this next one
did not come from Me, and I hope

2152
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:12,780
it's okay to ask this in
relationship to the beloved, to

2153
02:34:12,840 --> 02:34:19,500
the mother. Do you ever feel? Do
you ever feel that you were

2154
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:23,780
brought into this world on
behalf of the mother, to act as

2155
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:29,120
her child, Luminosity, to act as
that voice. I mean, do you ever

2156
02:34:30,380 --> 02:34:33,980
look at your trajectory as
actually being a kind of Avatar

2157
02:34:33,980 --> 02:34:39,440
of the mother itself that you
were brought to again, this idea

2158
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:44,680
of purpose and divine purpose
and teleology. Does that? Does

2159
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:47,200
that speak to you around this?
Or do you feel this is a little

2160
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:51,340
bit more sort of serendipitous?
I mean, another way you could

2161
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:55,600
say this in my languaging is to
what degree is karma predispose

2162
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:58,360
you towards this? But more
specifically, using your

2163
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:02,520
languaging, do. You think the
beloved sent her child into this

2164
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:05,100
world, right? Well, we're
getting really Christian here,

2165
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:09,960
man, right? Yeah, tongue in
cheek aside, I think you hope

2166
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:11,340
you see where I'm coming from.

2167
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:17,520
Chris Bache: I think that before
I answer the specific, I want to

2168
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:22,100
answer the general. I think that
many of us at first, I believe

2169
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:24,680
that we all knew what we were
getting into before we

2170
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:28,340
incarnated. We have choices to
make, and we choose our

2171
02:35:28,340 --> 02:35:31,580
incarnation. Now, we may not
choose it, if we're if we're

2172
02:35:31,580 --> 02:35:34,160
kindergarteners, we don't let
them choose their curriculum,

2173
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:37,280
but by the time you're in high
school and college and graduate

2174
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:39,620
school, you're choosing your
curriculum. And I think this,

2175
02:35:39,620 --> 02:35:44,200
this is true about reincarnation
too. We choose our incarnation.

2176
02:35:44,320 --> 02:35:47,200
We choose the form of it. We
choose the timing of it. We

2177
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:51,880
choose the place of it. We knew
at a time when we knew more than

2178
02:35:51,880 --> 02:35:56,560
we know now what we're getting
into. We said yes to the options

2179
02:35:56,560 --> 02:36:02,760
that of this incarnation. So I
think this is the lives that we

2180
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:07,320
are living are, for the most
part, for the vast majority, I

2181
02:36:07,320 --> 02:36:12,780
think, are chosen lives, okay?
And I think this is true for me,

2182
02:36:13,320 --> 02:36:19,620
and I don't think, I certainly
don't think I'm an, you know, an

2183
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:24,200
Ishtar for the for the mother.
But I have always considered

2184
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:28,580
myself in service of the mother.
I'm in it's in my astrological

2185
02:36:28,580 --> 02:36:35,120
chart. It's in my constitutional
chart. I I wanted to be, you

2186
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:38,600
know, my first vocation in life
was to be a priest. I woke up

2187
02:36:38,600 --> 02:36:41,380
when I woke up at five or six
years old, I wanted to be a

2188
02:36:41,380 --> 02:36:43,720
priest, and I was raised
Catholic, and that's how it

2189
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:49,900
expressed itself. But that fell
away. But the desire to serve,

2190
02:36:49,900 --> 02:36:54,460
the desire to know and to serve,
was always there, as it is for

2191
02:36:54,460 --> 02:37:00,360
many of us. And so I also
learned along the way, not in my

2192
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:03,840
psychedelic work, but actually
in some hypnotic work I was

2193
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:07,380
doing in past life therapy work
that I have history with

2194
02:37:07,380 --> 02:37:10,800
psychedelics. I have Native
American history with

2195
02:37:10,800 --> 02:37:14,700
psychedelics. It's what made me
comfortable with this mode of

2196
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:20,720
spiritual practice. So I believe
that I was born to do what I

2197
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:25,220
did. And that's, that's not
inflationary, that's just,

2198
02:37:25,220 --> 02:37:28,340
that's just very simple this,
this is what I did, what came

2199
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:35,540
naturally to him, and it's no
big deal. It's just what is I

2200
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:39,440
love to teach. Just so happened
that it took a little bit of a

2201
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:42,760
twist, and I'll add one other
little, small piece, there's

2202
02:37:42,760 --> 02:37:47,920
been great benefit to me in this
in that I also learned that I

2203
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:52,420
have had a number of lives where
I paid a price for speaking I

2204
02:37:52,420 --> 02:37:56,860
was tortured and killed for
speaking out, and so I was

2205
02:37:56,860 --> 02:38:00,960
internalized. I brought that
resistance in this lifetime, and

2206
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:03,660
it's not been easy. From the
first time I wrote on

2207
02:38:03,660 --> 02:38:08,340
reincarnation. I had to overcome
great resistance, but what I

2208
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:13,380
found was that by overcoming
that resistance and speaking the

2209
02:38:13,380 --> 02:38:17,160
truth as best as I could
understand it, it always worked

2210
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:21,980
out well. It always I was always
richly rewarded for the process.

2211
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:27,200
So there's been so learning for
me in rising to the challenge of

2212
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:31,280
doing this. It's not been easy
to write about psychedelics in

2213
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:36,200
our particular culture, but
look, the friendships that it's

2214
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:39,440
given me, the context that it's
given me the opportunities to be

2215
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:44,680
with people, has been very
rewarding. And I think, I think

2216
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:47,800
there are a lot, lots and lots
and lots of people who are like

2217
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:55,300
me, like yourself, who have
deep, deep spiritual hunger,

2218
02:38:55,900 --> 02:39:00,960
spiritual drive. And they they
do it, and as they get into it.

2219
02:39:01,320 --> 02:39:04,320
They're not holding this just
for themselves. They are truly

2220
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:08,880
Bodhisattvas. They're doing this
practice for everybody. First

2221
02:39:08,880 --> 02:39:14,400
thing you do in a practice
awaken bodhicitta, and the last

2222
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:17,340
thing you do in your practice is
you distribute the merit. You

2223
02:39:17,820 --> 02:39:21,500
know, this is, this is just the
nature of reality. This is just

2224
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:27,320
the very simple process of
waking up to the true condition,

2225
02:39:27,320 --> 02:39:31,340
which is a shared existence that
we all, that we all embody.

2226
02:39:31,700 --> 02:39:35,000
Andrew Holecek: Yeah,
breathtaking, breathtaking.

2227
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:41,200
Chris, really. How can people
learn more about you? Again, I'm

2228
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:43,780
going to probably going to say
one more thing, and we're going

2229
02:39:43,780 --> 02:39:48,760
to be here till midnight. But
how can people learn more about

2230
02:39:48,760 --> 02:39:53,020
you? What are you currently
working on? How can we support

2231
02:39:53,020 --> 02:39:56,740
you? Part of, part of what we
do, my aspiration is cross

2232
02:39:56,740 --> 02:40:01,500
pollination. Is bringing,
bringing this core. Of sanity so

2233
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:04,200
that we can increase
connectivity, enhance the

2234
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:08,400
connective tissue, strengthen it
and into whatever degree

2235
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:12,420
possible at whatever levels of
reality, overt or covert,

2236
02:40:12,780 --> 02:40:15,840
support each other. So how can
my community learn more about

2237
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:17,880
you, support you and your
journey, and what are you

2238
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:19,320
currently working on that we can
look

2239
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:26,180
Chris Bache: forward to? Yeah,
well, it's very kind of you to

2240
02:40:26,180 --> 02:40:31,160
ask that I just finished
teaching a seven week course at

2241
02:40:31,160 --> 02:40:36,440
the shift network, which is
basically a seven week course

2242
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:41,560
built around LSD in the mind of
the universe. And that course is

2243
02:40:41,560 --> 02:40:48,280
now it's available, and people
can get that course and download

2244
02:40:48,280 --> 02:40:51,940
it, and there's an hour lecture
followed by half an hour of Q

2245
02:40:52,060 --> 02:40:56,320
and A and, you know, there's
material there, and there's also

2246
02:40:56,320 --> 02:41:03,420
readings there that they can go
into. I have a website, Chris

2247
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:08,640
bache.com, it's unfinished, but
it's there. And if you want to

2248
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:11,820
get access to some of my talks
or some of the things I've

2249
02:41:11,820 --> 02:41:19,500
written, they're there. I don't
do a bulletin. I in right now,

2250
02:41:19,740 --> 02:41:24,200
still absorbing the feedback
from the course I did with the

2251
02:41:24,200 --> 02:41:28,460
shift network. I probably will
do some more teaching with them.

2252
02:41:29,900 --> 02:41:33,020
I will probably be having
conversations like we're having

2253
02:41:33,020 --> 02:41:37,640
now, for people who want to have
the kind of conversations that

2254
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:44,500
flow out of critical psychedelic
practice and with a spiritual

2255
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:51,220
twist to it. I look forward when
covid allows us to gather

2256
02:41:51,220 --> 02:41:57,040
together in groups to do
retreats. I happen to live

2257
02:41:57,040 --> 02:42:00,900
outside of Asheville, where
there are lots of retreat

2258
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:05,400
centers around here, and I hope
that there'll come a time when

2259
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:09,780
people can gather, we can gather
physically for long, weekend or

2260
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:16,020
week long retreats where we can
just enter into the discussion

2261
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:23,300
more deeply. I don't have any
immediate plans for that. I'm

2262
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:29,840
just, I live kind of in a
responsorial mode. You wanted to

2263
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:32,240
have a conversation. I'm
delighted to have this

2264
02:42:32,240 --> 02:42:35,900
conversation, but I just thought
of wait until things come to me,

2265
02:42:37,460 --> 02:42:39,500
and we'll take it

2266
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:42,040
Andrew Holecek: from there.
Beautiful, beautiful. Well,

2267
02:42:42,040 --> 02:42:45,640
Chris, I just like with your
book, you're I'm left with just

2268
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:54,100
this perfume, this this sense of
awe and wonder. It really the

2269
02:42:54,100 --> 02:42:58,960
magic and mystery of the entire
affair, the the surrender to

2270
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:01,740
some whatever you want to pen
hyper object them, and

2271
02:43:01,740 --> 02:43:04,620
necessarily not a silly word,
but a shrink wrap word for the

2272
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:09,720
ineffability, the elegance, the
beauty, the magic of this world

2273
02:43:09,720 --> 02:43:13,500
and your your presence really
embodies to me, and that's why

2274
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:16,740
so much I wanted to do this, not
just merely audit, audit with

2275
02:43:16,740 --> 02:43:21,380
audit, auditory means, but also
visual means. Is you're doing

2276
02:43:21,380 --> 02:43:27,860
something right. You're doing
something right, and your mere

2277
02:43:27,860 --> 02:43:31,520
presence conveys the kind of
authenticity, if I may be so

2278
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:34,460
presumptuous, of what you've
done and what you've elected to

2279
02:43:34,460 --> 02:43:36,980
be as your path. And we are the
beneficiaries of your the

2280
02:43:36,980 --> 02:43:40,780
diamonds that you're throwing
across this planet. And so on

2281
02:43:40,780 --> 02:43:44,440
behalf of my community, really,
thank you for taking time out of

2282
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:48,160
your busy life to spend some
time with us, and I'm just left

2283
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:52,000
somewhat breathless. Breath
taking the insights that you

2284
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,820
shared is really, truly, deeply
inspiring. And I don't pivot

2285
02:43:54,820 --> 02:43:57,280
these words out lightly. It's
really mind bending, mind

2286
02:43:57,280 --> 02:44:01,140
blowing. And what a tremendous
gift your courage in your beauty

2287
02:44:01,140 --> 02:44:03,420
has brought to this world so
deep, deep. Thanks, my friend,

2288
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:05,220
until Until next time

2289
02:44:05,700 --> 02:44:08,880
Chris Bache: I really touched
Andrew, thank you very much, and

2290
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:13,920
thank you for your work. Thank
you for the goodness that you're

2291
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:18,540
spreading, for the for the ideas
that you're seeding. And it's

2292
02:44:18,540 --> 02:44:22,520
really been an honor to be in
conversation with you today.

2293
02:44:22,640 --> 02:44:24,500
Andrew Holecek: Thank you. My
words, and maybe we can do it

2294
02:44:24,500 --> 02:44:27,140
again in this dimension or
another. So all the best, until

2295
02:44:27,140 --> 02:44:30,080
next time, my friend sounds
good. Okay. Much Love you.

1
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:02,972
Chris Bache: Tonight, let me
throw two more books, just so I

2
00:00:02,972 --> 00:00:06,632
want to get into the next
category, but I realize I didn't

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:12,512
put up the last two. The
experiences are wonderful. The

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:16,052
experience is extra ordinary.
But how do we know these people

5
00:00:16,052 --> 00:00:18,752
aren't just imagining and how do
we know that they aren't really

6
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:22,460
this kind of beautiful story,
but how do we know it's really a

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:31,460
story and pebble Van Loan. He's
a Norwegian doctor, and this

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,920
book is, there have been a
number of books of this type,

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,420
but I think this book is the
very best scientific evaluation

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,040
of the near death episode
phenomena. He just, he really

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,560
puts it through all the paces.
He looks at it from different

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,800
angles. He looks at the cases,
he looks at the arguments

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,420
against their legitimacy, and he
just patiently sifts it out. And

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,120
so if you want to look at a
book, or you have that, if you

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,640
have a husband at home, that's
just an engineer, he's

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,220
hypercritical of thinking that
this is just not real. This is

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,040
the book you want to look at,
just because this is the best,

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,400
best critical analysis of
phenomenon. And lastly, I would

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,180
mention the fourth of Proof of
Heaven. Eben Alexander, some of

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,020
you met him and know his work.
He's kind of the man of the hour

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,180
on some of this work, and we
have this in the bookstore. Emmy

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,100
Ray has his work in the
bookstore, and I think Eben is

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,540
doing great work really out
there. He's pitching hard. He's

24
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,620
absorbing a lot of abuse from
the academic community, but his

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:44,440
experience really powerful, and
really he's doing good work, and

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,740
I think this is a beautiful
experience. Okay, so let's go to

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,380
the next category, life, between
life theory. Now this work

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:04,020
actually began with this book
published in 1988 by Joel Witten

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,940
and Joe Fisher. Joel Witten is a
Canadian psychiatrist who was

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,240
doing past lives therapy on
behalf of the Canadian

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,660
government. By the way, he was
interested in foreign news, and

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,600
he accidentally gave an
ambiguous direction to one of

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,100
his clients, and suddenly he
found that his client was not

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,320
remembering a past life. He was
remembering a life between past

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,040
lives. He didn't even think that
this was possible, but he

36
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,640
discovered and he began to
regress people back. He went

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,940
when you went back into a former
life, and then you went through

38
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:43,060
the death in that life. He found
that he could escort people into

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,020
the place they went to after
they died. And when he had done

40
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,640
this many times, he published
this short book with Joe Fisher,

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,780
who's a newspaper reporter life
between life. And this is really

42
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,100
the beginning of this research.
But the man I'd like to show you

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,220
primarily around this work is
this guy, Michael Newton.

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:20,780
Michael Newton and all three of
these books are Michael Newton,

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,820
and we have two of them, right?
Ann Marie, we have two of them

46
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,920
in the bookstore. These are
wonderful books, and these are

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,300
just wonderful books. Michael
Newton, likewise, was doing

48
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,800
research, doing past lives
therapy. He was taking people

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,100
back to heal their circumstances
and their present life by taking

50
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,460
them back to their former lives
and, you know, uncommon trauma

51
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,760
and so on so forth. And then the
same thing happened to him. He

52
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,240
gave an ambiguous instruction,
and he discovered that people

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,440
had the capacity to go back into
their life before they were

54
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,340
born, the life between life,
what happens between death and

55
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,020
birth? And he began to
incorporate this into his

56
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,940
therapy. And after he had taken
600 people, right? So just

57
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,060
imagine, if you're a therapist,
how long does it take you to

58
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,600
have 600 clients going back into
this phenomenon? He kept

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,640
detailed records. He wrote this
first book, journeys of soul,

60
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,080
journeys of journey of the soul,
in which he basically

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,880
summarizes, always staying close
to his cases, the what people

62
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,400
experience in the structure of
the post mortem state. And then

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,200
that was following the date I
consider the bibliography I gave

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,040
you 2000s the next one destiny
of souls. And these two are

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,260
really kind of like two halves
of the same book. I mean,

66
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,520
they're really destiny of souls
gives you more detail, but the

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,060
phenomenon is the same. You're
just going into it in greater

68
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,140
detail. And. Off because and
then memories of the afterlife.

69
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,460
What happened is Michael live in
the seeing so many patients,

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,420
psychedelic psychotherapists
began to come to him, and he

71
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,140
began to train the therapist. He
began. So he stopped working

72
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,080
with patients, so much as he
began to work with therapists,

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,480
and he created an institute, and
so now he now this is the

74
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,080
fastest growing area in
hypnotherapy and past lives

75
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,560
therapy, and people who are
being trained not only to do

76
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,640
past life regressions, but to do
life between life therapy,

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,940
because it deepens and
accelerates the therapeutic

78
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,220
process, so that all of this
last book are collections of

79
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,420
cases by a different therapist.
So they will get the therapist

80
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,540
describe their background, how
they got into this, and they

81
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,320
present one case and they move
on to the next therapist. So you

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,140
see that the third book, in
fact, was published by the

83
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,800
Newton Institute. So the first
two books are Michael Newton.

84
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,500
The third book comes from the
Newton Institute. Now,

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,560
there are so many wonderful
things to share with you from

86
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,120
this material, like the near
death episode research, it just

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:34,220
is so consoling and it is so
illuminating to have a clear

88
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,240
description of the death
experience as the return to

89
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,540
ecstasy. Here we go into the
next step, into the nuts and

90
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:50,020
bolts of the world we return to
when we die. So let me just kind

91
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,920
of share some observations that
come that you'll find in these

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,320
first in these books of Newton,
he says. And first of all,

93
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,560
everything that we talked about
with near death episode

94
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,180
research. All of that phenomenon
is replicated in life, between

95
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,060
life therapy, the same
phenomenon taking the tunnel,

96
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,720
the encounter with the light,
layers and layers of light. He

97
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,560
talks about levels that his
clients talks about levels of

98
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,320
light, all woven together in
stratified threads a series of

99
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,460
rising dimensions above the
physical or tangible world. They

100
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,900
become less dense as one moves
farther away from the heavy

101
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,680
influences of earth. He talks
about there is a period of

102
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,580
orientation that when people
would die in this past life

103
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,220
therapy, they would go into some
type of very comfortable,

104
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:49,000
consoling environment, a park, a
lake, something very familiar,

105
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,900
and they would orient. And then,
once they were activated to this

106
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,160
new condition, then they would
go beyond that into deeper into

107
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,160
the death process. So this and
there is, there is a technology,

108
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,740
and there is a whole cadre of
beings whose job it is to help

109
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,280
catch people when they die, to
help them reorient to the true

110
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,240
nature of infinity.

111
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,320
Unknown: Just watch your mind,
there's a movie. Is a movie and

112
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,780
PM, you probably know

113
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,280
Chris Bache: exactly your life.
It's ending your life.

114
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,720
Very similar, maybe, okay, very
similar, because this is what

115
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,860
just get busy, is what would
happen if IBM could get the

116
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,280
Bardo contract. They go to this
place, it looks like Dallas, and

117
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,340
you can eat as much as you want,
you know, and you're defending

118
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,220
your life, your kind of life is
reviewed and what you could want

119
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,400
in that it's something like
that. I mean, how many people

120
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,320
die every day in the world?
Hundreds of 1000s of people die

121
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,400
every day. Well, that's a lot of
people to catch and integrate,

122
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,480
and it doesn't happen like some
big machine. It takes personnel.

123
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,100
It takes me to catch several
100,000 people

124
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,720
Margaret Hiller: every day. Do
they have a health and

125
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,040
retirement retirement plan

126
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,980
Unknown: is pretty good.

127
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:35,060
Chris Bache: Good. He says that
there is a whole, I don't want

128
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,840
to there. First of all, where we
go when we die. There are many,

129
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,220
many, many layers where we go
when we die. There are many

130
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,380
layers of the spiritual
universe, and not everybody goes

131
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,800
to the same place. Everybody
goes to the same home, but not

132
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,120
every there's like a condo of
many layers, and you don't all

133
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,680
go to the same layer of the
condo. He says there. Are many

134
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,620
guides, many beings, and even
the guides have guides. And the

135
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,600
basic principle is, the more
experienced coach, the less

136
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,660
experienced. And this happens up
and down the system that they

137
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,380
are, that you find that you had
to have guides, and those guides

138
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,940
have supervisors, and those
supervisors, you know, they have

139
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,840
guides, and there is a hierarchy
of guides, and what is it that

140
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,180
determines one's placement in
that hierarchy is really simply

141
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,020
their spiritual maturation. It's
open ended. It's a spiritual

142
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:45,520
maturation process. He says that
ghost as Hollywood presents,

143
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,340
actually, they're very rare.
It's very rare for people who

144
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:54,760
get hung up. You can get hung up
in the exiting process. But what

145
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,420
Hollywood has inculcated as all
these kind of shadow phenomenon

146
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,800
and scary things that happen
when we die. It's just, it's an

147
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,600
insignificant percentage of the
number of people who are dying.

148
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,140
The large majority of people go
through those intermediate

149
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,240
territories without problem.

150
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,120
Margaret Hiller: Now we're all
worried. Are we in that small

151
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,600
percentage?

152
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,779
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, he
actually, I'll give you some

153
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,799
percentages in a minute, because
he he's he gives you some he has

154
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,979
some statistics. He's worked out
on stages of soul development.

155
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,279
But a couple of other things.
First, first of all,

156
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:34,459
reincarnation is just an obvious
fact of life. He said, If you're

157
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,759
out of your body, you know the
reincarnation is just true. No

158
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,779
ifs ands and buts, that's it.
I'm sorry, but that's the way it

159
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:45,999
is, right, period. Secondly,
there's no help. Concept of

160
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:49,839
health is just a distorted, you
know, incomplete perception.

161
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,759
Everybody goes home. Now that
doesn't mean, I mean if you

162
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,919
were, if you were a mean son of
a bitch, and you hurt people,

163
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,079
and you cause people pain and
suffering, you got to deal. You

164
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,419
know you're going to have to
deal with that. And there is

165
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,079
processes and beings who are
there to help you deal with

166
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,199
that. And there are people.
There are people who can be so

167
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,099
damaged by their Earth
experience, they become so

168
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,619
hateful and so filled with so
much malice that very special

169
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:25,159
circumstances are required to
bring them back into the

170
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,939
wholeness of spirit, and he
discusses those, particularly in

171
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:31,879
the second book destiny and
stolen souls. He discusses this

172
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,299
in great detail. There are
beings whose specialty is

173
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:40,779
working with highly damaged
souls, damaged beings hurt so

174
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:49,479
traumatically. He says there are
soul clusters, and we are not in

175
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,539
this alone. We actually it's
like going to college everybody

176
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:58,119
you matriculate in a group, and
this group stays intact through

177
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:04,379
the entire journey process. He
says that after he calls them

178
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:10,439
soul clusters, he says there are
five to 20 beings in soul. In

179
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:16,859
your soul cluster, the average
he finds, is about 15 beings

180
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:20,119
who, at the every incarnation,
they come back together. They

181
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:24,139
don't necessarily incarnate
together sometimes, but when

182
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,739
you're in between life, you come
back together and you are

183
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:30,799
immediately transparent. I mean,
one of the things that happens

184
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,719
in the spirit world is you can't
hide anything. Everybody knows

185
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:38,659
everything about you, and you
know everything about the beings

186
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:43,719
that you are with and and your
debriefing of your most recent

187
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:47,439
life experience is done in the
context of your soul cluster.

188
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:50,919
And each of the members of your
soul cluster may have guides,

189
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:53,439
and sometimes they're different
guides, and sometimes they're

190
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,119
the same guides. But that there
is, there is a social matrix

191
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:02,879
within which this is all taking
place. Younger souls tend to

192
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,859
stay more tightly clustered with
their soul cluster. Older souls

193
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,599
tend to kind of go off and do
things more individually, but

194
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:16,319
they always come back. They're
always part of the soul cluster,

195
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,839
and the soul cluster basically
goes through the experience

196
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,759
together, but not necessarily at
the same pace. Some members of

197
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,479
the soul cluster may proceed
very slowly, and other members

198
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:33,199
of the soul cluster may proceed
faster. How do you know who's

199
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,759
going faster? He says, Well, all
you have to do is look at the

200
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:44,199
color of the light. He says, As
as you become more mature, the

201
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:49,479
energy of your being, which is
light, changes color. And he has

202
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:53,859
kind of a model of a sort of a
rainbow spectrum of the stages

203
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,499
of development reflected in the
colors. And he says it's

204
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:59,919
immediately obvious where a
person is in their development.

205
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:08,759
And just by looking at their
color, he says he he says he

206
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,039
talks about stages of
development. He does his

207
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,399
statistics, he keeps track of
things, and he differentiates

208
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,419
five stages of soul development
that he's been able to identify.

209
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:25,219
So the question is, what's the
percentage in stages? Here's his

210
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:34,699
statistics. Level 140, 2% level
230, 1% level that's kind of

211
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,779
discouraging, isn't it, that
means 73% of all the souls that

212
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:42,699
he's worked with are at levels
one and two. That's three

213
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,759
quarters of the world's
population in levels one and

214
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:55,779
two. Level three, 17% level
four, 9% level five, 1% here is

215
00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:00,839
a couple of he says, quote, I
have had many cases where a

216
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,459
client has been incarnated for
up to 30,000 years on earth and

217
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,399
is still in the lower levels one
and two.

218
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,459
On the other hand, he said, I
once had a client who entered

219
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:21,739
into a level three state of
awareness after Only 4000 years

220
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,719
an outstanding performance,

221
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:46,060
percentage level. 142,
231-317-4951, 495, 1% now,

222
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,220
honest mentioned something. One
of the things I really like

223
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,480
about Newton is he stays with
his dad. He is true to his dad.

224
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,140
He gives you cases for
everything he says. He gives you

225
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,120
examples that come from his
cases, that's, I love the

226
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,900
empirical side, you know, the
discipline side of his work in

227
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,240
that respect. But that's also,
from my perspective, is also the

228
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,540
limitation of the work, because
he can only reflect the

229
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,960
statistics of the people who
come to him to work. And as he

230
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,440
himself says, it tends to be
kind of younger souls who take

231
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,640
find their way to him. I mean,
the Dalai Lama has never gone to

232
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,500
work with Michael Newton. Great
saints and great beings don't

233
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,500
tend to need working with
therapists to explore these

234
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,840
dimensions so that his figures
tend to be skewed somewhat, I

235
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,380
think, in the lower direction.
Also his description of the

236
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,460
nature of post mortal existence
is skewed to what in the

237
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,380
Tibetan, you would say is the
lower half of the Bardo. He

238
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,060
tends to give a more, from my
perspective, a more detailed and

239
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,940
accurate description only of the
lower half of heaven, not of the

240
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,920
higher dimensions of

241
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,960
Unknown: heaven. That's okay,
because that's where most of you

242
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,320
are going.

243
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,360
Chris Bache: It's good, and
believe me, there's plenty of

244
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,120
joy to go around. It really is,
but it's not, I don't find it to

245
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,960
be reflective of the totality.
Is reflective of half of the

246
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,680
totality.

247
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,740
Margaret Hiller: In my Father's
house. Are many mansions, so

248
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,580
we're in the house. We're just
in different mansions. We're in

249
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,500
different aspects.

250
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,220
Chris Bache: You know The
Tibetan Book of the Dead

251
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,800
Buddhism, we talked about six
levels to the six locus, the six

252
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,460
realms of existence, hell
beings, hungry ghost beings,

253
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,460
animals can mark by ignorance,
human beings, low, low heavenly

254
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,340
beings, high heavenly beings.
Each of these are subdivided

255
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,000
into eight hot hills, eight cold
hills, the eight intermediate

256
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,960
hills. There are 26 high
heavenly realms. So it's like

257
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,820
hundreds and hundreds of realms
divided and at one level, this

258
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,980
is a teaching about what
happened, where we go, when we

259
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,940
die. From another level, it's a
teaching about what's happening

260
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,800
right here, because in this
city, there are hell realms.

261
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,860
There are some beings who are
living in the hell of violence

262
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,740
and anger. There are some beings
who are living in the realm of

263
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,920
greed and insatiable appetites.
There are some beings who are

264
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,280
living in the high, heavenly
realm. Everything there silver

265
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,160
in their mouth. Everything is
fine. They've always had plenty.

266
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,500
They've always, you know, so
it's Bardo reality, the

267
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,980
intermediate state, but it's
also in the physical world.

268
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:52,300
We're in this condition right
now. Those who have more

269
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,980
experience help those who have
less experience, guides. Help

270
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,320
souls. Souls help each other.
High guy. Help lore guides. He

271
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,280
differentiates. He has his own
vocabulary. He talks about

272
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,200
watchers. They're junior and
senior watchers. He talks about

273
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,120
sages. He talks about the old
ones, who are beyond level six.

274
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,960
You know? That says there are
the the old ones, and the old

275
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,140
ones are kind of, you know, he
talks about a council of elders

276
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,660
when you die, when you orient
and when you debrief with your

277
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,020
spirit guide, somewhere in
there, you're going to be

278
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,920
brought before the council of
elders. And the elders are these

279
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,940
old ones, and before you
incarnate when you've chosen

280
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,940
your life, when you've done a
number of things, you go before

281
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,700
the council of elders. So this
is like we're all in this

282
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,700
together. It's a collective.
That's why I talked about the

283
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,740
community of heaven. There is a
social matrix. There's a world

284
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,300
in which there is a social
structure, and it's a social

285
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,780
structure, which is not
hierarchical, in the sense of

286
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,140
the old ones are more valuable
than the younger ones. There's

287
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,560
not a value there's not a value
hierarchy, because we're all

288
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,160
divine. We're all of the Divine.
That's the fundamental truth.

289
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:21,800
But there is a gradient of
expertise. There's a gradient of

290
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,260
development, and that's just
accepted as an obvious truth. So

291
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,000
on the one hand, everybody is
equally valuable, and older

292
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,320
learners help the younger
learners to grow. There's a

293
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,420
structure to it. There's a logic
to it, and it's he talks about

294
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:50,320
some of the different worlds of
that reality. He talks about the

295
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,860
world of altered time. Is one of
his languages for it. He talks

296
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,060
about the world of creation and
non creation, and the world of

297
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,520
all knowing. Let me translate
those phrases, the world of all

298
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,260
your time is like a holodeck.
You've seen Star Trek. You go to

299
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,020
the Holo deck, and when you go
on the Holo deck, you can have

300
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,440
any experience you want to. He
says, You can do that when you

301
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,680
die too, and they're, you know
when you're What are you doing

302
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,720
with all your time in between,
from birth, from death to birth?

303
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,200
He said, Well, you can go into
this place called the world of

304
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,620
altered time, where you can go
into this holodeck and you can

305
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,120
experiment creating reality. You
can just create anything that

306
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,160
you can imagine. It's a
holodeck. He says, There is a

307
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,760
world of creation and non
creation. I call it Earth too.

308
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,480
There is an actual physical
world where you can go and you

309
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,900
can experiment with your
creative abilities. But it

310
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,020
actually is a tangible world,
and you can have as you can

311
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,740
spend as much time there as you
want, where you're flexing your

312
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,020
new muscles and you're
experimenting with doing things.

313
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,100
He talks about, what are you
doing? He says, well, one person

314
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,700
reported that they were learning
how to make fish. That's a real

315
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,780
aspiration. They're literally
using your mind to create

316
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:25,880
physical form and the idea is
that, you know, where did all

317
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,840
these new forms that show up in
evolution? You know, our current

318
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,500
thinking is Life creates things
randomly, and then they're

319
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,860
screened by survival of the
fittest. But from Newton's

320
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,180
perspective, that's not really
quite the whole story. There is

321
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,740
a creativity inherent in the
universal process, and you can

322
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,400
practice that creativity. And
there are beings who practice

323
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,540
the creation of new life forms.
And eventually, some of that

324
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,900
practice manifests in the
manifestation of new life forms

325
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,380
on Earth, which I like to think
about when I'm looking at those

326
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,700
coral reefs with all those
beautiful fish and thinking, How

327
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,160
is this all coming about by
accident?

328
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,600
Margaret Hiller: It gives me
something to hang on, that hope

329
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,180
where Jesus said, Ye are gods.
We are creative beings, and

330
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,740
whatever else he may have meant
by that, but this is in that

331
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,140
chapter for me, that ye are
God's place, yeah, that we're

332
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,160
creative being

333
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,640
Chris Bache: creative beings,
and we you have to practice

334
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,620
creativity. You have to learn to
control the powers that are

335
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,860
yours by your virtue of your
nature. But you can practice it

336
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,600
and get better and better. It's
like learning how to play chess.

337
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,260
Everybody's got the capacity to
be a master, but, you know, to

338
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:51,100
practice at it. Practice create.
He also talks about this world,

339
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,200
the world without ego. This is
the spiritual maternity ward. I

340
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,900
mentioned this to. You before,
this is a place where new souls

341
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,920
begin, and even it's one of the
most beautiful sections of I

342
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,760
think it's destiny of souls,
where he talks about these

343
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,260
beings who are kind of like
maternity ward nurses who catch

344
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:23,300
the new souls. They don't have a
self identity, yet, they're raw.

345
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,680
It's like a solar flare coming
off of the sun, and they catch

346
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,320
them and hold them and care for
them and basically help them

347
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,840
awaken to individual existence,
world without ego, meaning world

348
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,640
without sense of self. By the
time they leave the maternity

349
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,660
ward, they have a sense of
individuality. They have a sense

350
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,940
of self. It's a very and not all
beings, not all pieces of

351
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,740
energy, make that transition.
It's like some of them don't

352
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,240
congeal into an individuality,
which if they are kind of

353
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:06,600
reabsorbed into the totality,
and they catch more. So it's not

354
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:13,140
like there's an assembly line.
And he says, one person said, I

355
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,480
didn't know myself, asked myself
until I was moved into this

356
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,520
quiet place. So a new soul is
not capable of choice. They

357
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,340
don't have. He says they're not
self shaped. Once you have a

358
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,420
self, once you have a sense of
individuality, he says it's your

359
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,380
signature, and you'll have that
signature forever. He says.

360
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:47,380
Quote, once given, ego becomes a
covenant between oneself and the

361
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:55,600
givers to do the best I can with
who I am, who I am changes. What

362
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,980
I am doesn't change, the essence
doesn't change, but who I am,

363
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,740
the form changes, but the
covenant with the Divine is to

364
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,540
do the best you can with who you
are, as the covenant of

365
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,640
individuated existence, as I
mentioned before in my dialog

366
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,900
with her and Laszlo, my
experience is that individuality

367
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,000
is one of The precious gifts of
existence. In fact, I think it's

368
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,440
probably the greatest gift given
by the great mother. So for me,

369
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,280
only part of the Divine
manifests as the physical

370
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,600
universe. Part of the Divine is
outside the physical universe.

371
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,320
The physical universe is the
only thing that is hard enough

372
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,760
that it has the strength to
break up the wholes of the

373
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,820
Divine into individual parts. So
it's kind of like the being of

374
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,560
God has such power that it takes
something as dense as physical

375
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,360
matter to break off little bits
and pieces of the Divine to

376
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,480
develop individual capacity,
that individuality is the great

377
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,660
gift of the mother. It actually
is the great gift of physical

378
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,920
existence itself, the experience
of being an individual, so that

379
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,940
whatever happens, we will always
be an individual. We won't be

380
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,440
swallowed up and lose our
identity forever. Now you know

381
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,380
that most idealistic
philosophies like

382
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,560
interpretations of Hinduism and
some spiritual missions, say,

383
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,500
Well, you see, when you achieve
enlightenment, then when you

384
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,400
die, the Grof returns to the
ocean, the self just you

385
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,700
dissolve in the totality of
being. You cease to exist as an

386
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,040
individual. I'm thinking of a
bad word

387
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,480
Margaret Hiller: right now. We
can all we can all hear it.

388
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,280
Chris Bache: I don't believe
that that's true. That's not the

389
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,940
truth in my experience, in my
experience that no matter how

390
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,480
many times the ego dies, it
gives birth to a deeper

391
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,920
individuality. When that
individual individuality dies

392
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,160
and gives birth to a still
deeper form of individuality.

393
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,600
Individuality is one of the
great gifts of the creative

394
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,820
enterprise, and I don't think we
do return to the source. We do

395
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,540
return to the all. But the
universe didn't spend 13 point 7

396
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,500
billion years gestating this
individuality just to have it

397
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,000
reabsorbed into the totality, so
we go back to the totality, but

398
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,900
not so as to suffocate our
individuality, but actually

399
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,900
enhance and deepen our
individuality.

400
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,500
Unknown: Can you define that
individuality as, I said,

401
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,840
between the oneness and funny
the personality. Where does that

402
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,240
individuality fall? What is that

403
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,640
Chris Bache: in dark time early
on, where I'm exploring a lot of

404
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,900
different areas I'm exploring
that can. Connective tissue of

405
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,080
consciousness. I'm exploring
collective consciousness and

406
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,320
exploring the relationship
between individual evolution and

407
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,500
collective evolution, how
they're all intertwined so with

408
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,980
a deep appreciation for the
connective tissue that we are

409
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,240
all part of. The last chapter in
that book is called The fate of

410
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,000
individuality. As I address the
question what? You know, some

411
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,740
religious systems extinguish
individuality, and I don't think

412
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,580
there is, what is that
individuality? And the closest I

413
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,580
can get to a definition of it is
a functional definition, a

414
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,880
process definition is the
capacity for integrated

415
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,360
experience. I can't get more
specific than that, because the

416
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,860
nature of individuality changes
as the soul matures. And so if

417
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,220
you can't, you can't define it
in terms of content, because the

418
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,120
content is open ended. But what
does seem to be consistent is

419
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,140
the capacity to integrate
experience. So you're

420
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,460
integrating. You learn, you
integrate, you become more. You

421
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,820
learn you integrate, and you
become more. And this is why I

422
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,860
really don't agree with that
with Lazlo, that when we are at

423
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,020
the universe just creates egos
and then swallows them up into

424
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,080
the Akashic memory. The Akashic
field is real, but

425
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,420
individuality, is also real, and
it's a both and and I think we

426
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,460
can use last Well's field theory
to actually describe the

427
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,360
dynamics of the soul in a way
which is more accurate, but it's

428
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,180
truly a both and situation.
Thank you, Gary. And then here

429
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,040
and here, what do you think
about the concept of I've heard

430
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,520
from Shinto and other traditions
that ultimately, the soul

431
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,720
creates their own universe.

432
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:03,240
Newton and some others have said
that when a soul, when a soul

433
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,840
kind of graduates at a point
where you can continue in the

434
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,840
spiritual world if you want to,
or you can stay within the

435
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,100
physical enterprise if you want
to. But if you are a graduate, a

436
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,900
graduate, you can create an
entire universe. Because you can

437
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:25,220
create an entire universe. We
are the types of beings we think

438
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,640
of ourselves in such
underestimating terms. We are

439
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,760
beings who can create galaxies
once mature, that's what that's

440
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,040
the size and scale of what we're
talking

441
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,800
Margaret Hiller: about. We're
doing that workshop next week.

442
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:57,760
Unknown: To what Gary was saying
in 86 I experienced and I was

443
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,800
talking at lunchtime with others
in here. I called in this I

444
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,460
didn't know, at the time of
spiritual emergency, for lack of

445
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:12,060
a better word, and rather than
having all of the beauty, it was

446
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:17,640
like I created Dante's Inferno.
You know, I was born Pentecostal

447
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:24,320
wholeness, and I created that
hell within myself. To me, as I

448
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,440
was going through that, it was
18 months that I was in that my

449
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,840
family just kind of lifted open
for me to pretty much

450
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,140
experience, although they were
scared, you know. But through

451
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:49,240
that time, I knew that my soul
was so damaged, until I was

452
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,120
experiencing what my soul was
feeling. And somehow I knew that

453
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,180
I was working things out, you
know. But 18 months, I was like

454
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,260
that, and then all of a sudden,
one day, you know, I said, well,

455
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:11,640
I need to go and get some help.
So I had myself committed. But,

456
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:17,940
you know, after that time, it
didn't happen immediately, but

457
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,440
two or three years after that,
the entire time that I was

458
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,540
inside, I called it where I went
within. I didn't really feel

459
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,800
like I was individualized. I
didn't feel like I I felt like I

460
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,900
was I didn't have, I was a part
of nothing, yeah, you know, I

461
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,840
didn't, I wasn't anybody. I
wasn't, you know, I couldn't do

462
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,720
anything. I was nothing. I was
little. Everybody else was big,

463
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,000
but I was little, yeah, and, but
I everything that went on and

464
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,440
that time when I was within, I
wrote about it, yeah, so through

465
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,900
that writing and what I
experienced, you. Yes, I found

466
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,000
out that I could write, and
whenever I got outside of that,

467
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,520
that he'll become heaven. That
makes sense, because it gave me

468
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,600
an opportunity to pull from that
hell that I was in and see that

469
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,540
beauty. Because I had been
there, I had done something. I

470
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:26,960
was an individual person. God
had took me in and told me

471
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,340
secrets and showed me things
that nobody else had seen. So

472
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:37,760
whenever I came back out, I had
an absolute I was a totally

473
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,200
different person with a
different concept than the

474
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,800
person that I went in with,
yeah. So I guess in a sense of

475
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,380
what Gary was saying, My soul
did create the world that it

476
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,400
wanted, but ultimately it was to
get me. It was like, wake up.

477
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,840
It's time to wake up. Yeah.

478
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:02,279
Chris Bache: I don't believe in
an eternal Hill. I think that's

479
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:08,159
an abomination, but I do believe
that there are Hill realms, and

480
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:12,779
if a person has goes through a
very terrible traumatic

481
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:19,019
experience, they have nightmares
because they've got a hill

482
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,299
experience living inside their
psyche and until they clear that

483
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:27,379
it's there. Now, just think of
all the terrible things that

484
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:29,899
have happened to human beings.
And use the history. Think of

485
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:33,679
all the people who died World
War One, think of all the people

486
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,179
who died traumatically. War Two,
the people who died in the

487
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:43,479
Philippines this last week. Just
think of the human family with

488
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,119
all of the trauma that humanity
has undergone. And if the human

489
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,899
psyche has is a single
consciousness, if there is a

490
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:58,779
collective psyche, then there,
just as we have levels of our

491
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:04,379
mind which have pockets of hell
inside of them, then there are

492
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:09,239
pockets of hell in the human
psyche. And if you read the

493
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,679
biographies or autobiographies
of some saints and great

494
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,359
practitioners, you'll they go
into these hell realms, and they

495
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:24,139
spend a long time in these hell
realms in order to heal, not

496
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:28,339
themselves, but to actually help
heal, I think, the collective

497
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:34,099
psyche of humanity and so I
think those realms are there. We

498
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,099
get into them for all sorts of
different sometime, like a

499
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:44,019
spiritual emergency. And they
they are. They're bigger than we

500
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:49,179
are. They have, they have a
power all of their own. And

501
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:55,959
ultimately, even though they are
long live in terms of history,

502
00:37:56,139 --> 00:38:01,319
they are ultimately temporary,
because all trauma can be

503
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:07,739
healed, and when it's healed,
it's it clears and but humanity,

504
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:10,799
if we are giving birth to a new
human if we are giving birth to

505
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:15,719
a higher form of human life, we
have to heal all their human

506
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:19,019
history in order for human
history to move forward. And

507
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:21,679
that's why I think a lot of
people who do spiritual

508
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,739
practice, very deep spiritual
practice, they spend a lot of

509
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:31,699
time in the hell realm. I
mentioned Roger Wilber, and I

510
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:35,419
was giving a talk on this at a
conference one time, and Roger

511
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:38,359
was there. He and I had lunch
together, and I was talking

512
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:42,879
about the hell realm, and I was
talking about the discovery that

513
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:47,739
when you go into the hell realm,
it's not about healing yourself,

514
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,899
it's about healing the
collective. And he came to the

515
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:54,639
same conclusion on his past life
therapy work. He was taking

516
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,439
people into past life, and he
said they were just one lifetime

517
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:02,519
after another, lifetime after
another lifetime, trauma after

518
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:05,819
trauma after trauma. And he
eventually came to the

519
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:10,199
conclusion that this couldn't be
simply people who were had

520
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,799
amassed a long history of
trauma. Something else had to be

521
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:18,119
afoot. And he became convinced
that his clients were people who

522
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,279
were taking on collective pain,
taking on like other people's

523
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:26,419
lifetimes in the way of
suffering in order to clear the

524
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:32,959
collective fear. And I think
actually, we are in one of those

525
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,839
periods of history where the
hell realm is coming to the

526
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,279
surface. We are 21st Century is
going to be a hellish century,

527
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:45,639
and all of this is part of a
collective transformative

528
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:50,919
process, so you have to get out
the paint in order to clear the

529
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:54,879
system so that the system can
take in greater joy and greater

530
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:59,919
beauty. Thank you for sharing
your experience. You.

531
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,480
Audience 3: School, yeah, when
you were talking about

532
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:13,620
signature, I mean when, when I
meet a person, and, you know,

533
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,820
and I don't have to know them
that well, but there is a sense

534
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,220
or feeling that I have about
them over on above their words,

535
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,960
looks anything, it's like an
essence. You know, I think that

536
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,640
what you're talking about, but
could, could it be that that

537
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,940
aspect, that signature that
you're talking about, could be

538
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,620
just a divine gift of
personality that goes with us

539
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,420
throughout eternity, you know,
just like we have a soul, and

540
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,980
just like we have the spark of
the divine within us, all those

541
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,740
eternal elements, you know,
they're helping build the

542
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,540
miraculous body. Yeah, you know
that personality, that that

543
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,240
distinguishing mark, that even
if a million years passes by and

544
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,840
we see that person. You don't
have to say a word, and we can

545
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,600
feel their essence, that
personality.

546
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,639
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think I
agree with the concept. I use a

547
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,939
different vocabulary, because
our word personality is so

548
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:19,199
connected to individual ego that
it tends to carry that quality.

549
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:23,359
So I I just prefer the word
individuality, but the way

550
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,059
you're using the term
personality, I think it's

551
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:29,479
interchangeable. That basic
concept that there is a unique

552
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,839
identity, that identity is us at
the deepest level, and it is a

553
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,439
gift we didn't give it to
ourselves. You know, it was

554
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:43,899
birthed in the system, and once
burned, it never goes away. It's

555
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:48,219
always there. And I think you
can, you can feel it, besides

556
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:52,839
people, yes, about

557
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,200
Unknown: a year and a half ago,
I purchased couple of bottles of

558
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:05,100
extra time on I was going to end
my life, so I took about of the

559
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:13,560
275 and I wound up in Cedar
Sinai. And it was really weird,

560
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,400
because I was very at peace with
what I was doing. I really,

561
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,560
really wanted to go. But then,
when I spoke to the first

562
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,460
doctor, he said to me, well,
you'll probably have permanent

563
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,820
liver damage, and you probably
only have, like, two or three

564
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,260
days to live. But I didn't know
how to feel about that, because,

565
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,760
like, I, you know, I didn't plan
to wake up and have to deal with

566
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,520
well, do I Yeah, but that's not
my question. My question. My

567
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:47,320
question is, there's quite a bit
of suicidality in my family. So

568
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,340
is this show up in the books
about suicidality? Or have I

569
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:51,580
picked

570
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:56,079
Chris Bache: another In fact,
this also there was a question

571
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,679
asked earlier, what about
suicide? You know what is, well,

572
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,779
I didn't answer we came up very
great. So what about suicide?

573
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:13,499
First of all, the past life
therapy. Evidence is that

574
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:21,019
suicide can become a habit like
anything else, if you have a

575
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:27,259
ticket, we need another
anonymous group. If you get if

576
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:29,779
you get overwhelmed, you get in
a situation where you just feel

577
00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:32,659
like you can't deal with it
anymore. I'm going to end it.

578
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,660
Unknown: It is a coping it's a
lack of coping skill.

579
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,960
Chris Bache: What we find is
that people who commit suicide

580
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,320
in one lifetime sometimes have a
tendency to choose that as an

581
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,520
option in subsequent

582
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,260
Margaret Hiller: life. Chris,
can you hold the mic closer?

583
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,680
Chris Bache: Okay, there you go.
Thank you. It's I feel like I'm

584
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:57,040
smoking. It can become habit
forming. It can become an exit

585
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,160
strategy, but it doesn't really
solve things now, what are the

586
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,500
consequences of committing
suicide? I think the best wisdom

587
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,120
I've seen in all of the
literature is the consequence of

588
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,860
committing suicide is you have
to repeat the grade. If you

589
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,420
flunk the fifth grade, we don't
take you out torture you for the

590
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,780
rest of your life. We just
simply say you have to take the

591
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:28,580
fifth grade over again. So if
you choose, if you know, not

592
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:34,400
everybody commits suicide for,
quote, bad reasons, but if you

593
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:40,240
choose suicide of inability to
cope, the worst that happens, I

594
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,700
think, is that you have to come
back and maybe even more

595
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,060
demanding circumstances in order
to face the challenges that you

596
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,120
work in, to solve the issues
that you weren't able to solve

597
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:54,760
before. But I've mentioned
Robert Monroe, the Monroe

598
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,300
Institute, and he's the guy who
wrote three books. He's an out

599
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,380
of body kind of person. He.
Created the Monroe Institute in

600
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,400
favor of Virginia. He says, you
can check out anytime you want.

601
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,380
Anybody can leave anytime they
want, without cosmic judgment.

602
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,600
He feels very strongly about
this, but it doesn't mean that

603
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,200
there isn't, there aren't karmic
consequences, not in the sense

604
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,060
of judgment, but of habits that
can get established. And I don't

605
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,500
think suicide is a successful
coping strategy. It just

606
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,720
interrupts the process. Then you
got to get born again. You got

607
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,320
to go through diapers again just
to get yourself back into the

608
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,980
situation where you can face
whatever it was that took you

609
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:44,740
out the last time. So it's one
of those things where I don't

610
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,220
think it's the worst thing that
you can do, but it's not the

611
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:53,140
best thing either. So best to
work with what it is that you've

612
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:58,540
got yourself into until you can
get through it. But if you've

613
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,980
lost someone to suicide, they're
not outside of love. They're not

614
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,680
outside the universe. They go
home. They don't go to hell.

615
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,400
They go home. I'll tell you
another piece of research. There

616
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,400
was a guy who wanted to study
near death episodes of people

617
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,020
who attempted to commit suicide.
So he studied, this is an early

618
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,100
study. David Rosen, he studied
people who tried to commit

619
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,680
suicide by jumping off the
Golden Gate Bridge in San

620
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,220
Francisco. You jump off the
Golden Gate you got about a 97%

621
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,480
chance of dying, so it's a
pretty serious suicide attempt.

622
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,380
He found that they were eight
people who had jumped and

623
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,840
survived. He was able to track
down seven of them. He also

624
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,740
tracked down six people who had
jumped off the Golden Gate

625
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,660
Bridge, I guess the Bay Bridge.
I guess if the Golden Gate is

626
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:57,940
busy, here's what he found. He
found that every person who

627
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,200
attempted to commit suicide by
jumping off either of these

628
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,400
bridges, went instantly into
ecstatic Transcendence, state of

629
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,040
consciousness, they went
straight into the near death

630
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:13,020
episode, white light, totality
of consciousness, instantly and

631
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,580
not a single person ever tried
to commit suicide again, because

632
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:21,320
they learned the soul was not
killed when you kill the body,

633
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,240
nothing is solved by committing
suicide. It just delays the

634
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,800
inevitable. So they weren't
punished, but they never tried

635
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,680
to commit suicide again, because
they discovered that suicide is

636
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,120
an illogical action, because you
think you can solve the problem

637
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,640
by killing the body. You solve,
you do not solve the problem

638
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,660
like killing the body. I think
that's that work. I thought was

639
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,500
really I've heard

640
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,200
Unknown: one of those people
interview the lady, yeah, and

641
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,820
she said that she just was
grateful that she survived and

642
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:01,680
never tried again process
whatever her issues were, yeah,

643
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,240
Margaret Hiller: Chris, yes. Do
you and your perspective and

644
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,580
research? Do you feel like the
research is showing that our

645
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,440
prayers, our blessings, our
thoughts are impacting those

646
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,620
beloveds who did suicide or
impact those beloveds we know

647
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:24,440
have crossed over with huge
amounts of angst or fear our

648
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,260
prayers and thoughts impact them
in a

649
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:32,899
Chris Bache: positive way. Yes,
I think so. The community of

650
00:48:32,899 --> 00:48:37,999
Heaven is a community that is in
rapport with the community of

651
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:45,759
Earth, and we, who are embodied
can communicate with and assist

652
00:48:45,939 --> 00:48:49,179
those who have died. And in the
Monroe Institute, there's a

653
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:52,659
program you can they actually
train people how to go into a

654
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:56,139
state of consciousness where
they they literally kind of

655
00:48:56,139 --> 00:49:03,299
leave their body and find people
who are stuck in the post mortem

656
00:49:03,299 --> 00:49:07,679
state and actually assist them
and take them into the park. He

657
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,679
calls it the and once you're in
the park, then you'll be able to

658
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:15,059
get on and there. But a lot of
people, some people, not a lot,

659
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,759
a few people, when they die,
they don't know that they're

660
00:49:17,759 --> 00:49:22,099
dead, or they're confused. They
just kind of disoriented. We

661
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,959
can, we can get to those people
and help them move beyond their

662
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:32,599
uncertainty and their fears. In
Tibetan Buddhism, which I

663
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:36,319
practice within, among other
things, there is a practice

664
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,559
called she troll, which is a
practice for the recently

665
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:44,139
departed. And you do the
practice precisely for someone

666
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:48,999
who is dead, in order to bring
to them the opportunity to turn

667
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:54,879
to move to their soul who might
otherwise get caught. My sister

668
00:49:54,879 --> 00:49:59,439
works for hospice, and so when
she gets clients who are having

669
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:03,599
very good. Difficult death
processes. When she'll ask me to

670
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,879
do, she troll for them and and
so I do a lot of chi troll for

671
00:50:08,879 --> 00:50:12,959
people I don't know. And it
often happens when I'm doing

672
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:16,079
this practice, so that I see
things, I just get visual

673
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:21,199
impressions. And so I always
really careful, because you

674
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,859
know, you don't, never really
know exactly the truth of what

675
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:28,819
it is you're saying. But I relay
them to her, and she relates

676
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:36,139
them to the client's wife,
mother, whatever. And I find

677
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:42,699
consistently, we find that what
I what I see, that what is seen

678
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,859
contains a core truth, which
identifies that it's real, that

679
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:50,559
this person is actually there.
They're wearing a particular

680
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,239
shirt, or they're sitting in a
particular chair, and it's the

681
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:59,199
real shirt, their favorite
shirt, or their real chair. And

682
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:05,099
you I have many times, help
people get into the clear space,

683
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:09,539
the diamond light space. And
this is a practice which has

684
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:13,979
been taught for over 1000 years.
So there's 1000s and 1000s of

685
00:51:13,979 --> 00:51:16,919
beings as a matter of course,
think that they can help the

686
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:20,039
beings who have died to get
where they need to be in order

687
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:23,839
to make clear decisions. So I
very, very much believe that we

688
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,239
can do that. Yes, my

689
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,120
Unknown: husband died last year,
and I was having, I was having a

690
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,380
hard time, like I didn't feel
energy, but trying to block it

691
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:41,720
off, yeah, because I thought it
would go with her if I did that.

692
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,060
So I really thought it started
feel like I was going crazy a

693
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,540
little bit. So this very
intuitive person told me that he

694
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:55,660
was in a learning place and that
he couldn't process a lot while

695
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:01,140
he was alive because he had
autism, which no one knew about,

696
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,900
I mean, those days. So he was in
a burning place to process this

697
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:12,180
life, but he couldn't. And that
she thought, like she thought

698
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,420
his grandfather, or someone like
that was with him, someone who

699
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:21,500
loved him and helping him. And
what after she told me that all

700
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,660
of a sudden it just his energy.
Everything made sense. Yeah, and

701
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,960
and she said, Just be open to
it. Just open to his energy. And

702
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,020
I really felt then that my
relationship with him wasn't

703
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,340
over, and then I was actually
helping him while he was in that

704
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,960
learning place, like when I
would remember him, or feel his

705
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,220
energy very strongly, like I was
helping him to understand, yeah,

706
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:52,960
yeah.

707
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:57,759
Chris Bache: Thank you. Thank
you for sharing that. That's you

708
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:03,959
know, I don't remember the exact
percentage, 60, 70% of husbands

709
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:08,999
and wives whose spouse dies have
experience of being in contact

710
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:12,239
with them in some form or
another. I mean, it's a majority

711
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,599
experience that people have the
experience of the recently

712
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,239
departed, and that's the most
natural thing to in the world,

713
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:23,179
in a universe that I'm
describing here. Of course they

714
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:26,179
would want to come back and
touch base. Of course there

715
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:31,339
would be some rapport. And if
there is that rapport, then we

716
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:32,119
can help them.

717
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:38,599
Unknown: Yes. So, so her
husband, who she's speaking of,

718
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:46,959
was a very good friend of mine,
and it was so interesting when

719
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:53,199
he was very, very, very close to
death, so he had a hospice come

720
00:53:53,199 --> 00:54:00,839
in. So this hospice woman,
because of there was so much

721
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:07,559
prayer in her prayer, and she
could feel so much prayer and so

722
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,279
much going on just prayer. I
mean, it was basically prayer

723
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:17,159
that she was feeling. Saw
Maureen and people with

724
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:23,059
Buddhists that we can so she saw
so much prayer, for lack of

725
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:31,999
better word, even on Randy's
dying moments, he was still able

726
00:54:31,999 --> 00:54:37,579
to encourage somebody, this
hospice worker with with his

727
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:42,339
wife, even though, even though
He was ready to go here. He was

728
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:47,079
still here in spirit. And this
woman, this hospice woman, was

729
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:53,919
so encouraged by the family and
by the praise that she sought,

730
00:54:53,919 --> 00:55:00,479
and by Randy's life, rather than
Randy's death. And. And we know

731
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:04,139
that to be so because she's come
back to his year memorial

732
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:09,119
service. She's come back to, I
think she came back twice, to

733
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:16,379
something we have. It was all
this incredible experience, even

734
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:19,919
though here, there was still so
much encouraging going on here,

735
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:24,919
prayer. Prayer. There was so
much prayer that was clearly

736
00:55:24,919 --> 00:55:25,459
seen

737
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,800
Chris Bache: all this. I mean,
we understand that death is

738
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:39,860
weeping and hurting. We are left
behind, but for the soul who's

739
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:44,440
leaving, it's joy and
celebration. And the more we can

740
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,520
hold joy and celebration, where
we can hold the deep vision,

741
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,700
more we can support them in the
process that they're going

742
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:57,520
through. The worst thing is the
Weeping and Gnashing here to

743
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,840
really think that this is real,
that death is taking place,

744
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,460
termination, end point. This is
all there is. And that's what my

745
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,980
students are taught in
practically every course at the

746
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,940
university they take except
mine. You know, they're taught

747
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,060
biology, biology classes,
chemistry, all their courses

748
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,180
that death is the end doctors or
failures. If they if your

749
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:24,140
patients die, death is
graduation. Death is a great

750
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,920
release. Not this for permanent
release, but it's a great

751
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,940
release. Let me do a time check.
Okay, it's time to shift

752
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,040
categories. Are we ready to
shift? Yeah,

753
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,880
I hope you read we got two of
these in the bookstore. I hope

754
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:52,720
you read these books. These are
wonderful books. Did

755
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,460
Unknown: you bring

756
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:16,500
Chris Bache: it up for everybody
this workshop I'm working right

757
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,480
now on dark night, early on is
about psychedelic research, and

758
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,480
I'm working on a book which is
kind of the next book in this

759
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:28,280
series, and psychedelic research
is my area of specialty as a

760
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,320
philosopher. And so we said,
Okay, I said, How about if we do

761
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:37,100
this on the discussion of death
from the different perspectives,

762
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,940
and psychedelic work is part of
that for me, and if people are

763
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,180
okay with it, if we find that
people are comfortable, maybe

764
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,020
I'll come back next year and
we'll do an entire workshop on

765
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,560
psychedelics, because we have so
many misunderstandings and so

766
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,560
many fears about psychedelics,
and it's, I think it's so

767
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:00,100
important, I think represent a
before And after in

768
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:04,260
philosophical work, because it
just it changes the landscape.

769
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,820
So just a couple of things.
First, we've been doing this for

770
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,780
a long time, and these are three
books which I've just bring

771
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,740
here, just to point out that
psychedelics have been with

772
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:21,000
humanity for a very long time.
And I'm not going to talk about

773
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,440
these books. I just want to
mention them. The first book for

774
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:30,200
us, the visions, written by Alex
pallari Omega that he's one of

775
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,560
the founders of their two
psychedelic two Ayahuasca

776
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:41,980
churches in Brazil, Santo Daime
and vegetal. Ayahuasca is a very

777
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,460
powerful psychedelic which
results in combining two

778
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:50,860
particular plants. It's about
its usage goes back 1500 years.

779
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,800
It's integrated with
Christianity. You know, once the

780
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,680
Spaniards came and brought
Christianity, kind of, there's

781
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:02,640
an amalgam. And it's a very,
very powerful healing substance.

782
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,140
They are now Americans are doing
Ayahuasca, and there is a

783
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,640
community in Ashland who has
taken their case all the way to

784
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,440
the Supreme Court and won the
right to use Ayahuasca as not

785
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,660
Brazilians, as Caucasian
Americans in their community. So

786
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:24,020
when they bring the Ayahuasca
from Brazil, they're met at the

787
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,980
airport by a Department of Drug
Enforcement Agency and a

788
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,880
representative of the church.
It's coming into this country.

789
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,820
There is another Ayahuasca
community in Houston, which is

790
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:41,320
likewise won the right to be
doing Ayahuasca. The second book

791
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,060
is a book by Ralph Metzner on
Ayahuasca. It's an anthology

792
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,660
people's experiences so on and
so forth. And the third book is

793
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:54,040
also by Ralph Metzner. It's an
anthology on sacred mushrooms,

794
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,160
Psilocybin mushrooms, Native
Americans who've been using

795
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,100
mushrooms for years as a healing
ritual. That use Peyote, that

796
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,820
use Mescaline. This is nothing
new. So what I'm going to talk

797
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:10,080
about is not new. What I'm going
to talk about is the rediscovery

798
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,700
of this ancient healing modality
in contemporary scientific

799
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:21,320
context. So the person I'm going
to talk about is Stanislav Grof,

800
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:26,360
who is the foremost authority, I
think, today, on integrating

801
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,780
psychedelics into the
therapeutic process. He was

802
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:35,000
Czechoslovakian, born. He
started his work after

803
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,240
graduating from medical school.
First day after he graduated

804
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,920
from medical school, he did his
first LSD session. He is the

805
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,180
foremost authority on the
psychoactive effects of LSD and

806
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:50,800
integrating it into therapeutic
process. He's written about, I

807
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:57,520
think, 1516, books by now. Stan
is in his upper 70s. This book,

808
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,500
realms on the human unconscious
changed my life. It was

809
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,460
published right about the time I
finished graduate school. So

810
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,280
when I came out of graduate
school and I began work at

811
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,840
Youngstown State, it was only
then that I became aware of the

812
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,480
real significance of
psychedelics. I didn't do drugs

813
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,480
in high school, I didn't do
drugs in college. I did not do

814
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,640
well a little bit I didn't do
drugs in graduate school. Was

815
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,200
only when I was 29 years old
that I began to systematically

816
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,280
begin to work with psychedelics.
Now, in 1978 when I finished

817
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,100
graduate school, my government
had made psychedelics illegal.

818
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:43,660
It said in 1969 1970 there is no
value to these substances.

819
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:49,480
They're going to be scheduled as
we criminalize them. That put me

820
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,200
in a hard spot, because Stan had
just begun to publish. He had

821
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,440
already published hundreds of
articles. There were literally

822
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,680
3000 essays published on
psychedelics in the 60s and 70s,

823
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,640
tremendous therapeutic
potential. But no, it happened.

824
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,640
The 60s happened, and then
everything came crashing to a

825
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:17,160
stop in 1969 i i knew that
psychedelics were going to come

826
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,020
back eventually. I knew that
they were so important that our

827
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:24,620
culture was going to not abandon
them, that we would find our way

828
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:29,540
back to working with these very
powerful sacred medicines. But I

829
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:35,060
knew that by the time we did
that I'd be an old man, and I

830
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:39,560
was not willing to wait. So what
I did was I began to work with

831
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,940
psychedelics using Stan Grof
methodology, and I'll describe

832
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:47,200
that methodology in a second,
but that meant going

833
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,040
underground. And there are I
became part of a community of

834
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,180
people who are working
conscientiously, therapeutically

835
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:58,900
and philosophically with
psychedelics, not like Timothy

836
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:04,920
Leary, not like Ram Dass, not
like Richard Albert Ram Dass in

837
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,460
his previous reincarnation at
Harvard, but doing it in a

838
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:14,340
different kind of modality. But
that meant going underground,

839
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:21,200
and I'm now beginning to write
up that work between 1979 and

840
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:28,640
1999 I did 73 high dose LSD
sessions, massive quantities of

841
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:34,520
LSD. Probably the more LSD than
just about anybody you know. But

842
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,580
I don't look that crazy.

843
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,940
Margaret Hiller: You're not
talking about street drugs.

844
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,320
You're talking about rubber LSD,

845
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:48,399
Chris Bache: I'm talking about
pure pharmaceutical grade. LSD,

846
01:03:48,459 --> 01:03:53,079
what you get on the street, very
different animal. And I'm not

847
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,499
talking about tripping. I mean,
I've read all the literature on

848
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,979
psychedelics, and if you want to
see all the things that went

849
01:03:59,979 --> 01:04:03,419
wrong in the 60s, you can read a
book called storming heaven,

850
01:04:03,479 --> 01:04:06,239
which is a history of
psychedelics in the 60s. There's

851
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:08,939
another book called tripping,
where people share their

852
01:04:08,939 --> 01:04:12,959
experiences of tripping. I'm not
talking about tripping. What's

853
01:04:12,959 --> 01:04:15,599
the difference between the
therapeutic use of psychedelics

854
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:20,399
and tripping? First of all, let
me just restrict myself to

855
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:21,379
those. Yeah, go ahead.

856
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,020
Unknown: I really hate to do
this, right? I didn't ask two

857
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:28,520
questions I had about the
previous really regret. They'll

858
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:34,820
tie into this. But um, okay,
well, people are the one we're

859
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:39,140
at, that jumping off place and
that clarity that, if you know

860
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,420
or suicide are checking out that
that realization that we can't

861
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,660
leave, we can get rid of the
body. I had that experience. It

862
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,180
was very powerful. It was just
one of the most powerful

863
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:53,680
experiences I've ever had. And
it was so clear that I would

864
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,320
just have to start over, be
stuck there just was not an

865
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,840
interesting place. And it never
cost my money, and in a real

866
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,860
way, yeah, I've also. Had an
experience, kind of induced by

867
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:05,280
some of this stuff and other
things, where there was no way I

868
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,920
could see the things I was
seeing with my eyes, and I was

869
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,680
way too far away, but I could
normally hear people, and felt

870
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,700
like I was leaving and torn in
that, in that state of absolute

871
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,940
bliss, but also not done here,
and knowing that I wasn't done

872
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:22,640
here, but what I thought was a
hallucination over time, after

873
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,840
connecting with people that were
within a few short distance in

874
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,420
that place where everything I
heard them say was what they

875
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:32,180
were saying, the direction they
were standing, facing what they

876
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:36,020
were everything they were doing
and saying they told me was

877
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:38,600
real. I thought it was all. I
thought it was hallucination,

878
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,540
but these were all real
experiences. Yeah, and the

879
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,040
questions of this forgiveness.
So the other things said that,

880
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:51,040
yeah, when we're you, I got
really confused when I first got

881
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,220
here, because I just have a
strong releases and some that I

882
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,980
can't really understand. But the
one, this illusion of

883
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,320
separateness, I believe that
we're all interconnected, but I

884
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:03,060
don't comprehend it in words and
but also the solution of time

885
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:08,760
and space. Do you believe? Do
you believe we talk about these

886
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,580
different spaces, that we go
through different transitions,

887
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:17,880
that we can access any time in
space, if we're in tune, it's

888
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:19,680
tricky.

889
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,500
Chris Bache: Einstein taught us
that the universe we live in is

890
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,680
a time space. It's a four
dimensional universe, right?

891
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,680
Three dimensions of space and
one dimension of time. And so

892
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:35,480
time and space is a Unified
Fabric. And we have reasons to

893
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,940
think that there are parts of
the universe which are traveling

894
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:43,180
faster than light, and therefore
they they are not inhibited by

895
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:52,360
time the way we are in the large
size of things. If you are able

896
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,180
to enter into a state of
consciousness in which you move

897
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,980
beyond space as we know it, part
of that is also moving beyond

898
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:04,980
time as we know it, and so I do.
I know from personal experience

899
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:08,640
that it is possible to move into
trans, what psychologists call

900
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,900
trans temporal experience, or to
move in a different temporal

901
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,860
reality, to move outside time
and space as we ordinarily think

902
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:22,700
of it. But it's not like there's
time and then no time, there may

903
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,060
permeability, there's a
permeability, and there may be

904
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:32,000
variations on the time space
continuum. So that you can move

905
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,120
into states of awareness where
1000 years will pass in five

906
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,880
seconds. You're in a temporally
dilated state. You can move into

907
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:48,940
100,000 million year time
landscapes. These are, this is

908
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:52,060
just the way time exists in
those variables. And you can

909
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:56,320
move completely outside time and
space reality altogether, and go

910
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:02,100
into reality which is not time
limited at all. So I think that

911
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,560
there are variations on this
process.

912
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,280
Unknown: And when we tap into
those things where you're

913
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,860
talking about, you know, what
shirt someone was wearing, or

914
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,500
examples like that, which I've
experienced. And like I said, I

915
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:20,340
thought they're hallucination.
You think that's a amplified

916
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:24,080
clarity just hyper senses.

917
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,180
Chris Bache: It's not that there
are not hallucinations, which is

918
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:34,280
to see something which isn't
real, but there are true,

919
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:39,440
legitimate visions where you see
things which are real, but are

920
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,060
are not restricted by time,
space, reality the way we

921
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,840
eventually think of it.
Traditionally, we say all of its

922
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,800
hallucinations, but there are
people who have experiences, and

923
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,620
people who have near death
experiences, who go into the

924
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:58,720
future, and that future happens
the way they saw it, enough that

925
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:02,520
we know that it is possible to
have vision, to have experiences

926
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:08,160
of future reality, even in
times, in this time and space

927
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:13,680
moment. So we know that it's
possible. Then after that, we

928
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,240
have to go to the particulars.

929
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:21,199
Margaret Hiller: Well, also what
he's talking about, our

930
01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:24,679
consciousness can be in more
than one place at a time. So our

931
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:29,899
consciousness can be expansive
enough that we can pick up on a

932
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,979
conversation or see things, hear
things, sense things where our

933
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:40,599
body isn't over there, but our
our sense, our spiritual

934
01:09:40,599 --> 01:09:44,859
sensing, I guess, is the best
term that's coming down we can

935
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:49,239
where we have that available

936
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:54,580
Chris Bache: to us. A woman's
playing golf and a particular

937
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,460
tea at a particular time,
suddenly she has an overwhelming

938
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:01,680
sense that one of her children
is in trouble. It, and she plays

939
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,680
out the golf game, and she goes
home, and she gets a phone call

940
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,680
as soon as she gets inside, and
it turns out her son had just

941
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,880
had a car accident exactly at
the minute when she felt it at

942
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,020
that particular time on the golf
course. So part of her is

943
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:20,540
obviously capable of sensing
beyond her physical senses. And

944
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:26,960
we have lots of cases like that.
What's the difference between

945
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:32,480
tripping and serious psychedelic
work? First of all, and of

946
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,940
course, there are many
psychedelics. I mean, you have

947
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:41,560
to take them individually. LSD,
Psilocybin, MDMA, MDT, DMT. So I

948
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,820
don't want to oversimplify, but
basically what we mean when we

949
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:48,880
classify a substance as a
psychedelic. And I never use the

950
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,140
word hallucinogen, because
that's a pejorative materialist

951
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,720
description, because the
hallucination is when you see

952
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,900
something which isn't there, but
that's to make a metaphysical

953
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:02,520
judgment, and I want to use that
category. Some people call it

954
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,380
entheogenous, that which awakens
the divine within. That's okay.

955
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:11,340
If you have a pretty broad
definition of God, I prefer the

956
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:15,900
term psychedelic mind opener,
mind expander. What these

957
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:20,160
substances do is they
hypersensitize consciousness.

958
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,900
They amplify consciousness. They
do not give you a particular

959
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:28,580
experience. They do not cause
you to see two people, 100

960
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:32,780
people on a psychedelic do not
have the same experience. They

961
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:36,320
hyper amplify your
consciousness. And then what

962
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:40,840
happens is a function of
consciousness itself, not a

963
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:46,420
function of the drug. It's a
function of the aroused state of

964
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:52,360
consciousness. Usually when
people take psychedelics,

965
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,240
they're usually a recreation
taking in recreation. They want

966
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,500
to, kind of have fun, have a
party, and they use this hyper

967
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,540
stimulated state, and they stay
in dialog in the physical world,

968
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,600
and the physical senses come in.
Their hypersensitive

969
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,160
consciousness kind of rises up.
They get a swirling mishmash of

970
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,700
hallucinations and trails and
spins. And they kind of have

971
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:18,360
some fun. Go to a party. The
music is so intense and and the

972
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:22,040
insights are sort of so
interesting. And when it's all

973
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,860
over, nothing has changed.
They've just kind of entertained

974
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,820
themselves for a few hours. The
Native Americans are not

975
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:32,180
interested in tripping. They
were only interested in serious,

976
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,480
sacred medicine work. And the
difference is this, when you

977
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:39,080
work in a therapeutic modality,
first of all, you isolate

978
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,640
yourself from the physical
world. In the old days, they

979
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,920
would climb into a Kiva. You
know what a Kiva is an

980
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:49,180
underground cave, underground
hole in the ground, where they

981
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,240
go down a ladder, and then
you're sitting around the fire.

982
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:56,260
You pull up the ladder, you're
there till dawn. So you in

983
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:59,380
contemporary context, you're
lying down and you're wearing

984
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:04,140
eye shades. You're not in any
contact with the physical world,

985
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,380
so that whatever you experience,
you know what's coming from you.

986
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:12,660
That's kind of important. And
then you're listening to very

987
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:18,720
carefully selected music. And we
if psychedelic has a particular

988
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:22,940
time curve, we know if you're
taking LSD, it's going to have

989
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,240
an acceleration. It's going to
impact within about total 45

990
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,880
minutes. You're going to be on a
peak that's going to last maybe

991
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,340
four or five hours. It's going
to have a tail that's going to

992
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:34,760
last another three or four
hours. And we know that we can

993
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,480
choose music that will support
what happens in each of those

994
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,400
stages. So there's essays and
works which have been written on

995
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,520
the kind of music you want to
help you break through and to

996
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,760
confront what you need to
confront, and then slowly

997
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:52,120
integrate and then slowly come
back and return. It's a

998
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:56,440
complicated process, but the
basic vision is this, when you

999
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:00,240
hyper stipulate your
consciousness, what starts to

1000
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,820
happen is that your
consciousness starts to purify

1001
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,300
itself. It starts to heal
itself. And in order to heal

1002
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:11,340
itself, it has to bring forward
what needs healing. So it has to

1003
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:15,480
bring forward all the pain. It
has to bring forward anything

1004
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,180
which is unfinished business,
and sometimes from this life,

1005
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:21,860
sometimes from other lifetimes.
It brings forward physical

1006
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:24,620
trauma, when you had whooping
cough, when you were five years

1007
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:28,580
old, and you almost died, and
the physical memory of that is

1008
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,540
still in your mind.

1009
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,860
It brings forward all the
existential questions. It brings

1010
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,520
forth all the deep, deep
philosophical questions. It

1011
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,480
brings forward all the
uncertainty we have about

1012
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,240
whether life is meaningful,
whether there is any logic to

1013
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:57,700
the process. And basically what
happens is, as the system begins

1014
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:02,460
to detoxify itself, you come to
Christ. Crisis points. And most

1015
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,780
people, when they confront these
crisis points, the same thing to

1016
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,960
do is kind of go away. You do
not want to go into the pain.

1017
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,380
You want to get away from the
pain. But in therapy, when

1018
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,980
you're working therapeutically
or as a sacred medicine, you

1019
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:20,960
learn to go into the pain. You
learn to go deeper and deeper

1020
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,280
into what it is. It's causing
you problems. If you learn to go

1021
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:30,080
into the pain, the pain becomes
your ally, and you suffer. You

1022
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,080
suffer terribly. You suffer
physically. There's tremendous

1023
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:37,040
physical pain involved, and you
suffer psychologically, and you

1024
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,560
suffer existentially and
spiritually. But if you navigate

1025
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:45,640
that crisis skillfully, if you,
if you have a good sitter, by

1026
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:49,180
the way, you never, ever want to
do this by yourself. I mean,

1027
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:52,180
it's just it's not safe. You
need somebody there who's going

1028
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,180
to control the outer world. You
need somebody who's going to be

1029
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:59,860
your lifeline. If you navigate
that confrontation successfully,

1030
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:04,380
the pattern is you reach a
crisis point. You reach a

1031
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:08,520
breakthrough point, and you have
to be comfortable losing

1032
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,420
control. Because you lose
control, your mind is

1033
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:16,680
functioning 100 times more power
than it normally functions. You

1034
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:21,980
lose control, and you go through
some type of death process. You

1035
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:27,620
go through some type of absolute
loss of your life as you know

1036
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:36,440
it, you die. And the miracle is,
after you're completely dead,

1037
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:42,640
you wake up in a different
reality, in a different world,

1038
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:46,420
as a different kind of being
than you were going into it.

1039
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,260
There have been people who have
done psychedelics, heavy

1040
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:54,880
psychedelics, for 100 150 times
that have never, ever gone

1041
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,380
through this process. It's not
easy, it's not fun, it's

1042
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:02,880
excruciatingly difficult work.
And all the Native American

1043
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,940
traditions know this. The
Ayahuasca traditions know this.

1044
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,900
The Eleusinian Mysteries know
this. In ancient Greece, at

1045
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:18,180
Plato Aristotle Bardo as a
philosopher, when I read Stan's

1046
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:23,000
work, I knew that this was a
methodology that allowed us to

1047
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:28,220
actually explore the
consciousness of the universe in

1048
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,180
a way that

1049
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,840
there are other traditions,
there are other ways to explore

1050
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,340
the universe. I mean, there are
people who withdraw into the

1051
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:46,360
mountains for decades and
decades of isolation and

1052
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,840
meditation to explore the
universe. The Kalahari Bushmen

1053
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:53,380
explore the universe through
trance dancing. Some people

1054
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:57,460
explore by nearly dying. It's a
very effective way. It's kind of

1055
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:01,980
difficult going through sacred
medicine, work is simply a

1056
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:05,820
different modality of doing what
human beings have always done,

1057
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:11,040
and that is to explore the world
that we live in. And very

1058
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,300
quickly, you find out that your
individual ego is just a shell.

1059
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:19,200
It's just a shell that you can
you can dissolve. You can pop

1060
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:23,060
it. It's a balloon that just
pops. And when you pop it, you

1061
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:25,340
move into a deeper state of
consciousness where you

1062
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:30,620
literally are a different life
form. You're not simply a human

1063
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,220
being, but you can kind of move
into a state in which you

1064
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:39,500
literally become humanity
itself. You can move into merger

1065
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,880
with the collective psyche of
the human species, and the

1066
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:48,700
purification continues at that
level. You don't you go through

1067
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:53,860
the Death-Rebirth process again
in subsequent sessions, but now,

1068
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:58,780
no longer as an individual, but
now as humanity, you go through

1069
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,340
the cycle of Death-Rebirth, I've
learned is a cycle that repeats

1070
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:09,660
itself over and over again, the
deeper and deeper you go along

1071
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:16,380
the way, when you break through
into this deeper reality. That's

1072
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,100
why I feel deep kinship with
Eben Alexander and near his

1073
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:24,860
episode people, because they're
talking about things that I know

1074
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:29,300
from personal experience. You
can go through the death process

1075
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,260
before you actually die
physically, and then, in many

1076
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:36,620
ways, the spiritual death
process is much worse than the

1077
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:39,260
physical death process, because
when you go through the physical

1078
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:43,180
process of dying. Part of you
knows that the psyche is okay,

1079
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,360
because you've been through this
before. The psyche is going to

1080
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,780
not going to be killed by the
body dying. But if you go

1081
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:53,020
through a spiritual death
process, you're going through a

1082
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:56,800
process which is actually deeper
than physical dying, because

1083
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,840
that nucleus which transfers
intact. After the death of the

1084
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:05,880
body, it is that Numinous which
is itself dying in this process.

1085
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,780
Why would you do something as
stupid as that? Why would you go

1086
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:18,720
into that much suffering in
order? And the answer is, well,

1087
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:22,400
I was trained as a philosopher.
I wanted to know what the

1088
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,280
structure of the universe was. I
wanted to explore whether there

1089
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,360
was any meaningful tapestry. I
mean, I wanted to cross the

1090
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,020
ocean. I wanted to see what was
there. And you can, you can

1091
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:37,400
explore what's there. You can
come to have first hand personal

1092
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:44,740
experience of the larger cosmic
we are part of and it's not for

1093
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:48,040
everybody. It's not, certainly
not for I don't advise it for a

1094
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:53,920
lot of people. You don't need to
do it, but you can do it. And if

1095
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,820
you do it, one of the things
that happens is you lose your

1096
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:01,500
fear of death, absolutely, for
the same reason that here this

1097
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,340
episode of people lose their
fear of death, because you know

1098
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:10,920
experientially that you are a
being who cannot die. It's

1099
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,120
impossible for you to die as a
spiritual being. Your physical

1100
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:19,800
being can die. Your personality
can die. But that germ you were

1101
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,380
talking about, the underlying
essence that cannot die. It can

1102
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:29,480
only be liberated in deeper,
deeper manifestation. So if you

1103
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:33,560
want to look well, this all the
books I've shown you are kind of

1104
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:39,860
pretty easy reading. This is not
a difficult book to read. This

1105
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:46,540
is first book. But if you're in
terms of death, these books are

1106
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,480
what I consider the most
important of Stan's many books

1107
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:59,200
focused on the issue of death.
Now the first one, and the

1108
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,980
reason these look all kind of
rumpled is because these are my

1109
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:06,300
books. I snapped them on the
scanner and took a picture of

1110
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:12,960
them. LSD therapy. Psychotherapy
is a manual that was written in

1111
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,520
1980 a manual written for
doctors and nurses and

1112
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:24,260
psychologists on how to do LSD
psychotherapy. It's a nuts and

1113
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:31,040
bolts methodology. He wrote this
after LSD was illegal, and he

1114
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,160
wrote it for two reasons. One,
he knew people were doing this

1115
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,720
work anyway, underground. And
two, he knew that we would get

1116
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,680
back to it. We would bring it
back within our repertoire of

1117
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:45,160
scientific investigation, and it
was important to document and

1118
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,880
Stan. By this time, had over
5000 sessions with LSD, sessions

1119
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,300
with with his clients. He had
been doing this work for 20

1120
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,680
years before it was illegal, and
he wanted to bring it down to

1121
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:01,740
document. This is a technical
manual on how to run LSD

1122
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:05,460
sessions, counter indication,
screening, indications. How do

1123
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:08,220
you manage it? The difference
between low dose therapy and

1124
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:12,540
high dose therapy very
different. Low dose therapy is

1125
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:19,020
kind of peeling the onion by
layer by layer. High Dose

1126
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:21,980
therapy is like blowing through
the layers very quickly, going

1127
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:25,700
right through the layers. It's a
very different kind of project.

1128
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,620
He did logos therapy and
Czechoslovakia, taking people

1129
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:35,060
into 100 sessions, layer by
layer, layer by layer, resolving

1130
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:38,540
it, layer by layer, gave them a
very detailed map. When he came

1131
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:42,100
to Spring Grove Hospital,
Baltimore, Maryland. They

1132
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,040
started a new research project
working with terminally ill

1133
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,100
patients, cancer patients, they
were terminally ill. It was not

1134
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:52,180
any attempt to try to heal them.
What they were trying to do was

1135
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:56,740
prepare them for dying. And so
they did a maximum of three

1136
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:01,260
sessions, high dose. Basically,
they were experimenting with

1137
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:04,980
triggering a Near-Death
Experience deliberately under

1138
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:09,540
controlled circumstances. And
they succeeded. They succeeded.

1139
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,840
Tell us how, how? Yeah.

1140
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,120
Margaret Hiller: I mean, what
did people report? I mean, was

1141
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,240
the anxiety about death so
diminished that it was

1142
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,020
completely gone? Or how? Give us
a report.

1143
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:25,100
Chris Bache: Well, there's he
wrote. He co wrote a book with

1144
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:28,280
his then wife, Joan Halifax was
an anthropologist who's now a

1145
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:32,660
Zen Roshi called a human
encounter with death. If you

1146
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:35,780
wanted to see the actual
details, go to that book, a

1147
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:41,440
human encounter with death. What
they were found that we can if

1148
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:46,180
you take a very, very high dose
of LSD and you contain it, you

1149
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:49,720
compress it, you go through lots
of layers. You go through a lot

1150
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,840
of psychodynamic layers. But you
can you go through a

1151
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:57,340
Death-Rebirth process that
basically projects you into a

1152
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:00,360
state of consciousness, which is
the consciousness that. You move

1153
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:05,460
into when you die. From that
perspective, you can, you can

1154
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,880
awaken the awareness that we saw
in near death episode. People

1155
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:12,120
said I was remembering. How
could I have forgotten this? I

1156
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,060
was remembering. Well, that's
what happens in these sessions.

1157
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:19,260
People remember who they are.
They remember the deeper truth

1158
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:22,820
some people, one person was a
very, very modest he was a

1159
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:27,680
janitor, a very modest
intellectual. And he was

1160
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:32,000
Catholic, very traditional
Catholic. And he had a very,

1161
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,800
very detailed encounter with
reincarnation, and he came back.

1162
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,500
He was all embarrassed. He
really didn't know what to do,

1163
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,360
because he saw the truth of
reincarnation in his sessions,

1164
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:47,500
and he had integrate that into
his Catholicism.

1165
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:53,860
Unknown: Yeah, okay, so what I'm
hearing is okay, so I don't have

1166
01:25:53,860 --> 01:26:00,060
the experience I never, for lack
of a better word, tripped, but I

1167
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:05,520
was very, very much in that
realm. Many, many people around

1168
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:10,620
me in that time and everything
you're saying, everything you're

1169
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:15,480
saying, sound exactly what I've
personally witnessed in people.

1170
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:24,740
Of course, it was underground.
Yes, underground. So I'm not

1171
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:27,800
understanding the difference.
And I don't want to get caught

1172
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:34,100
up here, just on the words, but
what you're saying, I have, I've

1173
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:41,200
seen that happen with people,
not, you know, in a not in the

1174
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,300
climate that you're talking
about, but

1175
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,000
in, yeah, outside of that, yeah,

1176
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:52,900
Chris Bache: you know, if you,
if you take a psychedelic, if

1177
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:56,920
you take, Let's, let's stay with
LSD from the end,

1178
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:06,600
you do if you stay in touch with
the world. You know, people talk

1179
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,820
about a bad trip. That was bad
ass, you know, that was a bad

1180
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:15,420
trip. I don't ever want to go
back there again. But in

1181
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:20,720
therapy, a bad trip is a good
trip. Yeah? Well, in the street,

1182
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,300
a bad trip is just a bad trip.
It's something you want to

1183
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,180
avoid. You do not want to go
into it. What you learn in

1184
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:30,260
therapy is a bad trip means your
system is purifying itself, and

1185
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:33,500
you want to, you want to purge
those poisons, and you want to

1186
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:38,840
go deeper into that, because
when you purge those poisons,

1187
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:42,400
your system is going to move
into a deeper experience of

1188
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:47,380
reality. You There are lots of
times, and if you read the

1189
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,960
literature like this book
tripping, you'll see people have

1190
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,140
all sorts of glimpses into
interconnectivity and glimpses

1191
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:57,700
into and they'll have, you know,
various psychic experiences

1192
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:00,540
where they can merge with the
mind of people around them, or

1193
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:05,760
things like this. The difference
is one of degree and one of

1194
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:12,420
clarity and one of lasting
impact. It's the degree clarity

1195
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,440
and lasting impact.

1196
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:16,439
Unknown: So if you did ask it,
and you changed your whole life,

1197
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:21,539
you know reason to ask it when
sand those trucks got hijacked,

1198
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:24,679
and that was like the ultimate
aspect, because it was

1199
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:30,319
pharmaceutical acid, and it was
my 60s, and it was exactly like

1200
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:33,439
what you're talking about. I
mean, I you, one of the things

1201
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:36,259
Steven Job said was one of the
better choices he made when he

1202
01:28:36,259 --> 01:28:40,299
was in college was to do acid.
You know, I see that as having

1203
01:28:40,299 --> 01:28:43,299
lasting impact with him. I mean,
a lot, somebody said you

1204
01:28:43,299 --> 01:28:46,959
wouldn't have your iPad. Was it
for acid? Definitely wouldn't

1205
01:28:46,959 --> 01:28:52,299
have the music on it, you know.
So I've been around people in

1206
01:28:52,299 --> 01:28:55,179
all realms of drug use, people
that are just screwing around

1207
01:28:55,179 --> 01:28:59,319
and want to have a good time.
And the stuff that passed for

1208
01:28:59,319 --> 01:29:04,619
LSD for some recent decades
which bore no resemblance, I

1209
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:07,019
remember as LSD,

1210
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:12,360
Chris Bache: the Discover of DNA
now kind of as admitted to see

1211
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:16,320
the critical breakthrough came
through when he was on LSD and

1212
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,200
Rupert Sheldrake and this
important Morphic field theory

1213
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:21,080
was LSD that gave you that
breaks,

1214
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,520
Margaret Hiller: and Alex Gray,
so

1215
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:27,980
Unknown: we may not have been
doing it in a clinical setting,

1216
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:31,100
but you can't just write off all
the things that came from that

1217
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,920
because they were entirely life
changing. I don't

1218
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,780
Chris Bache: mean write it off
or diminish it. I certainly

1219
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,320
don't. And they are life
changing, and they were culture

1220
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:46,960
changing. They gave us a
different culture. And yet, at

1221
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,020
the same time, there is a
difference. Because if you read,

1222
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,200
for example, I think the best
history of the 60s is storming

1223
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,740
heaven, and I can't remember the
author's name, it's a wonderful

1224
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:02,640
book. But what happened is a lot
of that. Catalytic energy. It

1225
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,500
washed through us, but it didn't
take root. It didn't hold it

1226
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,860
kind of it changed lives, but it
didn't change our culture the

1227
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:16,440
way we hoped it would. It just
washed through and what I hope

1228
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,480
is that when we come back into
it, in this next wave, we can

1229
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,720
get a leverage that will help us
change the fundamental culture,

1230
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,640
that will help us change the
understanding

1231
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:28,940
Margaret Hiller: Chris, as you,
as you know you and I talked

1232
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:33,440
about this, my hesitation even
having this segment in the

1233
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:39,320
workshop, because there's still
so much misunderstanding about

1234
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:47,500
psychedelic research. So there's
a cultural prejudice about still

1235
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:53,500
so, but the whole idea that
these substances are naturally

1236
01:30:53,500 --> 01:31:00,640
occurring and have been used for
1000s of years for expanding

1237
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:05,880
consciousness, that there's
there has to be some good reason

1238
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:12,780
why these substances were a part
of our human experience. And

1239
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:20,340
what I'm really interested in is
looking at how many people, now

1240
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:25,100
current day who are returning to
this as the sacred medicine

1241
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:30,440
you're talking about. It hasn't
always been used as sacred as we

1242
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:33,980
know. We can take anything and
make it sacred or unsacred. It's

1243
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:39,560
certainly been used in unsacred
ways, but the sacred ceremonial

1244
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:49,360
use to expand our consciousness.
This is what I'm and I'm looking

1245
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,920
at a lot of the I know medical
doctors who actually do

1246
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:59,560
Ayahuasca with their patients a
week or so before they do major

1247
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:05,220
surgery. You know, they're doing
it as sacred medicine, and

1248
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:08,880
that's really what I'm
interested in, and I'm

1249
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:15,540
personally, I'm encouraged that
more people in the medical field

1250
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:22,820
are catching hold of sacred
medicine, versus medicine that's

1251
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:29,720
killing us. We're being killed
by, quote, medicine. So if

1252
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:35,000
there's another way to use
sacred medicine, especially with

1253
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,300
treating depression and anxiety
fear,

1254
01:32:38,899 --> 01:32:41,139
Chris Bache: Johns Hopkins is
doing a research project.

1255
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,479
They've already published out
that they're continuing on the

1256
01:32:43,479 --> 01:32:47,859
use of Psilocybin in depression.
The use of Psilocybin to treat

1257
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:51,639
post traumatic stress syndrome
and DNA is being used with

1258
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:56,619
returning vets to treat post
traumatic stress syndrome, so

1259
01:32:56,619 --> 01:33:02,219
we're beginning to bring it back
into a therapeutic modality. IPO

1260
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:07,139
gain is an African psychedelic
which has extra ordinary

1261
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:11,279
capacity to interrupt addiction,
even cocaine and heroin

1262
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:14,819
addiction, which, as you know,
is the most powerful. The one

1263
01:33:15,059 --> 01:33:18,719
gets a grip on the soul and it's
hard to let go. IPO gain can

1264
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,819
produce a window of
detoxification of about two

1265
01:33:22,819 --> 01:33:26,119
months that will allow you to
then intervene, follow up with

1266
01:33:26,119 --> 01:33:32,419
interventions of conventional
therapeutic interventions. So we

1267
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:36,979
have a whole new kind of
generation of young researchers

1268
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:42,699
who are beginning to use the
sacred medicines for healing.

1269
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:47,799
Now, personally, I'm not a
psychologist, and I'm not

1270
01:33:47,859 --> 01:33:52,059
interested. I'm not my project
is not healing. Stan is a

1271
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:54,819
psychiatrist. His project is
healing. He's been all over the

1272
01:33:54,819 --> 01:33:57,939
world, and he's developed non
drug modalities for entering

1273
01:33:57,939 --> 01:34:02,039
into these states. You know, I
should mention No, he was always

1274
01:34:02,039 --> 01:34:06,959
doing certain certified
protocols, government sanctioned

1275
01:34:06,959 --> 01:34:11,219
protocols. And when LSD was no
longer legal, he and his wife

1276
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:14,459
developed a non drug protocol
for entering into these states

1277
01:34:14,459 --> 01:34:18,839
called Holotropic Breathwork, so
that there are other modalities

1278
01:34:18,839 --> 01:34:22,759
for entering into these states.
I was a philosopher. I was kind

1279
01:34:22,759 --> 01:34:26,059
of like Aldous Huxley, you
mentioned. I'm interested in

1280
01:34:26,059 --> 01:34:31,159
cosmology. I'm interested in in
the structure of the universe,

1281
01:34:31,639 --> 01:34:36,259
in that's a different project
than healing. But if we can get

1282
01:34:36,259 --> 01:34:42,039
the sacred medicines back into
the repertoire of healers, then

1283
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:45,699
underneath healing the
personality, and underneath

1284
01:34:45,699 --> 01:34:50,499
healing the heart, there is
healing the soul. And the only

1285
01:34:50,499 --> 01:34:55,059
way to heal the soul is to
connect with the essence of

1286
01:34:55,059 --> 01:34:58,239
life, the essence of the soul
itself. And when you connect,

1287
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:01,079
when you take it the healing
down to the. That level, the

1288
01:35:01,079 --> 01:35:05,039
only way to heal the soul is to
connect with the universe and to

1289
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:08,999
enter into communion with the
universe itself. And that is the

1290
01:35:08,999 --> 01:35:13,739
classic work of Mystics and
Saints. And you know, lifelong

1291
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:16,559
meditators, to me, psychedelics,

1292
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:19,980
they're not they're not a
shortcut,

1293
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:24,379
but what they are is an
intensifier of spiritual

1294
01:35:24,379 --> 01:35:28,459
process. You can accelerate it.
Now, I wouldn't do what I did

1295
01:35:28,519 --> 01:35:34,339
again. I mean, I I chose to work
with very high doses. I did

1296
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:39,799
psychedelic work for 73
sessions, and this is wear and

1297
01:35:39,799 --> 01:35:42,579
tear the customer. I wouldn't
take that aggressive an approach

1298
01:35:42,699 --> 01:35:45,819
now, now that I know what I
know, I would take a much

1299
01:35:45,819 --> 01:35:56,439
genitalr path into it, having
said that I wouldn't trade the

1300
01:35:56,439 --> 01:35:59,139
tentative name I'm working with
on this book. You know, you'll

1301
01:35:59,139 --> 01:36:02,219
Chene, maybe, but right now. I'm
calling it stealing diamonds

1302
01:36:02,219 --> 01:36:11,639
from heaven, because imagine you
could have a near death episode

1303
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:14,459
like we just touched on you read
in some of these books, imagine

1304
01:36:14,459 --> 01:36:22,279
if you could have that
experience 40 times. That's what

1305
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:25,099
we're looking at. What if we
could, not only just a few

1306
01:36:25,099 --> 01:36:30,799
handfuls of individuals, what if
we could take 1000 individuals

1307
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:36,979
and take them into this
initiatory process 100 times and

1308
01:36:36,979 --> 01:36:43,059
gather all of their experiences
and integrate them into a

1309
01:36:43,539 --> 01:36:46,899
visual, a picture of the
structure of the universe.

1310
01:36:47,559 --> 01:36:50,679
That's what I think wrong. We're
right on the cusp of doing we're

1311
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:54,219
on the edge of being able to do
that work in the traditions that

1312
01:36:54,219 --> 01:36:57,999
work with sacred medicines. You
know what they say? They say

1313
01:36:58,179 --> 01:37:02,039
these medicines were given to us
by the sacred, because the

1314
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:07,559
sacred knew when we incarnated
we were going to forget. And so

1315
01:37:07,559 --> 01:37:10,019
the sacred medicines are about
remembering. They're about

1316
01:37:10,019 --> 01:37:13,079
waking us up and helping us
remember what we forgot when we

1317
01:37:13,079 --> 01:37:18,479
incarnated. And what are we
trying to remember? We're trying

1318
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:21,739
to remember who we are, what we
are, what the purpose of life

1319
01:37:21,799 --> 01:37:25,939
is, what is our connection to
each other. We're trying to

1320
01:37:25,939 --> 01:37:30,559
remember the fundamental truths
of life. When you remember, then

1321
01:37:30,859 --> 01:37:35,119
just along the side death
disappears. There's not an

1322
01:37:35,179 --> 01:37:39,679
anxiety around death. The same
insights that emerge near death

1323
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:45,399
episode work emerge in sacred
medicine, work you just that is

1324
01:37:45,399 --> 01:37:46,239
not a problem.

1325
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:54,580
Audience 3: Yeah, Chris, I write
the legal form across 10 times.

1326
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:56,320
Yeah. And, and

1327
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:01,260
what you're talking about right
now is I had an experience

1328
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:06,360
there, but I never had in my
life. And I was transforming it.

1329
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:11,760
I don't see the world, you know.
I lost all sensation on my body.

1330
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,360
I was flying around, out in
space. I was hearing a lot of

1331
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:19,080
booming voices saying, where I
am with God and, you know? And I

1332
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:23,540
felt totally, totally bliss. I
did not want to come back, and

1333
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:26,420
the next thing I knew is the
facilitator opened my eyes, and

1334
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:36,080
she said, Are you all right? But
that that was an absolutely

1335
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:43,240
tremendous experience like that.
I can't it's, it's like, anybody

1336
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:46,180
who goes for any of the
experiences, you can say words,

1337
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:50,680
there's no language to describe
that. It's an experience that I

1338
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:53,200
had, and there's been none in
life,

1339
01:38:55,479 --> 01:38:59,199
Chris Bache: in a wedding. The
psychedelic aspect is a red

1340
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:03,479
herring. It's like, it's not
about psychedelics. It's

1341
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:05,639
Holotropic Breathwork. You know
how they do it?

1342
01:39:06,299 --> 01:39:11,459
Hyperventilation, internal body
work, music and hyperventilation

1343
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:16,139
for a couple of hours at a time.
It's psychedelics. It's just a

1344
01:39:16,139 --> 01:39:19,379
method. It's not what we're
looking at is the Release

1345
01:39:19,379 --> 01:39:24,499
Potential of consciousness,
nature, mind itself, and that's

1346
01:39:24,559 --> 01:39:29,599
important, and you can you can
release that power by nearly

1347
01:39:29,599 --> 01:39:33,979
dying. You can release that
power with hypnosis, or you can

1348
01:39:33,979 --> 01:39:40,119
release it through psychedelics
or meditation. Meditation. My,

1349
01:39:40,359 --> 01:39:45,759
my first wife, whom I love
dearly. She was my sitter for

1350
01:39:45,759 --> 01:39:48,999
all of my work. For 20 years,
she was my sitter. She's a

1351
01:39:48,999 --> 01:39:53,079
clinical psychologist. She never
did a single session herself.

1352
01:39:54,339 --> 01:39:57,759
She's one of the most she's very
spiritually oriented person. Her

1353
01:39:57,759 --> 01:40:01,559
path is meditation. She's
completed her. Three year soul

1354
01:40:01,559 --> 01:40:04,139
meditation retreat to the
Tibetan Buddhist tradition.

1355
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:08,999
She's a natural meditator. She
never did a psychedelic session,

1356
01:40:08,999 --> 01:40:12,779
but she was my she was my
lifeline during all of my

1357
01:40:12,779 --> 01:40:17,039
psychedelic sessions. And it was
only after doing about 15 years

1358
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:22,279
of this work that I began to
understand her. It's not about

1359
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:25,399
psychedelics, it's about
different methods for working

1360
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:27,859
with consciousness. We're coming
to the end of our time. Let me

1361
01:40:27,859 --> 01:40:34,579
just mention. The cosmic game
was written four books after LSD

1362
01:40:34,579 --> 01:40:38,479
psychotherapy. Stan wrote
several books about for written

1363
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:41,319
for clinicians, written in the
clinical methodology, looking

1364
01:40:41,319 --> 01:40:44,859
for all the indications, and so
on, so forth. Eventually, he

1365
01:40:44,859 --> 01:40:48,819
wrote a book which is about the
cosmic logical implications of

1366
01:40:48,819 --> 01:40:53,319
this work, the model of the
universe that emerges from deep,

1367
01:40:53,319 --> 01:40:56,679
psychedelic work. And that's
this book, The cosmic game. It's

1368
01:40:56,739 --> 01:41:01,559
a wonderful, wonderful book. And
then later, he wrote this last

1369
01:41:01,559 --> 01:41:05,699
book, the ultimate journey,
which is specifically the

1370
01:41:05,699 --> 01:41:10,079
ultimate journey, is death. And
so he's looking it's a masterful

1371
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:14,279
scholarly work, but also
integrated with his own personal

1372
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:16,679
experiences and other
psychedelic voyagers

1373
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:21,079
experiences, exploring the
phenomenon of death from that

1374
01:41:21,079 --> 01:41:27,439
perspective. So it's just, it's
the straight on implications of

1375
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:31,759
psychedelic work for the
experience of dying. And then I

1376
01:41:31,759 --> 01:41:40,239
just mentioned one last piece.
Oh, this is dark night, early

1377
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:44,019
dawn. All of my work basically
situated within Stan Grof

1378
01:41:44,019 --> 01:41:52,959
tradition. This is my first book
on psychedelic work, and so I

1379
01:41:52,959 --> 01:41:57,279
incorporate, I think if you're
going to do philosophy in this

1380
01:41:57,339 --> 01:42:01,079
genre, you have to reveal the
experiences that are the

1381
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:05,039
foundation of your thinking. All
philosophical reflection assumes

1382
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:08,459
a shared experience. If I give
an indication, a counter example

1383
01:42:08,879 --> 01:42:11,639
in an argument, I'm assuming
that we have a certain body of

1384
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:14,639
experience, and so if I give an
example, you'll understand what

1385
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:19,379
I'm talking about. But most
people don't have advanced

1386
01:42:19,379 --> 01:42:22,159
psychedelic experience. So if
you're going to present a

1387
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:26,299
philosophical argument based
upon experience, you have to be

1388
01:42:26,299 --> 01:42:29,479
willing to put your experiences
on the table and say, these are

1389
01:42:29,479 --> 01:42:32,119
not perfect. These are
incomplete. Tell me where I went

1390
01:42:32,119 --> 01:42:34,939
wrong, but these are the
experiences that I'm using to

1391
01:42:34,939 --> 01:42:39,019
draw these conclusions. And so I
integrate my own psychedelic

1392
01:42:39,019 --> 01:42:42,759
experiences in this book, I put
them on the table, and I

1393
01:42:42,759 --> 01:42:47,019
integrate it in a discussion
with other people's exploration

1394
01:42:47,019 --> 01:42:50,739
and using different
methodologies, this way of doing

1395
01:42:50,739 --> 01:42:55,359
philosophy is a new way of doing
philosophy. Here we temporarily

1396
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,259
lose contact with the physical
world. We go into a non ordinary

1397
01:42:59,259 --> 01:43:02,819
state. We have a set of
experiences. We come back and

1398
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:10,499
write them down, and then we
analyze them. I've spent now 14

1399
01:43:10,499 --> 01:43:14,879
years analyzing 20 years worth
of psychedelic experience, and

1400
01:43:14,879 --> 01:43:17,879
it's only now that I'm really
beginning to write the whole

1401
01:43:17,879 --> 01:43:22,459
story. It's not enough to have
an exotic experience. You have

1402
01:43:22,459 --> 01:43:25,339
to understand it. You have to
think about it. You have to plug

1403
01:43:25,339 --> 01:43:28,879
it into the literature. You have
to think about the you have to

1404
01:43:28,879 --> 01:43:32,359
plug it into an intellectual
landscape in order to extract

1405
01:43:32,359 --> 01:43:36,559
its philosophical value along
the way. I'll just, I'll end

1406
01:43:36,559 --> 01:43:42,339
with just one experience, small
experience, just along I was

1407
01:43:42,339 --> 01:43:42,879
being

1408
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:49,900
taken out into what I call deep
time, out in a deep time, into

1409
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:56,799
the opportunity to see where
humanity is being taken into,

1410
01:43:57,339 --> 01:44:01,319
into the future, human time into
that world. So we're on a on a

1411
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:05,639
scale of hundreds of 1000s of
years, and I was going all of a

1412
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:09,119
sudden, everything expanded real
quickly. All of a sudden is just

1413
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:14,159
going pop, everything pop. And I
said, what happened? And the

1414
01:44:14,579 --> 01:44:17,039
Intel, the voice I was, the
intelligence I was with, said,

1415
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:22,039
Oh, we just, we passed your
death. It's like I was going

1416
01:44:22,039 --> 01:44:25,819
forward in time, and I passed
when I would die. And when you

1417
01:44:25,819 --> 01:44:29,059
pass your death, you don't have
the glue that holds you in a

1418
01:44:29,059 --> 01:44:33,919
particular configuration. You
just expand in that larger

1419
01:44:33,919 --> 01:44:40,159
domain. I've gone in and out of
that space so many times that

1420
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:43,119
it's kind of become more
comfortable there, and that's

1421
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:46,479
why I love the near death
episode research. The difference

1422
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:48,699
with the near death episode
research and this type of

1423
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:53,739
research is this, when most near
death episode people only have

1424
01:44:53,919 --> 01:44:57,459
one shot at that reality. A few
of them have had two or three

1425
01:44:57,459 --> 01:45:01,679
near death episodes, but mostly
you get one shot. Up, you get an

1426
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:07,439
intense experience, but you
don't always see the full

1427
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:11,099
landscape, because you get a
quick it's like seeing a

1428
01:45:11,099 --> 01:45:15,419
landscape in Arizona at night
and you got a flash of lightning

1429
01:45:15,419 --> 01:45:18,119
that shows you the landscape.
And you see it all, but you

1430
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:24,859
don't see it all. But if you
could go back 4050 times, then

1431
01:45:24,859 --> 01:45:28,939
you have a much deeper
perception of that reality.

1432
01:45:28,939 --> 01:45:32,839
Also, because you go through
many death and rebirth, you go

1433
01:45:32,839 --> 01:45:37,099
deeper and deeper into reality,
deeper into the cosmic itself,

1434
01:45:37,639 --> 01:45:43,179
and you get a more complete
portrait of what's real. It's

1435
01:45:43,179 --> 01:45:46,839
not about psychedelics. It's
about the nature of mind. It's

1436
01:45:46,839 --> 01:45:51,219
about exploring the nature of
the mind of the universe. And

1437
01:45:51,579 --> 01:45:54,459
along the way, along with all
the other work, we're looking at

1438
01:45:54,879 --> 01:46:00,779
death. What is death? Death is
your best friend. Death is you

1439
01:46:00,779 --> 01:46:04,919
know, absolutely nothing to be
afraid of. I can't tell you how

1440
01:46:04,919 --> 01:46:10,319
much I look forward to not
that's the last thing I want to

1441
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:15,059
be I want to avoid. So I have a
I have an agreement with Jesus,

1442
01:46:16,499 --> 01:46:20,339
don't you come for me. I'm gone.
I'm not fighting this. This is,

1443
01:46:20,339 --> 01:46:24,679
you know, don't come for me
until you're ready for us to

1444
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:30,979
wrap this thing up. Thanks very
much. So, Chris, I know that
